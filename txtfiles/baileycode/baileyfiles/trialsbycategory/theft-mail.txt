but never knew him employed in the Post-office—I met him in Charlotte-street Bloomsbury on the 25th of October—he came to me with an order purporting to be signed Woolley Marshall and Co which I afterwards destroyed—it was an order to deliver to the bearer any letters which might be directed to them—I delivered him one charged 8d the portage of Which I duly received from Woolley and Marshall—I saw him again on the 2nd of November and a like transaction took place—on the 9th of November he the again in Charlotte-street and asked if there Were any letters directed to Woolley and

Marshall s and I did not get the money for the letter—they said they had never received such a letter in consequence of which I made a communication to the post-office—I never saw the prisoner again till the 12th of April when he was in custody—when I delivered him the letter I told him I was obliged to be very careful who I delivered letters to as there had been a person going about with forged orders from different firms and obtaining letters from different carriers he said he hoped the person would soon be taken and brought to justice—I was discharged for delivering him this letter

written on them when brought WILLIAM BOCKENHAM I am employed in the Inland-office The prisoner was formerly a letter-carrier in the office and left about two years ago—I frequently saw him write and am acquainted with his hand-writing—to the best of my belief the name of Charles Watkins on these notes is in his hand-writing Prisoner Q How many times have you seen me write A I should say some hundreds and when I paid your wages—it was chiefly his signature but I have seen him write on many occasions—Thomas William Earl of Litchfield is the Post-master-general EDWARD TURNER I am the prisoner s brother-in-law and am a brick-layer On the 9th of November I was at work at the Grand Hotel opposite the entrance of the Birmingham Railway Euston-square—the prisoner came to me at the Drummond Arms Drummond-street when I was at dinner—he pressed me very hard to take a trip with him to Tring by the railway—seeing him with sovereigns and knowing he was in bad circumstances before he told me he was transacting smuggling business for a person —I declined going saying half a day s work was more to my family than a trip—I saw him with a bag of sovereigns—he offered to pay my half-day s work—I am not positive whether this was the 9th or not—it was on or about Lord Mayor s-day and I believe on a Friday—on the Sunday following he called at my house and said he had come to bid me good-bye that he was going over to New Brazil and that he had a situation under Government as Superintendent of the Police—I did not see him again till he was in custody Prisoner Q Are you confident it was all sovereigns I had in the bag A No but according to the bulk of the bag I should think there were from thirty to forty sovereigns if it was all gold—I did not see inside the bag—I judge by the chink of the money but I saw gold in it MARY PENNELL I am the wife of Simeon Pennell of Union-street Middlesex Hospital—the prisoner came to lodge at our house on the 8th of September at 4s 6d a week—their rent was four weeks in arrear—I asked his wife for it about the 8th of November—I had asked for it once or twice—and on the 10th of November his wife paid me 18s and they left—I saw no more of them—when I asked for it about two days before it was paid he told me he was going to the Bank NICHOLAS PEARSB I am a policeman In November last I received instruction to apprehend the prisoner—I endeavoured to do so but did not succeed till Friday the 12th of April when I went with Shaw to No 8 Richmond-place Lisson-grove to the first-floor back-room—I found the door locked—I knocked and called but nobody answered—I then called Mrs Turner knowing she occupied that room—the door was unlocked at last—I saw the prisoner and asked his name—he said it was Turner and he was the son of Mrs Turner—Shaw—then entered the room and called him Cummins—he said My name is Turner —he was taken into custody—he said he had been to Bristol and came up last Saturday Prisoner Q Could the door be shut close without locking A To the best of my belief it could—I did not observe whether there was a hasp to it FRANCIS PURDEN I live at No 30 Princes-street Soho In November last no person named Charles

Litchfield her Majesty s Postmaster General —Other COUNTS charging him with embezzling and secreting the same WILLIAM ABBOTT I am a letter-carrier in the Two-penny Post-office Charing Cross branch-office the prisoner was also a letter-carrier in the same office On the evening of the 22nd of April I was employed in sorting letters at the office and so was he—he is a sorter when he is in the office—he sorts for the South Western division—he was sorting there that evening and I observed when he came to one letter he took particular notice of it—he felt it and did not place it in the box before him— there were seven boxes before him for the different divisions —instead of placing it in one of them he placed it underneath the other letters—he then sorted into the different boxes till he got to that letter again and then he took up other letters and placed on the top of it a second time—when he had sorted them into the different walks he took this letter to his own desk—I had suspicion that the letter did not belong to his walk and I informed Mr Gapes the Inspector—he went to him in a short time when he was about to leave the office and asked him for his bag and letters—he took his bag and letters and out of his bag Mr Gapes took two letters and an account-book—one letter was much less than the other—I should know the letters which were taken out of the bag—I should not be able to recognize the letter he took to his own desk—not by the direction—I noticed the two letters that were taken out of the bag and read the address of one—it was Mr Seymour gold-beater Long Acre — looking at a letter —this is it and I believe it to be the letter which he put behind the others—MR Gapes only took two letters out of the bag—there were no more in the bag Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How near were you to him when he was sorting A If we had stood upright I might have been a yard from him—I was not a yard from him—I was leaning over the desk opposite his desk—I had no occupation then—I was merely a looker-on—I was near enough to have read the addresses if they had been held up to me not without—the backs of the letters were generally towards me—he might sort sixty letters altogether or it might be one hundred—we have never been intimate nor unfriendly—we have not been at all cool to one another—the desks in the Post-office are open—there were two or three persons sorting at them—I do not believe there were four but I could not swear it—the letter-carriers generally keep their bags in the box I believe—they may be put in the desk at times—I have never seen them in the desk when the letters have been there—when they come in sometimes and all the letters are emptied out of the bag they may put the bag in the desk—I have not seen it done—I have seen a bag in a desk but never when they were sorting MR ADOLPHUS Q He was sorting at a desk and you at the opposite side A Yes I could not read a direction upside down very well THOMAS GAPES I am Inspector of the letter-carriers at the Branch-office Charing Cross On the evening of the 22nd of April Abbott gave me information and I examined the prisoner s bag—I found there two letters and a small memorandum-book in which they keep their accounts—I asked him how they came there—he at first said he did not know and then that somebody must have put them there—I said he had placed him-self in an awkward situation and sent for an officer—he had been employed that evening in sorting paid letters—this is one of the letters I found in his bag—it is directed to Mr Seymour gold-beater No 38 Long Acre London—this is a paid letter—the prisoner is a letter-carrier as well as a sorter—that letter was not in his walk—he had no right with that letter in his possession at that time—it bears three stamps—one Reading the paid stamp of the General Post-office in St Martin s-le-Grand and the date stamp of the Two-penny Post-office St Martin s-le-Grand 8 night April 22—that would not be in the office as a dead letter—it was sealed when I found it—the prisoner at that time had a bundle of letters prepared for delivery—it was not among them—they were not in the bag Cross-examined Q Where were the letters he had for delivery A They were lying in his desk—he said he must have taken them up in mistake as dead letters—there are occasionally mistakes made by sorters—the prisoner has frequently returned dead letters to me—he was at his own desk when I went to him—the seals of both letters were unbroken MR SHEPHERD Q What is a dead letter A A letter which has been taken to the address and they are not able to deliver it and return it as a dead letter—the dead letters he has returned to me were on his own walk JAMES EDWARD SEYMOUR I am a gold-beater and live at No 38 Long Acre in partnership with my father This letter was not brought to me by any body from the Post-office—I saw it at Bow-street and opened it—it contained one sovereign a half-sovereign and a four-penny piece—it

Leicestershire On the 3rd of August I had occasion to remit some money to Messrs Smith Payne and Smith of London—I wrapped it up in a letter which my son wrote—I put into the letter a 10l and a 5l country notes three sovereigns and a shilling I sealed the letter took it to the post-office myself at Market Bosworth and paid 4d with it ELIZABETH MAIDES I am the wife of the postmaster at Market Bosworth—I transact the business when he is out—we forward the London letters to Hinkley This is the letter bill which went with the letters on the 3rd of August to Hinkley—the numbers of the letters are entered in the bill—I recollect Mr Niffin posting a letter that day and paying 4d for it—I forwarded that letter with others to Hinkley ANN HOLLIER My father is the postmaster at Hinkley—I assist him in the business The Market Bosworth mail comes to our house—on the 3rd of August it came all safe tied up in its proper order—I opened the bag took out the letters and stamped them—they corresponded with the number in the bill—I remember one directed to Messrs Smith Payne and Smith which attracted my attention because it was wrapped in the letter bill itself and had hard cash in it—it was put in the bag and forwarded to London by myself—I generally do it ALFRED ROOTS HUBBARD I am a clerk in the General Post-office London On the morning of the 4th of August I remember the Hinkley mail arriving in town in the usual state—I opened the bag I broke the seal the letters corresponded with the bill which came in it Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q What time did you open the bag A Soon after six o clock about six o clock—I have a particular recollection of what passed that morning—I do not know the number of letters which were in the Hinkley bag—the number was not set down in the bill—the amount of the paid letters corresponded with the amount in the bill COURT Q Your attention was drawn to it by the prisoner being taken up A Yes UNIACK RONAYNE I am a clerk in the Inland department in the General Post-office London the prisoner was a clerk in the same office On the morning of the 4th of August I and the prisoner were in the same office separating the town and country and foreign letters which had arrived that morning—about five minutes after six o clock I saw the prisoner take a small letter in his hand—I happened to look towards him whether he saw me I cannot tell but he threw it under the foreign box which is raised about six inches above the table—there was only one row of letters before him then—one of the men then laid two more rows before him and then he pushed those letters towards the foreign box which concealed the small letter from my view—he threw a larger one over the small one—he pushed the three rows of letters towards the two letters I have mentioned having put the large letter over the small one—there is five or six inches between the box and the surface of the table—about twenty minutes after seven o clock I saw him put his hand under the foreign box by the side of the three rows of letters and after fumbling about he withdrew his hand closed and appeared to convey something into his pocket—he left the table directly left that part of the office and went into another part of his division—I then removed the three rows of letters which I have mentioned and found the large letter but the small letter was gone—I reported it to Mr Holgate the President of the Inland Office—this is the letter to the best of my opinion— looking at it —I did not see the address but it was a letter of this size Cross-examined Q How long have you been in the Post-office A Very nearly four years—the prisoner was next above me in the office—he was not placed over me he was appointed before me—he had been in the office about a month longer than me—I do not know that it is the practice in the office to give rewards to persons who make discoveries of letters but there is an order in the inland books saying that a gentleman in the Twopenny Post-office had discovered a person embezzling five letters and he received a reward of 30l —I am not aware of any rewards being paid—I think it was a letter-sorter who received that reward—I have met the prisoner s brother and father—I have heard that his father is an old officer in the army—he has lost a leg FRANCIS NIFFIN re-examined This is the letter I enclosed the money in WILLIAM HOLGATE I am one of the presidents of the Inland Post-office London I was on duty on the morning of the 4th of August—the prisoner was on duty—Mr Ronayne made a communication to me that morning in consequence of which I looked for the prisoner—he was not in the office at that time—I went down stairs to the water-closet and called him up to do his duty—he answered he would come up immediately—I returned into the office and he followed in about two minutes and Mr Wynne my colleague to whom I bad made a communication took him into a private room and had him examined COURT Q Did you observe whether there was any impediment in his speech when he answered you at if there was any thing in hit mouth A No I did not GEORGE HUXHAM WYNNE I am vice-president in the Inland-office On the 4th of August I received a communication from Mr Holgate and saw the prisoner on his return from the water-closet about three minutes after Mr Holgate had spoken to me—I saw him coming from the water-closet—I asked him where he had been—he said To the water-closet —I could tell by his speech that he had nothing in his mouth at that time—I then asked why he left his duty and said Just come With me —I took him into an inner private room which I went to through the Inland-office and across a passage about six feet long—the passage is darkish—when we got to the private room I beckoned to the officer Tyrrell to retire but he did not observe me and I went into the room—the prisoner followed me in—he had walked by my side in the passage—I then asked him under what pretence he had left his duty and observing him chewing some paper in his mouth I said What have you in your mouth take it out —he made no reply—Tyrrell came up—I told him to take it out of hit mouth which he did and it was the letter which has been produced addressed to Smith Payne and Smith—it was in the state it is in now the seal broken and without any contents—here is the mark of teeth on it—I asked him how he came by it—he said he did not know—I asked him again and said You know perfectly well you should not have had this letter —he made no answer—the letter should have gone out for delivery about nine o clock Cross-examined Q Do you know whether it is the practice for clerks to make use of the envelopes of letters which have been used at the office A No they do not get into their hands—they are never scattered about unless they are letters addressed to clerks—I have seen letters returned from the public offices for allowance and the allowance having been made on them the covers are thrown aside—the prisoner gave me no account of the letter at the time—he afterwards in answer to a question from the officer said it came to him with other letters as waste paper and he took it down stairs ROBERT TYRRELL I am a constable at the post-office I was present when Mr Wynne came in with the prisoner—I have heard his statement—it is correct—I searched the prisoner in the private room—I forced my finger into his mouth and pulled out this letter doubled up in this form wet and chewed—I asked where he got it from—he made no reply—I searched him and found three sovereigns one shilling and one penny all in his waistcoat-pocket—I searched the other waistcoat-pocket and found a counterfeit sixpence and two halfpence—in a minute or two the prisoner said he had got the letter from other letters which were put before him loose letters that came to him and having occasion to go to the watercloset he took this with him and hearing a knock from the outside from Mr Holgate to attend while on the seat he read the address on the letter and felt alarmed and put it into his mouth Cross-examined Q Did not he tell you that the letter was open when he took it down A Oh yes RICHARD CRADDOCK I am a messenger and constable at the Post-office I was present at the examination of the prisoner before the Magistrate at Bow-street—before the examination I assisted in searching him in the private room at the office at Bow-street—when I had gone through the whole of the things he said Are you perfectly satisfied there is nothing now —I said Yes —he said But I am d—d if you know whether I have got it now but I wish to God I had —I had told him I was ordered to search him as they were not satisfied that he had not got the notes and after I had finished searching his clothes he made that observation MARK BEACHAM PEACOCK I am solicitor to the Post-office Thomas William Earl of Lichfield is the Postmaster-General Cross-examined Q Has the amount contained in the letter been paid to Niffin by Lord Lichfield A Certainly not—I cannot remember whether Lord Lichfield was in town on that very day or not—the letter would receive the inland stamp in the inland-office—the letter bears the Post-office stamp of the 3rd of August MR NIFFIN re-examined I did not take the number or date of the notes COURT to UNIAC RONAYNE Q Would the letters you were then sorting receive the stamp in that office before they went out A Yes but after they left the table where we had been dividing them—this has not received that stamp—it should receive the inland paid-stamp at the next table ANN HOLLIER re-examined

in it—this is the note— produced —this was in the letter—it has two names on it by which I know it besides the date and number which I took at the time—on the 23rd in consequence of hearing from my wife I went to the Post-office and gave information HUGH JONES I am porter to Mr Meyer of Conduit-street—I remember receiving three letters from him on Tuesday the 21st of September one of which was addressed to Mrs Meyer at Herne Bay—I remember that letter perfectly well—I took them to the Post-office receiving-house in Maddox-street kept by Mr Dawes a grocer and gave them to King his assistant who weighed the letters and took 4d postage Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q You did not observe what he did with it A I did not JAMES KING I am in the employ of Mr Dawes On the 21st of September I remember receiving three letters from Jones—one was directed to Mrs Meyer—I received the postage of that letter—I put it into the paid letter-box—the prisoner was in Mr Dawes s employ at that time—he had the opportunity of observing the letters—he was in the shop that day—no one but him and I had access to the letter-box—I did not see the letter after I put it into the box—on the 22nd I had occasion to send the prisoner into the City between two and three o clock—he returned between five and six Cross-examined Q He was an ordinary porter in the grocer s shop A Yes—the paid letters were kept in a drawer under the counter which was kept unlocked—the letters would be sent away from our house about a quarter before six o clock—I was in the shop all the time from the time I received the letters from Jones till the bag was made up and the prisoner was with me COURT Q What time was the letter put in A About half-past four o clock—the prisoner assisted me to make up the bag—I took the letters out of the box paid and unpaid and put them into separate bags—the prisoner assisted me in separating them—it was part of his duty occasionally to assist in sorting and separating letters LOUISA MEYER On the 22nd of September I was staying at Mr Piercey s at Herne Bay—I did not receive a letter from my husband about that day containing a 5l note nor a piece of cambric—I had sent the piece of cambric now produced to my husband as a pattern before the 22nd of September Cross-examined Q Which is the pattern A This—there is a bole by which I know it—I had been working on the cambric some time before—I speak to it as well from my recollection—this is the remains of a larger piece I had been working on—I had done no work on this piece myself—I think I can positively swear this is the same piece—I have not a doubt on the subject—it is a piece of the cambric on which I had worked MR MEYER re-examined I put into the letter the remnant of cambric I received from my wife—in the centre was the 5l note and half a yard of cambric besides which I had bought from the pattern about half an hour before I put it in the letter—both these pieces resemble what I put into the letter—it was Irish cambric—I had sent down a piece before which was not the width and I had this slip as a pattern for the width which drew my attention to it Cross-examined Q How did you get the pattern A Mrs Meyer sent it to me in a letter I think—I had it four or five days but I frequently went down to Herne Bay and do not remember whether I had it by letter MRS MEYER re-examined I gave it to Mr Meyer—I do not think I sent it MR MEYER re-examined I sent down another piece not quite correct after I had the pattern—I bought the piece myself in Regent-street and I bought the first piece at the same shop at the corner of Conduit-street—I did not take the pattern with me the first time—I left it in a drawer at my own house for some days among some papers—there was nothing else like cambric there ALEXANDER ROBERTSON I am one of the pay clerks in the Bank of England I remember this 5l note being presented for payment on the 22nd of September—I have the book in which I made the entry—my attention was called to the circumstance by a particular writing on it—I entered it—I am quite sure this is the note—I have every reason to believe that the person who presented it wrote this on the top of the face Thomas Smith 307 Oxford-street —we always require a person presenting a note to write his name and place of residence—I gave four sovereigns and 1l in silver for it—my attention was drawn to it by an application being made two or three days after MATTHEW PEAK I am a policeman I was sent for to the solicitors office at the General Post-office on Saturday the 25th of September—Mr Peacock myself the prisoner Mr Phillips the clerk and Mr Elb another clerk I believe were there—the first thing said to the prisoner was that a letter had been posted at his master s house containing a 5l note and a piece of cambric since that the note had been changed at the Bank of England and the writing on it much resembled his handwriting and from this circumstance his person and lodging must be searched—he made no objective—I asked him where he lived—he said No 7 Tyler-street Regent-street —I asked him if he had got any money at home—he said Yes he believed his wife had got three or four sovereigns—I asked him where she got it—he said she saved it from her last situation—I then went to No 7 Tyler-street and asked if Mr Poor lived there—I found a woman answering swering to the name of Mrs Poor—she took me up to the second-floor—I asked her if she had got any money—I found four sovereigns in a box—I afterwards told the prisoner what she had said—I stated to him all that passed about the money—I asked her where she got it—she said her husband brought it home last Wednesday—I then made further search and in a drawer I found the two pieces of cambric produced—they have been in my possession ever since till I produced them to-day—I returned to the Post-office saw the prisoner and told him the account his wife had given—he did not say a word to it—the cambric and the note were shown him—I told him I found the cambric in the drawer of that house and that his wife said she had never seen it there before and that her husband must have put it there unknown to her—he made no answer Cross-examined Q Did any body desire you to put these questions to a man under a charge of felony A put no questions—I believe I and Mr Peacock both asked him if he had any money at home—it was not by any body s desire—the 25th was Saturday and Wednesday was the 22nd PRISCILLA ANN MORGAN I live with Mrs Johnson the landlady of the house No 7 Tyler-street I saw the room the officer examined—it was the prisoner s room CHARLES DAWKS I keep a receiving-house for letters—the prisoner was in my service—it was part of his duty at certain times of the day when the letters were heavy to assist in getting them out of the box—he has done so repeatedly—I have seen him write—I believe the name Thos Smith 307 Oxford-street on the face of this note to be his hand writing—I cannot swear to it Cross-examined Q How long has he been with yon A Nearly seven years four of which he lived in my house—it was King s duty more immediately to attend to the letters—towards four or five o clock when the letters got heavy the prisoner assisted King—when I was present I did not require it—I had the highest opinion of the prisoner until this charge was made—I had a good character with him when be came to me GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Twelve Years 
t18411129-75  75 WILLIAM HENRY MENCE was indicted for that he being employed under the postoffice of Great Britain and Ireland did on the 28th of October at St Anne and Agnes feloniously steal a certain postletter containing 1 penny the property of her Majesty s Postmaster-General —Four other COUNTS varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS ADOLPHUS and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution ELIZABETH MORGAN I live in Drury lane On the 27th of October last 1 wrote this letter now produced and wrote this address on it Mr H Day Solicitor Queen-square Bristol or elsewhere —I gave the letter to Susan Wise my servant between eight and nine in the evening to post—I also gave her a penny piece to pay the postage with and another halfpenny to buy some wafers with and told her to wafer the letter and pay the postage—I did not write the letter for myself but for a friend Mrs Cousty SUSAN WISE I am in Mrs Morgan s service I remember her giving me this letter to take to the postoffice about eight or nine o clock and 1d to pay the postage—I went to the postoffice in Drury-lane and found the shop shut—I dropped the penny into the letter and fastened it in with a pin as it is now and put it into the letter-box EDWARD WEST I live with Mr Maynard a pinmaker in Drury-lane he also keeps a postoffice If a letter was posted at our shop on the 27th of October it would be sent from there to the general postoffice by eight o clock next morning—I have the letter-bill of the 27th of October in which the posting of that day is entered—I wrote it myself Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you forward the letters to the general postoffice next morning A Yes—I do not remember the letter in question—I believe it is the custom at some receiving-houses to mark letters which are put into the post upon which no postage is paid—my master never does—if no money is paid no mark is put on—I did not notice a pin in any letter—that letter would be included in this bill among the eleven unpaid letters—there were eleven unpaid letters—I remember that MR BODKIN Q When you prepare letters in the morning to go to the postoffice what do you do with them A I tie them up in the letter-bill with a piece of string and leave them on the counter for the person who calls for them THOMAS SPIKEN I am a letter-carrier in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane On the 28th of October last I called at the receiving-house for the letters at eight o clock in the morning—they are generally left on the counter in the shop—I do not remember whether they laid on the counter that morning or whether I received them from the hand of anybody—whatever I received that morning I took safely to the postoffice and in the same state JAMES ATTERBURY I am a clerk in the Twopenny postoffice at St Martin s-le-Grand On the morning of the 28th of October I received the letters from the Drury-lane receiving-house—I checked them with the bill which accompanied them and saw that they corresponded in number the paid and unpaid—I then sorted them and the porters cleared them away—according to the course of business the letters would then go through a tunnel to the Inland-office JOHN FORBES I am a messenger in the General postoffice the prisoner was also a messenger there On the morning of the 28th of October we were both on duty in the Inland-office—it was part of our duty to stamp and prepare the letters from the receiving-houses—I was taking letters away from behind the stampers for the purpose of being sorted—the prisoner was stamping the date stamp—about the close of the stamping I perceived a few letters lying beside the prisoner on the table he was stamping at—I observed that one of them contained some coin or something very heavy and very singular there was a pin at the back of it—I took the letters up in my hand—the prisoner stopped me and said Stop they are not obliterated that is the Queen s head was not destroyed—there was no Queen s head on the letter with the pin in it—I laid them down again and in consequence of the prisoner s manner I kept my eye fixed on him—I saw him take up this letter along with the others—he went over to another table for the purpose of obliterating them as I thought—it was not his duty to do so that morning—he came back with the same letters in his hand and went behind a table where there is a writing-slope—I there saw him shuffling them in his hand for a little bit—he then came round and put them down on another table along with some others that were done—thinking there was something wrong I looked over the letters—they were all spread out with their faces towards me—there was about 150 or 200—I ran them over with my hand and looked at the backs and could not find the letter with the pin to it—it was not there—I then took the whole of the letters down to the sorters which was a little way down the office—the prisoner was standing talking to one of the other messengers at the time about five or six yards off but not out of my sight—I came towards him again and he said to me he thought it was time to go into the railway department which is at the further end of the Inland-office—it is not exactly the same room it is a place parted off at the further end and there is a communication by arches without opening a door—he and I walked down together into the railway department—he went to tie letters at the Stafford branch and I at the Weedon close by his side—Mr Hodd one of the clerks came round to see the men do their duty—in consequence of my suspicion I stepped on one side and spoke to Mr Hodd—we had some conversation and I went to the Weedon branch again—the prisoner left the room very shortly—I followed him as far as the President s desk—I there met Mr Hodd—he called the prisoner back and said the President wanted to speak to him—I saw the President Mr Hodd and the prisoner go into a private room—I did not lose sight of the prisoner from the moment when the letter with the pin in it was taken off the table till he went into the president s room—he did not in that time pick up any letter from the floor or any other part of the office if he had I must have seen him—this is the letter I saw EDWARD HODD I am a clerk in the General Postoffice—I was on duty in the Inland Office on the 28th of October About nine o clock in the morning Forbes made a communication to me in consequence of which I went and spoke to Mr Holgate the president of that department who came out of the office—the prisoner was not in my sight at the time I spoke to the president but he was immediately after—I kept my eye on him till Tyrrell the officer came—in that interval he did not stoop to pick up any letter or any thing of that kind—I called him and said Mence the President wishes to speak to you —he made no answer—he appeared to be going from me—I called him back again and told him not to leave for Mr Holgate would be back immediately—he waited then—Mr Holgate came in in a minute and a-half or two minutes and he and the prisoner then went into the president s room—Mr Holgate said to him From information I have received I strongly suspect you have a letter which does not belong to you or words to that effect—the prisoner made no answer to that that I heard—I was shutting the door at the time and he might have said something without my hearing it—Tyrrell was in the room at the time—as soon as Tyrrell came in or shortly afterwards I observed him seize the prisoner by the wrist and struggle with him—he said Let go Mence —there was a considerable struggle between them for a minute or so—I saw he was getting the advantage of the officer and assisted—I got hold of his other hand and in the struggle Tyrrell took the letter from him containing one penny-piece—the letter bears the Inland Office stamp of that morning s date which denotes it had been stamped that morning—Tyrrell afterwards said to him that he had no occasion to answer any question unless he thought proper as it would perhaps be eventually brought against him and then asked him where he got the letter from—he waited some little time and then said he picked it up just before Mr Hodd called him—he had a blouze on that morning with pockets outside ROBERT TYRRELL I am a constable of the Postoffice—I assisted in apprehending the prisoner—the account given by Mr Hodd is correct—I took the letter from the prisoner s hand after great difficulty—we all fell on the ground together—I still kept hold of his wrist and called out Mence leave go —while on the ground I succeeded in wrenching his fingers open and from his hand I took this letter—after I took him into custody he got away for a short time and ran for a few minutes but I got him again Richard Battersby oil and colour-man Whitechapel-road Richard Jarvis

the Prosecution ANN RAINS I am the wife of John Rains of Truro in Cornwall On the 22nd of December by direction of my husband I inclosed a sovereign in a paper which I put into a letter—I put it in a piece of paper put the paper into the letter and sewed it round to the inner leaf of the sheet with a needle and thread—I took it to the post-office kept by Miss Thomas—I delivered it there—I had sealed it with a red seal and pressed it down with my thimble as I was sewing at the time—I sealed it firmly and well and directed it to Mr Alden No 27 Brewer-street near the Brill Somers-town London —the sovereign was paid by my husband to a benefit society—this is the letter now produced GEORGE REYNOLDS I am an assistant inspector of letter-carriers—the prisoner has been a carrier in the Post-office about a year and a half—in December last Brewer-street Somers-town was his district—he had been removed at the commencement of October from the Crawford-street and Montague-square district On the morning of the 27th of December I was at the Post-office—I saw a letter directed to Mr Alden No 27 Brewerstreet near the Brill Somers-town London —I took a copy of the address and marked the letter with a private mark—I noticed the letter particularly—it contained some kind of coin—it had the Truro post-mark on it—I gave it to Mr Cook another assistant inspector and desired him to put it among the letters for the prisoner—I told him also to take the direction down—he did so—the prisoner was not in the letter-carrier s office at that time—he came up immediately after Mr Cook had put the letter among his other letters—he arranged his letters for delivery and went out in about three-quarters of an hour—I saw him take the letter—this letter now produced is the same and has my private mark on it—the prisoner left the office about ten minutes before nine o clock Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q About how many letters had he to deliver that morning A I have not the means of knowing exactly—perhaps about seventy and some newspapers—I did not look over all his letters that day—there might be other money-letters—it was his duty to sort all the letters he found placed on his seat THOMAS BURGESS COOK I am an assistant inspector of letter-carriers On the morning of the 24th of December Mr Reynolds gave me a letter which in consequence of his directions I placed among the prisoner s letters on his seat—I made an entry in a book which I have here of the address and where it came from—I believe this to be the letter—I noticed that the r was left out in the word Somers-town and it appeared to me to contain coin—that coin was safe in it when I put it among his delivery letters—there was no appearance of any breaking of the seal or displacement of the coin—I afterwards made inquiry at Brewer-street to see if the letter had arrived there and in consequence of what I heard there I went to the prisoner s lodging No 6 Berkeley-street Clerkenwell—I saw him there and told him he must go with me to the Office respecting a letter that had been misdirected—he went with me—on the arrival of the officer we were directed to go to Mr Peacock s the solicitor—Mr Peacock asked the prisoner if Brewer-street Somers-town was in his delivery—he said it was—Mr Peacock then asked him if he had any letters that morning for Mr Alden of No 27 in that street—he said he had not that be knew the name in the street but he had no letters for him—Mr Peacock then said that an inquiry had been made for a letter supposed to contain coin and directed to Mr Alden No 27 Brewer-street—the prisoner said he had not seen it if he had it would have been delivered in the usual way—be gave no further account respecting the letter at that time Cross-examined Q Was Peak the officer present at that time A Not till afterwards—I left the room before Peak was called in—after Mr Peacock bad asked the prisoner a few questions Peak was called in ANNE ALDEN I live at No 27 Brewer-street Somers-town On the morning of the 24th of December I saw the prisoner pass my house—he spoke to me and said it was a warm morning—I was cleaning the step of my door—I saw him pass again on his return—he had letters in his hand—he delivered no letter to me—my husband was out RICHARD ALDEN I am the last witness s husband On the morning of the 24th of December I went out about a quarter to six o clock in the morning and returned about half-past eight in the evening—I did not receive any letter that day from Truro—it never came to my hands till I saw it at the Postoffice—I have a person corresponding with me every half-year from there MATTHEW PEAK I am a constable of the Post-office On Friday morning the 24th of December I was called into the solicitor s office the prisoner s was there—I saw Mr Cook going out as I came in—Mr Peacock stated that a money—letter had been addressed to a house in the prisoner s walk and had not been delivered in consequence of that his person and house must be searched—the prisoner said Very well —I took him into another room searched him and found several letters on him and in his breast coat pocket a memorandum-book also a gold sovereign 3s 6d in silver and 3d in copper—the sovereign was in his trowsers pocket—I opened the memorandum-book shook it and a letter tumbled out—I have kept it ever since and produce it—it has my name on it—when the letter fell out I said What letter is this —he said That is the letter which has been inquired about with the sovereign —he was then cautioned that whatever he might say would be used either for or against him and he said no more—the letter was just in the same state as it is now open—here is a hole where it appears something has been sewn round just like a great O—the needle and thread have only gone through the inner leaf of the letter Cross-examined Q Were the words used to him that whatever he said would be used for or against him A Yes Q Will you swear you have not said what you said was you cautioned him not to say any thing unless he thought proper A That is not what I said to him certainly Q Is this true I then cautioned him not to say any thing unless he thought proper A I am sure he did not say that—this is my signature to my deposition—I swear I did not say that I am positive of it—that was not the words I used Q Was it not your impression that he was about stating something more when you cautioned him A He was about stating something I expect—he got up from the chair— The witness s deposition being read toted I then cautioned him not to say any thing unless he thought proper and he said no more —I swear I did not say that—it must have been a mistake which I did not notice when it was read over—I was desired to attend to it but I might overlook that—I heard the prisoner make a statement at the police-court which was taken down—I saw the prisoner sign it The letter produced was addressed Mr Alden 27 Brewer-street Somers-town near the Brill London The statement made by the prisoner at the police-court was here read as follows — The prisoner says When I got up from my chair I was going to make a reply to a gentleman in the room and to make a further statement when I was cautioned by some gentleman it is that the letter in question I had for delivery Previous to my getting to the house by the pressure of the string I found that the seal was broken and a sovereign visible—I took it out put it into my pocket and the letter into that red memorandum-book separate from the others It was my full intention on returning to my duty at half-past five o clock to have taken it to the President whoever was on duty and have stated to him that just before my delivery I discovered the seal broken and the sovereign visible to know what I was to do with it whether I should detain it until my morning delivery or what I should do with it I was so agitated when I went before the gentleman that I hardly knew what I said or I should have immediately taken it out of my pocket and asked the gentleman what I should do with it In coming from my lodging with Mr Cook I asked him if he knew what Mr Kelly wanted with me he said he thought it was respecting a money order I had the day before which was directed to the receiving-house No 1 Pleasant-row Bloomsbury The morning previous he had told me that I might try it at No 1 Pleasant-row Battle-bridge it was opened by Mr Steed at the receiving-house he did not know any thing about it I took it to Mr Playle the inspector on Friday morning he wrote on it Not for Mr Steed and told me to take it to the Bloomsbury man I put my signature to it and I gave it to the Bloomsbury man it was thinking of that when I was before the gentleman that caused me to be so agitated or I should have brought out the other letter to have asked what I was to do with it I saw Mrs Alden as she as has stated as I passed her I said it was a mild morning and I repassed her —R HORTON Richard Greenhill

t18420404-1245  1245 ALEXANDER FRANCIS BAILIE NICHOLSON was indicted for stealing 3 letters containing 3 shillings 1 sixpence and 2 sovereigns the property of Her Majesty s Postmaster-general he the prisoner being employed in the said Post Office —2nd COUNT for embezzlement —3rd COUNT for secreting &c—4th COUNT for stealing the said letters and money sent by the post MR ATTORNEY GENERAL with MESSRS SHEPHERD and ADOLPHUS conducted the Prosecution JOHN FORBES I am a messenger at the General Post-office—the prisoner has been employed there about two years—on the 1st of March he was employed in the inland office collecting letters behind the stamper—his duty was to take the letters from the stampers table to the sorters table—in doing so I perceived him separating two or three letters by themselves and place them behind a row of letters which he had collected—he took the whole parcel up in his arms and conveyed them to the sorters—he took those he had put at the back part of the row with the rest—I followed him to the sorters without his observing me—I observed that he only left about half the row of the letters at the sorters table—he kept the latter part of the row still in his hands which contained those I had observed him put at the back—he carried those letters back with him towards the stampers table and on his way back I perceived him shifting some letters under his waistcoat—he put the others which he had carried back down on the stamping table with some others and conveyed them down to the sorters—after he had done so I perceived him put his hand up under his waistcoat again as he returned to the stamping table—he appeared at if he was adjusting his waistcoat—I communicated the circumstance to Mr Hodd a clerk in the office— examining three letters produced by Matthew Peck —two of these have passed through my hands—I have marked one of these which is directed to Miss Jones—I have written loz on it—this is my hand-writing—it was my duty to weigh the letters—I can speak positively to this—here is another directed to Miss Terry—I recollect seeing this pass through my hands—they all bear the inland stamp of the 1st of March on them and would arrive in due course by the mail that morning Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q He has been two years in the establishment has his conduct been good up to this time A I never heard anything else COURT Q Where were these two or three letters put do you mean at the end of the row or behind it not in the same line A Behind the row at the back of it they formed part of the same row—it was not his duty to separate the money letters from the rest—the whole were not money letters but mixed—money letters are not separated from the others—he did not say why he brought part of the letters back to the stampers—that was what caused my suspicion—he ought to have left the whole—I had noticed the letters—I had put down a number of cash letters before the prisoner with the others—I can very easily distinguish cash letters from the rest by the feel EDWARD HODD I am in the inland office and was on duty on the 1st of March In consequence of what Forbes said to me I caused the prisoner to be searched by Peek the officer in the inspector s room-before he was searched Peek asked if he had got anything about him which he ought not to have—he said he had not—he was asked if he had any objection to be searched and said no—Peek searched his waistcoat pockets then opened his waistcoat and discovered two or three letters inside the waistband of his trowsers—he wore a waistcoat with sleeves and no coat—his waistcoat was tight down—it was left up a short way and the letters thrust into the waistband of the trowsers—I do not recollect what he said on their being discovered—Peek said something to him I do not recollected what—all three letters bore the inland stamp of the morning of the 1st of March and the marks of the country towns they came from—it was the prisoner s duty to carry letters over the proper weight which had not paid sufficient to the sorter COURT Q Then it was his duty to separate from the letters any which were to be paid for above the amount of the stamp A Certianly not—he should carry all the more to pay letters to the sorters—it was his duty to carry the whole whether there was more to pay or not but the packets that are stamped at that table are to be carried to a different place altogether—but these are stamped with the unpaid letters and are taken to the sorters—the others are taken to another sorters table—it was his duty to carry all the letters from the stamper to the sorters those that have the proper stamps to one table and those that have more to pay to another sorter s table—all three of these letters had more to pay—the letters are taken by Forbes to have the stamp More to pay put on them MR ADOLPHUS Q What post-towns do they come from A The one directed to Miss Terry from Hastings one for Miss Jones from Elston in Cornwall and the one forCullen from Hereford—from these stamps it appears that they had all passed through the office in the regular way Cross-examined Q Had you known anything of the prisoner before you made the discovery A I had suspicions of him—I knew nothing of him Q Have you ever observed that his habits were of a morose sullen retired disposition A He was rather so disposed—I observed nothing odd about him MATTHEW PEEK I am a policeman On the 1st of March I was called into Mr Kelly s room at the Post-office—the prisoner was there—I was desired to search him by a gentleman in the office—I asked him if he had got any letters about him—he said No —I then commenced searching him I was not present when he was asked whether he had any objection —in the waistband of his trowsers I found the three letters now produced—I finished my search and then cautioned him whatever he might say would be used in evidence against him—he said nothing at that time but in a minute or so afterwards he said Mr Peek it is a bad job and I am sorry for it —I then repeated my caution and he said no more—Hodd was present when I searched him—this letter directed to Miss Jones had the seal broken when I found it on him—it contained three shillings and a sixpence—I saw the letter to Miss Terry opened—I have kept the letters in my possession ever since—I took the letter addressed to Miss Terry to the Dead-letter-office—it was opened by a gentleman there and contained a sovereign—it appears to come from Mrs Terry at Hastings—it bears the Hastings post-mark of the 28th—I showed the letter addressed to Mr Cullen to Mr Higgins the next day—I saw him open it at the examination before the Magistrate—it contained one sovereign—it appears to come from Mr Lloyd of Hereford and contains an order for some leeches Cross-examined Q Have you observed the conduct of the prisoner at the office A Not particularly—I have not observed any peculiarity about him—I might have passed and repassed him that is all RICHARD CRADDOCK I am a constable of the Post-office On the 1st of March the prisoner was delivered into my charge by Peek—when I was in the room with him I said to him I am sorry to see you here I hope there is nothing wrong —he said yes they had found some letters upon him it was a bad job MR CLARKSON called the following witnesses on the prisoner s behalf ELIZABETH CATHERINE BOWSTEAD I am the prisoner s sister-in-law he has been married to my sister since 1834 or 1835—I was not in London at the time—he has two children—in the latter end of 1836 he conducted himself in a very strange manner by taking poison—he had treated my sister with great unkindness—not striking her or swearing at her but he would leave home for days together—I remember her being obliged to leave him for three days—she went to my father s during which time I was living in the house where me prisoner lived—he never took his clothes off or went to bed during those three days—in 1836 I remember discovering an ounce bottle of poison and two razors in his pocket—it was between seven and eight o clock in the evening—either in September or October—a gentleman named Westcott came in while he was locked up in his bed-room and broke the room door open—I communicated to Mr Westcott what I had seen and he went up—he brought an ounce bottle of laudanum down stairs—it was empty when he brought it down—Mr Westcott fetched his wife back that night—on the night she came back the prisoner slept on the sofa in the front room—we once found a bottle of laudanum in the cellar—I cannot say whether it was before or after this circumstance—my sister and I found it—one evening in the latter end of April or the 1st of May 1887 he attempted to hang himself—be was hung up—I remember the execution of Greenacre—the prisoner did not make that the subject of conversation to my knowledge—this circumstance took place the day previous to the execution of Greenacre but be had made no observation about it—I missed him from the bar for two hours—he then kept the Cock and Crown public-house—my sister at that time was ill in bed—I got Mr Clark and my brother Robert to look for him—I know the room he was found in but I did not see him myself till the following day—my sister was obliged to relinquish the business of the Cock and Crown on account of his strange conduct—about the 9th of May we left the Cock and Crown and went to Jewin-crescent—about July he conducted himself like a madman—he sharpened a couple of razors and went about the house breaking the china and glass—be put the razors in his pocket—I saw him with them myself—there was no cause for his breaking the china and glass—be was always a sober man—after breaking the china and glass he fastened himself in the water-closet—my sister and I sent for two policemen who broke the door open got him out and took out of his pocket two razors which they gave me—some time after he removed to New-street City-road—he was in the habit of carrying razors about the house with him in the day-time—I never saw him out—when we were in New-street in 1837 he took poison—I was living in the house at the time—my sister told me of it—I was not called up—I saw nothing of it myself—after he left New-street he removed to Cannon-street and there he sharpened two razors—he kept us up all night by wandering about the house saying he would destroy himself which he had frequently said before—he wandered up and down the house all night in his cloths—there was no cause for this more than being unfortunate in business—he had been unfortunate at the Cock and Crown—he has not allowed his wife what she wanted for her maintenance since he has been in the Post-office—he has not allowed her any thing—she has lived by letting the house out to lodgers—his general disposition has been very melancholy—he never struck his wife nor swore at her but he kept her without money—he always said he was taking care of his money but my sister did not know in what way—he did no act that I can speak to after leaving New-street not till the night previous to this happening at the Post-office-his conduct was much better but always melancholy—the night before this was discovered he came home about half-past nine—he went into the parlour and sat there by himself for two hours which was very unusual—he had a candle—he came out—I asked him what was the matter—he said Nothing —he then appeared very melancholy as if be was going as he had been before—that was the way his disorder appeared to attack him before—it was that sort of moroseness by lying in bed for two or three days together—he has done that since he has been in the Post-office without having anything the matter with him—he was always sober—he has laid in bed sometimes without any cause at all MR ATTORNEY GENERAL On any of these occasions was he under the care of any medical man A He was not ROBERT BOUSTEAD I am the prisoner s brother-in-law I had occasion to notice his conduct in May 1837—I myself was not present before that when he did any act of extravagance—I have heard how he has behaved from time to time—on the night of the 1st of May 1887 I lodged at the Cock and Crown in Little Britain which was kept by the prisoner—about twelve o clock at night I was informed they could not find him—I went in search of him about the house—my sister his wife was ill in bed—I found him in the tap-room hanging by his neck-handkerchief on a nail—I lifted him in my arms and took him down—he appeared to be quite dead—I laid him on the floor and called Mr Clark a friend of mine—we got some blankets and brandy took him into the kitchen laid him by the fire rubbed him gave him the brandy and in about ten minutes he began to show signs of life—he began to struggle—I got into the tap-room by bursting the door open—there was a sky-light in the tap-room ceiling and it was by means of that sky-light I found him there—when I had got him down I searched his clothes and found in his pocket two razors and a hand-towel—Mr Clark who is a chemist ascertained that he had taken no poison that night—I was not in England when he was married—he has appeared to me at times not to know right from wrong since I have been acquainted with him I have not considered him of sound mind—I have not of my own knowledge known that he was in possession of poison in his pockets—I have heard it—I have heard him threaten to destroy himself and talked to him about it and on one occasion succeeded in dissuading him from it—I have known him lay in bed for days together without any occasion—he was not of drunken habits—in consequence of his extraordinary conduct my sister was taken from him—he never offered to do her any sort of violence WILLIAM WESTCOTT I am a clerk in the Post-office I remember being called on in 1836 to render assistance to the prisoner s family—in consequence of what Bowstead told me I went to the room the prisoner was in—it was the second-floor back room of the Cock and Crown public-house Little Britain—I think it was about September—it was a bed-room—I found the door bolted—in consequence of what was communicated to me I broke it open and found the prisoner lying on the bed with his clothes on—I think there was a slight quantity of laudanum in a bottle but it appeared to me he had taken a quantity of it—there was a cup there—I endeavoured to remonstrate with him but it had no effect—he appeared in a state of stupor as if he had taken a narcotic—at that time his wife had been absent two or three days—in consequence of this she was fetched back to him—I did not stay there all night—I went for his wife by the advice of her sister—I always thought him remarkably morose and extraordinarily obstinate—I have always heard of him as particularly honest up to this time—I have known him about eight years—in nine cases out of ten I have observed his conduct to be sullen and morose but for eight or nine weeks together I have not seen him—I was not intimate there—I thought at times he was in rather a mad state of mind from what I have heard but the only instance I observed was in 1836 MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q What office do you fill in the Post-office A A clerk in the twopenny department—I have been there nearly fourteen years—I suppose the prisoner earned altogether about 30s a-week—at times I thought he was touched with insanity from the acts I have heard he has committed—but all I myself saw was the act of taking poison which was seven years ago in 1836—if I met with a person in the establishment who I thought unfit for duty I should think it right to report him but I did not belong to the same department as the prisoner and seldom met with him—I saw no acts that led me to conclude him mad except seven years ago GUILTY Aged 31 — Transported for Life

at the Brompton post-office and was so on the 11th of May I remember that the King s-road collection came to the office that day—a letter directed to Birmingham coming between four and five o clock would be forwarded to the London Post-office by the five o clock despatch—I was at my business on the 11th of May—the letter-bag was properly despatched at five o clock that day WILLIAM SALISBURY I am a clerk in the Twopenny Post-office St Martin s-le-Grand—I was on duty on the 11th of May and remember the Chelsea mail-bag arriving in the evening in the usual way properly tied up and sealed—I opened the bag and found the letters corresponded with the bill—a letter addressed to Birmingham I should pass with other letters down the tunnel into the General Post-office JOHN FORBES I am a messenger at the General Post-office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier in the employ of the General Post-office—I was on duty in the Inland-office on the 11th of May and saw the prisoner there that evening employed obliterating the postage stamps—I observed him feeling the letters between his thumb and fingers as he went on stamping them—this drew my attention to him—he came to a certain letter and placed it at the further end of the row of letters he was stamping and when he came to it he took it up and placed it along with some others he had stamped he afterwards took them all up in his hand and dropped this one on the table—I saw him take up some unpaid letters and mix this letter along with them—he afterwards went away to another table—I kept my eye on him saw him put down all the unpaid letters and retain this one in his hand—he stepped on one side behind the stamper and put it in his left-hand waistcoat pocket at the same time drawing his snuff-box out and taking a pinch of snuff—he went back to his table and stamped a few more letters—I informed Mr —Blott a clerk what I had seen and saw him leave the office soon after Cross-examinedA Had you known him long A Eight or ten years—he bore a very good character—I had no reason to suspect him before—he was always very lively—this could not be attributed to an act of inadvertence—he took the letter away to another part of the office where they were stamping unpaid letters—I saw him take this one from them and put it into his pocket—I did not lay hold of him because I thought it my duty to inform my superior MR ADOLPHUS Q YOU informed Mr Blott and left it to his discretion A Yes WILLIAM BLOTT I am a clerk in the General Post-office—I was on duty there on the 11th of May—Mr Forbes made a communication to me in consequence of which I followed the prisoner who I saw leaving the office—I came up to him in the yard called him back and said Beard I want to speak to you on particular business —I took him to the superintending president s room and on the road we met Tyrrell who asked him Have you a letter in your pocket —he said No —I directed Tyrrell to ask him no further questions—I took him into Mr Bockenham s the superintending president s room—I then said Beard I have been told you have a letter in your pocket is it so —he said No but almost immediately corrected himself and said Yes I have it was given to me in the street at Hoxton by a greengrocer — Tyrrell had previous to this cautioned him that what he might say would be given in evidence against him —Tyrrell took the letter out of his

him—the prisoner and Mr Blott returned towards me—I accompanied them to the superintending president s office—on my way there I asked the prisoner if he had any letter about him—he said no—he went to he super-intending president s office—Mr Blott then said he was informed he had a letter in his pocket and was it so —the prisoner replied no and almost at the same moment said Yes putting his right hand towards his left-hand waistcoat pocket—I then put my hand into his pocket and took out this letter—I cautioned him as to what be might say and asked where he got the letter from—he said from a greengrocer in Hoxton—I searched him and found nothing more but a few dockets and a snuff-box—I opened the letter on the 16th—it contained a half-crown inclosed in a card—I have kept it ever since The

t18420704-2108  2108 FREDERICK HUNT was indicted for that he being employed under the Post-office of Great Britain and Ireland did on the 21st of June feloniously steal a certain post-letter containing 2 shillings the monies of Her Majesty s Post Master General —3 other COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge MESSES SHEPHERD and DOANE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM HEWITT I am a letter-carrier in the Twopenny Post-office On Tuesday morning 21st of June I was on duty in the letter-carrier s office about half-past eight or twenty minutes before nine o clock—I was engaged in sorting letters and in the course of my sorting the letter now produced came into my hand addressed to Mr Uranus—it was sorted to me by Merritt who said it contained cash—in consequence of what Merritt told me I gave the letter to Gauntlett my assistant and told him it was a cash-letter—the prisoner was sitting by me on my right and Gauntlett was sitting opposite me—the prisoner was sorting on my right hand-side as near as the seats could stand—soon after Gauntlett called me aside and laid I have lost the money-letter —in consequence of that all the letter-carriers of our division were ordered into the inspector s room—there were thirteen or fourteen of them and the prisoner was one—to go into the inspector s room you have to pass through the supernumeraries-room—there is a partition between the supernumeraries -room and the inspector s room and on entering the inspector s room there are two steps—I went up them and when I got on the top step my face was turned towards the supernumeraries room and I observed the prisoner on my right side—he was on the floor below me and close by a table on which there stood a box about seven inches from a partition—I observed the prisoner take this letter from some letters which he had in his left hand—he pushed it along the table and hid it behind the box—I got down from the steps and said There is the letter I saw Hunt put it there —I looked behind the box and found this letter—it is the one I had before given to Gauntlett—the prisoner was too confused to say anything Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Do you mean be said nothing A He was too confused to say anything at the moment—after be came to himself again be said be knew nothing about the letter—he did not answer immediately—a moment or two elapsed—he and I have been on adjoining beats—I do not suppose he has been on that beat more than eight or ten months—I have been but little associated with him—I have asked him to deliver letters for me at Mr Boyle s the corner of Farringdon-street and Holborn it is as much in his delivery as mine—the private-door is in one street and the shop in the other—I deliver in Farringdon-street and he in Holborn—whatever letters are delivered to us it is our duty to deliver—I may have asked him to deliver letters to one or two houses within a door or two Q Have you not given him many letters to deliver while yon have been drinking and smoking A I never smoked in my life—I have not gone into public-houses with him and remained there and asked him to deliver letters for me instead of delivering them myself—he has never declined delivering letters for me—he has declined doing it for my partner Gauntlett but not me—I have heard him decline doing it for Gauntlett two or three times—Gauntlett was on the same beat with me then—the refusal was not as much to me at to Gauntlett—he never refused me—I have not been on bad terms with him in consequence of his refusing me—I sever had any quarrel with him in my life—Gauntlett and I were on good terms—this proved to be a money letter and I said This in a money letter take care of it —the prisoner was not in the office at that time but several other persons were there—I gave the letters to Gauntlett singly as we always do—there were no other money letters that day to my knowledge—I saw Gauntlett put the letter down on the desk where he was sitting by the side of him—Ford and another person were by the side of Gauntlett—I did not remain in the office till all the men went out saw Gauntlett go out and go to the inspector s office—he went before me—he did not take the letter that I swear—I did not see the letter till the prisoner was in the act of putting it behind the box COURT Q At the time you were all summoned to the inspector s room was the letter then misting A It was missing then MR BALLANTINE Q Where was the prisoner at this time A Sitting on the right side of me and Gauntlett was opposite me—Gauntlett never left his seat till we all went to the inspector s room—the prisoner had been there from before nine o clock—be was not there when I gave the letter to Gauntlett—he came a minute or two afterwards—I have never been charged with getting drunk and being incapable of delivering letters MR DOAHE Q How long have you been in the office A Twelve years—I have given the prisoner letters to deliver to houses which adjoin his beat—I did not give him this letter—I gave it to Gauntlett and told him to be careful—Gauntlett came round to me but he did not leave the room till the whole fourteen of us were summoned—Fleet-street is in Gauntlett s beat SAMUEL GAUNTLEET I am a letter-carrier in the Twopenny-post-office I have been employed there nearly eight years On the 21st of June I was on duty at the office—Mr Hewitt was there and the prisoner—I remember Mr Hewitt giving me a letter containing cash addressed to Mr Uranius No # Crane-court Fleet-street —I put it on one side of me—it remained there about twenty minutes—I then left to get some letters from another office—I gave some of them to Hewitt some to another man and the remainder to the prisoner and I believe this letter was in the packet of letters which I gave to the prisoner for when I received it I put it down on the desk with another letter and when I brought the packet of letters from the other office I laid them down on these two letters I then gave two parcels to two other persons and the last parcel I gate to the prisoner—if he had received this letter with the parcel which I gave him he ought to have sorted this into the Farringdon-walk letter boxes—there are six of them and one of them is for the division which I deliver and be ought to have put it into that box—I took the letters out of that box in about a minute after I had given the parcel of letters to the prisoner and this letter was not there but the other letter that I had pot down with this one was—I then asked Mr Hewitt if he had this letter as I had lost it—I went round the division to see if it had made its way into any of the other Farringdon boxes—I could not find it and I made a report to Mr Payne that I had lost it—he ordered all the letter-carriers into the inspector s room—that order was given loud enough for all to hear—they all went but the prisoner he remained behind he did not go immediately—I said to him Come you must come with your letters as well as the rest you know you must come —he then took up his letters and came from the division where he had been sitting towards the inspector s room—he followed me—Hewitt was half a dozen paces before—I went on and passed Hewitt just as he got to the door and I had not been in a second before Hewitt cried out There is Hunt putting a letter behind that box —I turned as soon as I could and saw Hewitt get down the steps and take away a letter from the box—it was handed to Mr Payne the inspector and he handed it to the President—he asked me if that was the letter I bad lost—I told him it was—at the time Mr Hewitt took the letter I saw the prisoner—he appeared very much confused for the moment and after a short pause he said I did not put it there —Hewitt and I have been on the same beat very near four yean—the prisoner s beat joins ours—I do not recollect that he and Hewitt and I have been in company except as letter-carriers—I have requested the prisoner to deliver my letters on one or two occasions when be has been pawing a house which I have got a letter for—I have not heard Hewitt ask him to do so but I have asked him in the presence of Hewitt—I think he has refined to take a letter for me—perhaps he has not had a letter near the house and he has said I can t take it for you this time —I have never heard him refuse Hewitt Cross-examined Q You say you put a lot of letters down A Yes on the two letters—I put them down with the intent of sorting them myself—the prisoner was sitting opposite me—I handed a parcel to him and I suppose this letter was in the parcel—when I missed it I mentioned it—the prisoner might have heard me but I rather think he did not CHARLES MERRITT I am a letter-carrier in the Twopenny Post-office I recollect early in the morning on the 21st of June handing this letter to Hewitt—I told him it was a cash letter—I after that heard the order for all the carriers to attend in the inspector s-office—I went in with the others—I was on the top step and could see the box on the table—I heard Hewitt call out Hunt is putting a letter behind the box —I turned and saw the prisoner standing near there and he was drawing his right hand from the box—he had letters in his left hand—Hewitt took the letter from behind the box—I observed the prisoner s manner—he appeared very ouch agitated—he made some remark but what I did not hear CHAELES COX I am a charge-taker in the Twopenny Post-office I was on duty on the morning of the 21st of June—I went with the carriers into the inspector s-room—I was standing on the top step or the floor and saw Hewitt on the lower step—he said There is Hunt putting a letter behind the box —I saw the prisoner—he was standing about a foot from the table—he was in the act of drawing his hand from the box—Hewitt went from off the step to the box put his hand behind it and drew out the letter—I had seen this letter pass before me from Merritt to Hewitt RODEICK NBALE I am a letter-carrier On the morning of the 21st of June I heard the order for the carriers to go into the inspector s-room—I saw them leave the office to go there—Hewitt and the prisoner were the two last—I saw the prisoner was rather fidgety at his duty and he shifted his letters which I considered was rather unusual—I could look over his shoulder and I saw him take ft letter from the centre of his bundle and place it at the back of it—that was after the others were all gone op to the inspector s room—the prisoner then followed Hewitt and Gauntlett—I did not go I am not in that division ROBERT TYRRELL I am a police-constable attached to the Post-office On the 21st of June the prisoner was given into my custody and Hewitt aid in his presence that he had seen him place this letter behind the box—he denied it—he was then questioned by me and I asked him if he had seen that letter that morning—he said he had no recollection of it—the letter has since been opened by Mr Flood—it contained two shillings—it was then sealed up again CHAELES ALEXANDER FLOOD I live in George-street Greenwich I have letters addressed to me occasionally by the name of Uranius Crane-court Fleet-street—this letter is one of them—I went to the Post-office from information on the 25th of June—this letter was produced to me—I opened it and found it contained two shillings—it is from a person of the name of Clark THOMAS WATKINSOV I keep the post-office at Lower Tooting This letter bears the stamp of my office—it has passed through there— address read — Mr Uranius No 3 Crane-court Fleet-street Immediate SAMUEL GAUNTLETT re-examined Q You say you had placed this letter and another by your desk you then went and fetched some more letters which you put down you then gave some to one and some to another and the last parcel of them you gave to the prisoner to distribute into the different boxes are you sure he had finished the distribution A Yes he had the whole of them—he had no others to distribute and just at he had done distributing them I looked into the boxes—I saw him when he went into the inspector s room—he had his own letters in his hand at that time MR BALLANTINE Q Did you see him distribute the letters or do you merely conclude he did so because it was his duty A I saw him sort them into the different boxes—he would sort his own letters into his own box and then take them out again to arrange for delivery—those were the letters he had in his hand The Rev John Bathurst Deane of Finsbury-circus and Mrs Jemima Wood whose husband is employed in the Post-office gave the prisoner a good character

t18421024-2786  2786 WILLIAM RUSSELL was indicted for stealing on the 11th of October 1 sovereign and 1 half-sovereign the monies of Her Majesty s Postmaster General —2nd COUNT stating it to be the monies of William Blott —3rd COUNT stating it to be the monies of John Playle MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL with MESSRS SHEPHERD and ADOLPHUS conducted the Prosecution JOHN PLAYLE I am an assistant-inspector of letter-carriers at the General Post-office The prisoner has I think been in the Post-office about nine years—his delivery is in Palace-yard Westminster On the 10th of October I enclosed a sovereign and a half-sovereign in a letter—Mr Russell another assistant-inspector was by at the time—I had marked the sovereign and half-sovereign on the 27th of September and Mr Russell at the same time marked them on the other side—we handed them from one to the other to mark them—I left them with Mr Russell on the 10th of October—I had had them in my possession part of the interval—I looked at the sovereign before I enclosed it and saw that it then bad on it the marks I had made—about half-past ten o clock next morning the 11th of October I went to the house of Mr Tucker an upholsterer in Great College-street near Westminster Abbey—the prisoner had an assistant named Dowries and Mr Tucker s house is in Downes delivery—in the regular coarse all the letters would come first into the prisoner s hand and he should distribute to Downes those belonging to his delivery—Mr Russell went with me to Mr Tucker s—the letter should have been delivered there about ten o clock—I saw Mrs Tucker and inquired of her for a letter—she did not produce any letter to me—after going to Mr Tucker s I went to the neighbouring post-office No 2 Mil bank-street—the prisoner had been there to sign his card showing the time he had finished his delivery—the prisoner had taken the card away with him—this is the card—it states that he had finished his delivery at ten minutes before ten and is signed by the prisoner—about two hours after I went to the prisoner s lodging in Gibraltar-row St George s-fields—I went alone—I brought him with me from his lodging to the inspector s room at the Post-office—he was then asked if be remembered seeing a letter directed to Mr Tucker upholsterer No 20 College-street Westminster—he said he had no recollection of having seen such a letter—be was then told that such a letter was known to have been in his possession that morning and it had not been delivered and that it contained money—Tyrrell the officer was present and searched him—he made no objection to being searched—a sovereign a half-crown and other silver were found on him—I examined the sovereign and immediately saw it to be the same which I had enclosed in the letter the previous day—he was asked how he became possessed of the sovereign—he said he had had it some time and had brought it from home with him that morning—this it the sovereign—I have no doubt about it Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q I suppose Downes is also an officer of the Post-office A Yes—he had been the prisoner s assistant for three or four weeks—he was only an occasional assistant in consequence of the regular assistant being ill—the assistants occasionally assist in sorting the letters both in the absence and presence of their principal—I think it was Mr Peacock that told the prisoner it was known that such a letter had been in his possession that morning—it was not explained to him how it was known—the witness Rice is here to explain how it was known—he is a superintendent of the sorters in the Inland office—the prisoner was first asked whether he had any objection to be searched and he said None in the least —I am not aware that he took his money from his pocket himself and put it on the table—he assisted in taking his coat off—I did not see the money produced—for aught I could discover to the contrary the prisoner had discharged his duty in the ordinary course that morning—I made the same inquiries with reference to Downes—I found that he had signed his card at a different house from that at which it was his duty to sign it—it was about half-past twelve o clock when I took the prisoner to the Post-office Q Did you tell him that a person had come to the Post-office about a letter and said it had contained a 5l note A I said something of that sort—I told him a person was making inquiry at the office about a letter out of which a sovereign had fallen in the morning—I think I said the person said it ought to have contained a note—I cannot say whether I said a 5l note—it was not a sovereign but that was another letter—I am not aware that there is any other indictment against the prisoner—he expressed his readiness to come to the Post-office to give any explanation about the letter of which I spoke to him not about the letter he is indicted for—I did not explain that to him—in the course of that morning before this occurrence the prisoner had gone to the authorities of the Post-office with a sovereign which he said had dropped out of a letter—I was not present at the time but I know it from the Post-office authorities—no person came to the Post-office to claim a sovereign which had dropped out of a letter to my knowledge—if such a thing had happened I think I should have heard of it some subsequent morning—I never heard of any such transaction—Downes was not taken into custody—he was taken before the authorities of the Post-office but I think he was not examined because before be came the prisoner had been searched the marked sovereign found and there was no necessity for further examination—we knew not who had it before it was found—the letter in which the sovereign was enclosed would be in Downes s delivery—Downes was required to come into Mr Peacock s presence and give an account of the transaction—he was sought for for that purpose—the sovereign was found on the prisoner perhaps half an hour before Downes arrived—Downes was severely reprimanded by the president for signing his card at a house where he had no business to sign it—he was told that his situation was in jeopardy for such conduct—I saw a sovereign that morning in possession of Mr Kelly the superior of my department which was said to have been delivered by the prisoner—I did not see it in Mr Wynne s possession MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did he bring any sovereign to you A No—I did not see the sovereign in his possession ANN TUCKER I live at No 20 College-street Westminster Abbey with my son who is an upholsterer On the 11th of October last I received no letter directed to Mr Tucker or any letter of any sort—none arrived—I was at home the whole morning—my son left home at nine o clock and did not come home till five—I was the only person at home—no letter reached me THOMAS RUSSELL I am an assistant inspector of letter carriers On the 10th of October I saw Mr Playle put a sovereign and a half-sovereign into the cover of a letter—it was sealed up and it was given into my possession—I locked it up in my desk and gave it to Rice the sorter next morning—I gave him no instructions—I had marked the sovereign and and half-sovereign so as to know them again—this is the sovereign that was put into the letter—I saw it again on the morning of the 11th after it had been taken from the prisoner s pocket and knew it again directly Cross-examined Q Early that morning did the prisoner come to you with some letters which he had to deliver and a sovereign A He did about half-past seven o clock with about a dozen letters in his hand—he said he had found the sovereign among his letters and he supposed it had fallen out of one of them—I told him to proceed in the ordinary course in such cases to take it to the president of the Inland office—I was at my desk when he came to me—I cannot say whether I had left my desk for a minute or two before—it is possible—I am frequently called away—I examined the letters he produced to me and one letter was selected as being likely to be the one out of which the sovereign might have dropped—I have since seen that letter—Mr Playle showed it to me this morning—it has some writing of Mr Wynne s on it—if any inquiry had been made at the office for a sovereign lost out of a letter that morning I have no doubt I should have heard it—I am not aware of any such application being made MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You say the prisoner brought you a sovereign is that sovereign in Court A It is—this is it— produced by Mr Playle —it is marked—I know it as such—I saw it put into a letter that morning—it was put into the letter out of which it was said to have fallen—this is the letter— produced by Mr Playle —the sovereign was put into this letter at the same time the other was put into Tucker s letter—the sovereign was first wrapped in the enclosure and then the whole was put in the envelope—the fly leaf was opened—it was put into that sheet and folded—I am convinced that the sovereign could not have dropped out of that letter—I had seen this letter about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before the prisoner brought it to me—it was not open then—the sovereign was put into this letter by Mr Playle in my presence at the same time the other was—it was locked up with the other in the desk given to Rice with the other and brought out by him—the prisoner pointed out to me how the sovereign had got out of the letter—he said it had fallen out—he brought me several letters and said it had fallen out he could not say out of which it had fallen he supposed it must have fallen out here—there is an opening in the letter which would let it out—there was no such opening or any thing of the kind when I saw the letter a quarter of an hour before MR CLARKSON Q Is this writing on the letter the handwriting of Mr Wynne the president A Yes it is— reads — If any thing has escaped from this letter application to be made to the Secretary General Post-office —that letter has since gone through the Post-office to the person it is addressed to—it is directed Mrs Jones at Mr Jeane s North-street westminster —it is the writing of Mr Playle s servant JOHN PLAYLE re-examined I have the sovereign that was taken out of the letter addressed to Mrs Jones—it is a marked sovereign—I folded it up in the letter myself that morning—there was no fracture in the cover at that time—this letter was prepared with the sovereign in it in the same way as the other to see if anybody would take it—I am not aware that Mr Wynne knew anything of these letters being trap letters—I saw this letter again about half-past ten o clock that morning—I examined it to see how the sovereign had got out—it appeared to me that it had come out of this fissure or break but I cannot tell by what means—I am confident it could not have dropped out MR CLARKSON Q When the letter was brought to you at half-past ten o clock was the seal unbroken A Yes—it was the same seal I had put on it—this is the fissure of which I speak— pointing it out —has become enlarged since—the sovereign was in the middle—there is a break in the enclosure corresponding with the envelope—I am quite sure that fissure was not there when it was in the hands of the Post-office autborities before it was put on the prisoner s desk—I believe these trap letters were known to the Postmaster-General—I believe it was by his sanction that Mr Kelly my superior desired me to take the steps I did—he desired me to make the trap letter—I cannot say in whose possession this letter has been up to yesterday—I had it yesterday from Mr Brodie a gentleman is the Post-office and have had it ever since—I have kept it in my pocket—I have prepared a great many trap letters about a dozen within the last twelve months not more—Mrs Jones is not here nor Mrs Jeanes—my servant Norah Murphy wrote this letter MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did you ever prepare a trap letter with out directions from your superior A Certainly not—two were prepard that morning—I identified the sovereign which came out of this letter about twelve o clock that morning—it was then in Mr Kelly s possesion and the sovereign taken from Mr Tucker s letter I identified about half an hour before—I did not see it produced—my back was towards the prisoner at the time—the sovereign was given me by Mr Blott clerk to the superintending President HENRY RICE I am a sub-sorter in the General Post-office Mr Russell gave me two or three letters on the morning of the 11th of October—one was directed to Mrs Jones at Mrs Jeanes North-street Westminster—this it it—I felt it at the time I received it and know that it contained coin—all the letters did not contain coin—one other did—I placed this and another directed to Mr Tucker in the Palace-yard district in the Inland office among the other letters—they remained there till Kingsford the collector took them away two or three minutes after ROBERT KINGSFORD I am a letter-carrier in the Post-office On the morning of the 11th of October I collected the letters which were sorted and took them to the different letter-carriers seats—I took the letters within the Palace-yard district to the prisoner s seat—if a letter directed to Mr Tucker College-street Westminster had been sorted there I should have taken it—I do not look to see if the letters are properly directed—I tike all I find in the letter-carriers department DANIEL DOWNES I am a sub sorter—I act occasionally as an assistant letter-carrier—during the absence of letter-carriers through illness or other causes if there are not a sufficient number of letter-carriers the subsorters occasionally take their place On the morning of the 11th of October I assisted the prisoner—he divided the letters between us—if there was a letter directed to Mr Tucker of Great College-street it would have been in my delivery—I had no such letter ROBERT TYRRELL I am an officer I searched the prisoner about eleven o clock on the 11th October and found this sovereign a half-crown a shilling three sixpences and a fourpenny-piece in his trowsrs pocket—I think he might have been asked whether he had any objection to be searched—he made no objection—I found two stamps in the lining of his hat which appeared to have come off of letters—I asked him where he had got the sovereign from—he said he had had it some time that he had brought it from home that morning Cross-examined Q I believe before you began to question him you told him not to criminate himself A Yes and that he need not answer unless he liked—I then asked him about the sovereign GEORGE HUDSON WYNNE I am a president in the Post Office On the 11th of October the prisoner brought me a sovereign and some letters stating that he had found a sovereign among his letters—I do not recollect that be suggested any letter as the one out of which it had come—I examined the letters—this is my writing on the back of this letter—I wrote it at it struck me to be the most likely letter from which the sovereign had escaped—I was not aware that there were any trap letters that morning—I do not recollect how many letters the prisoner brought to me or whether he drew my attention to this letter himself Cross-examined Q Were there as many as twelve or twenty letters A Not more than four or five I think—Mr Russell was not with me—I did not mark the sovereign which the prisoner gave me—I did not know that it was marked MR CLARKSON called— ALFRED WILLIAM COOPER I am one of the sub-sorters in the Inland Office of the General Post Office Between six and seven o clock on the morning in question as I was standing sorting the prisoner touched me on the back and said Fred look here —I turned round—he had some letters in one hand and a sovereign in the other—he said it bad dropped from one of those letters—I said Do you know which —he said No I don t —I said Look at them —he immediately put the letters on his seat and looked over them and I looked with him—he came to one with a blue stamp—this is the letter—he said I think this is it here is the mark of the coin this is the letter I shall give it to Dowries to put the sovereign in his pocket and he can deliver the letter —I said Yon are not going to be such a fool as that are you supposing it should contain two sovereigns and that one has dropped out before it was posted or if it should be remaining in the bag or dropped in the Inland Office —a person named Hammond who sat on his right-hand advised him to do the same—I advised him to take it to Mr Russell which he did—I cannot positively say whether he put the sovereign into his pocket—I was in conversation with him on the subject about five minutes before he went to Mr Russell—I should not have observed what had occurred if he had not called my attention to it JOHN PLAYLE re-examined This is the sovereign out of the letter with the blue stamp—I marked it with a bradawl with a slight dot against the initial letters f d and here is the mark quite plain—all the other sovereigns I had marked were marked every one quite differently—the sovereign put into Mrs Jones s letter is of a different reign to this—I marked that before the letter G being one of William the Fourth—they were selected purposely—Mr Russell saw both sovereigns at the time—he saw me mark them on one side and I saw him mark them on the other—he put a similar dot made with the same bradawl underneath the dragon on one sovereign and underneath the shield on the other—this is the sovereign I put into Mrs Jones s letter—I am certain of it—I made a memorandum at the time—they were marked a fortnight before I put them into the letters—they had been kept some time in my drawer in the office and sometimes they were used for the purpose of placing them in letters—I noticed the marks on the sovereigns on the morning of the 10th when I put them into the letters and so did Mr Russell—I am positive of both of them GUILTY Aged 32 — Transported for

t18430508-1418  1418 GEORGE DAVIES was indicted for stealing on the 18th of April 1 letter containing 1 sovereign the property of the Postmaster-General —2nd Count stating it to be the property of the Right Hon William Baron Lowther —3rd Count stating it to be the property of John Playle MESSRS SHEPHERD and ADOLPHUS conducted the Prosecution JOHN PLAYLE I am assistant-inspector of letter-carriers at the Post Office The prisoner was a letter-carrier in the Dorset-square district Regent s-park—in consequence of complaints at the Office I made up a letter on the 17th of April and addressed it to Mr Midlam bread and biscuit baker No 6 Dorset-place London —I put two penny adhesive stamps on it and next morning Tuesday the 18th I put into the letter one sovereign in the presence of Mr Russell—we each put a private mark on the sovereign—I now produce that sovereign and am quite sure it is the identical one I put into the letter on the 18th—here is both my mark and Mr Russell s—I noticed also that it was the coinage of Victoria 1843 which this is—the paper had a yellowish cast not the usual colour of letter paper and the letter was rather large—I sealed it and gave it into the hands of Mr Brodie a clerk in the superintending president s room to take the address—I afterwards went to one of the windows in the hall and gave it into his hands at the window—he put the obliterating stamp on it and the day of the month—he then brought it back to me in the superintending president s room and I took it into the inspector s room and gave it to Mr Russell who had seen me make it up—he sent for Henry Rice a sorter and gave it to him—this was about twenty-five minutes past seven o clock in the morning—I have never seen the letter since—it is the practice in the office for the letter-carriers to pay their charges to the receiver-general three times a week—they pay the amount of two days letters—one carrier takes it from what is called the division and hands it to the receiver-general s clerk—there are fifteen divisions—there are seventeen carriers in the prisoner s division—when their pay papers are made up each paper is delivered separately to the receiver-general s clerk with the money in it—Hipp is collector of charges to the prisoner s division—on the morning after this after Hipp had collected the payments from the different carriers he brought them to me about seven o clock in the morning of the 19th THOMAS RUSSELL I am assistant-inspector of letter-carriers On the 18th of April I saw Mr Playle inclose a sovereign in a letter about a quarter past seven o clock in the morning directed to Mr Midlam bread and biscuit baker No 6 Dorset-place London —a sovereign was fastened into it by a piece of card—I had marked the sovereign and saw Mr Playle mark it—I noticed that it was the reign of Victoria 1843—that produced is it—Mr Playle sealed the letter—I shortly after saw it in Mr Playle s hands—it had then received two post-office stamps—Rice was called up and directed to put it among the Dorset-place division with Davis s letters—about a quarter past eight o clock that morning I saw the letter again on the prisoner s seat having passed through the first sorting and put up in one of the divisions of letters as is the custom to be delivered in different streets—the letters are first sorted by a sub-sorter into divisions and afterwards into walks—they are then brought out into another office and placed on the seats of the respective letter-carriers who have to deliver them—they are brought out in a tray and placed on the carriers seats—they then arrange them for delivery—I saw this letter after it had been arranged for delivery—that it done by the carrier Q How could you tell it was after it was arranged A They are first placed flat on the desk but afterwards placed upon two shelves and stand upon one end—this being a larger letter than common and of a peculiar yellow tint and what is rather unusual two stamps that satisfied me it was the same letter—I saw the two stamps and the colour of the paper—it was rather a large letter but I think not to large as to project so much as it did—I did not see the prisoner leave the office that morning—I saw him with his hat on and he came into the private office where I was preparing to go out—I think it was a little after eight—I was present next morning when Hipp brought the charges into what we call the inquiry room—Mr Playle was there—we both began to open the different charges—Mr Playle opened Davis s when it came to its turn and put it on one side without speaking for me to look at which I did COURT Q How did you know it was Davis s charge A I knew that afterwards—here is the paper with Davis s name at the bottom of the amount in his handwriting—there was six sovereigns and one shilling in it and among them was the sovereign which he bad marked—the prisoner was called in that morning and placed in charge of Tyrrell the officer—he remained in his custody an hour or two before he was examined by Mr Peacock Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When was this plan of putting sovereigns into letters first commenced A About a year and a half or two years ago—Mr Playle was entrusted with the management of it—if a man is suspected we have recourse to this to discover if it is correct intending he should take the letter and money if so disposed Q I believe it has turned out once or twice that the wrong man has been suspected A I should think so—Mr Playle detected a relation or his own in that way after giving another man into custody—I was concerned with Mr Playle in getting up that plan—I noticed the date of the sovereign at Mr Playle s suggestion—anybody into whose hands this paper came might open it and change the money—there is no seal—it has the prisoner s signature to it showing that for two days his letters came to 6l 1s all but 1d I made a dent on the sovereign with a brad-awl on the shield side between the stems of the wreath—Hipp has been seven or eight years I think in the Post-office—his situation is the same kind as the prisoner s—I saw Mr Playle put the wax on the letter in the superintending president s room and saw him leave with it—I saw the letter afterwards—I do not know whether I had it in my hand but am pretty certain I handed it over to Rice but do not exactly recollect—the prisoner s is the fifteenth division—I do not know how many letter-carriers there are in it—there are a great many—if a letter is given to a carrier whose division it does not belong to he would not be fined if he does not carry it out that I am aware of—the carriers seats are divided by a partition—each man has a seat to himself—I did not put the letter on the prisoner s seat nor see it put on—on the division of his seat that I saw this letter there were about twenty—they varied in size—Mr Playle selected the paper for the letter and directed it by Mr Kelly s direction—I saw Mr Playle mark the sovereign at the end of the curl of the Queen s hair—it was an indentation of the same brad-awl—I was not acquainted with Midlam—I have since found there is a person of that name—the prisoner s ordinary weekly payment was about 6l MR SHEPHERD Q Do you put down in writing the date of collecting A I take the particulars on paper JAMES BRODLE I am a clerk in the General Post-office On Tuesday morning the 18th of April I remember Mr Playle bringing me a letter to the window addressed to Mr Midlam bread and biscuit baker 6 Dorset-place London—it appeared to contain a piece of coin and had two 1d postage stamps on it—I obliterated them stamped it with the date-stamp of the office and gave it back to Mr Playle HENRY RICE I am a superintending-sorter in the General Post-office I was on duty on the 18th of April and received from Mr Russell a letter directed to Mr Midlam bread and biscuit baker 6 Dorset-place London—it contained some hard substance which I supposed to be cash—Mr Playle was present—I placed it among the letters for the Dorset-square delivery after they had been sorted in the inland-office—the other letters for the district had been sorted into walks—the delivery is what we term a walk or district—it was the division No 15—I placed it among the prisoner s walk which is the Dorset-square walk—the letters were at that time standing up on their ends as they had been sorted—Thomas Le Good the collector came in while I was there and took the letters away into the letter-carrier s-office in a tray—he took those of the Dorset-square walk and the whole of the fifteen divisions at the same time—the letter I had placed there was among them—it was what we call the last collection after the sorters had done—the collector takes letters away several times in the course of the morning for the sorters—this was the last collection of that morning—there were two stamps on the right hand corner of the letter and the paper was rather of a yellowish cast Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q About how many letters went to that division that morning A Perhaps from 8 000 to 10 000 carried in this tray at separate times—the man who takes them out places them on each letter-carrier s seat—the letter-carrier is sometimes at his seat and sometimes not—the walks are divided on the tray by one letter being put upright—there is no wooden partition to the tray—there are about twenty-three letter-carriers in this division—only one person carries the letters for each division—some of the heavier divisions employ two men—I have seen letters dropped at times in carrying from one office to the other THOMAS BURSTON LE GOOD I am letter-carrier in the General Post-office On Tuesday the 18th of April I was employed in collecting letters from the Inland-office for the last collection of the fifteenth division—those intended for the Dorset-square district I laid on the prisoner s seat about ten minutes or a quarter before eight o clock in the morning—I saw Mr Rice there at the time—prisoner s duty was arrange those letters for delivery Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Where was the prisoner when you placed them there A He was not at his seat to the best my knowledge—I had not been made acquainted with the plan—I put on his seat about as many letter as I could take in my hand perhaps thirty—I took them from the table in the Inland-office where they are sorted—there are two sorters appointed for that purpose Ray and another—I do not know who it was that morning—I earned them in an open tray—it was not full at the last collection but nearly so—I did not observe the colour of them MR ADOLPHUS Q Whom did you receive the letters from A From the table—Rice was close behind when I put them on the prisoner s seat and when I took them from the table—I did not in any way alter them HENRY RICE re-examined Q Did you see Le Good carry the letters to the prisoner s seat A I saw him take them into the letter-carrier s office and afterwards saw the letters placed on the seat—I did not see the letter in question on the seat—I believe I afterwards saw it on the seat but will not swear that I saw that letter in particular I saw him placing the letters on the seats—I did not see him actually place them on the prisoner s seat but saw them on it immediately afterwards—I cannot speak to seeing that particular letter there at that time—I can say I saw a letter which I suppose to be the letter—I have scarcely any doubt it was the same—for I observed in it two stamps and the colour of the paper—that was when I pointed it out to Mr Russell—that was about ten minutes after I first saw the bundle of letters on the prisoner s seat—they had then all been sorted by the prisoner—I do not know whether he had arranged them quite for delivery but he had thrown do that—I did not see Le Good put them on the prisoner s a seat as I did not like to follow very closely MR CLARKSON Q Would not the prisoner be absent at different times calling the charges that morning A Yes he would be engaged the principal part of the morning perhaps about an hour from seven till eight o clock—he would be from his seat occasionally and it might be as early as half-past six according to the duty—he had to call the carriers to fetch their own charges duty to call them to retell their charges—there is only one besides the prisoner employed on that duty—he would be occasionally doing that from half-past six to eight most of thetime he would be occasionally at his seat—they arrange between themselves one to be absent a few minutes and the other to attend to it COURT Q How then could he sort the letters to the different streets A He would have part of his letter at his seat which are brought out at different time to his seat—he would occasionally get a few minutes to sort them then go away to call the charges WILLIAM GEORGE MIDLAM I am a bread and biscuit baker and live at No 6 Dorset-place Pall-mall I know Mr Playle—I did not in April or at any time receive from him a letter with a sovereign in it WILLIAM HENRY HIPP I am a letter-carrier at the General Post-office It was part of my duty to receive from the letter-carriers of fifteen divisions their pay-lists On the 19th of April I received a pay-list from the prisoner—this is it— looking at it —it contained money—I put it into my pocket and took it into the room to Mr Playle—I received lists from all the other carriers that morning—I put them all into my pocket and delivered them to Mr Playle in Mr Kelly s room Q From the time you received these pay-lists till you delivered them up had they been broken open or the money at all mixed A No each man s money was wrapped in his own pay-list—I delivered it exactly in the same condition as I received it from the prisoner—I marked one of the coins which was taken out of it by desire of Mr Russell—I had seen it taken out—it was in the paper at the time I received it from the prisoner—that now produced is it—I put my name on it Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q How long elapsed from the time you received the money and handing it over A It might be twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour—it was not an hour—after I received it I was engaged collecting the others—I put them into my right hand coat pocket—I do not know the amount of any of the others—this was the highest amount—some of them were in silver—the lists are all the same size—I received them from the different men—I went about from place to place receiving them—some came to me and some I went to—I dropped them into my coat pocket MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you break bulk or cause any of the money to come out in dropping them into your pocket A No I did not—there was no loose money in my pocket that morning ROBERT TYRRELL I am a constable of the Post-office I was in the inspector s room on the morning of the 19th of April—Mr Playle Mr Peacock Mr Russell and I think Mr Kelly who belongs to the Post-office were there—the prisoner was with me—I was called and brought him into the inspector s room and he was delivered into my custody—I had had him in my custody for some time before—this paper was opened by Mr Playle who looked at one sovereign in particular and identified it—the prisoner was then asked how he accounted for the sovereigns—he said he had received one the day before the Tuesday from the bar-maid of the Alsop Arms New-road two he had received from the same house on the Monday and he received the other three on the Friday previous—he was asked to look at the sovereign which Mr Playle had previously identified and he said he believed that to be the sovereign he had received from the bar-maid as the one he had received was a new one—Mr Peacock said a letter directed to Mr Midlam baker No 6 Dorset-place London on his walk had never been delivered—the prisoner was asked if he had seen it and said he had seen no such a letter for he knew No 6 was a Mr Robinson s a surgeon—I have inquired and found there is a Mr Robinson at No 6 Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did not he tell you he had not seen such a letter and if he had he should know it was not for his delivery as Mr Robinson a surgeon resided at No 6 A Yes JOHN PLAYLE re-examined On the morning of the 19th of April Hipp brought me a pay-list which contains the amount each man has to pay—he also delivered to me the packets of money named in that pay-list—they were all in separate papers and apparently unbroken—I proceeded to examine them—I took them as the names appear on the list but did not examine the amounts of each paper—I only looked at the sovereigns—I had examined about five before I came to the prisoner s packet which contained six sovereigns and one shilling his charge being 6l 0s 11d —I looked particularly at the sovereigns in that paper which was signed by the prisoner himself—among them I found the sovereign I named as having marked and put into the letter—it is the identical sovereign—here are the marks which I and Mr Russell put—I desired Hipp instantly to mark it which he did—I gave the prisoner into custody of Tyrrell and in about half an hour afterwards I saw him in the inspector s room—he was asked by Mr Peacock what money he had given to Hipp that morning—he said 6l 1s —he said he gave them to him in the usual way folded up in the paper—Mr Peacock told him there had been a letter missing in the morning directed to Mr Midlam which had not been delivered and that letter contained a sovereign and one of the sovereigns found in his paper was known to be the identical sovereign that letter contained—he said he could not tell how that could be for he could account for where he obtained all the sovereigns—he said he had no such name in his district that a surgeon named Robinson lived at No 6 in his district and not a baker—he said if a letter had been directed to Dorset-place Pall-mall he should have taken it either to the letter-carrier s seat for Pall-mall or put it among the blind or miss-sorted letters as we term them—he said one sovereign he had taken of the bar-maid of the Alsop Arms New-road the bright sovereign and that was the one I had marked Q How did he point that out as the one he bad take n A Hestood at a distance and was looking over the different sovereigns—he said he remembered taking three of one and two of another and the bright one he said I took of the bar-maid of the Alsop Arms —that was the one which was marked Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did he say he knew nothing about the letter but if it had come to him he would not have taken it out for he had no bread and biscuit baker living in Dorset-place but a doctor lived there A I will not say those were the identical words but it was to that effect ELEANOR HORLOCK I am bar-maid at the Alsop Arms New-road—I know the prisoner On Tuesday morning the 18th of April he brought me 20s in silver and I gave him a sovereign which I took from my purse—I had had it about a fortnight or three weeks—I am quite sure I had had it longer than a week unless I gave somebody else change which I do not remember—I am quite sure I had it before that day—I had it on the 17th—I gave it him between eleven and twelve in the morning Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q I believe your master had a very high opinion of the prisoner A Very high indeed and so had I—I have known him eleven years—he was very largely trusted with money by my master—it is very likely I change money every five minutes in the day but that is from the till—the sovereign I gave him was of the present reign but I cannot say whether it was of this year MR SHEPPARD Q Was that sovereign out of your purse A Yes—that is not common for me to do but there was no sovereign in the till and I took it from my purse—the first I took out I did not give him but the second—I think I had had that sovereign a fortnight COURT Q Are you able to say with certainty whether you took that sovereign the preceding day or might you have got it that morning in change A I am sure I did not get it that morning—I have no recollection of giving any one a sovereign for silver—the last money I put into my purse was about a fortnight before when I received my wages—I might have given change since that but do not remember it—I am sure I did not that day—that was the only time I opened my purse that day—I kept my purse in a drawer in the bar—it had been there about a month MATTHEW MORRISS I am a letter-carrier at the Post-office Dorset-place Pall-mall is in my division—Mr Midlam a biscuit-baker lives there—I had no letter to deliver to him that day—the prisoner did not deliver one to me or communicate to me that I ought to have had one MR PLAYLE re-examined The sovereign I put into the letter was my own

Postmaster-general —Seven other Counts varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS SHEPHERD and ADOLPHUS conducted the Prosecution ROBERT SMITH I am superintending president of the Twopenny Post-office The prisoner was employed as an assistant letter-carrier in the Enfield district—in consequence of something I heard on the 8th of June I marked a sovereign and enclosed it in a sheet of paper sealed it and directed my clerk to address it to Mr Thomas Nicholson George-street Manchester and saw him direct it—I delivered the letter that same day to Peek the officer and desired him to proceed to Ponder s-end next day and post the letter there and to meet me at Enfield post-office a little before one o clock on the 9th—I got to Enfield about a quarter to one on the 9th—it was the prisoner s duty to collect the letters at Ponder s-end and he was provided with a pouch to put them in and to take them to the post-office at Enfield to be made up for the London bag—he collected at Ponder s-end about a quarter-past twelve—I waited at Enfield till the bag was brought out of the post-office and delivered to the rider to put into his saddle-bag to bring to London—I proceded immediately to the post-office at Enfield—Peek was also there—I got the bag from the rider—the prisoner was standing at the side of the horse—I took the bag into the sorting-office cut it open and looked for this letter—I could not find it and I said to the prisoner A letter is missing are all the letters here that you have brought from the receiving houses —he said Yes —I looked over the letters again and said A letter is certainly missing have you got any about you —he said No —I then asked him if he had any objection to be searched—he hesitatingly said No —I directed Peek to search him—when he was in the act of doing so the prisoner got out of the chair where he was sitting and said It is no use denying it put his hand into his left-hand trowsers pocket and pulled out the letter crumpled up—it was the letter I had previously given Peek—this is it it has not been opened yet— The witness here opened it —it contains the same sovereign as I put in—the prisoner said I beg your pardon I hope you will forgive me —he fell down in the chair and laid his head across the back of it—I then gave him into custody Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did he appear to be very much terrified at the time A Yes—I do not know that there is such a person as Mr Thomas Nicholson of George-street Manchester—it was a name which came into my head and was used only for the purpose of detection—the letter bears no post-mark MATTHEW PEEK I am a police-constable attached to the post-office On the 8th of June Mr Smith gave me a letter to post—I dropped it into the box at Ponder s-end post-office on the 9th about half-past ten o clock in the morning—I afterwards went to Enfield and met Mr Smith there—I waited till the prisoner brought the bag out of the office and gave it to the riding-boy—I then stepped forward and ordered the boy to give me the bag back—we went into the office and Mr Smith cut the bag open and said there was a letter missing—he asked the prisoner whether he had brought all the letters from Ponder s-end—he said Yes —he asked if he had got any about him—he said No —he asked if he had any objection to be searched—he hesitatingly said no—I was about to search him when he said It is no use denying it put his hand into his trowser s pocket and produced the letter in a crumpled state—he then said I beg your pardon I hope you will forgive me —he then fell back in the chair apparently in a fainting state and hung his head over the chair—this is the letter EMMA BRADING My husband keeps the post-office receiving-house at Ponder s-end and I assist him in doing the duties of the office—I know the prisoner—he came to the office on the 9th of June—this letter was then in the post-office—as I took the letters out of the box and put them on the counter I observed this letter bearing a blue stamp I took it up and observed to the prisoner that I thought it above weight and that it contained coin and by the sound of it a sovereign—I knocked it against the counter—the prisoner took it up looked at it and replied to the same effect that it did contain coin—I then proceeded to sort them and make up my bill and gave all the letters to the prisoner—I laid this down among the rest—he had no bag—he went away with the letters to go to Enfield Cross-examined Q I suppose you stamp all the letters A Yes COURT Q It is your business to do so A Yes and I supposed I had done so—this letter ought to have been stamped but I must in the conversation with the prisoner have omitted stamping all the unpaid letters—I am sure I stamped all the paid—there were only twelve letters altogether six of each—stamped letters are considered as unpaid—paid letters are those which I receive money for Tom Flood Cutbush of Enfield John Harvey of Stamford-hill Thomas Foster builder of Enfield Thomas Parbury smith of Enfield Charles Griffiths clothier of Enfield Ebenezer Gibbons fruiterer of Enfield William Hogg plumber of Enfield Harry Young surveyor of Enfield

letter-carrier On the morning of the 29th of Jan I was at the Post-office—I had previously procured this letter with the Birmingham post-mark on it addressed to Mr Tyrrell Bank of England London—Mr Russell another inspector was with me in the assistant-inspector s room—I saw Mr Russell inclose a sovereign in that letter and a 1l note of the Edinburgh Bank—before the sovereign was inclosed in the letter I marked it on the obverse side and Mr Russell marked it on the reverse side—Mr Russell sealed the letter with coloured wax—this is the sovereign—my mark is a dot on the head side after the word Rex —I have a memorandum which I made at the time of the mark and it answers the description of the coin—the date of the coinage was also taken down—the letter with the sovereign in it was placed in this other letter directed to Mr F Morgan of Birmingham to be left at the Angel Coffee-house next door to the Bluecoat-boy City-road Islington London —I then sent for Henry Rice the superintending letter-sorter and gave him the letter with directions to place it among the prisoner sletters in the Inland-office—at that time the letter with the sovereign in it was certainly placed within the folds of the other—it was allowed to fall into it so that it could not be perceived and it could not shake out—the prisoner was on duty that morning—I went to the Angel Coffee-house where the outside letter is directed—I got there about ten minutes past nine—I was not acquainted with the landlord up to that time—I stated to him why I came—about a quarter of an hour after I had been there the prisoner came—that house is within four or five doors of the first house at which he delivered any letters—he delivered this outside letter to the landlord who immediately gave it to me—the other letter was not then in it—I saw the prisoner deliver this to the landlord and without losing sight of it I received it from him—I then went to the Bank of England and saw Mr Tyrrell to whom the inner letter was directed—I ascertained that he had not received the letter—I was on duty at the Post-office next morning the 30th—John Arthur the letter-carrier for the Bank of England received instructions to bring all letters directed to the Bank of England to me that morning and had done so up to eight o clock about which time he brought this inner letter directed to Mr Tyrrell saying he had just found it on his desk—he gave it to Mr Boydon another assistant-inspector—I was not there at that moment but I received it within a minute afterwards—it was then sealed but it had been opened—it was not opened in my presence—Mr Rackley another assistant-inspector showed the letter to the prisoner who was sent for as he was leaving the office about a quarter-past eight in the morning and said Have you seen that letter before or Do you know anything of that letter or words tantamount to that—he said he knew nothing about it—Mr Rackley replied that he had evidence that the letter had been in his possession yesterday—the prisoner s seat is about six or eight yards from Arthur s desk—there are ten or twelve letter-carriers seats between them—the sovereign is my own Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Was any impression placed on the seal of the enclosed letter A It was fastened with the point of a pencil-case so as to form a ring of the circumference of the pencil-case—the mark I made on the sovereign was a slight indentation with the point of a fork made after the word Rex —I did not see the mark Mr Russell made but I saw him in the act of marking it—I did not see where Rice took the letter to when I gave it him—he took it singly from my hand—he had no other with him that I know of—he left the room immediately as if he was going to the Inland-office—I did not see that letter again till the following morning—it was then in the possession of Mr Boydon accompanied by Arthur in Mr Kelly s room—about 260 persons were employed that morning in the same room that Arthur s seat is in—about ten persons were between the prisoner s seat and Arthur s—I had taken this sovereign out of my own private purse—the Scotch note was not mine

letter addressed to Mr Morgan—my attention was called to another within the folds of it—I was desired to put it among the prisoner s letters after they had been sorted in the Inland-office—I took out the inner letter and copied the address—I then replaced it in the letter again as it was—I felt the letter directed to Mr Tyrrell to ascertain that it contained something and I felt it contained something like a coin—I supposed it to be a sovereign—after placing the one letter within the other—I took them to the Inland-office where I placed them with the City-road letters already sorted for the prisoner s delivery—I remained there about teu minutes—Brooks the collector came and took all the letters away in a tray—I did not see where he took them to but it was his duty to take them to the letter-carrier s office—I am certain he took this letter away because he took the whole that were placed there—I sent a communication to Mr Boydon Cross-examined Q I suppose there was a tray full of letters A There was—I did not notice the seal of the enclosure JOHN BROOKS I was in the service of the Post-office On Monday morning the 29th of Jan I delivered letters to several letter-carriers of

saw Brooks come from the Inland-office with the letters on the tray—I saw him take from the tray that portion of the letters belonging to the prisoner s district and place them on the seat before him—the prisoner was at bis seat at the time—I saw him take the whole of that parcel of letters in convenient portions and divide and arrange them for delivery—next morning about twenty minutes or half past eight o clock I received from Arthur this letter directed to Mr Tyrrell Bank of England—Arthur went with me into the inspector s room—I there found Mr Rackley another assistant inspector the prisoner and the officer—I produced the letter and told Mr Playle I had received it from Arthur—the prisoner was not exactly present—there was only a door dividing the room—he was within hearing—Arthur said he had just found it on his seat JOHN ARTHUR I am a letter-carrier in the General Post-office—the Bank of England is in my division—my assistant delivers the letters there—they are delivered at the lodge kept by Mr Tyrrell—on Mondays they are delivered to one of the Bank porters at the door—he calls at the office for them—they are delivered by my assistant—there are some registered letters which I take myself—I was on duty at the Post-office on Tuesday morning the 30th—I had been at my desk and left it for about two minutes—when I returned I found this letter there directed to Mr Tyrrell Bank of England—I cannot say whether the prisoner was in the room at that time—I had not seen him that morning to take any notice of him—I put the letter into the box where I generally place the Bank letters and afterwards took it into the inspector s room—Mr Boydon came to the door and took the letter from me—when I found it in my seat there was nothing in it to my knowledge—I did not feel anything in it—if there had been a sovereign in it I have no doubt I should have felt it—I felt no such thing—my seat is fifteen or sixteen yards from the prisoner s—other men are between me and him JAMES TYRRELL I am a Bank porter and reside at the lodge at the Bank All letters that come to the Bank of England pass through my bands—on the 29th of Jan I received no letter

Jan I was sent for to the inspector s office—I there saw the prisoner Mr Rackley Mr Blott Mr Russell and Mr Playle I believe—this letter addressed to Mr Tyrrell was produced and the prisoner was asked if he knew anything about it but before that he was cautioned that whatever he said would he used in evidence against him—he said he knew nothing about it—it was stated to him that it was known it was in his possession the day before—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked where he lived—he said at No 26 Goswell-terrace Goswell-road—I went there and saw a female on the first floor who answered to the name of Frost—I afterwards went back and stated in the prisoner s presence what had passed between myself and Mrs Frost—I said to her I want the sovereign your-husband gave you yesterday —she went into a back room—I followed her and from a chest of drawers she took this box and gave to me stating that the sovereign was inside—I only found one sovereign in it—it was not locked nor Were the drawers—this is the sovereign which I have produced—I asked her when her husband gave it her—she said the day before after he had done his delivery—I returned to the Post-office with the sovereign and

on the fly-leaf of it—the letter contained Bank post-bills bills of exchange and checks—I compared the bills with the writing on the fly-leaf to be certain the bills mentioned there were in the letter—I gave the letter with the bills to Mr Rogers another clerk to have them endorsed and the letter copied—it was returned to me—I then compared the Bank post-bills bills of exchange and checks with the particulars on the fly-leaf and found they corresponded—I inclosed them in the letter which I handed to Rogers to have it posted—it was directed to Messrs Glynn Halifax and Mills bankers London—we were apprised in the course of post that it was not received Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You did not make the memorandum on the fly-leaf A No but compared it after the bills were returned to me before I sent them to the post MR ADOLPHUS Q The memorandum of what the letter contained was made before you received it A I received the Bank post and other bills to have a note made on the letter which was done—I compared them with that memorandum before I gave the letter to Rogers to post DAVID THOMAS ROGERS I am a clerk in this bank with Jamison On the 10th of Aug he gave me a letter directed to Glynn and Co —this is the letter—I copied it endorsed the bills of exchange put them in the letter and handed it to Mr Jamison again—he inclosed them and gave the letter to me—I put

employed on the water-closets at the Post-office On the 12th of Aug in consequence of directions I received I went near the water-closets and placed myself in a situation to enable me to see the whole of them with Peak the officer at a quarter to six o clock in the morning—I was in a situation to see four of the water-closets and if I moved could see the other two—there is a gas-light directly opposite the closets so that I could see who went in and out—there is no door to the closet—Peak was about ten feet from me—the closets are beneath the letter carrier s office on the basement at the end of the kitchen—they are self-acting water-closets—when a person sits on the seat he fills the box with water above his head and when he rises the seat rises an inch and the water immediately rushes into the basin—there are two gallons in the box and it leaves one gallon in the basin—when the person rises it carries down whatever is in the basin—I saw the prisoner enter the closet at ten minutes past six—he was the first person who entered that closet while I was there—I could see distinctly what he did—he tried the closet twice to see if the water would flow by sitting down with his clothes buttoned up and rising up—he then unbuttoned his clothes and sat down put his hand into his pocket and took from it a letter or paper—he then put his bead down to listen to know if anybody was coming—I then saw checks and Bank-notes in his hand—he commenced examining them and put some of them underneath him in the closet with his right hand into the pan—he then rolled up the letter or paper in a round ball and put that in the pan—I then communicated with Peak and he ran round and took my place—I took my station again—the prisoner was then examining papers—I directly heard a struggling then ran round to Peak s assistance and found him on the prisoner holding him down on the seat—I put my knee on the seat to prevent the water flowing into the basin—Peak pulled the prisoner off the seat—I then called for a light put my arm into the basin and took out two letters some bills and checks and gave them to Peak—the prisoner said when he rose from the seat You cannot hurt me now —he was taken into custody—they were struggling together in the kitchen MATTHEW PEAK I am a constable attached to the Post-office On the morning of the 12th of Aug I was with Blackburn about ten paces from him—he came there a little after six o clock—when he had been a little while looking into the water-closet he made a communication to me and I took his position and saw the prisoner break open a letter with a red seal—he was sitting on the closet—the light was strong enough for me to see the colour of the seal—there was a gas-light seven or eight feet from the prisoner opposite him—when he broke the seal he took out a square substance a paper and put it down by the side of him either into the pan or under his thigh—it appeared to go into the pan—I ran round to him and seized him—he then commenced kicking and knocking about—I did not take him off the water-closet but kept him on the seat knowing that if he got up the water would flow down and the contents wash away—he then commenced straggling—Blackburn came round—I saw him put his knee on the seat—I then took the prisoner off the seat—he said There you cannot hurt me now you only want to injure my character and kept striking and knocking at me—I called for Blackburn—I then searched him and found nothing on him but two fourpenny-pieces and a sixpence I received from Blackburn—the papers produced are a letter directed to Messrs Glynn and Co a Bank post-bill for 15l 19s 10d and altogether post-bills and securities to the amount of 670/ —he was taken to the solicitor s office and the letter shown to him—he was told he was charged with stealing and breaking it open that morning—he said he had broken no letter open—he lives at No 141 Golden-lane St Luke s—I had seen him at that lodging on the 22nd of July and then he said he had no money at all WILLIAM LAST I am a sub-sorter at the General Post-office The prisoner was a letter-carrier—it was his duty to collect in the letters of divisions Nos 11 and 12—No 10 is near that on his left side—I observed him when he was collecting Nos 11 and 12 very frequently blend the letters of No 11 with No 10—I have several times remarked to him that he was a very careless and clumsy fellow—he had done that the very morning this happened—he took No 12 letters in his right hand and placed them in his left hand—he should then take No 11 and place them also dividing the letters with his fingers but in doing so he pushed them among the letters of No 10—I saw him do so that morning and remarked to him that he was at his conjuring tricks again was not yesterday sufficient to practise in—he asked what I meant twice—I told him to mind some morning one of the letters did not stick to his fingers—he said nothing to that—he had nothing to do with No 10—Messrs Glynn and Co s letters would be sorted to No 10 JOHN ROBERTS I am a letter-sorter I was on duty on the 12th of August and saw the prisoner there—he is my collector—the 10th division is not in his part—on the morning of the 12th I saw him push the letters of No 11 with those of No 10 and after he had walked round to divisions 11 and 12 and laid the letters down he laid his body completely on the 12th division letters and looked through the wire division of the 12th sorting-table at me and said If I had you down stairs I would curl your hair for you —he had his body completely over the 12th letters and would have an opportunity of taking up a letter without my seeing it—this was about five minutes before he was in custody MR JAMESON re-examined This Bank post-bill for 18l 19s 10d

am assistant to a bookseller at Dewsbnry in Yorkshire I have a brother at Islington named Richard Groom On the eveniog of the 26th of Dec last I wrote a letter to him and pat into it a 5l Bank of England note a sovereign and a half-sovereign—the gold was secured inside a small penny almanack—I sealed the letter with sealing wax and stamped it with four penny postage stamps—I pot it into my pocket-book till the following morning and then carried it to the Dewsbury post-office and with my own hand put it into the letter-box a little before nine o clock—before I inclosed the Bank-note I took a memorandum of the number and date which I have here—I made it myself just before I put the note into the letter— read—X T 20905 Leeds July 25 1843 —I expected an answer from my brother in a day

the one I put into the letter—I directed the letter to Mr Richard Groom 14 Upper Bansbury-street Liverpool-road Islington London —I have never seen that letter again PAUL FLETCHER I am postmaster at Dewsbury—a letter placed in my post-office a little before nine o clock in the morning of the 27th of Dec would leave Dewsbury at five or a quarter past five on the same day—I made up the letter-bag on that day and put the usual letter-bill into bag—this is the bill I forwarded on the 27th of December Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Does this indicate that there were no unpaid letters for London at that time A No—here is 1s 4d that was for letters which I received the amount of—I cannot state in respect of how many letters that 1s 4d was paid—there were no unpaid letters that day—I call them paid letters when they have the heads on—I received 1s 4d in cash which I was accountable for WALTER ROBERTSON SCULTHORPE I am one of the presidents of the Post-office—the prisoner was employed in the Post-office as a letter-carrier at Islington—if a letter was posted at Dewsbury on the 27th it would reach London between five and six o clock on the morning of the 28th and if that letter was addressed to Islington it would be forwarded from the Inland-office to the London District-post and there sorted to the Islington box and forwarded about half-past eight o clock—there are two dispatches one at half-past eight to forward the letter-carriers in sorting and the other about half-past nine—it would be forwarded by one of those dispatches to the Islington district in a bag made up with the Islington letters—there were thirteen letter-carriers at Islington at that time—when the bags arrived at Islington it was the duty of the letter-carriers there to assist in sorting them into walks for the purpose of delivery Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q I understand you only to be speaking of a general practice not to anything that was done on a particular day A No WILLIAM ALDEBSON WALTON I am a clerk in the Inland department at the Post-office On the 28th of Dec I received the Dewsbury letter-bag about seven o clock—it was properly sealed and tied—this letter-bill was in the bag—the letters corresponded with that bill Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q There is no account of any letten here is there A Only 1s 4d the amount of the paid letters—the quantity of letters is not mentioned—the amount of paid letten corresponded with the bill COURT Q But the particular letten are not described A Not at all only the unpaid letters are noticed not the stamped letters CHARLES SCOTT I was on dirty at the General Post-office on the 28th of Dec —I made up the two dispatches of letters for the Islington district that morning—the first dispatch was forwarded by a messenger at half-past eight o clock and the second by the rider about half-past nine—I forwarded them both securely in the usual way Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q I suppose you did not make any examination of them to see what they were A No I merely sent them off JOHN WOOD I am superior charge-taker of the Islington branch-office The prisoner was a letter-carrier at Islington—he was on duty on the-morning of the 28th of Dec —I know that from this book which is the attendance-book of the letter-carriers—I make the entries in the book of their arrival and each letter-carrier puts his own signature to the twe of his arrival—here is the prisoner s name—he arrived at the-office at ten minutes to nine—immediately on the receipt of the letter-bag it would be opened by the letter-carrier whose seat is opposite to mine ami a bundle handed to each letter-carrier in attendance who sorts them into divisions—there are thirteen carriers at my office—when the sorting is over they are delivered to eaen letter-carrier for his delivery—the letters are not put into walks till they have sorted them or they might get letters which do not belong to their own walk—somewhere about the latter end of Dec or the beginning of Jan during the progress of business the prisoner in a very off-hand way stated that he had lost his notice-paper for the Insurance-office but he did not know how or in what way unless he pulled it out with his handkerchief or string and that on going to the office he found that his policy had been paid and the receipt cut out of the book—I remarked that it was very strange that any stranger should pay his insurance for him and advised him to go again to the office to see if there was any mistake in it for if the wrong receipt was cut out and given to another person they would most assuredly take it back again and would not keep it as their own—about two days after the prisoner had a letter in his hand and said Here is my receipt some one has sent it me —he did not speak to me expressly—he spoke generally in the office Q Did the prisoner tell you that he had lost his notice for the Insurance office before the conversation in which he told you that he had been to the office and found that somebody had paid it A He only mentioned the subject once—it was at that time that he told me had been to the office and found the receipt cut out of the book and it was two days after he said Here is my receipt some one has sent it to me Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was there anybody else present at this conversation A Yes—I do not recollect that all the letter-carriers were in at the time—there were other letter-carriers there—it was said openly—I made no memorandum of the conversation—it was in an off-hand way—I took no further notice of it not expecting that anything would call it in question—it was about a month before this charge was made against him WILLIAM MICHAEL I am sometimes employed as a messenger at the District Post-office I was so on the 28th of Dec last in the morning—I received the first bag for Islington and carried it safely in the same state as I received it to Islington—I started at half-past eight and reached Islington seven or eight minutes before nine CHARLES GOOD I am a mail-rider in the Post-office On the 28th of Dec I took the second bag to Islington and delivered it as I had it safe and the seal unbroken JOHN SPINK I was one of the letter-carriers of the Islington district on the 28th of Dec last—a letter addressed to Upper Barnsbury-street White Conduit-fields would be in my walk—I was in attendance on my duty at the office at Islington on the 28th of Dec and assisted in sorting the letters—I have no recollection of seeing such a letter or of having it to deliver that morning—I delivered all the letters accurately in my walk that were given me for the purpose Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you mean that you have a distinct recollection that you had no such letter that morning A No—I have no recollection—I made no memorandum of the letters COURT Q Do you recollect whether the prisoner was present at the time the letters were sorted that morning A I do not recollect JOHN WOOD re-examined I have no time entered in the book when the prisoner left—there is no memorandum made of the time of departure only of arrival—the letter-carriers continue till the letters are all sorted and the mis-sorts all corrected—they never leave the office till the letters are all sorted ready for delivery in the different walks Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q That is if they stay the proper time A I do not allow them to depart—I am there all the time—I recollect seeing the prisoner there that morning—I have a perfect recollection of it—it is my duty to see that they sign the correct time of their arrival and I take it from that he came at ten minutes to nine o clock—he went away at the usual time of leaving the office about ten minutes to ten—I have a distinct recollection of his being there that morning RICHARD GROOM I am clerk to a solicitor in London and brother to John Henry Groom who has been examined—I reside at No 14 Upper Barnsbury-street Islington On the 28th of Dec I received no such letter as my brother has spoken of nor did I ever receive such a letter Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q I suppose you do not take in all the letters that come to your house A no—all the parties are here who were in the house that day JOHN BROOKS JOHNSTON I am a clerk in the Royal Exchange Assurance Office In 1835 a policy was effected in that office on the furniture in a house No 15 Regent s-terrace White Conduit-fields Islington—this is the policy—the number of it is 443116 and the amount 100l on furniture at the dwelling-house of Mr William Onley—the annual premium and duty is 6s —it is our usual course to send out a notice when the time for the payment of the premium is arriving—one would have gone to Mr William Onley in the usual course of business—I have no personal recollection of it—I have here such a notice with the post mark on it—the premium upon that policy appears to have been paid by my account but I have no recollection of receiving it—I receive a great many—I have the book here which contains the margin of the receipt corresponding with the receipt—on the 30th of Dec I have an entry of my own—a 5l note was tendered in payment of the premium—I put the number of the policy on the note— looking at the 5l note —I find the number 443116 on this note—that is the number of the policy put by myself—I gave a receipt at the time—I only remember the transaction generally—whether a man or woman paid it I cannot tell—it it my invariable practice to put the number of the policy on a note in the presence of the person who gives it me—I marked the change for the 5l note on the notice at the time—here is 4l 14s marked upon this notice—this is the receipt that I gave—it is my writing— This receipt was produced by Peak and was dated 30th Dec 1844 for the payment of 6s premium and duty by Mr William Onley on policy number 443116 and signed by the witness —this is the date the receipt was issued Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Are you sure you did not make any mistake in the number of the policy that you put on the note A I have every reason to believe not—there are six figures MATTHEW PEAK I am a police-constable acting at the General Post-office On the 27th of Jan I was in the Solicitor s office—the prisoner was there under an inquiry—he was asked where he lived—he said at No 15 Regent s-terrace White Conduit-fields—he was asked what rent he paid—he said 21l per annum—he was asked who insured the house and furniture—he said he insured the furniture for 100l at the Royal Exchange and the premium was 6s —he was then asked who paid the last premium—he said I did but then apparently recollecting himself he said Oh there is some mistake about that I lost my notice paper which was sent to me from the Insurance Office I mentioned the circumstance to Mr Wood the charge-taker that I had done so and that he did not know how he should get to know how to pay his insurance—he said Mr Wood advised him to take down the policy to the Insurance Office and the number would answer the same as the notice—he said that he did so and when he came there he found that the insurance was paid but by whom he could not say nor did he ask that two or three days after he received a letter containing the receipt which he showed to all the letter-carriers at the Islington district—he was asked to produce the letter and he said he could not—the Solicitor said that the insurance had been paid by a 5l note which was inclosed in a letter addressed to No 14 Upper Barnsbury-street Islington—he said he could not tell how that could be—he was about leaving the Solicitor s room when he said Can I see the gentleman —he was asked what gentleman and he said The gentleman to whom the letter was addressed —he was asked what he wanted with the gentleman and he said to give him the money if he pledged his bed for it—I then took him to my own house at his request rather than go to the station that night—in going along he requested to see a Mr Whitewick a lodger of his—I got a messenger to go for him and he came to my house—I told them I must notice all they said—the prisoner said to Mr Whitewick I want you to go to Islington you will be too late to see the man at the office go to No 6 Moon-street he will tell you where Spinks lives and Spinks will tell you where the gentleman lives who was to have the letter and get the money if you pledge my bed —they were about saying something else and I stopped it—I went to No 15 Regent s-terrace where he was living—I made a search of the house and found this policy which I have produced and this file of receipts—the receipts were at the top of a book-case and the policy I found in a drawer of the burem underneath the book-case—I returned to the office and the prisoner was given into custody Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was there any friend or adviser of the prisoner present when he was taken to the solicitor s office to be examined A No—Mr Sculthorpe Mr William Peacock and another gentleman Mr Phillips I believe were present—I did not caution the prisoner there—the conversation at the Solicitor s office did not take more than fire minute—it was before he and Mr Whitewick commenced conversation that I said I must notice what he was saying and when I found the conversation was against the prisoner I stopped it—I went to the prisoner s house and saw his wife—I produced the policy to her and said You paid this with a 5l note—she said Yes —I did not before she said so say It is no use your denying it for your husband said you paid it with a 5l note and it will benefit him if you can tell me the day upon which it was paid —I said nothing to that effect allow me to state what I did say it was something to that effect I said Your husband says that you paid the last insurance she said Yes I said With a 5l note she said Yes I said What did you do with the change she said Sir that was part of it that you saw when you were here before —I had been there on the 15th—it was untrue that the husband had told me this he had never said any such thing although I told her that he had—we are obliged to tell falsehoods to get truth I swear that and I could mention three cases that I have an object in now where I have got the stolen property—the prisoner s wife did not at first deny that she had paid the prennn—she answered me off-hand as I answer you—Mr and Mrs Whitewick were not present I swear that not during the conversation at all—Mr Whitewick never came in till Mrs Onley fainted away—she fainted away on a question I was asking her about the gentleman she paid the money to whether it was an old or young gentleman Q Will you persist in swearing that the prisoner s wife did not at fint say that she knew nothing about the matter and then go into a fainting fit and while she was in a half-insensible state did not you reiterate the question and was it not while she was in that state that she said Yes A Not at all—I swear that I speak the truth—I have been fifteen years in the police and never was contradicted before—I never told the prisoner s wife that it would benefit her husband—I told Mrs Whitewick that I wanted to get at the date—Mrs Whitewick came down and I said to her Mr Onley has sent me stating that Mrs Onley has changed a 5l note to pay the policy —Mrs Whitewick then said I recollect Mrs Onley going out clean one day —I then pressed her to get at that date—she and her husband had a conversation on it and came to the conclusion that it was on a day that her husband had a parcel sent from the country—I told the prisoner that his wife had admitted that the had paid the 5l note for the premium—he said Oh that woman will say anything to get me out of trouble and put it on her own shoulders MR SOLICITOR-GENERAL Q When had you searched the prisoner s house A On the 15th of Jan —I found about 4l 10s in a drawer William Wilkinson surgeon Samuel Gissing oil and colourman of No 40 Hamilton-row Bagnigge-wells-road William Simpson watch-manufacturer of No 6 Regent s-terrace Islington Frederick Barlow mrveyor of Gray s Inn-road Francis Hancock butcher of No 15 Copenhagen-street Islington and Thomas Hammond

Windsor—I there saw Julius Jonas who hai a brother in that way at Birmingham—I sent the stone and pencil-case to Jonas s brother at Birmingham by the post—when they were done they were to be sent either to me or to Benjamin Cohen a cousin of Jonas in London—soon after this I returned to London and saw Ferdinand Jonas on the 1st of Aug —he told me something about the pencil-case and stone in consequence of which I made a complaint at the Post-office—I am sure these are the articles I sent to Ferdinand Jonas at Birmingham Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q When did you complain at the Post-office A On Monday the 4th—the pencil-case belongs to the footman of a captain—I do not know his name—I only had it two days—I have not many such articles to repair and had none at the time—I had never seen them before—the brooch belongs to a servant girl at Feitham named Mary Ann—I call at houses for orders—I had the brooch also two days—it is a pebble stone and here is a mark a chip—it is not uncommon to see stones chipped—I am positive they are the same JULIUS JONAS I live at Mr Cohen s White-street Cutler-street Houndsditch In July last I was at Windsor and saw Blumantal—we lived in one room there—he showed me the stone of a brooch and a silver pencil-case which had no stone in the head of it—I saw him inclose them in a letter to my brother Ferdinand who was at Birmingham at the time Cross-examined Q Where did you see the articles A At Windsor—I was looking at the stone and pencil-case—he had jewellery in his box but I did not look at anything else—he showed me these—my brother being at Birmingham he wished them sent to him—nothing else was produced—it is a common stone and pencil-case FERDINAND JONAS I am a travelling jeweller and live when in London at my cousin s

Northampton—I found I should not get back to London so soon as I expected and sent them to my cousin Cohen in a letter directed to Benjamin Cohen 9 White-street Cutler-street Houndsditch London —I put both the pencil-case and brooch in the letter sealed it and took it to the post-office on Saturday morning the 26th of July between nine and ten o clock—I put it into the post-office before ten o clock—I cannot exactly tell how long before ten it was—I paid 2d with the letter—I am quite sure the articles produced are those I inclosed in the letter—I came to London on the Friday following and found my letter had not arrived—Leopold wrote the direction on the letter for me—he did not go to the post-office—I put the letter in directly after he wrote the direction—Thomas Morris mounted the stone in the brooch Cross-examined Q How came Leopold to direct it A I cannot write English nor read it after it is written—I did not look at the clock as I went to the post-office—I had never seen

of July and opened the Northampton day mail-bag that day—this bill came in that bag—the bag appeared perfectly secure sealed in the usual way—the bill contains the total amount of paid letters which came in the bag not the number—that would enable me to say if the proper amount of paid letters were in the bag—it was all right that morning—a letter for Houndsditch would go through the tunnel to the London District-office—I opened the bag between half-past one o clock and two in the day—a letter would be delivered in Houndsditch that day Cross-examined Q I suppose you have no distinct

standing next to me sorting letters about half-past six—he held a bundle of letters in his hand—I saw him put his right thumb over one letter feeling it to see if it contained money as I thought—in consequence of that I watched him—he placed that letter under the letters he held in his left hand—a letter-carrier sitting on my left asked me some question which induced me to turn round-when I turned to the sorting-table again the prisoner had left—I saw him going up the office and into the second office in which the water-closet is—I saw him go to the water-closet—he tried the door it appeared to be fast—he then came into the sorting-office again to his own desk—the name of his district was then called out by Mr Smither and the prisoner as was his duty went up—whilst he was gone I looked at the letters which lay on his desk—they were quite right—hey were letters addressed to his own walk—he did not take them with him—it was only the first part of the duty—they were separated ready for being taken away—I then missed the prisoner from the office—I went to the bottom of the office and found he had left the office—it is not a very long office—I went outside the office into the street—I went ten or twelve yards from the office towards the Golden-cross hotel—I saw him coming from that direction towards the office—he held some white paper in his hand—he was tearing it into pieces and threw the pieces into the road with his left hand—I said nothing to him—he passed me and went to the office—I proceeded to pick up some of the fragments ho had thrown away—I produced them to the officer—these which have been produced are the pieces—my examination of the pieces did not enable me to find out whose letter it was or where it bad been addressed—I took the pieces home and put them to-gether but could not understand them—I mentioned to my wife what I had noticed and next day or the day after I am not positive which I named it to Dolan who is in the same office—I did not show him the pieces—I told him what I had seen—the prisoner was taken into custody on the 17th—I preserved the fragments till then—they were produced before the Magistrate—I had been on duty the day before Monday the 3rd at the same place—the prisoner was there also—he and I assisted in sorting the letters that were brought from the chief office by the dispatch at four and a quarter to four—I did not on that occasion notice anything that attracted my attention Cross-examined Q Am I to understand that you told Dolan you had seen the prisoner throw the papers away A I am not positive that I told him that—I did not mention the prisoner s name to any one except my wife I did not mention his name to Dolan—it was only a case of suspicion—I did not paste the pieces together—I saw Mr Sculthorpe do so—they never went out of my possession—I kept them locked up in a box which no person could get at without breaking it open—it was on the Tuesday evening that I saw him fingering the letter and followed him out—I did not see what became of that letter after he had placed it at the bottom of the letters—he had it in his hand—I had a doubt whether the torn letter was one which had been in the course of delivery MR BODKIN Q What was it you said to Dolan A I told him I was convinced that there was one of the letter-carriers in our office not honest—it is so long ago I forget whether I said anything more—I said a good deal to him about it—I told him I had seen what had satisfied me but it was not sufficient proof I thought for the authorities of the office—I said that to him at that time DANIEL DOLAN I am a letter-carrier in the office at Charing-cross Abbott made a communication to me last Thursday fortnight Cross-examined Q Do you see him often A Yes—we frequently meet—I am on the same walk as he is but not at the same hour—I saw him on the Wednesday and on the Tuesday evening—it must have been six o clock on the Tuesday evening that I saw him—I saw him on the office then—I did not notice the prisoner there JOSEPH PARK police-constable F 124 I was on duty in the Strand during the first week of Nov —I know Abbott by having seen him—I remember seeing him one afternoon in that week picking up something opposite the Golden-cross—they were small pieces of white paper or writing paper—they were on the ground—the wind was boisterous and the paper was blowing about from one side of the road to the other—he was about three or four doors beyond the branch Post-office nearer Temple-bar Cross-examined Q You did not pick up any of the paper yourself A I did not JOHN ADOLPHUS GEORAGE BOUSTERD I acted as clerk to the justice on the examination of the prisoner on this charge—I took down from his mouth what he said on being asked what he had to say—it was read over to him and I asked if that was what he wished to say—he said yes— reading —The prisoner says I don t recollect whether I had such a letter in my hands—the sweepings of the office are swept outside the door Cross-examined Q Are you sure that was all he said A That was all he said—he did not say they had never come from him—if he had said it I should have taken it down—I am quite sure he said no more than I have taken down—he asked several questions of the witnesses—that was all if said in his defence—he asked the witnesses questions and commented upon them—that I have not got down WALTER ROBINSION SCULTHORPE I am one of the presidents of the Post-office I examined these Tragments of paper which were produced by Abbott—I put them together—some of them have been spoken to by the prosecuterix—I find here portions of two letters—one baa the name of A Williamson on it quite in a different handwriting MISS BUCKLE re-examined The name A Williamson on this paper if not my writing it formed no part of my letter to Mr Wilks GUILTY Aged 45 — Transported for Ten Years

CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution ELIZABETH EBHART I live at Cheltenham In June last I was staying at Exmouth in Devonshire —On the 25th June I sent a letter to my sister from Exmouth enclosing in it two small notes and a sovereign which I wrapped in a piece of tissue-paper—these are the notes that I enclosed produced and it was in such paper as this that I enclosed the sovereign—this is the envelope in which I put them—it is my handwriting—it is addressed to Miss Ebhart Chelsea College London —I sealed it and gave it to Thyrza Tar the servant to put into the post—my sister s names are Rhoda Mary Ebhart THYRZA TAR In June last I was in the service of Mrs Beacham at Exmouth —On the 25th June I took some letters from the drawing-room table one of them was addressed to Miss Ebhart—I recollect it perfectly well it was in the last witness s handwriting—this is the envelope—I put it into the post at Exmouth in time to go by the post of that day—I noticed there was coin in it—anybody could feel that WILLIAM STEPHENSON I am clerk in the General Post-office The prisoner was letter-carrier there in June last—on the morning of the 26th June I was in attendance at the time of the arrival of the Exmouth bag which was between half-past five and seven o clock—I opened the bag and deposited the letters on the table—in the course of business they would be carried from that table to another to be stamped—it was part of the prisoner s duty to take them to the stamper s table to be stamped—we opened twenty-six bags at that table—five persons were employed to carry the letters—the prisoner was one of them—he was on duty that morning—I saw him employed in carrying letters to the stamping-table Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What time did the bag arrive that morning A About half-past five o clock—I remember opening it—the prisoner was there when it arrived—I did not see him meddle with that bag further than bringing it to the place—it was sealed up then—there were five persons in that department during the hour and a half from half-past five to seven o clock—there are six persons in the first part of the morning but only for a very short time—no other persons would have access to the letters before they had gone through his hands—at the stamping-table there are the stamper and the person who takes the letters from him—six persons have access to the letters that is myself and the stamper and four others ROBERT TYRRELL I am one of the constables attending the General Postoffice On Friday morning the 26th June I was standing at the basement of the building to see what was going on in the water-closets this model properly represents the arch within which the water-closets are except that these round holes are a narrow wire grating so that nobody can see that anybody is looking through—a gas-light throws a light over the whole of the waterclosets and I could see everything that was going on—Peak was at the other grating—I had been on the watch for an hour and a half ever since half-past six and about eight o clock I saw the prisoner come to the second closet directly opposite me—the room was perfectly light I could see everything—I saw him enter the closet undo his things and sit on the seat—he remained there a short time and then put his hands behind him into his coat-pocket—he drew from his coat pocket a small piece of writing-paper which he dropped in front of him down the hole between his legs without making any use of it—he placed his hands into his coat pocket again kept feeling there some little time as if feeling for something and then he brought in front of him a piece of white paper rolled up small in the shape of coin he unfolded the rolls several times—I saw it was very fine paper—I then gave a signal to Peak—he took my position and I went round to the prisoner who was then in the act of putting his things up—I laid hold of him and asked what he had put dots the watercloset—he said Nothing but what I have been using —I searched him and in his waistcoat pocket found 18d in silver a few loose coppers in his trowsers pocket and a sovereign loose in his left hand breast coat pocket—I found a small canvass bag in his left hand trowsers pocket tied up closely containing a sovereign and 13s in silver—a plumber was sent for the watercloset was opened and I saw him take from the closet from the seat from which the prisoner rose this piece of tissue-paper from the basement and also this letter from the same place—there were no marks of use on them—one has the appearance of having been used—it was in halves but they are put together—part of the half seems to have been used—he certainly did not use the part that he put down in front of him—the tissue-paper was in one strip at the time it was found but it has got split—I told the plumber when he came to look for a fine piece of tissue-paper Cross-examined Q It is well known I suppose to the persons in the post-office that there are these holes A No—I have given that in evidence before but there has been no case since the prisoner has been appointed—we have no chance of catching any but those who have been recently appointed—I had been there since half-past six and had seen from two or three to five or six persons occupy this particular water-closet—no person had been to this one within five minutes before the prisoner—I do not recollect who occupied No 2 immediately before the prisoner—my attention had not been called to the prisoner particularly—he might very likely have gone there for the purposes of nature—I can scarcely tell—he sat long enough for that purpose—I cannot form any opinion whether be used any paper for the ordinary purpose—this piece of paper has soil upon it—I did not see the act of wiping his person COURT Q You did not see him get off the seat the whole time nor pot his hand behind him apparently for that purpose A No—the pieces he took from his pocket he dropped in front—I left him on the seat when I went round—when a person rises from the water-closet the water flows in MATTHEW PEAK I am an officer of the Post-office On the morning of the 26th of June I was stationed at one of the holes to watch—I did not tee the prisoner come to the water-closet—Tyrrel gave me a signal—I then came to the hole and saw the prisoner sitting on the seat in the act of putting small piece of paper in front of him into the basin—I then saw he had something of the appearance of coin in his hand which he immediately put into his left-hand breast pocket with his right hand—he had dropped the paper with his left hand—he then put his hand into his coat pocket pulled out a piece of paper and dropped that between his legs in front of him—he then put his hand into his pocket again pulled out a similar piece and part of an envelope he put the piece of paper between his legs and used part of the envelope for a natural purpose—as soon as I saw him put the paper between his legs I gave Tyrrell a nudge to go round and be went away—I saw the prisoner rise from the seat turn round and look down into the basin—I then went round found Tyrrell there and saw him take the sovereign from his right-band coat pocket WILLIAM BLACKBURN I am a plumber employed by the General Post-office On the morning of the 26th of June I was called to examine the water-closet—it acts of itself—the moment the weight of a person sits era it the seat jumps one inch opens a valve and water flows into the box at the bottom of the cistern and when the person rises from the seat the water rushes into the basin—I examined the water-closet in question and found two portions of a letter an envelope and a small piece of tissue-paper on the surface of the water—the basin does not contain water but the trap under neath contains about three quarts—there is no bottom to the basin—I took the papers out and handed them to the officer—there were several pieces of brown paper besides in the trap EDWARD CHURCHILL I am clerk in the inland office at the Post-office On the morning of the 26th of June I was clerk of the table where the letters pass from the table to the stampers—I saw the prisoner assisting to carry letters from the table to the stamper—this letter has never received the London stamp—it must have been taken between the period of its coming from the bag and getting into possession of the stamper—it has the Exmouth stamp MR ROBERT WILLIAM PEACOCK I am solicitor to the Post-office Edward Glennell Earl of St Germans was postmaster-general on the 26th of June GUILTY Aged

ATTORNEY-GENERAL with MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JAMES BALL I am a clerk in the London Docks and live at East India buildings Houndsditch On the 2nd of Sept I wrote a letter to my brother who was at Loughborough—I enclosed in it a printed card and a half-sovereign—I cut two pieces off the top of the card and one off the side—both these pieces of card were inclosed in the letter— looking at two pieces —they were in one piece when I put them in—it is the same card—I found this third piece in the house afterwards—I addressed the letter to Mr A Ball Leicester-road Loughborough Leicestershire sealed it and about fire o clock in the afternoon gave it to the servant to take to the post with 2d to pay the postage—the half sovereign was a new one a bright one—I did not observe what year it was—the girl returned shortly afterwards and brought back 1d Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You have had portions of the letter shown to you since A Yes not the whole of it but nearly all—this is it— looking at it —here is my writing on both portions—I wrote note-paper—here is part of the envelope which I addressed to my brother and part of the paid-stamp on it—this word happy is my writing EMILY WALKER I am in the service of Mr Ball On the 2nd of Sept I received a letter and 2d from him—I took it into the post-office at the grocer s shop in Bishopsgate-street after five o clock—the postage was 1d ADAM SCOTT I am a grocer and keep the receiving—house in Bishopsgate street—there is only one receiving-house in Bishopsgate-street—if a letter is posted with me after five o clock and before half-past it would go to the General Post-office at half-past five—I stamp all paid letters at my office—I have examined these fragments of a letter and can see my stamp here DANIEL DIXON I am a clerk in the General Post-office—a dispatch leaves the Bishopsgate-street office at half-past five—on the 2nd of Sept about 20 minutes to six o clock I received the half-past five dispatch from Bishopsgate street—it was sealed in a bag—I opened it to take out the letters—I found the paid-letters bill—there were ninety-five paid-letters—they corresponded with the bill—I put my signature to it—they then would go to the paid-stamped office to get the paid-stamp on them and after that to be sorted EDWARD HART I am clerk in the General Post-office The prisoner was employed there as a General-post letter-carrier and in the evening in the Inland office to clear the letters away from the paid-stamped table and carry the to a table to be sorted—he would have to do that from five to seven o clock—the half-past five o clock dispatch from Bishopsgate-street would come to the office where he was employed and he would assist in carrying them to the sorting-table—they would be despatched by the mails at eight o clock—this letter might come into the prisoner s hands—it would come to the table where he was employed with others—I have examined these fragments of a letter before and can trace the Bishopsgate-street stamp and also the paid-stamp made at the Inland-office—that does not indicate the date—the prisoner was on duty for he was taken into custody at the office at seven o clock that evening Cross-examined Q There were others employed at the same duty five others—other persons in the office might get to the letters certainly ROBERT TYRRRLL I am a constable attached to the Post-office On the 2nd of Sept about ten minutes past six o clock in the evening I was placed to watch the water-closets—I could see who went into the water-closets with out being seen myself—I saw the prisoner go into one of the closets about seven o clock—he put his things down and sat on the seat—I saw him place his hands in front of his trowsers inside—he kept moving them about and I heard the crumpling of paper—some footsteps approached—he took his hands from the front and placed them across his body-the footsteps ceased and he put his hands in the same position as before—there are no doors to the water-closet—it is not a thoroughfare only a passage—he put his hands as before—he then drew his body back so that the corner of the water-closet screened the upper part of his body from my view then brought his body for-wards and I observed him chewing something—I then went round to the privy—he was then sitting on the seat—I seized both his hands and said What have you got here —he struggled got his left hand to the side and threw something down the closet—I still kept hold of his right hand and from it forced this piece of card which I have produced—he said I have got nothing —I said No you have thrown it down the closet —I kept him on the seat searched his right-hand trowser s-pocket and found a purse containing two sovereigns—in his right hand waistcoat-pocket I found a half-sovereign loose—I also found a bag with 2s in it and some loose coppers in the other waistcoat-pocket—I sent for the plumber who held the seat down and I took the prisoner off the seat and desired the plumber in the prisoner s hearing to search the closet and take out all the papers—he did so—the seat is constructed so that on a party rising from it the water flows down—I saw the plumber bring from the seat these fragments of a letter and two pieces of card which correspond with the piece I found in the prisoner s hand—I received this long strip of card from the prosecutor—it corresponds with the upper part which he cut off—these smaller pieces of a letter were found close together as if they had been chewed but I have since opened them—on putting all the pieces of card to-gether it is nearly perfect—the plumber took his coat off put his hand down into the soil below the pan and the trap and found the paper among it—this is a printed card Cross-examined Q Were the whole of these pieces produced at the police-court A Yes the plumber found the whole of them in the prisoner s presence—I occasionally watch the water-closets—there are six water-closets—this was not the end one it was the first of four—there are three beyond it—when the prisoner came in the next seat to him was not occupied but the others I cannot speak of—anybody passing to the water-closets beyond where the prisoner was would have an opportunity of seeing him—nobody could pass the end water-closet—I had been watching three quarters of an hour and had seen several persons in the water-closets—I did not take notice of the number—I bad not seen anybody at this particular one that I recollect—it might have been so—I was not watching that one closet particularly—I should not think there were six or seven persons in that one—I do not think above six or eight came to the water-closets and there are ax closets—I did not watch anybody besides the prisoner in the closet—the water flows into the closet on a person rising from the seat HENRY BALL re-examined I put a printed card in the letter—it was a card about an asylum Cross-examined Q Did you use any blue ink in the letter A I think I did—this writing in blue ink is mine—I think I used both blue and black WILLIAM BLACKBURN I am a plumber employed at the Post-office On the evening of the 2nd of Sept in consequence of a message I went to the letter-carriers water-closet and saw Tyrrell the prisoner and Craddock who was holding the seat down as when the seat rises the water in the upper basin flows into the trap—his keeping it down would retain the water in the upper bason—the bason did not contain anything—it does not contain any water at all—I searched the trap and found these fragments of paper and two pieces of card which I handed over to Tyrrell—there was no other paper in the trap—it contains about half a gallon of water—the paper was floating on the surface—in the ordinary course unless the seat was pressed down what was in the trap below would go away—it remains in the trap till the water flows but on the party rising it flows into the drain—by keeping down the seat whatever was in the trap must have been from the person last using it Cross-examined Q Were the whole of the fragments found in the same part A They were on the surface—it was necessary to wash them and even now they retain marks of the soil—that is from my holding them—I was compelled to put my hand into the trap and that marked them—they were altogether with the soil in the trap—they could have got into the trap before the prisoner left the seat he need not have pushed them down he could hare dropped them down—I mixed them with the soil as I had to put my hand down among the soil—the soil was not dry—I took the closet to pieces before anything escaped—there was a fragment of paper in the trap bat not writing-paper MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q There is no valve at all in the bason A No anything dropped into the place would go into the trap—there is do bottom to the bason—it goes at once through a hole into the trap—a person might drop anything into the trap without sitting on the seat COURT to ROBERT TYRRBLL Q Is there always somebody watching the closets A No—I was placed there on this occasion—it is very rarely I am watching GUILTY Aged 37 — Transported for

prisoner being employed in the postoffice —Other COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL with MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution THE REV JOHN FLETHCER I live at Regent s-villa New Finchley-road On or about the 1st of Feb I wrote the letter now produced—it is addressed to Richard Hays Esq Secretury to the Clerical club 13 Henrietta-street Covent-garden —I enclosed in it check for 13l 2s 6d it was crossed and Co —I do not know whether I took it to the post or sent it by the servant—the seal is not in the same state now as it was then—it has been altogether altered—a few days after I called on Mr Hays and found he had not received the letter—I wrote nothing on the check—it was not drawn by me Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q The letter is dated the 1st of Feb 1846 A It was written in 1847 I am positive RICHARD HAYS I am Secretary to the clerical club Henrietta-street—I never received this letter or the enclosure for 13l 2s 6d—I first saw it on the 10th of March in the hands of the policeman WILLIAM CATLIN I am assistant to Mr Flemming a pawnbroker in St Martin s-lane—the prisoner has been in the habit of coming to our shop occs sionally—on the morning of the 10th of march he came and pawned this coat and a pair of sheers for 3s 6d-about an hour after he left I took the letter producer out of the breast-pocket of cot—it was in an envelope and had a check in it—the seal was broken as it is now—I put a mark on the letter and gave it to Inspector Pearce—this duplicate looking at one is the one I gave prisoner JAMES LEWIS ASHMAN policeman On the 10th of March I went with Inspector Cole in search of the prisoner and found him in the Strand—I showed him the letter produced which I had received and asked him how he accounted for its being found in the pocket of the coat which he had pledged that morning at Mr Flemming s in St Martin s-lane—he said he knew nothing of the letter but that he had pawned a coat that morning—I went to his lodging and found a quantity of duplicates and forty letters—I afterwards took him to the Post-office—he there stated that he had bought the coat the day before yesterday which would be Monday the 8th of a Jew in Compton-street and gave him 2s and a white waistcoat—I found no other coat like that at his lodgings Cross-examined Q Did not he say he did not know the Jew s name or where he resided A Yes—I had no further conversation with him at the Post-office—he separated the different letter found on him—I heard no Further conversation there respecting this letter WELCOME COLE I am inspector of Letter Carriers in the London District Post-office—the prisoner has been a letter-carrier nearly three years employed at the Branch-office Charing-cross—it was his duty to deliver letters in Covent-garden and that neighbourhood—if the letter in question was at the London District it would not be his duty todeliver it—it bears the mark of the old office—it was posted at St John s Wood and arrived at the chief office from there—it has the five o clock delivery marked on it from St John s Wood—it would be collected at St John s Wood at there o clock and arrive at the General Post office St martin s-le-Grand between there and five o clock—and be sent from there to Charing-cross and be sorted there to be ready for the five o clock delivery in Henrietta-street—it would not be part of the prisoner s duty to deliver it—his beat was next to the beat which included Henrietta-street but might very likely have fallen into his hand by mistake and if so it would be his duty to give to the party who should deliver it or to the inspector on duty—Inspector Pearce of the F division of police showed me the letter on the 10th of March and I went in search of the prisoner in company with Ashman—I have heard Ashman s statement of what passed—it is correct—I was present at the Post-office when the letter was shown to the prisoner and heard him say he had not seen it before that he knew nothing of it—he admitted pawning the coat—I heard him asked if it was not likely that such a letter might be sorted to his walk by mistake—his answer was Very likely —the prisoner was on duty at the Charging-cross office on the evening of the 1st of Feb and if in the performance of his duty he would have been there at the arrival of this letter in its due course he has signed his name as being present at that time Cross-examined Q I believe you found him in the Strand A Yes returning from delivering his letters—the moment I said I wanted to speak to him he said Very well and went with me to Southampton-street where I gave him to the policeman—he afterwards said he had bought the coat of a Jew whom he had frequent dealings with before but did not know his name or where he was to be found—there have always been many circularletters sent by the post MR CLARKSON Q Are circular-letters required to delivered as well as other letters A Certainly—those found wre addressed from the Taxoffice to various people in his walk COURT Q Why might the letter fall into hands by mistake rather than into the hands if the proper carrier A Henrietta-street being so near Covent-garden many of the sorters do not know the difference between one walk and the other—Henrietta-street belongs to Charing-cross walk—Covent-garden was written on the letter and he belongs to Covent-garden walk MR PAYNE Q Are not many persons present when these letters are sorted A Yes—they stand very near together at work but when placing the letter for delivery they sit down at some distance from each other HENRY FINLAYSON I am a cashier of Union Bank of London—this check for 13l 2s 6d is signed by Mr Colquhon a customer of ours—I remember its being presented to me for payment but cannot exactly say when—it was about a week before my attention was called to it—about a week before the prisoner was examined at Bow-street which was on the 10th of March—it had then the words and Co across it—I refused to pay it and wrote on it Crossed —I have no recollection of the person who presented it Cross-examined Q Had you fund to pay it A Yes CHARLRS PARTRIDGE I am a letter-carrier in the London District-office—I know the prisoner—I think I have seen him wearing this coat a fortnight before he was taken—to the best of my recollection this is the coat—if it is I am certain he wore it a fortnight before he was taken—it seemed not to fit him being rather too large Cross-examined Q You saw him wearing it one night I believe A That is all—I did not examine it—to the best of my recollection he wore a frock coat similar to this—I will not sweat this is the coat—I only saw it once and that was at night GEORGE MIDDLETON I am a letter-carrier in the same office as Partridge—the prisoner was my partner in the Covent-garden district I was ill on the 1st of Feb —I have seen him wearing a frock coat similar to this as much as two months before he was taken—it is rifle green THOMAS WELLS I am a letter-carrier of the London district On the 1st of Feb in consequence of the illness of Middleton I assisted the prisoner the whole day—I was present at one of the examination before the Magistrate—I was called up and shown the letter produced and did not recollect anything about it—I afterwards went to Mr Peacock to see the letter as I remembered a conversation between the prisoner and me about a letter which I thought afterwards was like this on looking at the letter—I remembered that at the five o clock delivery after he had done sorting I went to where he was sitting and began to set the letters in —I came to one read the direction and asked him where it was to go—he said That is not yours —I said Whose is it —he said I will take it —I know Henrietta-street it is not on our said I mean mine and his—I said But it is not in our walk at all —he said I am going there I will deliver it —he took it up—I recollect reading Secretary of the Clerical Club on the letter—I recollect it was at the five o clock delivery because I went that part of the ground at ten and five o clock and at ten o clock I did not attempt to set the letters and at five o clock I did Cross-examined Q What did you do at Bow-street that day A I had been delivering letter close by and knowing the prisoner s examination was coming off went in to hear it—they called me as a witness and showed me the letter—I did not look much at it—I said I did not know anything about it—the conversation was on the 1st of Feb and this was on the 16th of March—I said I knew nothing about it—I did not remember it at the time but on consideration I remembered what passed that day—I was only on with him one day—when the letter was shown to me I was taken by surprise and did not recollect it—I was nervous—I do not know that the prisoner was in the habit at times of hanging up his coat at the place where the letter were sorted at Charing-cross—I will not swear he never did it I do not remember it—he had a very bad cold that day Q Will you swear he did not leave the coat two hours in the office on Monday the 8th of March so that anybody might have put the letter in A I had nothing to do with him that day I do not believe he wore this coat at all that day but will not swear it—I did not see it—I did not go close to it and see the breast pocket—I am rather nervous now—when I went to hear him examined I hardly knew I had been on with him on the 1st of Feb —I went because I felt an anxiety about his being locked up—I never thought anything about the letter being in his coat pocket—after I was examined I tried to recollect all I could about the letter—I recollected something about speaking to him about a letter before I was out of the Court that day but not sufficient to go and speak confidently—I considered the matter over made myself confident and went to Mr Peacock next day—I spoke to Mr Cole first—the words clerical secretary on the letter were as plain on the 16th of March as on the next day but I had been on many different walks since I told the prisoner it was not in our walk at all and he said I will take it I am going that way but I did not think of that on the 16th of March—on my oath that conversation did occur—there might have been thirty men present is the office—the room is nearly as long as this Court and rather narrow—there were men near to me at the time I was sorting the letter but there is great noise and confusion there—they are all calling out and asking questions of one another—the check was for 13l 2s 6d drawn by G Colquhon WELCOMS COLE re-examined I have the book in which the men signed their names on the 10th of March—Wells was on the Strand walk on the 8th of March a man being ill—he was on the same walk on the 9th and 10th—he would be in the same sorting-room—he would sit in a different part of the office but they sort all at the same table— The prisoner here requested to be allowed to try on the coat which he did CHARLES PARTRIDGE re-examined To the best of my recollection seeing it on that is the same coat—he was sitting down when I saw it on—what I noticed was the tails—I said it seemed not to fit him—it was rather too large GEORGE MIDDLETON re-examined To the best of my recollection that is the same coat GUILTY Aged 27 — Transported for Ten Years 
t18470510-1175  1175 JOHN DENBY was indicted for that he being employed in the Postoffice did steal a certain letter containing 1 order for payment of 10l 19s 6d 1 order for payment of 7l 3s 1 order for payment of 6l 1 order for Payment of 4l 13s 8d 1 warrant for payment of 22l 3s 1 bill of exchange for payment of 10l two 5l Bank notes and six 5l promissory notes the property of Her Majesty s Postmaster-General —other COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution GRORGE KEMP WELCH I am cashier at the banking-house of Tice Welch and Co of Christchurch Hants—Rogers and Co are our correspondents On the 2nd of April I made a remittance to them by post—I enclosed in a letter checks Bank notes and securities to the value altogether of 110l and a few shillings—among them were the two 5l notes produced—one is a Leamington Bank note No 8836 and a Portsmouth branch Bank of England note No 03418 dated 27th of Oct 1845—here is another 5l Winburn promissory note which was also enclosed in the letter—it is dated the 11th of Jan 1841 No 4030—it is a branch Bank of England note—I sealed the letter and directed it to Rogers Olding and Co bankers London and gave it to servant Ann Luther with others to take to the Post-office—soon afterwards I received a communication from Roger s house in London in consequence of which I made a communication to the secretary of the Postoffice that the letter had not arrived Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you mark the notes A I took a memorandum of the numbers which I have here and find by that that these are the notes—I gave Luther no particular directions about this letter—it was on the day public humiliation MR BODKIN Q Was this letter a tolerably thick one with the enclosures A yes—neither of the other letters were so thick ANN LUTHER I am servant to Mr Welch On the 2nd of April he gave me some letters to take to the postoffice—I took them and remember one being a thick letter—I did not put that with the rest as it was too thick to go into the box but gave it inside to the postmaster Mr Pike—it was about five o clock in the afternoon—master had given me no particular direction about that letter ABRAHAM PIKE I am postmaster at Christchurch Hampshire A letter posted at my office at five o clock in the afternoon would arrive at the General Post-office the following morning—it would leave my place about five minutes before six o clock—I tied up the bag myself that evening enclosed the letters in it sealed it and delivered it to the driver of the mail with my own hands—I do not remember receiving this particular letter—if I did I am positive it was put in the bag Cross-examined Q You do not remember receiving any letter from the hands of Luther A No—I was in attendance at the office from one o clock till the mail was dispatched—nobody else was attending to the letters—every letter delivered to me I should put into the receiving-box where it would remain till the dispatch of the mail JAMES RUSH I am a clerk in the General post-office London On the 2nd and 3rd of April I was in attendance there—I remember the arrival of the Christchurch mail—I opened the bag on the morning of the 3rd at a few minutes past five o clock—it was sealed and in a proper state—I took out the letters sorted them and gave them to be stamped—they would then be distributed to be delivered ROBERT BAULDRY I am sub-sorter at the General Post-office—after that duty is over I deliver letters On the 3rd of April I was in attendance at the General Post-office—it is my duty to deliver any letter coming by the morning mail addressed to Rogers and Co —I delivered all the letters at their house which were given to me that morning JOHN OSBORNE I am one of the firm of Rogers Olding and Co On the morning of the 3rd of April I was at the banking-house and opened all the letters which came to the firm—there no letter containing remittances from Tice Welch and Co —we expected a remittance from them that morning and in consequence of not receiving it wrote to them by return of post Cross-examined Q Do you sleep at the house A No—I got there that morning about twenty minutes before nine o clock—the letters had arrived and had been taken in by one of the clerks RICHARD WHITE I am in the service of Mr Frazer a pawnbroker of Ipswich On the 3rd of April I was in the employ of Mr Dexter a pawnbroker of Whitechapel-road—between half-past nine and ten o clock that morning the prisoner came to the shop with a female and requested me to show him some chased keeper-rings—I showed him all we had—we had none small enough to fit the female s finger—he then requested me to show him those with stones in them—I showed him all we had—his wife selected one with a garnet or green stone or emerald—he then requested to be shown some pebble brooches which was done—his wife selected one for 18s —they paid 28s —a conversation took place about a key which was not bought—he took a 5l Bank of England note out of his trowser s pocket and gave it me—this is it— looking at No 03418 —I asked him his name—he said Willis —I asked him his Christain name—he said William —I asked him where he lived—he said No 14 Jubilee-street Stepney —I wrote on the back William Willis 14 Jubilee-street Stepney J C D my employer s initials 3—4—47 —Shortly afterwards I was applied to on the subject and gave a description of the party which was very fresh in my memory—on the 20th of April I came to London accompanied by Peak the officer and Richard Reaves—I went to Oxford-street Mile-end no great distance from Jubilee-street—when I got to the door Peak knocked—it was opened by a female the person who had accompanied the prisoner to Mr Dexter s shop—I saw her finger and the ring on it which I had sold her on the 3rd—I went up stairs and saw the prisoner in the act of jumping out of bed—I knew him directly—he is the man who gave me the 5l note—after the house was searched I saw the brooch which I had sold—this produced is it and this is the stone ring MATILDA FRESHWATER I am the wife of William Freshwater who keeps the Telegraph public-house Hawkins-street Mile-end there is a Derby sweepstake club held there On Wednesday the 14th of April about eleven o clock in the morning the prisoner came—I have no doubt he is the man—he asked if the Derby sweep was full—I said No —he took a chance in the 30s stake—there are different priced stakes—I made him out a card—he then took a 10s chance—that was a sweep also—I filled up one ticket for both—this is it— looking at it —it is a receipt for the money—he gave me a 5l Leamington note—this one No 8836 is it—I know it by the number and by the writing on it—I asked him his name—he said Williams —I wrote that name on the ticket—I said I did not like to take it being a country note—he said it was sent by a friend from Leamington to lay out in sweeps—I then took it—he asked me if he should sign at the back of it—I said Yes and gave it him to do so—he has written W Williams Leamington on it in blue ink—he asked me when it would it would be drawn—I told him it would be advertised in Bell s Life—I gave him 3l change and he went away—he said he would call next day and stake chances in other sweeps—he took the card with him not the ticket that was kept—he did not come next day—I did not see him again till he was in custody—there is stolen from a letter written on the note—that was not on it when it came to me RICHARD REEVES I am inspector of letter-carrier at the General Postoffice The prisoner has been employed there three or four years as a lettercarrier—he was on duty at the Postoffice on the 3rd of April at the time the general-post letters arriving that morning were being sorted for delivery—he was that morning on what is called the chance of the office—there are always a few men disengaged to take the place of men who are absent from illness—he was on duty that morning for a man who was ill—that man s duty was to deliver letters in Friday-street—the prisoner was on that walk that day—on the 20th of April I accompanied Peak to Oxford-street Mile-end and found this ticket on a dresser in the lower room Cross-examined Q What time did you see the prisoner that morning A He was on duty all the morning—I do not remember seeing him that morning in particular but his signature is in the book as being there on that date—the signature would be made about a quarter after five o clock—he has signed his name himself—that does not prove the time he came to the office—the book produced is not the one he would sign in when he came but the one he would sign in when called to go out—that was twentyfive minutes after eight—it proves that he was on that walk at twenty-five minutes after eight COURT Q Are all the letter-carriers in one room A There are two rooms and an archway from one to the other—the letters are sorted below by the sub-sorted and brought by a man to the letter-carriers to their seats—each man has his own seat for a walk—the letters are delivered by two people to different carriers—the carriers have no opportunity of taking the letters from each other—they do not help themselves MATTHEW PEAK On the 20th of April in consequence of what came to my knowledge I accompanied Reeves and White to the prisoner s house No 1 Oxford-street Mile-end—Reeves knocked at the door—it was opened by a female—I saw a ring on her finger—White said That is the woman who accompanied the man to our shop and said That is the ring it has got a green stone in it —I left her with Reeves telling him to take care of the ring—he afterwards produced it—this is it—I went up stairs and took the prisoner in charge—I told him it was for taking a 5l note out of a letter and that it had been changed at Mr Dexter s—I asked him if he had anything to say to it—he said no he had nothing to say—I then said I take you also into custody for taking a 5l note out of a letter changed at Mr Freshwater s and asked him if he had anything to say to that—he said No I have nothing to say —he was just getting out of bed and was putting on hi trowsers—I searched his trowsers and found in a purse 1l in silver and one sovereign and 6s loose in his pocket—I examined the bed-room and found in a work-box this brooch—I took him into the kitchen—the female was there—she upbraided him and went into hysterics—I took them both to Bow-street—as we went he said to the female It is hard for Mr Peacock to send you —I said Mr Peacock has a duty to perform —he said A wife is not bound for her husband s action —I produce four tickets which I afterwards found in the house they appear to have come from Mr William Willis and a memorandum book among other entries in which is one of the name of Freshwater and the sums paid for sweeps 1l 10s and 10s —the female was discharged as soon as she was in a condition to produce the certificate of her marriage—I have made inquiry at 14 Jubilee-street Stepney for William Willis—there is no such person there WILLIS CLARE I am assistant-inspector of letter-carries in the post-office I know the prisoner—I was at the post-office on the morning of the 3rd of April and saw the prisoner there—he should have been on duty at a quarter after five—I know his writing and find his signature in the book as having arrived at five o clock in the morning—in the interval between his arrival and the time he went out to carry letters at twenty-five minutes after eight he would have the opportunity of taking the letter in question—he was what is called a chance man and in the absence of Persons the regular carrier he was put on as a substitute—there is a firm of Rogers Olding in Lombard-street and Rogers Nephew in Friday-street district and it happens in sorting that letters get sorted to the wrong walk being directed only London —if this letter had been directed to Lombard-street this would not have occurred Cross-examined Q Rogers Nephew might have got this letter A It is possible—it might be delivered to them MR CLARKSON Q If it was sorted to Friday-street instead of Lombard-street would the man who had the Friday-street delivery receive it A Yes he ought not to have taken it out of the officer well knowing it was not in his delivery—it should have been given to the sorter to sort what we call blind letters—the dispatch was ten minutes after seven that morning—the prisoner may have had a morning duty in the Inland Office previous to that time—letters are brought to the carries by a person who signs for that duty but the letters in Friday-street are divided to two persons—he might have had this letter by its being mis-sorted—the letter are brought up and laid on the carrier s seats—the prisoner s seat was not near the Lombard-street seat—he would have been noticed if he went to the Lombard-street walk and took a letter—the only way I can account for his having it is the mi-sorting of the letter MR BODKIN Q Why should he be there at five o clock A That is the time for the carries to attend MR BALLANTINE Q I am told that Rogers Nephew always sent for their letters A I am not aware of that—there are a few parties who have their letters at the window MR BODKIN Q If he was there early in the morning what was he doing until eight A He would be in the Inland Office ROBERT CROSS Q I am barman at the Duke s Head public-house Whitechapel-road I was in a sweep—this 5l Winburn bank-note No 4030 I received with other bank notes and sovereigns from George Hawkes on the 17th of April Cross-examined Q You are a sporting gentleman A I have several sweeps—I am acquainted with matters of that kind—I know Hawkes—I do not know whether he is a sporting gentleman—we never bet together—I have betted with him—I thought you meant in partnership—I only know of his belonging to one sweepstakes—he is a letter-carrier—I am not in any sweepstakes at present—I have had several chances GEORGE HAWKES I am a letter-carrier in the post-office On the evening of the 17th of April I paid Cross 19l in three five pound notes and four sovereigns—there were two Bank of England notes and one country note—this Winburn note No 4030 is the country one—I received it form Mr Willis at the King s Head Newgate-street—I afterwards went to Mr Cross to ask to see the note—I wrote my name on it—it has on it the name of Samuel Day Whilmore —that was on it when I first had it—I know the prisoner s writing and believe it to be his—I have frequently seen him write Cross-examined Q Is that the only one you have of these notes A The only country note—I am in the sporting line on a very small scale if any—I have had a bet of a shilling or so—my betting has not been limited to a shilling—perhaps two shilling or half-a-crown—I have never gone higher than that—I have lost between twenty and thirty shilling to William Cross brother of the witness—I was at the post-office on my usual duty on the morning of the 3rd of April—I was present at the time the post came in from Hampshire—I am regularly on duty COURT Q What walk is yours A Mile-end—19l was paid for a 20l prize that was won by Bob Cross—I was commissioned by Cross to call for it for him—I have received it of Mr Willis MR BALLANTINE Q I believe you have been intimate with the prisoner A I have been intimate with him up to the time of his being in custody—I was a good deal about with him—we never had any money transactions together—I may have advanced him half-a-crown—I am still in the employ of the post-office—I cannot say whether he has or has not lent me money—I have not had bets with him over and over again—I think I recollect having a bet of five shilling with him once—my wages are 1l 5s a-week COURT Q You nothing to do with the sweep you went to get 19l for Cross A Nothing whatever MR CLARKSON Q How long have you been in the post-office A seven years I am on the Mile-end walk—on my solemn oath no letter addressed to Rogers Olding and Co ever came into my possession THOMAS LAURIE I am one of the partners in the firm of Rogers Laurie and formerly Rogers Nephews—we have a pigeon-hole in the post-office in which our letters are deposited—we send for them—no letter containing this remittance addressed to Rogers Olding and Co came into our hands on the 3rd of April COURT You have had occasional mistakes with Rogers Olding and Co A Frequently—their letters have come with our letters when we sent for them and we immediately send them to Rogers Olding and Co and they have sent us letters in like manner PHOBE✗ WILLIS I know George Hawkes On Saturday the 17th of April I paid him this 5l note—I had received it from the prisoner that morning—he gave it me for chances in the Chester cup—I desired him to write his name—he wrote something on it but I did not notice what he wrote—he did write on it and gave it to me—I had no other country note in my possession at that time—here is Samuel Day Whimore written on it—I paid it to Hawkes the same day—these tickets produced are for sweepstakes issued by us to the prisoner Cross-examined Q How many of these tickets do you issue A Sometimes one sometimes two it depends on the number of subscribers—I cannot tell how many we had for the Chester cup unless I look at the card—the number will be on that 26 —when the number is full we get others—we have other stakes—I believe the prisoner is the man who paid me the note but do not swear it—Hawkes is not the man—I knew him by sight—Hawkes has not been in the habit of taking shares that I know of except for Cross WILLIAM PARSONS I am a letter-carrier and sub-sorter in the General post-office—I deliver letters in Friday-street walk and in Walting-street where Rogers Laurie and Co are situate—I have very frequently seen letters for Rogers Olding and Co sorted to Rogers Laurie and Co not precisely Rogers Olding as I believe originally the firm was Rogers Toogood—I have frequently seen them in that name—if there is a mistake they are sorted to the blind sorted—on the 3rd of April I was away from the office through illness—I found on examining the books that the prisoner has signed his name as doing my duty WILLIAM DYOTT BURNABY I am principal clerk at Bow-street police-court—I acted in that capacity on the examination of the prisoner on the 21st of April—after the depositions were taken he was asked if he desired to say anything and was cautioned that what he said would be taken down in writing and might be used against him on a future occasion—I took down from his mouth what he said—I afterwards read it over to him—he signed it—there was a subsequent examination on the 28th of April—he was then asked whether he desired to say anything else—he said something which I wrote down read it over to him and he signed it—it is signed by Mr Henry the Magistrate—this is it—read— The prisoner says all I have to say is I am guilty of the charge my wife is innocent I told her I had the money left to me she was with me when I went to the shop to buy the ring and brooch — second statement read— The prisoner says I wish to contradict the statement I made on the former examination and to say that I am not guilty Charles Taylor builder of Moorgate-street and John Pincott of Merton gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 24— Transported for Ten Years 
t18470705-1643  1643 ABRAHAM THACKER and WILLIAM RINGROSE were indicted for stealing in the 23rd of June whilst employed under the Post-office 23 post letters the property of Her Majesty s Postmaster-general —2nd and 3rd COUNTS for embezzling and secreting the said letters —4th COUNT for secreting the said letters for the purpose of cheating and defrauding our Lady the Queen of certain duties of postage chargeable thereon MR SOLICITOR-GENERAL with MESSERS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM BOKENHAM I am the superintending President of the Inland department of the Post-office—the prisoner Thacker has been for some years in the service of the Post-office first as a letter-carrier and afterwards as a sub-sorter—he was a sub-sorter in the Inland-office on the 23rd of June—Ringrose was a letter-carrier in the 10th division in which Lower Thames-street is included—the walks are distinguished by numbers—Lower Thames-street is No 106 or 116 I cannot exactly say which—in the forenoon of the 23rd of June last an East India mail arrived—according to the practice of the office the letters coming by that mail would be in the course of sorting for the different divisions in the mid-day of the 23rd of June—as the letters arrive in the mass they are first of all divided into fifteen divisions numbered from one to fifteen—they are divided by sorting—the letters belonging to each division are sorted to each division—all the letters of the 10th division would be transferred to Thacker and he would then re-sort those letters at his table into the letter-carries walks—I cannot say exactly how many walks there are in No 10—I should say from ten to twelve—it would be the duty of the sub-sorter to divide the letters which he had previously sorted to his division to the separate letter-carrier s walks of his division—Thacker would stand those letters up on his sorting-table which bears the names of the different walks of which the division consists printed on the edge or back of the table—he would be on one side of the table and the general sorters on the other—the letter-carriers did not act as general sorters on this occasion—it is the duty of the sub-sorter to place a docket bearing the number of the letter-carrier and the name of his walk in front of each parcel of letters—he puts the letters for each walk separately and when the letters have accumulated to as many as can conveniently remain there he places them upright with a docket on them—they are then handed to the teller who sits at another table within a short distance—it is the duty of the sub-sorter to take them but occasionally in the press of business a messenger is employed and frequently the President himself does it—the teller would tell up the amount of postage charged on that batch of letters and enter the amount on the docket—they are then taken away from the teller by a messenger with the docket to a box appropriated to the walk to which they belong in the letter-carriers office which is the adjoining office but previous to the letters being placed in the box the messenger hands the docket to the check-clerk who enters the amount of postage in his book—the messenger leaves the docket with the check-clerk and places the letters in the box—at that period the letter-carrier does not see the docket—in the course of sorting the East India mail it frequently happens that there is more than one charge of letters taken to the box—the letters on which the docket is put are called a charge of letters—I do not know how many charges there were that morning of the East India mail for the Lower Thames-street division—supposing there were two the same ceremony would be gone through in each the letters being taken away from the table as they accumulate—when the charge is complete in the letter-carrier s office the duty of the carrier begins—it was then the duty of Ringrose to take the letters from the box tell up the amount of postage and report it to the check-clerk—he has no knowledge of the amount till he tells it up—he tells it up on each occasion when there is a charge to his box—if there were two charges he would have to make two tellings to enable him to know for the first time the amount of the charge—it is the duty of the letter-carrier when he has ascertained the amount of each charge to report it to the check-clerk to call it out to him—if the amount is correct as it appears on the docket returned to the check-clerk the check-clerk would hand the letter-carrier the docket and he would sign it and return it—he generally puts his initial—he then places it in a small box close by in front of the check-clerk appropriated for that purpose and that docket is afterwards retained as an official voucher—if the amount does not agree another clerk is called who is denominated the re-teller and he would be a sort of umpire between the telling-clerk and the letter-carrier—he decides the amount and then the carrier signs it if it is wrong he alters it—if there were two batches of letters carried in the course of the sorting of the mail to the Lower Thames-street-walk the letter-carrier would have possession of two dockets which he would place in the box—after he has arranged his letters he may have some letters mis-sorted to him which he would hand to the charge-taker and get an allowance for and other letter-carriers may have had letters mis-sorted to them intended for him which they would bring to the charge-taker—the charge-taker is the person who ascertains the aggregate amount of the different charges of letters that fall in his department—if there are two charges of letters they are put together and the whole amount is remitted to the charge-taker and then if a letter-carrier has had any letters mis-sorted to him he gets credit or debit on them and having ascertained the amount of the whole and the balance for which the letter-carrier would be responsible the carrier then proceeds to his delivery—the postage by the Indian mail is considerably higher than on ordinary letters and if people were mischievously disposed that would be the most convenient opportunity—the East India mail postage is very heavy—on this occasion the letters came through France—that makes the amount still larger—the newspapers are charged 3d each by way of France by way of Southampton they are free—the letter-carrier pays to the Treasurer or his representative every Monday Wednesday and Friday—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge whilst the letters were in the course of being sorted from that mail on the 23rd of June I placed myself accompanied by Mr Kelly another inspector and by Mr Playle an assistant-inspector of letter-carriers in a part of the Inland-office from whence I could see what Thacker was sorting—we were about fifteen yards from his sorting-table and could see it—I saw Ringrose there that noon—he was engaged at the newspaper business—he had nothing to do with the letters at that time—he was in the same room—I believe he was dividing the news-papers all I can say is that I saw him at work at the newspapers what he was doing with them I do not know—I should say he was about three yards from Thacker—at about a quarter to one o clock I saw Ringrose leave his newspaper business and go to Thacker s sorting-table—he leant over and spoke to Thacker—he then left Thacker and went into the letter-carriers office—I afterwards saw him go to Thacker a second time and saw Thacker pass some letters from the left-hand side of his table to his right which Ringrose took up and carried into the letter-carriers office—the Lower Thames-street-walk is at the extreme left-hand side of the table—Ringrose would have nothing at all to do with letters at that time—I afterwards saw Ringrose leave his newspaper duty again—he had a newspaper in hand—that was the third time I saw him—he took nothing away the first time—I could not see what became of him when he went into the letter-carriers office the second time—it was impossible he was out of my sight—I saw him go into the letter-carriers office—the third time when I saw him with a newspaper in his hand he went to Thacker s table again and just at that moment Mr Playle called out Good God he has given him them plainly enough —Mr Kelly made the same observation and they put their heads together before me so that I did not see this transaction so plainly but I saw Ring-rose s hand rise with pretty well a handful of letters under the newspaper—the exclamation was not made loud enough for the prisoners to hear it—I have no hesitation in saying that they were letters in Ringrose s hand—I saw them—the newspaper was not spread out it was not larger or so large as the letters it was a doubled up newspaper—Ringrose took the letters and the newspaper into the letter-carrier s office—I did not see Thacker give the letters to Ringrose in this case as I did in the former—I lost sight of Ringrose for about half a minute I should say or it might be a minute—I then saw him come from the letter-carrier s office with apparently the same newspaper and the same letters into the Inland-office—he went to the President on duty Mr Partridge and spoke to him and afterwards to a clerk named Whiting who took the news-paper from him and opened it—he gave it back to Ringrose who doubled it up again and then went back to the letter-carrier s office with the newspaper and letters—I saw no more of Ringrose till he was in custody—it was in consequence of directions that I gave that both Ringrose and Thacker were taken—it was after their duty closed—that would be after three o clock but I cannot exactly say of my own knowledge—it was certainly before four o clock—Ringrose was brought into Mr Kelly s room—Thacker was sent into my room—I had not then ascertained the amount of the charges of letters that would have properly come to Ringrose s hands but I accused Ringrose of having more letters than he had been charged with and directed his letters to be told up Mr Kelly and Mr Playle were present and several other parties but I do not remember who they were—I asked Ringrose the amount of postage he had been charged with and he handed me this pencil memorandum—I believe it is in his handwriting—he did not hand the paper to me—I cannot speak as to the gross amount of letters found on him—I can only speak to the letters that he had in his possession more than he was charged with—when I accused Ringrose with having more letters than he had been charged with he denied it—I had the letters told up and the postage marked on the letters also told and I found the amount was 2l 12s 11d more than had been charged against him—I knew what had been charged by having the book by me and from his own admission—I am prepared to swear that he had 2l 12s 11d more than he was charged with—I know that by the book which was at my side and which will be produced by another witness—Ring-rose named a certain sum but what it was I cannot recollect—there was a book before me which contained certain amounts with reference to the prisoner—I examined that book and then said You have 2l 12s 11d more then you have been charged with —he said he could not account for it—I then told him he had been seen to take letters from Thacker s sorting-table in the Inland-office—he afterwards admitted that he had done so but he did not think ha had taken so much—I told him he had been seen to do so twice—he said he had taken the 2l 12s 11d with he exception of 1s which might have been an error—those were his words—he said he did not think he had taken so much by a shilling that he had taken the 2l 12s 11d with the exception of about 1s —he then said he was very sorry for it and he would never do it again Q You said something about an error A Yes he confessed to stealing the 2l 12s 11d with the exception of 1s which might have been an error—that was not my observation—he used those words MR PARRY Q Did that apply to the transaction A No certainly not—he said that he had taken the 2l 12s 11d from Thacker with the exception of about 1s which might have been an error in his charge—those were his own words that is the 1s might have been an error MR CLARKSON Q Was that all that passed between yourself and Ringrose on that occasion A To the best of my recollection—I then went into Mt Kelly s room and Thacker was brought to me there—Ringrose was taken away into another room—Thacker was told that he had been seen to hand letters to Ringrose—he denied it and said if Ringrose had taken letters from his place it was without his knowledge and he said anybody might have taken them without his knowledge—from my observation on neither occasion could they have been taken away without Thacker s knowledge—when the first lot was taken away their hands must have touched—I saw Thacker give him the first lot Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q The letters come from the general sorters to the division sorters of whom Thacker was one A Yes—the letters which Ringrose took were laid flat in front of Thacker at the right hand side of his sorting-table not in the usual way on end—I should say this was a docket looking at one —when he sorts the letters he puts them up takes the docket out of a little box and puts in front—that is a signal that they are ready for the telling-clerk—the docket being placed before them is the signal if you call it so not without—it is the sorter s duty to take them to the telling-clerk although when pressed a messenger will do it or the President himself—the sorter goes on with his work and the proper person or anybody that may have to take them to the telling-clerk comes by and takes them—if we are pressed myself or any of the Presidents or anybody would take them to the telling-clerk—I do not mean anybody —if there is a press of business the messengers or the President an inspector or a clerk may do it—in the press of business an inspector might even direct a letter-carrier to do it—it might be so but I question it—they never have done so to my knowledge—I swear that positively—I have heard of it being done since this transaction—a letter-carrier ought not to be employed to do it—when we have press of business we are glad of anybody to assist another undoubtedly but they should be employed in their respective duties—if one had nothing to do we should be very glad of him to help another but not to do this—I was not aware of its being done until since this transaction COURT Q We want to know whether the fact is so because it is a very strange thing if one it to be a check on the other that you should get rid of the check by ordering the man on whom the check is to be to do it what have you heard about it A I have heard that an inspector having a press of business occasionally directs a letter-carrier under his own eye to take the letters—the inspector standing by would say Put over those charges to the tellet —that is not giving him a general roving commission—the inspector says to the letter-carrier You may take it MR HORRY Q In the press of business does not a sub-sorter some-times when he has a number of letter before him and is wanting to get rid of them tell a letter-carrier or anybody coming by to take them to the telling-clerk Q No—I positively say I am not aware of such a thing—I do not know of it—I might have said that at such times we are glad to get the assistance of anybody but I never referred to a letter-carrier most assuredly—there is a division between each sorter—there may be about thirty inches allowed to each sorter—I have never a known a man when he has so many letter as to impede his sorting call anybody that may be passing by to take some of his letters away that he may have the table cleared—I never knew anything of that sort occur—the Thames-street walk on the arrival of an Indian mail is rather heavy so that the tenth division would have a heavy morning s work—I really do not know that anything is meant by putting the letters flat—I have not risen from the ranks—I have not been an inspector—the imperfectly directed letters should be placed in a box in front of the sub-sorter—there is a box for that purpose—they are not laid flat to my knowledge—he place them in the blind box in front of him—he does not place them flat beside him on his right hand side to my knowledge—I do not know that his laying them flat on his side is a signal for them to go to the blind sorter—the practice according to my belief is that the sorter on the opposite side of the table takes the blind letters to sort—we call those blind letter that are imperfectly directed Q The blind sorter is the man that has to receive the letters that the sub-sorter cannot make out or addressed to firms such as Messrs Allen and Co druggists London A Yes—my impression is that from Thacker or from the district sorters the letter are taken by the general sorter generally—I am not aware of any blind man—I have described the practice according to the best of my belief—I am not aware of any blind sorter in the sorting of the town letters in the first instance—there is not such a man as the blind sorter among the general sorters that I am aware of there is not a blind sorter in the London delivery—there is I believe for the letters passing from London and I believe there are blind sorters in the letter-carriers office but I am describing the Inland-office—what passes in the letters-carriers office is an after process—I think there is a person of the name of Sims in the Inland-office but I really do not know him—I have 762 men under my control and it is impossible for me to know them all—I think there is a man of that name but whether he is a letter-carrier or a sub-sorter I really do not know—there was a clerk of that name but he has left—I cannot say that Sims duty is to sort imperfectly addressed letters—other witness will give you all this information—my duty is the superintendance of the others—I cannot enter into these minutes points COURT Q The letters that come to Thacker s table have been previously sorted by the general sorters A Yes—they would detect the blind letters—still occasionally some might slip in which Thacker would put into a box in front and the general sorter standing on the other side if the table would take them out—they are in fact the blind sorters MR HARRY Q When a sorter does not know where a firm lives when a letter is addressed merely London what does he do with it A He sorts it to the book-officer in the letter-carriers -office and he looks to the book to see what the address is—I do not know that the letters laid flat are for the book-officer or for the blind sorter—I am not aware of any letters being laid flat on the sorting-table—I do not think that letters called callers are put down flat by the sub-sorter—If a number of letters come to one firm I do not think they are laid flat for convenience and kept out of the general charge—the telling-clerk sits a little way from the subsorter and according to the ordinary course of business these letters will pass over to him—he tells there up rapidly makes out the amount and hands it to the check-clerk who sits above him the letters are placed in the letter-carriers box and the letter-carrier puts his initials to the docket—if he finds out an error after he has gone out of the office and after the delivery it is his duty if he is an honest man to come back again and rectify it but I am not aware that I ever heard of such an error—if he has letters mis-sorted to him he brings them back and has the allowance made for them—these letters are handed over to the proper letter-carrier and the proper letter-carrier is then charged with them—he is charged with the letters delivered to him from other letter-carriers and discharged from these which he has delivered over to others Q Suppose the carrier has got his letters he has to go over then hurriedly to check the telling-clerk and having done that in going out of the office he finds that all three parties have made a mistake A I am not aware of such a thing—I thing such a fact if it ever happened would come under my notice—it would be a most extraordinary case—there is a letter-carrier of the name of Hodge—I know him very well he is a very honest man—I have no knowledge of a mistake being made with him a long time ago and his coming back an accounting for it—there are papers for the President to rectify such errors when the man comes back next morning—this paper looking at one is not a President s paper but it is very similar to it—this is the charging of the mis-sorted letters—it is a very similar docket to the one to which you are alluding—a carrier has no opportunity whatever of correcting that error till the next morning—Hodge might there would be opportunities but I should say the next morning would the be the time—it would then be his duty to come back and to claim back the reckoning if it was under or if he had received too much to pay it over to me—I have know knowledge of the President making a memorandum to that effect in any case—such an occurrence would be most extraordinary—I never heard of a mistake being made by the check-clerk telling-clerk and letter-carrier—I know Hodge perfectly well but am not aware of such a circumstance happening to any one Q I believe there have some rather heavy charged preferred against yourself A I have been charged with tyranny and something of the kind but nothing beyond that that I am aware of—I have had a copy of the charges against me but they applied more particularly to Mr Kelly I believe then myself if you will describe the charges I shall be most happy to answer them—they were preferred by some disaffected men in the office section—the charge came from the letter-carriers—I know a man of the name of Gallin—he is subsorter to Brandon—the charges applied to Mr Kelly rather then to myself—one cause of complaint was the Post-office Directory being in the office—the men in the office have never complained to me personally that they were worked improperly on account of the Directory—they presented petitions for the Postmaster-General—I have forwarded their petitions—they have complained that I had not done so but I deny it—it was not a general complaint in the office that the letter-carriers were obliged to work excessively on that Directory—it was the complaint of a section—it was left to the option of the letter-carriers whether they would work on it or not and I think only eleven out of a body of about 300 declined working on it—a section of them have complained of being oppressively worked on the Directory—I am not aware of fifty or sixty—I should think 160 were examined on the subject—there is no investigation going on at the Post-office into my conduct—a charge have been brought but it has never been investigated—I unhesitatingly swear that my conduct has never been investigated—I will not swear that my conduct has not been impugned—I was charged with using foul and I think abusive language to the men—I was charged with the having threatened to punish those who would not work on the Directory and I would have punished them because it was part of their duty by the Postmaster-General s order and I would have carried it out precisely the same as I would any other duty—the Directory is now entirely a private speculation—it was demi-official—it was acknowledged by the Postmaster-General—it has been so ever since Mr Kelly has had it—I really cannot tell you when it ceased to be so but I think within the lost three months—since this investigation Government has ordered it to be removed from the office—it has been discontinned—I have been ordered many times to make a return of the persons employed in the office—I might have been ordered to do so about the 7th of August 1844—at that time the Directory was considered a demi-official publication inasmuch as the Postmaster-General ordered the men to work at it the same as they would at any other portion of their duty Mr Kelly when he entered office was compelled by the Postmaster-General to purchase it of the previous inspector—I was in office then but I was not Mr Kelly s superior officer—Mr Critchett was the previous inspector—I did not know that he paid every one of the letter-carriers employed on it—I know Mr Kelly has paid them precisely the same as Mr Critchett did—I cannot say when the Government order was made for discontinuing the Directory—it was about three months ago before the 22nd of June—I was present at a portion of the investigation when the parties were examined—my name was not mentioned in the charged that was gone into—I did not say that Mr Kelly could do nothing without me—in common fairness I beg the charge may be read—an investigation was ordered by Government at my request—charges were brought forward against me in conjunction that had taken place at my request—Grapes said I can prove that Mr Kelly s Bokenham has threatened to punish those who neglected to attend to Mr Kelly s instructions respecting his work and I would have done so but that charge has never been investigated—some persons said that the Directory was an impediment in the way of public business—I did not think so myself that is a point I never admit—my impression is that the delivery of letters was never delayed five minutes by the Directory but rather accelerated COURT Q The Directory gave persons the means of knowing where letters were to go A It did MR HORRY Q On your oath did you not say that you would kick all dismissed for tempering with one of these witnesses and trying to get him to withhold his evidence—he was dismissed on Saturday night—I shall not say who told me of his tempering with the witness—it was on the report of some-body—it was afterwards investigated by the Postmaster-General the solicitor of the Post-office and Colonel Maberly without either myself or Mr Kelly being present and his Lordship from his own observation dimissed Grapes without referring to me at all—I did not know of his dismissal and did not recommend it—I have recommended a person named Last for promotion and he is now I believe the junior inspector—he has not to my knowledge been repeatedly accused of improper conduct in his situation he has not to my knowledge gone three times through the Insolvent-court—I do not know that I was asked to make a report in April last on the subject of the disaffected men— looking at a letter —I put down the names of certain persons here as disaffected persons—the name of Thacker is on the list—I do not think Thacker gave any evidence against me—if he gave evidence twice against me it is in that book—I do not think he gave any evidence against me—that was an investigation at my own request—I reported upon it to Colonel Maberly but I am not aware of any charge against me with respect to that—charges were made against me and others in an obscure newspaper of which you Mr Horry were sub-editor—the names of Grapes Ferguson Potter Aldridge Ridout Mitchell Rail Bird and Mantel are on this list—Grapes was most properly dismissed—I cannot say that Ferguson has been suspended—I have no recollection of reporting him myself—Potter is still in the office and so is Aldridge and Ridout—nothing was done to Ridout—I am not aware that he has ever been suspended—Mitchell has been dismissed and was appointed to another Government situation shortly afterwards—he was not dismissed by me he absented himself from duty and was dismissed for being impertinent to his superior officer—the matter was inquired into—I do not know of my own knowledge that he has obtained another situation under Government—you tell me so and I would not doubt your word—Rail is still in the office in his situation—he has not been punished that I am aware of—Bird is still in the office and Mantel also—he has been kept back from promotion—he has been ten or twelve years in the office—he was kept back from promotion on my recommendation because he would not tell the truth and I was determined that I would not recommend a man that would not tell the truth—a man had been suspended by the Postmaster-General the disaffected parties set his Lordship s order aside by making up hid pay to him Mantel was proved to have collected this money to make up the pay he afterwards declared that he did not recollect collecting it he eventually admitted that he did but could not say from whom or to whom he gave it although he admitted making a memorandum of it at the time upon that I said to the Postmaster-General that I could not rely upon his word and therefore I could not recommend his promotion Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q When you and Mr Kelly were watch-ing what distance were you from the sorting-table A Fifteen yards—I have had it measured since—the sorting-table is a division of a long table with person standing on each side of it the general sorters on one side and the district sorter on the other—I do not think there were so many as ten or twelve sorter—I should say about four on one side I cannot say how many on the other there were several—there were a great many persons about—there was not one on each side of Thacker—Thacker was at the extreme end of the table—No 10 is at the extreme end—he had only a person on one side of him—there was no other business going on in the tenth division be-sides the sorting of letters at that moment—they were working off the East Indian Mail—the tenth division as regards Thacker applies to a place about thirty inches wide—the room itself is four times as large as this Court—noting was going on in the room at this time with the exception of getting rid of the East Indian Mail stamping letters sorting them telling them up and so on—Ringrose was engaged with the newspapers that had arrived by the Indian mail but I do not know whether he was sorting them or what he was doing with them—I thought he was dividing the town from the country—he was arranging them in some way—that was his duty that morning it was part of his duty as a letter-carrier—it is generally done and it was his duty that morning—sorting and arranging is part of a letter-car-rier s duty—they are occasionally employed in sorting newspapers and letters to learn the sorting there are a certain number of letter-carriers who are ambitious of becoming sub-sorters and they take every opportunity of learning the sorting—it is by permission that they are put in—it is not any one that can walk in and do it—I employ them in sorting newspapers for the purposes of the office—it is part of the ordinary duty of a letter-carrier who may be directed to do it to sort letters for the country not for London—it is not done as part of his ordinary duty—he is directed to do it by his superior officer most likely by the clerk who has the direction of the letter-carriers—if he refused to obey it would be considered a breach of his duty—he does not do it unless specially directed and I do not specially direct all of them—there is no special direction in writing—letter-carriers are also employed as stampers to sort newspapers tie up bags and carry them out of the office—I do not recollect anything else—they work hard enough they have quite enough to do—there is no skylight in this room—there are windows at each end but it is badly lighted—errors are frequently made in calculating the potage of letters—I saw Ringrose go into the letter-carriers office and return from there—I was not close enough to see what letters he had—that was about a quarter to one o clock—I did not afterwards lose sight of Ringrose for two hours—I think it was about a quarter to one that the first transaction took place and it was about twenty minutes after one that the second took place—I then lost sight of Ringrose—I was called away indeed I left the place altogether upon other business but I gave directions for him to be stopped and did not see him again till he was in custody—the third time of his going out was twenty minutes after one and he was in custody about half-past three—he went to Mr Partridge the President on duty and also to Mr Whiting the clerk—Mr Partridge was directing the general business—the superintending-president s is a distinct office—he has the control of the President—I do not think Mr Whiting was acting as a teller—it would not have been an impropriety in him so to act—to a stranger there would appear to be noise and bustle in the room but in reality there was none—there was a good deal going on moving of arms gestures and people passing to and fro—I should say from sixty to 100 persons were engaged on the Indian mail—I was not conversing with Mr Kelly while I was watching—we were anxiously looking—my attention was disengaged by some exclamation made by Mr Kelly—both Mr Kelly and Mr Playle spoke to me in whispers while we were watching and Mr Blott came and rapped at the door and said Colonel Maberly wanted me—no one else knocked at the door or called my attention off in any way while I was there COURT Q How long were you out A I was absent at one time I should think three-quarters of an hour on an hour—we had a Parliamentary Committee sitting and I was called away to furnish materials for it—I returned to the watching after that hour—I left two or three times and was absent perhaps from five to ten minutes—neither Mr Kelly or Mr Playle were absent while I was there—I was not superintending the Indian mail—that is the duty of the president—I had the general business of the office to attend to and payments and other papers to sign and different things—I did those things during the intervals of my going back wards and forwards—I only left the place when it was absolutely necessary for me to do so—the Parliamentary Committee had no reference to myself at all—it was no the revenue department of the Post-office Q Supposing an error occurs in these calculations that would be a fault for which a letter-carrier or teller would be liable to censure or reprimand A No I think not for an error in charging unless it is repeatedly done then of course I should censure the party—errors are frequently made—some tellers will tell the whole of their charges from the morning and not have as error others will have two or three—the teller would be within three yards or less I should say of the tenth division sorting place—there was a teller there but I do not know who he was—the letters have since been delivered but a great many of them are here—the letters I saw were the letters that Ringrose had in his hand—it was his duty that morning to deliver the portion of the India mail for Lower Thames-street—that was his walk and he ought not to deliver letters belonging to other walks—in the event of a man being ill on a particular walk another might then take the walk but that is an extreme case—it dose occasionally happen in cases of emergency that letter-carriers to whom a walk is assigned deliver letters in another walk and letters sometimes get into the hands of carrier by accident which do not belong to his walk—it is then his duty if he discovers it before he leaves the office to transfer the letters to the charge-taker who will allow him the postage on them—if he continue the error outside the office it is then his duty after he has finished his own delivery to go to the place and deliver the letter he has taken out in mistake whatever the distance may be Q You say you have been charged with using abusive language has that been a repeated charge A No certainly not—I think there was only one man said I made use of it on two occasions I believe—neither Ringrose or Thacker ever charged me with it MR SOLICITOR-GENERAL Q Did you look at all the letters found on Ringrose when he was brought into the room A I did not look at all of them—they were placed before me—I read some of them so as to know the addresses—all that were found on him were within his own walk as far as I know although more than he had accounted for—it is my duty to report men in the office for good or bad conduct—I had named Thacker in 1846 as a disaffected person—in my judgment it was my duty so to do—I have not the slightest ill-will towards him—I cannot possibly have any FREDERICK KELLY I am an inspector of letter-carriers in the Post-office I was there on the 23rd of June when the Indian mail was being sorted for delivery—I was with Mr Bokenham and Mr Playle stationed in a part of the Inland-office where the letters were sorted—Thacker was at that time sorting the letters of the tenth division—I was so placed that I could command a view of the position that Thacker was occupying—I observed the other prisoner Ringrose employed in dividing the town newspapers from the country—that was at quite a separate table from Thacker three or four yards from it—I began to watch about a quarter to twelve or from that to twelve o clock—about a quarter to one o clock I observed Ringrose leave his duty and go to Thacker and speak to him—he then went away and retruned to his own duty—in a few minutes he went up to Thacker again—he stood at right side—at the moment of Ringrose s coming up Thacker was sorting letters he had letters in his left hand and was sorting them with his right—I observed his right hand pass from before him to the end of the desk where Ringrose was standing and put some letters into Ringrose s hand which Ringrose immediately took into the letter-carriers office that is perhaps six or eight yards off—he was out of my sight when he got into the letter-carriers office—it is a compartment of the same office but is separated by a wall and you have to pass through large door-ways with arches—he went through the arches quite out of the place—the inland office is a long office consisting of several divisions called the sorting office the inland office and the letter-carriers office—the letter-carriers office may be considered part of the inland-office but we call them distinct office—when I speak of the inland-office I mean the office in which the sorting takes place—Ringrose went into the letter-carriers office and went out of my sight—I should say he was absent two or three minutes three minutes would be the very utmost—I them observed him return and immediately go up to Thacker speak to him for a very short time and then go away to the newspapers again when he went out he had the letters in his had which he had received at Thacker s table when he returned he had nothing he remained at the newspapers some eight or ten minutes I did not notice the time particularly—he then went into the letter-carriers office again as well as I remember but my attention was particularly on that spot where Thacker was and I saw Ringrose then come up to that place the same place where he had had the other letters at the right side of Thacker with a newspaper in his left hand—it was folded up—I then observed Thacker give him several letters which he immediately put under the newspaper—I cannot say positively that it was a newspaper but I have no doubt that it was it had the appearance of one—he then left Thacker and went into the letter-carriers office—he returned I may say instantly—on his return he walked about the inland-office with what appeared to be the same letters and paper—I saw him with them in his hand he spoke to Mr Whiting and Mr Partridge who was the President on duty—I think both of them took the newspaper out of his hand I know Mr Partridge did—he opened it—I cannot say positively whether he gave it him back—after that he went into the letter-carriers office with the newspaper and letters—the table at which the sorting took place has a board under the sorter marked with lines and inscribed so as to show where the letters belonging to particular walks should be placed—the Lower Thames-street walk would be on the left hand side of the sorter—the end of the table at which Ringrose was sitting was about three feet or less than that from the spot appropriated to the Lower Thames-street walk—I was present when the prisoner Ringrose was brought into my room—that was between half-past two and a quarter to three—I asked him whether the letters then in his possession were those which had arrived by the Indian mail of that day—he said they were—he had them in his hand tied up in a bundle what we call set for delivery so that the letters would follow at the houses as he would arrive at them—I asked him what his charge for the day was and he produced a piece of paper and read from it the amounts which I at the time took down—he said there had been two amounts charged to him making 4l 18s 5d —this is the paper he produced and read from—having the paper in his hand he read 3l 0s 2d and 1l 18s 3d making 4l 18s 5d —I asked him as to the changes as they are called—he said 5s 2d had been added for letter that had been mis-sorted to other letter-carriers and which were found to belong to him—he did not explain that at the time because that was what we understood that made 5l 3s 7d and 1l 2s 10d had been allowed to him making his net charge 4l 0s 9d —I asked him whether the letters in his possession would amount to that and he said he believed so—the letters were then re-told in my presence and found to amount to 6l 13s 8d —I did not tell them myself the amount was told by Mr Brodie I think and Mr Playle—Ringrose himself looked at what was going on—it was dome quite in his presence—the amount was 2l 12s 11d over the amount that he had been charged—he was asked to account for that and he said he could not—he was then told that the circumstance I had mentioned had been he witnessed that Thacker had been seen to give him these letters and that he had been seen to take them away—he said yes he was very sorry for it but he did not think that what be had taken amounted to so much—he was asked whether he had taken all these letters in that way to the inland-office and he said yes he had unless it might have been a shilling or so mistake in his charge meaning too large amount—he said he would never do so again—I cannot speak of my own knowledge as to whether the letters which had been set for delivery were letters all within his own walk—he said nothing about it—there is a postage of 3d on newspapers arriving from India—there were some newspapers among the bundle of letters he had to deliver—I made no calculation to see whether the postage of any of letters or newspapers would amount to 2l 12s 11d —there was no one letter the postage of which amounted to 2l 12s 11d —I cannot say positively but I am quite certain from the size of the letters that no one letter was charged that amount—still I did not look them all through and cannot speak positively to that—Ringrose was then sent away and Thacker was brought in—he was told that he had been seen giving these letters to Ringrose and that on telling Ringrose s letters a surplus of 2l 12s 11d had been discovered—he said he knew nothing about it he had not given any letters to Ringrose that if Ringrose had taken the letters it was without his knowledge and that he should have permitted Ringrose or any one else in the office to have taken any of his letters unquestioned if he had observed it he should not have prevented it—it would not be possible according to the regular mode of proceeding for any number of letters intended for Ringrose s walk to be properly at the right hand end of the table—I have been in the Post-office twenty-eight years—according to the practice and mode of doing business it could not happen that the letters intended for the Lower Thames-street walk could be at the right hand extremity of the table if the sorter had sorted them according to the labels to the properly appointed places—no one would have authority to take these letters away or to interfere with any letters except those that were put up in parcels and had a docket in front of them and then they would be put on the teller s-table for the purpose of being told Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q If a sorter finds letters imperfectly addressed what does he do with them A He would put them on his right hand—he usually lays them down flat—they are then passed over to another sorter—it is understood that it is a signal that they are letters for the blind sorter—it is understood that that they mean blind letters improperly sorted or imperfectly addressed and to be passed over to be re-sorted—during the press of business consequent upon the arrival of an Indian mail the sub-sorter is sometimes incommoded by the number of his letters—it is then his duty to put a docket on those letters and to pass them over to the telling-table—I should say it is the sorter s own duty to hand over his blind letters—the blind sorter is just on the opposite side—I observed Thacker pass some letters over to a man on the opposite side who I have no doubt was the blind sorter and they were sorted by him—I observed Thacker do something of that sort according to the usual practice—the man sat just on the opposite side of the desk—it happened so that morning—he is not properly a blind sorter but he is a man that re-sorted the miss-sorted letters to Thacker as I understood from his position—the course is this on side one of the table the letters are sorted into the divisions one of which was the tenth on Thacker and the letters Thacker had miss-sorted to him he would pass over in the first stage of sorting that they should be re-sorted but the man is not in any sense a blind sorter—if a letter had such a direction that he could not tell to what division it belonged he would pass it to the original sorter and it would go from him to the book-officer if he employed a stranger to take those letters to the sorter he would do wrong—I am not aware of its being commonly done in the press of business—I have never heard of such a thing—instead of doing that he should hand them to the person opposite—there is no officer called the blind-sorter—there is a man who would sort them as far as possible—when letters arrive at the sub-sorter s not properly addressed he hands them up to the re-sorter to be re-sorted and if he cannot find out into what division to put them then he puts them into a charge called the book-officer s charge or blind charge and they search out the right address—a letter directed so badly as not to be read would not be sorted to Thacker it would be stopped at an earlier stage—the first sorting is the general sorting—they all come out of sorts and are thrown down on the table and placed in rows—the general sorter has to sort them into divisions—a letter so imperfectly addressed would not be sorted into any division—it might happen by accident in the hurry of business—letters are sorted into different divisions—when the sub-sorter comes to sort those letters in the usual expeditions manner and cannot find out to whose walk they should go he would put them down on his right-hand side and pass them to the sorter on the opposite side who is sorting the first-stage to re-sort—he puts them on his right side until he has a convenient opportunity of passing them over to be re-sorted instead of passing over every letter as he comes to it—if business is heavy it is important to him to get off the letters as quickly as possible—he would not say to anybody coming by Take these away for me when he is himself so say near the man that by just leaning over and passing his hand over he could reach him—such letters would go back to the general sorter who would re-sort them—the sub-sorter puts them over on his right side until there is a sufficient number for a parcel—I should not understand that as a signal to anybody coming by to take the letters up—I should say if a sorter having unpaid letters so placed saw any person take them up it would be his duty to see what his object was in taking them—they are put there for the purpose of going to the general sorter—no one is authorized to take the letters away to be blind-sorted except the President on duty or one of the inspectors—I have seen it done except by one of those officers—I never saw a letter-carrier do it—a sub-sorter would not question a superior officer if he saw his letters taken away—it is prima-facie wrong but if he saw it was his superior officer on duty that did it he would then suppose all to be right—I have seen the inspector take letters in that way from the sub-sorter—if a sub-sorter finds he has got a dozen or twenty letters for one firm I should say that they are stood up on the right hand—a docket would be put to them by the sub-sorter before they were taken from him and they would be told as a separate charge—I believe there are very few such cases—I doubt whether there are half-a-dozen—their being put on the right or left hand would depend on whether the sorter was right-handed or not—if we had a left-handed sorter the probability is he would put them on the other side Q There have been and are a number of charges pending against you I believe A I am not aware of any charges pending against me—somcharges have been preferred partly examined into and as I believe abandoned because I heard myself the man who made these charges decline to go on with them—I am the proprietor of the Post-office Directory—I believe the grave charge was that I made a false return to Parliament of the profits of the Directory which on my oath was a false charge and I now state that my return was entirely true—the Directory is not carried on in the Postoffice now—I am forbidden by Government to do it—the Directory is a list of the names of the merchants and traders of London arranged alphabetically and in divisions—it was not supposed to be inconsistent with my public duties that I should be engaged in a trade—it is now my private property—I consider the removal of the Directory from the Post-office to be greatly for my individual benefit—I kept it in the Post-office because I did not like to sacrifice the interests of others—one of the charges was that the Directory was said to have impeded the public service—I did not have a copy of notes of all the evidence that was taken by the shorthand writer—I got from Mr Peacock copies of the notes of the evidence given on the investigation—I did not get all the evidence—I got that part of it which the authorities expected me to answer and therefore sent to me Q Did you not some time after that put up lists of names in the office one in red ink and another in black ink A I think I know what you allude to—about two years since there were various attacks in Parliament and in same newspapers and in various ways stating that the men considered it a grievance and I said if the letter-carriers considered their connection with the Directory a grievance I was quite willing to absolve them from it—I wished every one to say whether he did or did not and I would forward the names of all who wished to recede from it to the Postmaster-General and request they might be allowed to do so—many of the letters I received were hardly intelligible and I could hardly understand whether they wished to recede or not—I therefore put up a notice saying that I could hardly understand their views and I gave two lists those who wished to continue to be put in black ink and those who wished to recede in red—I had the list made up and I forwarded it to the Postmaster-General and obtained his Lordship s sanction to allow them to recede—all the names in red ink were the names of those who wished to recede from the Directory—after I had got the notes of a portion of the evidence I saw all the inspectors—I could not have called them all into my room at once for that would have impeded the public duty but I saw them all—I showed them that part of the evidence which I had and the names of all the parties who had been called whether against me or not—I am not sure but my impression decidedly is that Thacker s name was not among them—that must be a year or nine or ten months ago—I did not point out the evidence to the inspectors—I showed it them and asked them to read it all—I never told them that I had called them in order that they might know the men who had opposed the Directory and had given evidence against me—I swear that—I know Hodge and Robert Grapes two letter-carriers—Grapes never complained to me of any error about three weeks back—I know that he had endeavoured to obtain a reduction in his charges—I am not aware that it was referred to Mr Bokenham—if a carrier finds an error in the calculation and wishes to rectify it and comes to ma I should take official knowledge of it but in this case he did not—Grapes never made any application on the subject—I never heard of such a thing—I never heard that he made an effort to get a pound allowed to him beyond telling the President that there was a mistake—I know a letter-carrier named Campbell—I have not heard that he made up his account on the Indian mail 4l or 5l less than was charged to the revenue—I have no recollection of telling Hodge to pay in the pound when he said he had a pound over—it is a pure fancy on your part or your informant s—it is the first time I have ever heard of it Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You say you were watching all this time did you go away for any purpose from the place where you were standing with Mr Bokenham A Not till after the circumstance to which I have spoken—we were watching there from a quarter to twelve o clock or thereabouts—we watched for about an hour before we observed anything—during the first hour other letter carriers were acting as messengers carrying the letters to Thacker to sort from the first sorting to Thacker s sorting-place—the first process of sorting is into divisions—a letter-carrier named Pearce was employed in collecting the letters for the tenth division for which Thacker sorted and remained near Thacker till the proper duty was done—they were all unpaid letters—I never heard of such a thing as paid and unpaid letters by an I Indian mail becoming mixed—the letters by an Indian mail are all unpaid I believe—I never knew of letters being paid all the way to England by the Indian mail—during the time we were there no one addressed us or entered into conversation with us—we were alone there—when Ringrose was called into my room he held this paper and I copied it down as he read out of this one—here is the paper which I then copied down—he mentioned some sums that are on it—this paper is a guide to the letter-carrier as to what is the amount of his charge—it is made out by himself—it is what he would pay into the Receiver-General s office the amount of the postage he received on the letters—I cannot say whose writing it is—Ringrose produced it—it can scarcely be the teller s because the teller s docket is a different document altogether—this is a letter-carrier s paper and not a clerk s or teller s MR HORRY Q Did not you bring an action against a newspaper for a libel in connection with this charge A Yes—my attorney paid the costs without my knowing what he had done and abandoned it—I am speaking of a second action—I paid the costs of the first action in order to continue it and brought a second—my attorney paid the costs without my authority and I was very angry with him for doing it COURT Q Neither of the prisoners are the editors of that paper I presume A I never heard so or in any way connected with it that I know of MR BODKIN Q Did you introduce the Directory into the Post-office or did you find it there when you when you came into office A It was the property of my predecessor and I was told by the Postmaster-General to purchase his interest in it which he had purchased from a previous officer—it is now my private property JOHN PLAYLE I am assistant inspector of letter-carriers in the Post-office On the 23rd of June I was on duty and with Mr Kelly and Mr Bokenham set to watch what was doing at Thacker s table about twelve o clock—we were so placed as to command a view of Thacker and the proceeding at his table—I had seen Ringrose but not when I first began to watch—I saw him afterwards—when I first saw him he was at his duty conveying newspapers about three yards in front of Thacker—I saw him leave his place and go to Thacker s table—I had then been watching about a quarter of an hour—when he got to the table he leaned over and appeared to converse with Thacker—I could not hear what was said—he was on Thacker s right hand—Thacker was sorting letters and had some letters occasionally in his left hand and as he disposed of them of course his left hand become empty—I can hardly recollect what become of Ringrose after he spoke to Thacker—I think he remained there but I am not quite clear whether it was the first or second time—he came a second time to Thacker—he was still sorting his letters with his right hand—with his left he was holding a small quantity of letters which supplied the right hand—he appeared to pass them to the various divisions or compartments that he was sorting to—I saw him put some on his right hand side and lay them down which was contrary to the usual practice of sorting the usual practice being to stand them up—the Lower Thames-street letters should be on his left hand—I saw Ringrose take away a small handful of letters which Thacker had put on his right hand —he took the first handful into the Letter-carrier s office—Thacker was standing sorting all the while—I am quite positive Thacker could see it done—when Ringrose came back I think he went and spoke to Thacker and then went and resumed his sorting at the papers—he had nothing in his hand when he came back the second time—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I saw him with what appeared to be a newspaper—I observed as he came to Thacker that he showed Thacker this paper and immediately after Thacker made a sing as it were with his right hand to some letters which were lying and Ringrose took up those letters as well as the paper which he was showing to Thacker—the letters were lying on his right hand—he took them up and went apparently to the Letter-carrier s office—I lost sight of him I should say for scarcely more than a second—I saw him then returning into the Inland-office where he had taken the letters from as if seeking for some one—he spoke to one of the clerks—he had in his hand apparently those identical letters by the size of the grasp—he eventually went to the Letter-carrier s office with them—in the course of the same day I saw him in Mr Kelly s room—I was present when the letters on him were told up—I imagine all of them were in his own walk although many of them are not fully directed—they are directed to Messrs so and so London—I only conjecture that they were in his delivery—when told of having been seen taking the letters he at first said that he could not account for it—he produced this paper from which we gathered that his letters should have amounted to a certain sum—it is marked with pencil marks—the amount at that time was gathered by Mr Kelly from the paper not by me—it was gathered from Ringrose s own lips—the paper was first produced by Ringrose in answer to a question by Mr Kelly as to how much was the amount of his letters and there being some additions and subtractions Mr Kelly reduced it to a given sum—Mr Kelly knew what figures to put down from the lips of Ringrose and from the production of the paper—he held the paper in his hand—I saw Mr Kelly make a memorandum of his own—I think it began by Ringrose holding this paper in his hand and saying from it So much is my amount and he put it down but I was passing in and out of the room and am not so confident about it—I cannot positively say whether Mr Kelly collected it from the paper or whether Ringrose told it him—I told up the postage of the letters found on him—I made a memorandum of the amount at the time but I think I have destroyed it—I have a copy which I made next day—the total amount of the letters found on Ringrose was 6l 13s 8d —I cannot give the items—they are copied partly by myself and partly by three of the clerks—I cannot tell what the postage of the different letters were—this other paper is in my hand-writing I made it on the afternoon of that day—this is only a portion of the amount of the letters—the 2l 12s 11d answered to on particular number of letters—I did not know that any such calculation was made Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q You have succeeded Mr Rackley who has retired A Yes he was assistant-inspector of letter-carriers—I and he were employed on the Directory—the Directory has now left the office I believe—if it had continued in the office and I had succeeded Mr Rackley in the employment of the Directory as well as in the office I should have had upwards of 90l more annually—he received 117l from the Directory and I received 30l —the Directory has gone away and I have lost it all—I have nothing to expect—had it not gone away I might have expected 117l a-year or whatever the figure might have been then—a certain sum was last year received by the first assistant-inspector which situation I how hold amounting to 117l —the Directory having gone away entirely I cannot expect to receive anything—I have got my time and have not the labour—I have no expectation of receiving that sum—I have lost the 30l that had—I was once a letter-carrier myself on the Leadenhall-street walk—when I was on that walk I was repeatedly over and under in my charges—sometimes over and sometimes under—that arose from the mis-telling of the letters as to the amounts—the authorities of the India House in Leadenhall-street never complained of my having made several charges on them—I have no recollection of anything of the sort—it could not have occurred and I not know it—I should have recollected it—I was on the Old Broad-street walk which is a very heavy one—a letter-carrier is liable to be over or under in a charge which many perhaps be 20l worth of letters—the and teller and the letter-carrier may differ sixpence or a few pence and then if it is so near as that the charges are not re-told if they differ by more they are re-told by an arbitrator or a re-teller—that happens before we leave the office before we put the letters into order for delivery Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q When this calculation was made by which you arrived at 6l 13s 8d do you recollect whether Mr Cook and Mr Brodie told the letters A Mr Brodie told the letters—Mr Cook is an insector—I think he was not there at the time—I am not aware that there was a difference of 1l in our calculation—it did not come to my knowledge if it happened MR SOLICITOR-GENERAL Q Were these over or under charges you speak of discovered in the office or out A In the office before the letter-carrier makes himself answerable for a certain sum on the docket—when I was a letter-carrier I never had 2l or 3l worth of unpaid letters which had not gone through the teller—such a proceeding would be wholly unauthorized—I have no recollection of a teller making a mistake of 2l or 3l in his letters—when I was a letter-carrier and made a mistake the teller and I did not try and settle it—another clerk settled it a re-teller—I and the teller did not find out the difference together—there is a third party a check-clerk who holds possession of the docket on which the amount of letters made by the teller is placed he holds it unknown to the letter-carrier and it is to this intermediate party that the letter-carrier reports MR PARRY Q What is the amount of the Indian postage on an ordinary individual letter A I cannot answer that—1s 10d I believe is the single rate but that does not come so immediately under my cognizance—some of the letters contain inclosures and they would be charged a larger sum—some are 16s and some only 1s 10d —I think I remember seeing one as high as 16s some 9s some 8s 4d and go on perhaps there might be thirty or forty or seventy newspapers WILLIAM FARLEY I am one of the letter-carriers in the Post-office I was on duty in the Letter-carrier s-office on the 23rd of June last during the period that the letters by the Indian mail were being sorted and saw Ringrose come from the Inland-office with a handful of letters in his hand—he had nothing else that I am aware of—he passed from the Inland-office into the Letter-carrier s office and passed into the tenth division—I followed him and saw that they were what we termed good letters —I saw the letters in his hand—good letters are unpaid letters with the postage marked on them for which money is to be received—I observed a newspaper in his hand—it was a 3d charged newspaper that created some suspicion in my mind and I mentioned it to my superiors Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Did you go round the Post-office to get signatures to a petition to the Postmaster-General to keep the Directory in the office A Yes that was not by the request of Mr Kelly—it was the request of the Committee formed to draw it up—there was no inspector among the Committee—I was employed on the Directory many years MR CLARKSON Q You thought it was a good thing for you and other letter-carriers and you and others presented a memorial to the Postmaster-General A We did JAMES CROWDEY LOVETT I am a clerk in the Inland-office of the General Post-office I was on duty on the 23rd of June last when the Indian mail came in and was sorting—I was employed as a teller of the postage of the unpaid letters for the tenth division—I told up the postage or charge for the Lower Thames-street walk No 106 and entered the amount of the charge on the docket now in my hand MR PARRY Q Was Ringrose present when you made the entry or is it merely an entry of your own A An entry of my own MR CLARKSON Q The letters are handed to you for purpose of telling up before they come to the letter-carriers are they not A Yes—the amount was 3l 0s 2d —the letters were given to a messenger to place in the proper box in the letter-carrier s office—it was the duty of the messenger to give the docket to the check-clerk after I had put my initials on it Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Is that the docket you so gave him A Yes DAVID DAVIS I acted as one of the tellers on the 23rd of June on the telling up the charges for the unpaid letters of the Indian mail—I told up the amount of one of the charges for the Lower Thames-street walk No 106—this is the docket on which I wrote the amount—it is 1l 18s 3d —I calculated it from the letters brought to me by the messenger for that purpose—I afterwards handed the letters to the messenger to be taken to the letter-carrier s office and the docket to be put in to the box—It would be the duty of the check-clerk to receive from the hands of the messenger the docket that I so calculated COURT Q You put your initials A I did— charge told by D D Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Who brought you the letters A Mr Clare I believe—I do not know—a great many persons bring letters to me letter-carriers inspectors and assistant-inspectors—letter-carriers are occasionally employed as messangers COURT to MR LOVETT Q What is the meaning of these figures at the upper part where they seem to have added the two together A It is the amount of the two charges—I did not write that—it has been added since WILLIAM HILLMER I am one of the clerks in the Inland-office I was on duty on the 23rd of June when the letters that came by the Indian mail were being sorted I acted as a check-clerk—after the letter-carriers charges are told up by the telling-clerk the dockets are handed to me and I enter the amount of the dockets on some slip of paper—I entered the amount of the two charges for the Lower Thames-street walk No 106—they were 1l 18s 3d and 3l 0s 2d making a total of 4l 18s 5d —those were the only charges that day—the letter-carrier of that district reported to me the amounts of those charges in the course of his duty—if they had not corresponded they would have been corrected—they corresponded with the calculation of the teller—he called out the amounts and they agreed with mine—he then took them away to his own table—it is the practice for the letter-carrier to put him initials on the dockets signifying that they are right—I find the initial R here in pencil—I suppose it is for Ringrose—I do not examine the signature—I gave them to him to sign and that is the way in which he would sign them Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Did you deliver the letters to him A No—I did not tell up the letters with him—he signed it in the way of his duty—he signed it near me—I am in a desk above him—the letter-carrier who reports this charge to me signs the docket—I have no recollection who the letter-carrier was—I do not recollect whether it was Ringrose ANDREW FROOME I am a letter-carrier in the General Post-Office On the 23rd of June I was on duty there and deducted the amount of the charges from the different letter-carriers in the tenth division—I asked Ringrose the amount of his charges that day—I should think that was a little before two o clock—he gave me the amount of his charges by figures on the docket—I took the amount down from what he told me—I think it was 4l 18s 5d —he gave it me verbally—these are my figures—I wrote it down at the time—it is not usually the course of my duty to enter the amount on such a ship—I do it occasionally—I did it that morning—I took it down from his mouth—in the course of the day the witness Farley made a communication to me—I should think that was from about half-past one to two o clock Cross-examined by MR PARREY Q What officer is it who delivers the letters to the letter-carrier before he goes on his walk A They are not delivered to the letter-carrier they are bought from the Inland-officer after they pass the check-clerk the letter-carrier takes possession of them from his own box—they are numbered and put in boxes—the latter-carrier s number is called and he goes to his box and takes out whatever letters he finds there GEORGE KERSHAW I am one of the sub-stores I was on duty on the 23rd of June last about two o clock assisting the charge-taker of the tenth division—the total amount of postage against Ringrose that day is 4l 0s 9d —some of this in my handwriting and some in the writing of a person named Falls—I did not see this 4l 0s 9d written—the figures I put down were 5s 2d that was for mis-stored letters—that amount was called out by the charge-taker Splevins and it was added to Rindrose s amount—1l 2s 10d is dedcuted for the same sort of thing—I put down the 1s 2s 10d from Splevins calling out—that was allowed to Ringrose—I did not see Ringrose when it was allowed—he would read it and see it was all right before he went out—the charge-taker told me to read this to him before he left his seat—it would be the duty of the letter-carrier to read it to the charge-taker before he went out to enable the charge-taker to take it down—4l 0s 9d was the whole amount chargeable to Ringrose on that day—Thacker brought some unpaid letters and said Allow Ringrose 18s 1d —he said he had brought them from Ringrose—Splevins would be responsible for the whole amount—it would be his duty to ascertain its correctness and he told me to allow it to Ringrose—I entered that allowance in the charge-taker s book—I have the book here—I distributed the unpaid letters that Thacker brought to the letter-carrier for whom they intended Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q At the same time he came to you with the 18s 1d did he not also come from Ritterspeck A Not that I am aware of—he did not say anything to me about something to be allowed to Ritterspeck—he only came to me from Ringrose—I told the charge-taker the amount and he directed me to allow it Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Who calculates the amount of the mis-sorted letters A The charge-taker COURT Q The letter were produced to you and left with you for the 18s 1d A Yes and I distributed them to the right person and charged them with them WILLIAM SPLEVINS I acted as charge-taker of the tenth division on the 23rd of June last on the sorting of the Indian mail—it would be my duty to make an entry in this book produced —I believe these figures 18s 1d against the Lower Thames-street walk are mine—I am not certain but I think they are by the look of the 8 —I remember this amount of 18s 1d being brought to me by Thacker for me to allow it to the carrier of the Lower Thames-street walk Ringrose —I made the allowance without telling the letter—these other figures 4s 4d I believe are Mr Kershaw s COURT Q Did you read over that entry to Ringrose A He read it to me—it would be his duty to do so—he reads it thus 4s 4d —3d —3d and 4d first and then the other side 18s 1d 4s 6d and 3d —that was all I had to do with him—that makes the balance 4l 0s 9d —that was read over to him—he knew what he was charged with Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Can you recollect whether Thacker brought any letters from Fenchurch-street A I do not recollect that he did—he brought the 18s 1d to me JAMES BRODIE I am a clerk in the Inland-office—I was in Mr Kelly s room on the 23rd June when Ringrose was brought in with his letters—I saw him produce his letter—I told up the postage of them—he placed them out on one of the tables in Mr Kelly s room—the total amount of unpaid letters was 6l 13s 8d —that was inclusive of newspapers the total charge against him—I could not say how many letter there were without a memorandum which I have not here—I did not take them down in detail—that was afterwards done by another officer—I have a memorandum here which shows that the total number of letters produced by Ringrose was fifty-five and twenty-six newspapers—a calculation was afterwards made of how many letters and newspapers would make 4l 0s 9d and I told over—I found that thirty-two letters and twelve newspapers would make 4l 0s 9d but Mr Barnard made that out and can speak better to it—the list was not made out until after the examination at Bow-street Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Did Mr Cook calculate the amount of the letters as well A No he was not present—Mr Blott the assistant-President told up the amount and agreed with me—he did not differ to the extent of 1l —there was difference of a penny afterwards in Mr Barnard s telling—I am quite sure it was not 1l CHARLES WILLIAM BARNARD I am a clerk in the Inland-office On the 23rd of June some letters were handed to me by Mr Clare as the letters of Ringrose—I made out a list of the letters and newspapers with the amount of the postage charged upon each—this is the list I made out— produced —I made it come to 6l 13s 9d being the difference of a penny between myself and Mr Brodie—we discovered that difference at the time—it was not tried a second time—I made a calculation as to how many letters and newspapers would amount to 4l 0s 9 d —some letters addressed to Chalmers Guthrie and Co alone amounted to 4l 16s 11d —they were sorted separately for delivery—that would be done by the letter-carrier after they reached his hands for the convenience of delivery Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q At the time an Indian mail comes in are not about 300 letter-carriers employed there A No there may 100 or 180 not more certainly—there may be twenty or twenty-five clerks and as many messengers—there would be about 300 persons employed altogether WILLIS CLARE I am an assistant-inspector—I was in attendance on the 23rd of June—it was not any part of Ringrose s duty to take letters from Thacker s table—I was in Mr Kelly s room when Ringrose was there with a number of letters and newspapers—I delivered those same letters to Mr Barnard COURT Q We have heard that there are some few firms whose letters when they are at the sorting-table are sorted by themselves are Chalmers Guthrie and Co one of those firms A No Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Do you recollect the seventh and eighth divisions being momentarily unoccupied that morning A I cannot recollect seeing them unoccupied—Thacker suggested to me that as the seventh and eighth divisions were unoccupied he had better attend to them—the seventh and eighth divisions extend about Cheapside and the Bank and down to the water s edge—when I was a letter-carrier I dare say I have made mistakes and been occasionally over and under in my charges—I have never been out of the office when I have found that out—I have always found it out inside the office with the exception perhaps of 1d or 2d MR PARRY understanding that Mr Partridge was in attendance was desirous of putting a question to him The Solicitor-General expressed his readiness to call him but the Court was of opinion that as his evidence was not required for the Prosecution it should be left to the prisoner s Counsel to call him as his witness the Judges having come to the decision that Counsel for the Prosecution were not required to call all the witnesses whose names appeared on the back of the bill although bound to have them in attendance MR PARRY to MR KELLY Q How long has Ringrose been in the post-office A Eight or nine years and Thacker ten or eleven COURT Q And of course during all that time their characters must have been good or else they would not have remained A I do not know JURY Q Are the letter-carriers boxes locked A No not after the letters pass to the letter-carriers office—there are no boxes in point of fact—they are put into what are termed boxes but they are open at the top—they are merely divided into compartments—the messenger puts the charges into these compartments and puts the dockets at the same time—the letter-carrier then comes and takes the letters out of the compartments tells up the amount takes the letters to his own desk and there is no box or anything to look up there Charles Harold baker of Shoreditch and John Yetton publican of Globe-road deposed to Ringrose s good character and Joseph Steward general dealer Poplar to that of Thacker THACKER— GUILTY Aged 34

t18470705-1674  1674 RICHARD BRANDON was indicted for stealing whilst employed in the Post-office 13 post letters the property of Her Majesty s Postmaster General —2nd and 3rd COUNTS for embezzling and secreting the said letters — 4thCOUNT for secreting the said letters for the purpose of cheating and defrauding Our Lady the Queen of the duties chargeable thereon MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM BOKENHAM I am superintending president of the Inland-office of the Post-office I remember the arrival of the Indian mail on the 23rd of June—when the letters are taken out of the bags they are divided into fifteen divisions numbered from one to fifteen—the person who so divide are on one side of what is called the sorters table and on the other side are the sorters who have the letters given to them to sub-sort them into walks——there is a sub-sorter to each division—they have lines on a board in front indicating the particular walks composing the division and as they sort the letters they place them end-ways against the walk in which they run—it is the duty of the sub-sorter when they have accumulated sufficiently to place a blank docket in front of the parcel and to hand the letters so placed to the teller who is at a table close by—the teller ascertains the amount of postage charged on the letters and enters on the docket the total amount—each of those parcels is called a charge—they are taken from the teller with the docket which contains the total amount of the postage of each charge into the adjoining office called the letter-carriers office—the docket is then handed to the check-clerk and at the same time the letters are put into boxes or compartments—on the docket being handed to the check-clerk the letter-carrier who belongs to the walk looks at the letters so brought and tells to the check-clerk the amount of the postage on them without having any previous knowledge of the docket—the letter-carrier is then called to receive the charge if it is St Mary Axe charge for instance they would call out St Mary Axe and the letter-carrier would go and receive the latter—the letter-carrier has no means whatever of knowing the amount on the docket—he tells up the amount of the postage and calls it over to the check-clerk immediately and if it corresponds with the amount mentioned in the docket then the letters are put in the letter-carrier s box for delivery—if the amount which the letter-carrier makes corresponds with the entry on the docket the docket is handed to the letter-carrier by the check-clerk and the carrier places his initial upon it and restores it he then takes the letters away to his own place—the check is then complete and the revenue has nothing further to do with it—all he has then to do is to bring back the money for the letter he then has to go to the charge-taker—letters sometimes get mis-sorted in the course of this process but that is arranged before the latter-carrier leaves and those having been mis-sorted to his walk and not belonging to him are taken off the amount of money charged against him by the charge-taker—if any belonging to him are brought from another walk the amount of that postage is added to his by the charge-taker—the balance so struck is the sum he is to bring back to the Post-office—if any letters remain in his possession mis-sorted he has to deliver them after completing his own delivery and would be punished if he did not—the amount of postage of these letters would be included in the charge—the prisoner was a letter-carrier of the ninth division in which the St Mary Axe walk is No 96—Gallin is the sorter of the ninth division which would be the next to No 10 the division at which Thacker who was tried yesterday was placed—I did not see the prisoner at his duty on the day in question—as he was going out with his letters he was stopped by my direction from a communication that had been made to me and was taken into Mr Kelly s office—I afterwards saw him in my private room—the letters that he had to deliver were produced—I do not know whether the postage was told up in his presence Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Are you speaking of the morning or the mid-day duty A The mid-day duty the letter-carriers are then in a different office—I should say there are three times more person engaged in the morning than at mid-day—the mid-day duty occurs every day—the Indian mail does not arrive every day—when the Indian mail is connected with the mid-day duty more exertion is required but I should say there is not more bustle—letters are taken about from one to the other in the same way in the morning—there may be bustle on both occasions but I think not more at mid-day than in the morning—if one person had nothing particular to do he would be employed in some way other—I have heard since that an inspector sometimes tells a letter-currier to put over a charge to the teller—there are seats or desks at which the letter-carriers sometimes leave their letters while they go to some other part of the place—they are sometimes left for a long time—if letters not properly belonging to that seat are put on it that could only be corrected by the letter-carrier sorting his letters—the seat is only a small desk for the letter-carrier to arrange his letters on—he cannot get his letters for his walk until they have been previously charged by the teller—when he gets them he frequently lays them down on his seat or desk and goes away—if any other letters were put there in his absence he could only ascertain that by sorting the letters were put there finding when he went to deliver them that he had more COURT Q Does that sometimes happen A No he must leave his place or letters occasionally to fetch his second or third charge—if his letters are completely made up it would be barely possible that he might leave them even then being called by the president or go for a registered letter or for some purpose or other—he sets the letters himself—he commences sorting his letters as soon as he receives his first charge—he cannot finish it till he has got them all—he then should go out for delivery—a certain time is allowed and then a bell rings MR PAYNE Q When the bell rings he must go at once A Yes whether he has times to sort his letters or not—after going out he would not be able to set right any mistake till next day—at the time the prisoner was called into Mr Kelly s room two clerks reported to me that they had told his letters up—I heard that Mr Cook the inspector had also told them up and Mr Brodie afterwards—Mr Brodie and Mr Cook made a difference in the amount of their telling but I do not know what—when I found they differed I requested Mr Brodie to be very particular and also told another clerk to take it—the telling is a mental operation—it is a very rapid business—when they amount to 1l they are put up together and the odd pence are carried on to the next—it is written down to help the recollection—it is all matter of recollection until they come to the end—Mr Cook is not here that I am aware of—Mr Brodie will be able to state how much the difference was between him and Mr Cook—he told me the difference but what it was I do not know—there is a paper called the president s docket on which allowances are made and charges added—if there were more or fewer letters than there ought to be in a man s possession he would come next day and explain it and it would be set right in the president s paper of next day but I never heard of such a transaction—if you are charged 2s too much you take it back to the letter-carrier and he will take it to the president and he will allow you 2s on the dockt—if any mistake does occur it must be corrected next day on the president s paper but I never heard of one—if a man carried out more letters than he ought and came back and said I have carried out more that would be correct COURT Q If some person with a wicked motive put some letters on a man s desk inducing him to believe they were there before and he went away with them it must be set right by the president s paper A Undoubtedly—the man would come to the president and say I received 15s more than my charge yesterday I had some letters put by some person with an evil design on my desk and here are the 15s that would be the way in which it would be set right—they must have been letters not charged or else the other person who put them there would have it or else the revenue would get 15s more than it ought—I never heard of such a circumstance in my experience and I sometimes have to attend to these president s papers MR PAYNE Q The Indian mail letters would require a smaller number to make up an amount than common letters A Undoubtedly—the lowest charge is 1s 10d —there were some twopenny letters—they were inland letters which he had to deliver as well—I have seen Indian letters charged 100l or 200l which a man could carry out with ease or 500l —it need not be very large—the French post charge by the quarter of an ounce weight MR BODKIN Q Supposing when the letter-carrier comes and tells up the amount of postage on the letters he is to deliver and the sum he calls out does not correspond with what the check-clerk has on the docket what is done A Another clerk is called to re-tell those letters and to decide between them—if he makes the amount the same as the latter-carrier that amount is taken if it is the same as the teller the teller s amount is taken COURT Q If neither one or the other is taken A Then it is gone through again and when two calculations agree it is taken—supposing the teller is 4l and the clerk at the counter 4l 10s and the clerk called in 4l 6s he would count them up till he made it either 4l 10s or 4l 6s —he would ascertain what the right amount was and so alter the docket—that would be settled before the letters were taken away by the letter-carrier—the re-teller would alter the docket and the check-clerk his book before the letters are allowed to leave MR BODKIN Q Then the effect would be that the letter-carrier would only be charged with the sum that the inspector found was the proper sum A Yes—if the carrier had 1l worth of letters more than was counted in his charge there must have been a mistake in the first place made in the amount by the teller and letter-carrier or some person must have put the letters there to make him a present of 1l that he would get by the postage EDWARD CHURCHILL On the 23rd of June I was acting as a teller at the General Post Office when the Indian mail was being sorted—I remember telling up the amount of postage for the ninth division—I sent it in in the usual way with the docket containing the amount—this is the docket—the amount is 5l 7s 8d—it is the docket for walk No 96—I believe that was the first charge—it has the letter A at the top Cross-examined Q Can you tell how many letters that would contain A No I cannot JOHN HINTON I was acting as teller on the 23rd of June when the Indian mail arrived—I told one of the charges for No 96 walk ninth division—this is the docket—the amount is 4l 16s 3d —that docket would be sent with the letters to which it refers to the letter-carriers office COURT Q What letters are on the top of it A It is a private mark B —I do not know who made it—it does not mean that it was the second charge for the day Cross-examined Q I believe it is impossible to say who the person is that takes the letters and docket away after you have told them up is it a messenger sometimes A Generally speaking there is a person employed for the purpose—I cannot say who took these letters—it would be the duty of the messenger to take them and put them into the letter-carrier s box and the letter-carrier when called would go and find the letters there—he has nothing to do with putting them into the box THOMAS TURNER I was acting as teller on the 23rd of June at the General Post Office—I made up a charge for the ninth division the St Mary Axe walk—it amounted to 1l 6s 0d —that docket went with the letters to which it refers to the letter-carriers office WILLIAN HILLMER On the arrival of the Indian mail on the 23rd of June last I acted as check-clerk in the letter-carriers office—the three Charges on that day for the St Mary Axe district No 96 were 5l 7s 8d 4l 16s 3d and 1l 6s —it would be the course of the office to call for the carrier of the St Mary Axe district to receive his calculation of these three charges—on that occasion I received a calculation of the letter-carrier for that district—it corresponded with these three sums—he reported the amounts right and I cast them up—they came to 11l 9s 11d —I know they agree by looking at the initials and by this paper too—they all three bear the letter-carrier s initials signifying that they are perfect—the initials look like W B —they are in pencil and are done very fast Cross-examined Q Are the figures denoting the postage on the letters done very fast too A It is done quickly—it depends on the experience of the officer—they are written with considerable rapidity—is done generally thirty or forty yards from where they are told—there is no mark put on them at the places where they come from—the clerk who taxes the postage puts a mark on them corresponding with the sum to be paid MR BOKENHAM re-examined There are several clerks called taxing-clerk WILLIAM HILLMER re-examined The first operation is putting the postage on—it is done sometimes badly and sometimes clearly—an experienced officer would do it more leisurely—they sometimes flourish and make 1s 10d look like 2s 8d MR CLARKSON Q The course of the office is that the letter-carrier comes to you casts up the amount of the three parcels of letters that he is to carry and gives you from his own mouth the amount A That is right—he gives the amount of each charge separately the result of his own calculation THOMAS BENWELL On the 23rd of June I was charge-taker of the ninth division—this is my book the amount of charge to the carrier to the St Mary Axe walk on that day No 96 is 11l 9s 11d —I do not know what it consists of—I only take the sum total in the book—I take it from documents he produces to me—if there has been any mis-sorting it would be set to rights in this book—there was on that day 9s 6d mis-sorted to the St Mary Axe walk—that was taken off his amount—there were letters for other walks that were mis-sorted there—they amounted to 3d and 2s 3d —I subtracted 3d and 2s 3d and allowed him 9s 6d —that is done with the letter-carrier just before he leaves of the purpose of delivering his letters—he has generally got his letters set for delivery before he comes to me as many as he can get set at the time COURT Q How is it done A The mis-sorted letters are brought to me I tell them up to see if the amount is correct and allow it to him in this book—I keep them myself and throw them off into the different walks they belong to—those that come from others to him I deliver to him after entering the amount in this book—he checks the amount of the letters himself Cross-examined Q And supposing the bell to ring directly after that he would be obliged to go away whether he had had time to sort them or not A He would COURT Q We sometimes see a postman sorting as he goes along A It is a very inconvenient way MR PAYNE Q You have known instances where they have been obliged to go into a public-house to get it done A I have heard of it JAMES BRODIE I was on duty on the 23rd of June last and saw the prisoner in Mr Kelly s room after the duty had been performed—I think it was then close on three o clock—I cannot state the time exactly—I asked the prisoner for his letters and he pointed to some lying on the table—I transferred them to another table and told up the postage—I think I told them three times—I made the amount after the third telling 12l 12s 8d —I made it that amount twice—I did not make it the same in the first instance—I think it might be a few shillings different—I did not at that time mention the amount to the prisoner—I asked for his amount of charges—he produced this paper—the amount of his charges appears here to be 11l 2s 11d which I took down at the time—it shows the allowance and additions as well as the amount of three charges—he produced it to me as being the amount of his charges—I then stated to Mr Bokenham the difference and he desired me to have the prisoner brought into his private room—if he had gone away with the letters that were produced to me as his he would have had the opportunity of putting 1l 9s 9d the difference into his pocket—when he got into Mr Bokenham s room he was called on to explain how he got possession of the difference in postage—he said be could not account for it that he did not know that he had any surplus of letters in his possession—he might have said something about somebody putting letters on his table—I am not quite certain—the letters were all for hi walk—a list of the letters was afterwards made out by myself and two of the inspectors—there were eighty-one letters and sixty-five newspapers—the postage of those amounted to 12l 12s 8d —sixty-eight of the letters and fifty of newspapers would amount to 11l 2s 11d —I believe they all belong to his walk—thirteen letters and fifteen newspapers would be left—1l 9s 9d would be postage of those—newspapers are charged COURT Q Do you know what was the highest amount of any charge A referring to the list There is 13s 6d on one letter none higher than that—be was taken into custody MR PAYNE Q Will you explain any difference that there was in the calculation between you and Mr Cook A Mr Cook was telling the letters when I entered the room and he reported an amount to me which I think was about 1l less than I eventually made them—I instantly stated the case to Mr Bokenham—Mr Cook had told me then he had made about 10s difference between Brandan s telling and his—this was before I had asked Brandan for his amount—that induced me to do so—I did not hear from Mr Cook whether he had competed his calculation—I went to Mr Bekenham and told him the circumstances COURT Q Did you and Mr Cook go over the counting again A No we did not—I did it myself but I afterwards understood from Cook that he had not told the whole of the letters—that was after the prisoner had been stopped THOMAS BURGESS COOK I am in employment of the post-office as an assistant-inspector I remember the prisoner being detained as he was going out of the letters on the 23rd of June—I was requested to tell the charge of those letters and they were put down on my desk—I told a portion of them and mentioned the amount to Mr Brodie—I forgot the amount now—I had not told the whole of them—when I found Mr Brodie was telling the charge I took no more notice of it—I left it to him—there was one bundle I had not told—I had told him the amount I had made supposing he would add the untied bundle to it—the bundle I told was 10s and some odd pence more than Brandan had made the whole of the letters amount to—I think I counted four bundles—I am not positive—there were four or five altogether—I counted all but one and made it 10s more than Brandan had made it RICHARD GALLIN On the 23rd of June I was acting as a sub-sorter for the 9th division sorting the letters that arrived by the Indian mail—I remember the prisoner being on duty that day as a letter-carrier of walk No 96 the St Mary Axe walk—I sorted the letters and handed them to the teller in the usual way—I think the teller s table was five or six feet from me—I had occasion several times at the commencement of the duty to leave the table for a minute or two—the duty began at half-past eleven o clock or twenty minutes to twelve—the man Thacker was at my right—on the investigation of these matters the authorities of the Post-office thought fit to suspend me and I have since been restored COURT Q While you were at your table could any one have taken letter without your knowing it A No if letters were taken it must have been while I was a way—I went away four or five times during the first ten minutes of the duty to collect letters from the other sorters the general sorters—I collect all the letters belonging to the 9th division—last time I left was ten minutes after the commencement of the duty—I should think I had sorted a good many letters in that time and I should say there was a considerable number for the St Mary Axe walk—there might be as many as thirteen letters taken away—they might have been taken away and I not miss them—when I sort the letters I stand them on end so that a person could get hold of them—we have fourteen walks—the letters that we have to sort are laid before us on the table—we sort them and put them up against a ledge before us—if a person took away thirteen letters off the 96th walk he must have taken them after they were sorted by me or else he must have taken the trouble of standing and sorting them—that would be sure to attract notice—if a man took them without my knowledge it must have been after I had sorted them—we go or sorting the letters till they get rather inconvenient and then we hand them to a teller—thirteen or fourteen letters would not be missed from a large charge—I have nothing to do with newspapers MR BODKIN Q Some newspapers come by the Indian mail and have postage charged on them A Yes—I did not sort them that day JOHN PLAYLE I am an assistant inspector of letter-carriers and was or duty on the 23rd of June in the Inland-office—I cannot myself speak as to any duty which the prisoner had to perform that day in the Inland-office—whether he had any or not I do not know—I saw him there shortly after twelve o clock—I say him pass down behind the sorters Thacker and Gallin—Thacker was sorter of the tenth division and Gallin of the ninth—he apappeared to be walking slowly as if having nothing to do—he made a very slight halt behind Gallin—that was shortly after twelve o clock—Gallin was there sorting—the sorting had been going on about half on hour—perhaps it took nearly an hour altogether—I was not watching the prisoner—I merely observed this—I did not notice whether Gallin left his sorting-table after this COURT Q Who had divisions No 7 and 8 that day A I cannot say—a messenger generally collects the letters for the sub-sorter but if a sorter is not supplied he would go himself for them Cross-examined Q How long has the prisoner been in the Post-office A About thirteen years RICHARD GALLIN re-examined A man named Hollows was sorting in No 7—I cannot say who was sorting in No 8 WILLIS CLARE I am an assistant inspector of letter-carriers On the 23rd of June at the time the letters which arrived by the Indian-mail were being sorted the prisoner had no duty or business to be in the Inland-office Cross-examined Q Has it not been the practice for him to be in the Inland-office to take stamped letters from the openers of bags to the stampers A Not for the Indian mail nor for other letters at the time the Indian mail is in—his duty at the mid-day mail is after the Indian mail is disposed of to put the paid letters over—it is not duty to go out with the Indian mail—he goes out with the mid-day letters which is after the Indian mail is over—it would be his duty to assist in the mid-day mail—that would take place when the mid-day mail arrived—it arrived soon after the Indian mail on the day in question—it does not always do so but the letters arriving by the Indian mail are sorted at one end of the office and those arriving by the mid-day mail at the other—when the mid-day mail commences his regular duty would be to take letters from the openers of bags to the stampers

Prosecution PETER VERLEY I am a watchmaker at Wisbeach in Cambridgeshire On 10th Nov I put a pair of watch-cased and a sovereign and a half folded in a 10l note of the Wisbeach and Lincolnshire Bank Gurney s Bank into a pasteboard box sealed the letter with sealing-wax and addressed it Mr J Craig 8 Northampton-square Clerkenwell London —the number of the note was G 3606 dated 21st July 1838—I gave the letter to my wife who was going out—this note produced is the one I inclosed LOUISA VERLEY I am wife of last witness On 10th Nov I received a letter from him addressed Mr J Craig 8 Northampton-square Clerkenwell London —I saw it given to Mr Gower s son outside the post-office at Wisbeach by my niece at five o clock in the afternoon or a few minutes after—I paid him sixpence for it JOHN GOWER I am postmaster of Wisbeach If a letter was delivered at five o clock on 10th Nov it would go out at seven o clock at night—my son is a clerk in the office—I saw the London bag tied and sealed that night and dispatched it at seven o clock JOHN CRAIG I live at 8 Northampton-square Clerkenwell and know Mr Verley of Wisbeach A letter from him in Nov last containing a pair of watch-cases a 10l note and some money never reached me JAMES SANSUM I am a clerk in the General Post-office London I was there on the morning of 11th Nov at the arrival of the inland mail—I recollect the Wisbeach mail-bag coming that morning—it was tied sealed and in its usual state—it was my duty to open it and take out the letters—I did so in the Inland-office according to the common course of business—I put them on one side—they would then be carried to the sorting-place in the same office by other persons in the establishment WILLIS CLARE I am one of the assistant inspectors of letter-carriers in the Post-office The prisoner has been employed there nearly three years as a letter-carrier—on the morning of 11th Nov he was employed in the Inland-office—we require the assistance of the letter-carriers to collect the letters from the Inland-office and carry them to the different district offices—on the morning of 11th he was employed to collect the letters from the Inland-office and carry them to the sixth division—Northampton-square Clerkenwell is in that division—if a letter came from Wisbeach to be taken to Northampton-square it would fall among those over which he had control—letters are drawn up from the Inland-office into the different districts by a machine and they carry them up in trays—the prisoner would not be in possession of this letter to carry it to Northampton-square—the only opportunity he would have of getting it would be in carrying the letters up in the trays he being appointed collector that morning Prisoner There are two men employed to take up the sixth division letters from the Inland-office to the letter-carriers office I was only doing it for a man who was away Witness He was one of two men who act as substitutes for absentees—Hillier was the other collector JOSEPH HILLIER I acted with the prisoner on the morning of the 11th in carrying the letters for the sixth division—no letter containing a box or anything else addressed to Mr Craig Northampton-square Clerkenwell London came into my hands—I did not touch such a one Prisoner Q I had nothing to do with bringing the packets up did not you bring them up A I did not—I was on for a person named fox—it was not his duty to collect them—I had nothing to do with them that morning—I cannot say I saw you with the packets—I was on my duty and you on yours—I never interfere with another man s duty—you did not take the eights heaviest walks—I took the heaviest walk for FOX—I had signed for him several mornings and it was not my duty to take the packets up—such a letter was never in my hands—I did not bring the packets up for a fortnight previous—I cannot call to mind whether I did so the morning before—sometimes I am employed in one division sometimes in another JURY Q You say there was no letter addressed to Mr Craig did you distinctly notice the direction of every letter A I never noticed one more than another—it was not my duty to notice the directions—at times there are large letters which are not sorted with the packets—large packets and small cases are distinctly divided—I cannot say that in the letter I took no letter was addressed to Mr Craig—I took hundreds of letters that morning—I am not aware of having one addressed to Mr Craig BENJAMIN CLATHEROW I have been an assistant grocer and live at 75 St Andrew-road New Kent-road—I lived upon funded property left me by my aunt—in the early part of Nov I was without money having been out of a situation since March—I knew the prisoner four years or more previous to his being in the Post-office—I did not know his name—I knew him first at Clapham he was then a gardener—be only knew my Christian name—on Wednesday evening 10th Nov after eight o clock I met him in the General Post-office when he left off duty—I went according to his appointment—he had told me that as I was in bad circumstances if he had a few shillings to lend me he would do so—I made an appointment to meet him next day at the George and Gate Gracechurch-street—he did not come—I afterwards met him at the Four Swans Bishopsgate-street not by appointment but I knew he would be there and went at a little before five and met him—he then told me the reason he did not keep his appointment in the morning was on account of illness that he had borrowed the money of a man in the Post-office he did not say his name—he pulled his purse out and showed me the note—he said he had not been able to get it changed—he did not give it into my hands then—I did not see it open then—it was very dirty—it was a country note—he did not say what note it was or the amount—he was then going to the Post-office to go on duty and said when he got there he should plead illness get off duty very early and return to me at the George and Gate as soon as he could—I went there but he did not come—next day about a quarter to three I met him accidentally very near the George and Gate and asked him why he failed in keeping his appointment the night before and the reason he deceiver me so—he said he could not get off duty as he anticipated and directly he did he proceeded home he was so unwell—I afterwards went with him into the street—he asked me which way I was going and asked me to walk with him—we went to the Flowerpot in Bishopsgate-street—he then said I have not been able to get change for this note as it is a country note —he pulled out a green silk purse and produced the note—I opened it according to his wish—it was a Wisbeach and Lincolnshire Band-note—I have no doubt of this being it produced from its general appearance and it is very dirty and the writing and all corresponds—it appears to be the same—I did not observe anything on the back of it—I had it in my hands and gave it into the prisoner s hands and he gave it me back and told me to take the purse and note and get it changed for him—it was a green silk purse with steel beads and slides—I said the bank where it was payable was the best place to go and he asked me to go for him to the bank and get charge—I told him it was payable at Barclay s—I had looked at it and read it—I was to get nothing but 5s which he had promised to lend me—he said he would lend me the money when he got charge for it—he told me he had got the note from a servant in the post-office and he had to return one-half of the and keep 5l for which he was to pay interest—he did not go for the charge himself as he said he had never been to a bank to get change and if I understood it better did I mind going for him—I went to Barclay s with the note in one band and the purse in the other on the way I met a policeman named Lewis who I know well in Gracechurch-street—I spoke to him showed him the note and afterwards went to Barclay s and presented it to the first person on the right a gentleman in spectacles—he gave me a 10l Bank of England note for it which I changed with Mr Nutt the landlord of the George and Gate for nine sovereigns and two half-sovereigns to the best of my recollection—about ten minutes past three I went to the four Swans where the prisoner was to wait till I came back with the change—I found him there put the gold into the purse and gave it him—I told him I had got a 10l Bank of England note at Barclay s and had changed it at Mr Nutt s—he seemed perfectly satisfied and said On considering it over in my mind I can spare you half a sovereign and you must return it me as soon as you get into a situation—I stopped with him till five o clock till the mail cart came for him—I gave him all the money and he returned me half a sovereign—that was on Friday 12th—on that day week I saw Peak the officer told him something and on the same day between five and six o clock I was brought before the prisoner in the presence of Peak and Mr Peacock the solicitor and one or two others—I stated the whole of the particular of my meeting him and hid giving me the note on the Friday previous about the middle of the day not recollecting the exact time the prisoner directly said You know better then that it was three o clock —it was about three o clock—when asked if he knew me he said I know him very well but I do not know his name Prisoner I had no note on Thursday night and I had not time enough to show it you or say anything to you I was there within three minutes of the time of my going on the cart I had sixpence in my pocket and gave you fourpence-halfpenny because you said you had had no food all day which I have done many times before Witness You showed it me on Thursday night you did not open it it was folded up as you took it out of the purse you said I have got the note but have not been able to get it changed we drunk together you gave me a fourpenny-piece JURY Q Do you know Hillier A No I was in the habit of going to the Post-office—I have a friend named Wright a sub-sorter there—I believe the prisoner has only lent me a shilling sixpence and a fourpenny piece MATTHEW PEAK I am a constable attached to the Post-office—on 18th Nov about five o clock in consequence of information I went to the receiving-house in Bishopsgate-street and after waiting a short time saw the prisoner I asked if he had had a country 10l note lately—he said No —I asked if he had not given one to a person named Clatherow—he said no he did not know the name—I said it is a young man that is generally in Gracechourch-street—he said he did not know him—I asked where he was on 12th Nov —he said he was at home from about ten till between four and five—I took him to the Post-office and he was again asked whether he had had a 10l note—he denied it—Clatherow was then produced before him—he said Oh yes I know this person —Clatherow then stated what he has repeated this morning and when he came to that part where he said he met him about the middle of the day the prisoner said No it was about three o clock —I searched him and found this green purse with steal beads produced —it contains 6 sovereigns 2 half-sovereigns and 5d in copper—he was asked to give some account of the note and whether he had anything to say and said he should say nothing now JURY Q Did he say how he became possessed of the money A He said he had borrowed it and the purse from his brother-in-law Prisoner I think I said I was going to pay it to my brother-in-law Witness I think that was it JOHN LEWIS City policeman 581 I have known Clatherow two or three months—about 11th or 12th Nov about the middle of the day I saw him in Gracechurch-street—he showed me a Wisbeach and Lincolnshire bank-note—I do not recollect the amount—I believe this to be it—it was payable at Barclay s—it was dirty and had a piece of paper bigger then the note itself fastened on the back as if he had been divided—I directed him to Barclay s and he went in that direction—in about ten minutes I saw him in Gracechurch-steet again—I was on duty there—he spoke to me—he had something in his hand which appeared like a Bank of England note—I did not look at it—it was folded WILLIAM HUNT I am a clerk at Barclay s bank Lombard-street—Gurney s the Wisbeach and Lincolnshire bank draw on us—it is my duty to take the numbers of their notes in this book produced —here is a 10l note of that bank No 3606 entered by me on the 13th Nov as having been paid on the 12th—I have several entries of notes of that bank on the same day—I have no entry of a note of Gurney s No 6306—I enter the numbers from the notes themselves JOHN GULLIVER I am a clerk in Barclay s bank—I collect from the cashiers the country notes paid during the day and make memorandums of then in my book—among the country notes I received on 12th Nov from Mr Mitchell I have an entry of a 10l note of the Wishbeach and Lincolnshire bank—it was a single note—the cashier had others when I collected them but I entered every note distinctly—if Mr Mitchell receive a parcel of country notes at the counter he give them twist at the corner and hands them to me—I received this from him as a note cashed singly—the parties that pay the notes make an indorsement on the outside note if more then one—the figure 10 is eadorsed on this and M meaning Mitchell —that is how Mr Mitchell is in the habit of marking the notes—my entry is a Wisbeach note 10 under the head of Mr Mitchell s notes—I do not take the numbers in the course of business the note would be handed to Mr Hunt to enter on the following morning JOHN MITCHELL I am cashier at Barclay s bank—I cashed this note on 12th Nov about three o clock—I sit at the first desk just as you enter the door behind the door on the right as you go in—I wear spectacles when I am at business—it is part of my duty to enter in this book the numbers of the notes cashed by me—I have made a mistake in entering the number of this note instead of entering it 3606 as it is on the note I have entered it 6306—here is a figure 10 on it and my initial underneath—there are figures which appear like 1-11-47—my mark enables me to say that it was paid singly—I gave in exchange a 10l Bank of England note No 06433 dated 11th Oct —this is it produced —that was the only Wisbeach note paid singly on that day—I have looked through the book with a view to answer this question JOSIAH RUMBALL I am a clerk at Gurney s bank at Wisbeach—note No 3606 of that bank was in circulation at the beginning of Nov —there are not two notes of the same number and letter—I should say there is no 10l note of ours in circulation No 6306—I cannot say whether it is in or not of my own knowledge—this note 3606 has not been cancelled—it was in circulation at the time JAMES NUTT I keep the George and Gate Gracechurch-street—on 19th Nov I changed 10l Bank of England note for the time-keeper of the omnibuses at Gracechurch-street—I have known him for a number of years I gave him gold for the note—Clatherow was with him—I did not put say mark on it—I parted with it in about two minutes to Theakston the collector who was in my bar-parlour—I saw him write my name on it WILLIAM THEAKSTON I am in the employment of Messrs Nicholson the distillers—Mr Nutt is a customer of ours—I received this 10l Bank of England note from him I do not recollect on what day—here is my writing J Nutt on it—I only received the money from him once in Nov JAMES HARRIS I am time-keeper to the omnibuses in Gracechurch-street—on 12th Nov Clatherow asked me to get a 10l note changed for him—I went with him to Mr Nutt s who I have known many years got it changed and gave the change to Clatherow BENJAMIN RULE I am the driver of a mail cart—I know the prisoner by his riding in the cart with the letter-bags and I have seen seen Clatherow—I have seen him and the prisoner meet two or three times at the Post-office in Bishopsgate-street and they appeared very friendly Prisoner s Defence I do not deny changing the note or having it is my possession but the other things I never had as to Clatherow s stating that I showed him the note on the Thursday night I did not I had no note in my possession on Friday morning when I was on duty in the office taking up No 6 division letters I put my tray out of the way and there I picked the note up in the office I went and changed it on the Friday afternoon and paid 3l 10s away that night and the rest of the money the officer has now in his possession my wife had been ill with a fever and my children with the measles I had got very much behind and the temptation of the note was too strong for me to resist I through my self on the mercy of the Court Rev W Blunt of Merchant Tailors School deposed to the prisoner s

t18480403-1038  1038 HORACE BROWN stealing whilst employed in the Post-office two letters containing money the property of the Post-Master General MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JOHN FORBES I am a messenger in the inland department of the Postoffice—the prisoner was a letter-carrier there—it was part of his duty to assist occasionally in taking letters from the stampers to the sorters—it is a very large room—the stampers tables are distinguished by letters On 15th March the prisoner was taking letters from the H table to the sorters table—I was placed so as to have a view of persons so employed—about seven o clock in the morning the prisoner separated two or three letters from the others and put them between the fingers of his left hand then took a handful more up with both hands carried them to the sorters table and put some of them down—he brought some away towards the railway department put his hand down and put a few under his waistcoat with his right hand—I told Mr Barnard the superintending president s clerk and lost sight of the prisoner for two or three minutes—I went back and saw him about to ascend by the machine which is a frame with ten or twelve floors which constantly aseends by the action of a steam-engine—I got up too late to go by the same stage as he did and got on to the next—he could arrive at the floor above a little before me—when I got up he was going towards his seat—I told Mr Harris the assistant-inspector of letter-carriers—he went down with the prisoner to the inspector s room by the machine—I left them there and fetched Peste—these letters produced bear the inland stamp of 15th March and were stamped at the H table Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Who told you to watch A Mr Barnard—he is not here MATTHEW PEAKE I am an officer of the Post-office At a little after eight o clock on the morning of 15th March I was called into the inspector s room and found the prisoner—I searched him but found no letters—he had not hat—it was brought down by a letter-carrier Brown accompanied me and Mr Last one of the inspectors to his lodgings 6 Surrey-street Camberwell to search—I found four sovereigns two half-sovereigns and seventeen crowas—I searched the privy—I am sure there were no letters there then—the prisoner was in the washhouse close by—he knew that I got a light to put down—when he saw me come out he asked leave to go in—no one had been in in the interval—I stood at the door till he came out then looked again and said You have thrown a letter down here —he said Nonsense you are mistaken —I said It was not here just now and has been put down while you were in here —I was taking off the seat and heard an alarm of his being gone—there is a door out of the yard into the street—I pursued him calling Stop thief —he ran 400 or 500 yards—I brought him back pursued my search and found these two letters in the privy—I took him back to the post office and said I must search him again—he said it was of no use he had got no letters about him—I said I can t believe you must have had two when I searched me they were in my had up stairs —they were both sealed—I opened them by the Magistrate s order—one is addressed to The proprietors of the Ecclesiastical Gazette 9 Southampton-street London and contained 6d the other to The Rev J P Pearce Tetsworth Oxfordshire and contained 1s 6d GUILTY Aged 29 — Transported for Ten Years MR BODKIN stated that several letters had been opened the money taken out and the letters then forwarded re-sealed and bearing the impression of a seal which was found at the prisoner s house 
t18480612-1479  1479 WILLIAM CLUETT stealing whilst employed under the Post-office a post letter containing 2 half-crowns the property of Her Majesty s Post-master General Other Counts varying the manner of stating the charge Messrs Clarkson and Bodkin conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM EDWIN BASELEY I am a letter-carrier in the General Post-office and have been so four years and a quarter—I was employed at the Stepney-branch office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier also employed there—on 19th May about eight in the morning we were both there in the course of our duty—he was engaged at a table sorting the letters that had come that morning from the General Post-office—I was at my own desk that did not command a view of his situation—after the letters were sorted he brought some to his desk to throw them off into walks for delivery—I then sat immediately opposite to him—I saw him throw a letter upon a few old or dead letters which were on the desk—I heard something jingle when the letter fell—it sounded like money—he threw it with the seal uppermost and I saw that it was sealed with red wax—I then saw him take more dead and old letters from his side pocket throw them on this letter and then put the whole lot into his left coat pocket—as he was taking them up I noticed a large figure 4 on this letter in red ink—he then said to me Basely I have nothing to give up this morning —meaning no dead letters to go to the Dead-office—in about four minutes he went out of the office to deliver his letters—a letter addressed to Grove-road Mile-end-road would not be in his walk but in Paveley s—on the prisoner s going out I went to Mr Chamberlain the inspector of the district and made a communication to him and in about three minutes the prisoner was brought back to the office—Mr Chamberlain asked him to show him the letters he had in his pocket—he produced nine old and dead letters from his pocket—Mr Chamberlain asked me whether the letter I had spoken of was among them I said No —he then asked the prisoner whether he had any more in his possession—he said No —Mr Chamberlain said he must see further and was about to put his hand into the prisoner s pocket when the prisoner put his own hand in and pulled out this letter produced —it is the letter which 1 had previously seen—I said so—it was sealed with red wax and the figure 4 was on it— he had in bis bag the letters which he had to deliver in his own walk—they were separate from this—he was then detained in custody Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q I see the name of Baseley is on this letter A I wrote that by Mr Chamberlain s order when he asked if I could swear to it—that was after it was delivered up by the prisoner—this letter was io the walk of another carrier who is now at the office—I can-not say how near he sat to the prisoner—the carriers are allowed to keep dead letters for a week—there are a good many sailors wives and persons whom it is difficult to find in that district and sometimes when a vessel is not in we keep letters till she is in—we sometimes keep them two or three weeks—I do not know whether the letters that were taken from his pocket are here—I could see him distinctly from where I was sitting and he could see me through the wires that were between us—a person named King was sitting on one side of me—I do not recollect who was sitting on the other—there are partitions between us—you can only see the person opposite you not those at the side unless you look on one side—the wires are crossways in squares large enough to put two fingers through—I have no doubt that I saw the 4 —I noticed particularly that the letter was sealed with red wax—I saw both sides of the letter—I had never seen the letter before—it ought to have gone to Paveley—I had seen him that morning—I passed him coming into the office and I saw him beside me sorting the letters on the same side as I was on the same side of the desk and opposite to the prisoner—it was after that I saw this transaction—Mr Chamberlain sent a letter-carrier after the prisoner—I have been reported twice during the last twelve months—it may be three times—once for detaining letters and twice for impudence to the inspector—I have not been reported oftener than three times in the last twelve months—I was reported once for drunkenness two years ago—I was said to have detained three letters—Mr Sculthorpe has never cautioned or reprehended me—Mr Smith did for the same thing about seven weeks ago—I was never charged with dishonesty—I went and delivered the letters that I detained—I was put oil duty for it—I have not heard and do not know that the prisoner has petitioned that he might be removed from my walk or I from his—he may have done so—I never heard a word about it before this—I have quarrelled with him once or twice about little things but not lately—the last was about two months back—that was about a letter of Mr Saull which he ought to have delivered at ten o clock instead of which I had it in my possession at two—I had no right to have it in my possession at all—there was nothing in it—he gave it to me at two with the other missorts—I suppose he thought to get me into a scrape—I think he had some malice towards me—it was Mr Saull who reported me to the inspector—the prisoner never reported me nor have I been reprehended on his complaint—I was not suspended on Mr Saull s complaint—I have not been charged with any offence to my knowledge—I was never charged with taking a pair of browsers—I believe my wife took them away in mistake when we were moving—the party fetched them back while I was out and laughed about it MR BODKIN Q How long did you detain these letters that you were blamed for A For one night-—I had delivered them before I was reported—none of them contained money—no part of the wire-work was large enough for a letter to pass through—the prisoner had been sorting letters at the table—when the letters first come in they are put on the table to be sorted—all the carriers do not assist in sorting—they sort them to the different pigeon-holes to which they belong BENJAMIN PAVELEY I am a letter-carrier at the Stepney District Branch Post-office—it was my duty to deliver a letter addressed Gross-road Mile End-road Cross-examined Q Did a similar letter to this one with money come monthly A It used to come frequently—I cannot say whether monthly or weekly—it was a well-known writing and known to contain money—we have marked divisions for each walk to sort the letters into and we take ourletters out of those boxes—they are sent from the General Post-office in agreat bag tied up in large bundles—they are then untied and sorted and placed in the boxes according to the districts—each carrier takes a bundle and unties it—the bundle may contain letters for his walk and for others also—I saw Baseley there that morning—he was not very near to me COURT Q Then it is not extraordinary for a letter-carrier while sorting before he gets to his desk to have in his hand letters for sorting which do not belong to his walk A It sometimes happens by mistake—the letters come in packets of 200 or 300 not sorted MR BALLANTINE to WILLIAM EDWIN BASELEY Q Did you hand over any letters to the prisoner that morning A No not afterwards—I did hand him some letters that morning after they had been thrown on his own walk—after I saw him in possession of the letter and before 1 gave information—I might have given him about thirty they were for his walk—there were no dead ones among them—they had come that morning and I got them from the sorting-box—I handed them over the railing after he had left the sorting-table and after he had come to his desk—it is a common occurrence to get the letters from the sorting-boxes—I found letters among mine which belonged to him—upon my oath I did not among those hand over this letter to him WILLIAM CHAMBERLAIN I am an inspector of letter-carriers at the Stepney Post-office—the prisoner has been employed there some time—his district was Limehouse—I know Baseley—I was present when the prisoner left that morning—a communication was made to me about two minutes after that I sent for him back again—he returned—I told him that it had been intimated to me that he had a letter that did not belong to him—he said he had not—I requested him to let me see what letters he had—he took nine dead letters out of his side-coat pocket and told me that was all he had—they do not carry letters for delivery in their pockets but these were dead ones—I did not ask to see the bag—I asked Baseley if he saw the letter that he spoke about among those—he said No and I said to the prisoner I must see further and was in the act of putting my hand into his left-hand coat pocket when he put his own hand in and took out this letter—I asked him how it was he had that—he said he did not know he had it—it was sealed—I told him he must go with me to the General Post-office and I took him to the president Mr Sculthorpe in whose presence he was further searched—a letter addressed as this is would not belong to his delivery and he had no right to have it—he would have the opportunity of taking such a letter while sorting—there is no particular bundle for each man to sort but each of them take a bundle from the bag for the purpose of sorting into the different districts—this letter ought to have gone to the Mile End district—the prisoner would have no right to have such a letter about him Cross-examined Q Supposing a person took out dead letters on his walk he would return them at the end of the day if the parties to whom they were directed were not forthcoming A That would be his duty—they ought to be given up every hour and taken out every hour—the letter was in his uniform coat pocket which is a large pocket MR BODKIN Q Are the dead letters those where the parties to whom they are directed cannot be found A Yes—they are brought back to the office and should be given up every hour and then would go to the dead letter office—it is not the custom to take them out time after time—if they are General Post letters and the person could not be found they would be delivered back on the first Monday or Thursday after—if they do not find the person the first time they take them out again—they keep them in their possession in the interval—there is a drawer on purpose—if it is a London district letter it is given up the next time they come into the office—they should not carry out such a letter twice—letters with money in them are treated just the same—this letter was opened at the Police-court in my presence by Mrs Foster to whom it was addressed—it had money in it WALTER ROBERTSON SCULTHORPE I am President of the London District Post-office The prisoner was brought by Mr Chamberlain to the General Post-office on 19th May—Mr Chamberlain in his presence told me he had a letter in his pocket containing money and that when he was asked to produce it he did not—he took out other letters which are termed old letters leaving this one containing money in his pocket—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for the letter being in his pocket—he said he did not know it was there—I said You could not have it in your pocket without knowing it it is so heavy —he then said It is the first offence I am guilty of —I then gave him into custody and gave instructions to search him and his house Cross-examined Q Are those the very words he used A Yes It is the first offence I am Guilty of —it was not I was ever guilty of — looking at his deposition —I see it is so here—I may be mistaken—I believe the prisoner has borne a good character—he has been four years in the em-ployment and I believe he has never been reported—I never heard of his having made a complaint against Baseley JAMES GILSOK FOSTER I live at 16 Grove-road Mile End-road On 18th May I was at Birmingham and sent this letter to my wife enclosing two half-crowns in it—I took the money to the Post-office and paid 4d postage FANNY FOSTER I am the wife of the last witness I never received the letter until it was shown me before the Magistrate where I opened it—it con-tained two half-crowns COURT to W E BASELET Q Were you in the habit of sorting letters for the prisoner A No—I have given him letters for his walk without putting them into the pigeon-hole—there are no pigeon-holes at the desk—it was at the desk belonging to his walk that I gave him the letters on this morning—I am quite positive I did not give him this letter—I saw this letter after I gave him the others—I mean before GUILTY Aged 24 —Strongly recommended to mercy on account of hischaracter — Transported for Seven Years There was another indictment against the prisoner

Postmaster-general MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution SAMUEL SPAREPOINT In June last I was living at Deal—I formerly resided in the neighbourhood of the Hackney-road and had occasion to make a pledge at a pawnbroker s in that neighbourhood On Wednesday 12th July I enclosed in a letter the duplicate relating to the pledge two sixpences and two postage stamps—I wafered it with two wafers and addressed it Mr F Cotton 28 Hackney-road Middlesex and gave it my wife to to take to the Post-office—these fragments of paper produced are parts of that letter and this is the duplicate ESTHER ELIZABETH SPAREPOINT On 12th July I received a letter from my husband which I put into the Post-office at Deal about noon WELCOME COLE I am an inspector of letter-carriers in the London District of the Post-office—the prisoner has been employed as a letter-carrier of the London District upwards of three years On 13th July about seven o clock in the morning he was employed in sorting letters at the chief office for the Shoreditch branch—while sorting them I saw him feel the letters as I considered in a very suspicious manner so as to see if they contained anything—I observed this memorandum-book produced lying open on the table—I saw him look round as if to see if the inspector was watching him—shortly afterwards I saw him place as I supposed a letter in that book—his back was towards me at the time—he closed the book in a very hurried manner and it still remained on the board while he was sorting the other letters—he then looked round again and put the book hurriedly into his breast-pocket—I communicated what I had seen to Mr Bell the president on duty—it was then about half-past seven COURT Q Was it your duty to see whether anything irregular was going on A I was not actually on duty that morning but from instructions I had received I watched the prisoner HENRY JAMESON I am one of the inspectors of letter-carriers On the morning of 13th July after I had had some communication from Mr Bell the president on duty I watched the prisoner—I observed him go towards the stairs that lead to the water-closets and desired him to go to Mr Bell—I went with him—Mr Bell said he believed he had a memorandum book in his pocket—he said Yes —Mr Bell asked him to produce it—he did so—Mr Bell looked into it and returned it to him—he said that would do and let him go—the prisoner then went down stairs and returned in five or ten minutes with his breakfast in his hand—about five minutes after that William Taylor a letter-carrier brought up part of a letter WILLIAM TAYLOR I am a letter-carrier in the London District-office On 13th July at a quarter to eight o clock I was on duty and had occasion to go down stairs to the water-closets—I went into the centre one of the three—on the left side of the seat I found this part of a letter—I took it up stairs and gave it to Mr Jameson—the seal was not broken—the direction was on it as it is now—it appears to have been torn in half WILLIAM BLACKBURN I am a plumber On the morning of 13th July between eight and nine o clock I was directed to examine the basin of the centre water-closet at the London District Post-office and in the trap under the basin I found this part of a letter and a duplicate in it—I gave it to Mr Smith ROBERT SMITH I am superintending-president of the London District Post-office The fragments of a letter was brought to me on 13th July—I sent for the prisoner who was brought to my room a little before ten o clock—I put these parts of the letter together so as to ascertain that it formed one letter and so as to see its contents—I charged him with stealing a letter that morning—I had the fragments in my hand—he said I have no letter about me —I said I know that but you had the letter in your pocket when you were taken into Mr Bell s room —he made no reply to that—I then said The letter contained a duplicate 1s and two postage stamps and you stole a letter on Saturday morning —he said no he did not—Cole then asked him if he had any postage stamps about him—he said he had two—I said Produce them and he said they were in his office coat-pocket—that coat was sent for and examined—there were none there—he then produced a pocket-book which was examined but nothing found in it—I said Peak the officer must be sent for to search him and the prisoner then took his watch from his pocket and on his opening it two postage stamps were found in the case—I then said These postage stamps were stolen from the letter —he made no reply to that—I then took him to the solicitor s office but before doing so I asked if he had any explanation to offer—he said I did it I am very sorry I do not know what could have induced me to do it but I did not take the letter on Saturday —I think he said it was distress that made him do it—I think his wages were 21s a week—he had only just married and I expressed my regret to him at the time on account of his wife—a letter posted at Deal at the latter part of the day would arrive at the General Post-office about five next morning—a letter addressed as this one would go to the Shoreditch Branch and would have come into the prisoner s hands to sort Button Fidler a carpenter and builder Thomas Cook a draper and Edward Dyer innkeeper all of Wansted gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Ten Years

MR PRENDERGAST Q Are you sure and Co was on it A Yes I would not have signed it without—a clerk filled it up and I signed it—this Henry Grainger is not my clerk s writing or that of any person I know—I never saw it before to my knowledge—the clerk that seals them almost always posts them—there is no rule about it—I have four or five clerks—Moses Houghton generally posts the letters MOSES CARTWRIGHT HOUGHTON I am a clerk to Mr Grainger On Saturday 1st July I took a quantity of letters from different parts of the office and posted some in King William-street and some in Lombard-street about ten minutes to six o clock in the same state in which I found them—I believe they were all sealed—I sealed some—other clerks may have sealed others Cross-examined Q You cannot say you posted this letter A No—I cannot say positively whether I sealed any that day—there is none of my writing on this check it is Mr Wilton s our head clerk s—I did not see him write it—he always fills up the checks—I do not draw checks—I took the 2d letters to King William-street and the general ones to Lombard-street—this was a 2d one—I will not swear I took this to King William-street it may have gone with the general ones by mistake—I am sure I divided them JAMES PONSFORD I live at South Wharf-road Paddington and know Mr Grainger I did not receive a letter from him on 1st July containing a check for 29l 7s 1d —I open my letters myself MICHAEL DEARBERG I am in the employ of Moses and Son Aldgate On Tuesday 4th July the prisoner and another man came and ordered some clothes—he gave the name of Marshall and the other that of Spring—the prisoner was to have a suit of clothes and Spring a pair of trowsers and a waistcoat—they came to 7l 12s —I asked them for a deposit—the prisoner said he would pay for the whole and tendered me this check—it had and Co across it but not the word Bank —I believe tlut was put on at the Bank of England our bankers—I did not see Henry Grainger on it—I took them to be measured—they asked for the balance of the check—I said we had sent it to the bankers to see if it was correct—Spring left—we found the check to be correct and gave the prisoner the balance—the clothes were to be ready on the Thursday and were to be called for—they were not sent for till the 10th when a lad named Cremer came with this note— produced—read— Marshall will feel obliged to Messrs Moses and Son by their sending by bearer his clothes and the trowsers and vest and trusts they will be done according to promise Mr Marshall being from town prevented his sending before now —July 10th 1848 —a communication had been made to me from the Post-office authorities—we detained the boy while we sent to the Post-office and afterwards gave him the clothes Cross-examined Q Spring went away after he was measured A Yes—the prisoner went over the warehouse with me while I sent to the Bank—it took about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he was rather in a state of liquor—he knew I was sending to the Bank—he was not at all agitated—he did not hear me send—he waited till the messenger returned DANIEL CREMER I live at No 3 Crown-court Fleet-street On Monday morning 10th July I went with a relation Mrs Fyler to the Duke of York s Column—I saw the prisoner there—I did not know him before—he bad a blue coat with a red collar black trowsers and some crape and a cockade in his hat like a postman—Mrs Fyler spoke to him—they were together about five minutes—he gave her a letter from his waistcoat pocket which she brought to me and gave me 1s —in consequence of her directions I took the letter to Messrs Moses—I waited there some time and received a parcel—I walked as far as the Bank with it I then ran across the road and two gentlemen came up and took me to the Post-office Cross-examined Q Were you examined before Mr Peacock A Yes—the person who took me was there part of the time and then he went out—Mr Peacock told me the check was stolen—that did not frighten me only I did not like to have anything to do with it—I went to Bow-street and was then allowed to go home MATTHEW PEAK I am an officer of the Post-office On 10th July about nine or ten o clock in the evening I went to the Crown public-house Crown-court Fleet-street—Cremer lives two or three doors past there—I found the prisoner there—there were a great many people in the room—I should think he would know me—I crossed the room to speak to a person turned round and the prisoner was gone—I searched for him for several days—bills were printed offering a reward of 20l for him—on the morning of 27th I went to the Money Order-office at Liverpool with one of the Liverpool Police and saw the prisoner—I said to a gentleman who had a money order in his hand This is John Prenderville whom I am seeking —he said That is not my name you do not know me —he gave his name Thomas Connor—I do not think he gave any name at the Money Order-office—I accompanied him to the station and said Prenderville we received or Mr Edwards received your last letter —I think I said we first—he said What is in that letter is quite true —I said I took him for stealing a letter containing a check for 29l —he did not say anything—I took four letters from his pocket addressed Thomas Connor 18 Rupert-street Liverpool — producted —he was afterwards searched by a policeman who handed me nine sovereigns—next day I took him to the railway to bring him to London— at the station he said I did not steal the letter on the Tuesday that I went to Moses I met a man near Temple-bar who I knew very well he asked me to go and have something to drink I went with him to a public-house and after having some brandy-and-water he said I have a check but I cannot get it cashed it must go through a bankers I have been to the bankers and they will not cash it that he told him he found the check and said If you are amind to go with me to Moses and order some clothes we can get it cashed there we went to Moses and were measured for the clothes and finding a delay there I had suspicions that all was not right but as I had gone on so far with it I would not leave it in a minute afterwards I turned round and missed the man and was then quite certain that it was not right the balance of the check was brought to me I went down stairs met the same man in the street and shared the money with him on the Friday afterwards I saw him again but I caught a glimpse of a sorter at the chief office I cannot recollect who I then said to this man I can see where this check came from it came out of a letter he said Yes and you had better say nothing about it or else it will be the worse for you —I brought him to London—he said he gave the name of Marshall as that was the first name that came into his head—I got this letter from Cork produced after I had been to Liverpool but 1 had seen it before on the 18th—it was shown him at the Post-office and he said it was his writing Cross-examined Q Did he say he had endeavoured to find out the sorter that he might give information A Yes—Mrs Fyler was not at the Crown she was in custody WILLIAM EDWARDS I am inspector of letter-carriers at the London District Branch office A letter addressed to Mr Ponsford ought to go to Paddington—letters in the vicinity of Paddington are delivered at the North-road Branch office—the prisoner was employed there and was on duty there on 1st July—it was his duty to assist in sorting the letters of that division—this letter would go to that district—it should go to an office at Paddington where the letter-carriers meet and not to the office where the prisoner was but letters are sometimes missorted—sometimes we have 60 missorted—letters addressed to Mr Ponsford have come to the office since this—Mr Ponsford is in the Paddington district—the prisoner was last on duty on 10th July—he came on 11th but Peak came to see him and he went out saying he was indisposed—on 1st July he was a supernumary letter-carrier on the Edgware-road in the vicinity of South Wharf-road—he continued there till the 4th doing duty for a sick man—if a letter addressed to Mr ponsford accidentally got into his possession it would be his duty to give it up for me to return it to St Martin s-le-graud—this letter addressed to me is in the prisoner s writing—I first saw it at Bow-street after Peak had been to Liverpool—the letter to Messrs Moses is also the prisoner s writing Cross-examined Q Have you seen him write A Yes I am inspector of his office I have seen his writing on the back of letters saying he cannot find the parties—this letter from Cork seems to be written in a hurried way— read Cork July 18th Sir —having succeeded in reaching my native shore my first step was to obtain some information from Bow-street—I find by the Times of Friday the affair is greatly exaggerated—the amount of the cheque was 29l 7s 1d and also the boy has not told a particle of truth I dare say my absenting myself from duty with other colorable circumstances must have surprised you and I believe every man in your office which induces me to give you a full statement of the real facts of the case not that I am so vain as to think that anything I could say would be a paliation of my folly nor my subterfuge for my guilt But this I declare to you and to the God who knows it well and before whom I must at some future day appear and I hope before I appear in Newgate that I had no knowledge of how the cheque was obtained until the Friday night following the fatal 4th July and up to that melancholy day my character and integrity was as pure and unstained as it was at the age of seven But lo there was a fatal hour and that was the hour of two o clock the bargain was concluded and I have sold that which I thought the wealth of Peru could not purchase—my character My colleague in iniquity who was a person totally unconnected with the office but who was concerned in some same way with a mercantile house deluded me into the belief that chance threw it in his own way first taking good care to use those stimulants necessary on such occasions—brandy and water The fact was as I have subsequently discovered and when too late that it came from head quarters the sorting office Finding I was made a complete tool of and that I could scarcely escape detection I considered it more advisable to inhale the breeze of my native mountains than the air of Bermuda having by mere accident met this woful acquaintance of mine and I believe when every other remedy was tried by himself induced me to accompany him to the Minories —I am Sir &c J P WILLIAM BROWN I am a letter-carrier On 2nd July I delivered the letters in the district in which Mr Ponsford lives—I delivered all that were given me—it is in the country delivery and letters are delivered on Sunday morning WALTER ROBERTSON SCULTHORPE I am president of the London district Post-office A letter posted in Lombard-street at six o clock or a little before on Saturday addressed as this is would be delivered next morning as Paddington is in the country delivery—if within the three-mile stone it would be delivered on Saturday night The prisoner received a good character GUILTY of receiving Aged 25 — Transported for Ten Years

t18481023-2270  2270 WILLIAM MILTON PUGSLEY stealing whilst employed under the Post-Office a post-letter containing 1s the money of Her Majesty s post-master General MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution THOMAS GAPES I am inspector of letter-carriers at the Charing cross Branch-office—the prisoner has been a letter-carrier at that office for three or four years in the Pimlico district—a letter addressed to Emanuel Hospital Schools would be in his delivery—a letter posted at Beverley in Yorkshire on 3rd Aug would be delivered in town on the morning of the 4th about nine or from nine to ten—after his delivery he came to the office about twenty minutes past twelve—he was then taken into custody upon a process of the County Court—the officers were waiting at the office for his return—they brought him to me and asked if I would see that all his letters were taken from him before he was taken as they could not take him while he had any letters in his possession—I desired the prisoner to give up all his letters to his partner George Feltham—he said he had done so—he was then taken by the officers—this letter produced bears the Beverley post-mark of 3rd Aug and the London post-mark of 4th—it is open—it has been wafered—I know the prisoner s handwriting—I believe this other letter to be his— produced Cross-examined by MR BALLAXTINE Q Do you know about the number of letters he would have to deliver of a morning A I cannot say—I have known instances of money escaping from letters—if such a thing happened while the postman was going his rounds it would be his duty to explain that to the party to whom he delivered the letter if he knew the letter out of which it came—if he could not tell it would be his duty to inform some person in authority and to receive directions as to what to do—he would not be justified in delivering money to a party with a letter unless he was quite ascertain that it belonged to that letter—he would not have any opportunity of seeing any of the superiors of the establishment until he was taken into custody—he did not appear to be much excited and agitated—the officers were not in the office—I told him that two persons were waiting for him and desired him to go out to them—he brought in his collection of letters with him—I have no idea how many there were—he brought them in in a bag—they were letters that he had collected from the different district offices JOSEPH KING I am a warden in the Westminster House of Correction—the prisoner was brought there on the 4th Aug under a process of the County Court—I was asked by another officer to come and search him and I did so—the first thing I searched was his hat—I turned up the leather lining and found a piece of newspaper put in as if the hat was too large for him—I said Have you anything else in the hat He said No I then tanned down the lining and there found the letter produced broken open—I said Halloo here is a letter He said Oh yes it is quite right I have deliverd the letter and am further going to deliver it to a Mrs Somebody mentioning some name which I forget in Chapel-street it was no such name as is on this letter—I turned the letter round and said It is directed to Master Geo Eastwood Emanuel Hospital School James-street Westminster London He said Yes if I can see the next postman that comes to the prison gate I will explain the whole particulars to him and give it to him to take it to where I was to take it to I was about to take it out of the envelope when he very quietly took it from my hand and said It is quite right —I had not read the contents of it—I said I don t think you will be allowed to see the next postman if you will tell me the particulars about it I will give it to the postman —He said I think you will not understand it I said Why is it not written in English —he said Yes but you won t understand it I continued to search him and the only money I found on him was a penny and he acknowledged that to be all he had but he wanted to send for some money—that was while I was searching him—I searched every pocket except his fob and I told him to turn that out—he said he had nothing in it —he bad given the letter back to me and I gave it to Maries who was also present during the search—I handed it to Marles with the other papers—he reported the case to the Governor and the Governor allowed the prisoner to see the next postman—I was not present—I did not read the letter and envelope at the time I was with the prisoner—it was about five minutes to two when I searched him and it was about half-past four the same afternoon that I saw it again—Marles was not present when I looked at it—the prisoner did not ask me for pen and ink to write a letter nor did I see him write a letter—next day I went to the General Post-office and accompanied Peak back to the prison—I was present when Peak saw the prisoner—Peak said to him You are charged with stealing a money-letter containing one shilling directed to Master Geo Eastwood Emanuel Hospital Schools James-street Westminster London He said I did not steal it I found the shilling in my pocket and meant to have returned it to the inspector on duty —I said How could you do that when you had only one penny in your pocket —he said he had made use of the money previous to coming in and he meant to have returned it Cross-examined Q You have told us two very long conversations am I to understand that you pledge yourself to the accuracy of them A Yes I have not the least doubt about them—I am sure he said he found the shilling in his pocket—that was said in Peak s presence—I did not hear him say he found the shilling in his bundle of letters—he said he collected his letters at Elliott s but I did not hear him say anything about finding the shilling in the bundle—it was my duty to search him accurately—this was the only letter I foand in his hat I swear that—I found another letter in his side coat-pocket which I gave up to the Post-office authorities—I think I gave it to Marles it was directed to a Miss Adams Montagu-place—it was sealed—I have not seen it since—the word Paid was put in the corner but there was was no post mark on it—there was one letter directed to himself—that was found in his breast-pocket be pulled out three or four memorandums or papers—the letter directed to himself was with one directed to Miss Adams—it was among the letters he pulled out—I took it out of his breast-pocket with the papers he had—he was very reluctant to take them out—I took part out and he took part out—he took out the letter directed to himself and gave it to me I gave it to Maries—I am quite sure that that letter was not found in his hat because I read the direction myself—I found the letter in his hat before I found the other papers—I searched the hat the first thing—I put that letter and the other papers all together and delivered them up to Maries—I did not find every thins that the prisoner had about him—he acknowledged that he had given up everything—I have been reprimanded for the manner in which I conducted this search—I now know that some other things were found on him—the person is not here that found them—when I found the letter he said it was all right he had delivered it and was going to further deliver it—that was the letter I found in his hat—he did not say he had to deliver it—I said at Bow-street that he said he had delivered it THOMAS MARLES I was present at the Westminster gaol when the prisoner was searched I told him to give up all his property—he was asked whether he had given up everything that he had—he said yes he had done—he had given up a newspaper and two or three letters which he took I believe from his breast coatpocket—King was present when he produced them—he had his hat on—I saw King take it off and search it and find a letter in it—that was after the other papers were found—I am quite sure of that—this is the envelope of the letter that was taken from his hat—I read the address—I took the letters and papers and wrapped them up in a parcel—kept them for about half an hour and then delivered the letter again to the prisoner—he said he wished to see the next postman that came in order that he might give the letter up to him—a postman came soon after wards and I was present when the prisoner saw him—the prisoner requested the postman to go to some place and obtain some money for him and to come again at at half-past five o clock—I do not remember the place he mentioned—the post-man said Very well and the prisoner was about to come away and I said I thought you had a letter to give him you have not given him the letter —I had given him back the letter before that—the prisoner said Yes I have a letter put his hand into his side pocket and pulled it out and asked the postman if he knew a somebody I believe it was Mrs Williams but I am not certain in Little Chapel-street—the postman said no he did not know the house—the prisoner said No I have forgotten the number and if you will return at half-past five I will write out an explanation for yon —the postman said If you have a letter I had better deliver that no doubt I shall rind it out —he said No if you call at half-past five and bring me some money I will write out the whole of the explanation for you —he showed the postman a letter—the postman took it and returned it to him again directly and he kept it for a short time after the postman left and then applied to me for paper to write out the explanation—I supplied him—he wrote more than one—he gave me one addressed to a person in Regent-street I gave it to the Governor—I saw no more of him—at the same time he gave me this letter addressed to the Inspector Charing-cross post-office—it is not one of the sheets of paper I supplied to him but I know he wrote it—it was wafered when he gave it me—the wafer was wet—it was open when I had it half an hour before—the Governor opened it and King was sent to Emanuel Hospital with it Cross-examined Q Was not the other letter to Mr Pridley Palace-street Pimlico A No I heard everything that was said during the search—I cannot swear he had not taken his hat off when the letters were being delivered up—King took it off afterwards—the letter taken out of it was placed on the top of the others tied up in a parcel and delivered by King to me—when it was found King said Here is a letter it is broken open —the prisoner said Oh yes it is all right I have delivered the letter but have been requested as a favour to deliver it to somebody else —he did not mention the name but said to some one in Chapel-street —a bit of 3 paper was also found in his hat—1d was found—he was asked if he had anything more—he said No that was all he had—King did not say anything about a shilling that day—I was not present when he was searched the second time MR BODKIN Q When you left the room had you any notion that that letter was supposed to contain money A No not till the Governor broke it open—it was open when it was found—I never read it—I am not aware that any one did till the Governor did—I have no recollection of money being mentioned during the whole time I and King were together MATTHEW PEAK On 5th Aug I received a warrant to apprehend the prisoner and went to the House of Detention and informed him I took him for stealing a letter adressed Master George Eastwood Emanuel Hospital Westminster containing 1s which ought to have been delivered the day before—I asked him if he had anything to say to it—he said No —I said Am I to take that as an answer —he stopped a minute and said I found the shilling among the letters and intended to take it back to the Inspector when I went back —that he found Master George Eastwood s letter open and he was going to ask the Inspector if he was to deliver the letter with or without the shilling—King said How could you do that when you only had a penny on you —he said No I made away with that and all I had before I came here Cross-examined Q This was at Tothill-fields prison A Yes—he did not say he found the shilling in his pocket but among the bundle of letters GEORGE EASTWOOD I am the father of George Eastwood who was at the hospital and live at Ramsburton Yorkshire On 3rd Aug I wrote this letter and put it in this envelope—it was directed by a friend of mine to my son—this is his writing—I wrote another letter to Mary Elizabeth Waters the schoolmistress at Emanuel—I wafered both letters about twelve o clock and gave them to Stevenson the post-carrier who goes between Ramsburton and Beverley—they were quite secure—I know no one living in Little Chapel-street London GEORGE EASTWOOD JUS I was at Emanuel Hospital School On 8th Aug I went home for the holidays—I received no note from my father about a week before and no shilling—I know no one in Little Chapel-street London Cross-examined Q Is the hospital at the end of Little Chapel-street A Yes JULIA SEYMOUR I was at Emanuel Hospital-school I recollect the letters coming on 4th Aug —they are put into a box—I saw the prisoner who is postman that morning about eleven o clock put three letters into the box—I bad heard the postman s bell ring before that—I took out the three letters and gave two to Mrs Waters and one to the boy Thompson—this letter addressed Master George Eastwood was not there SAMUEL MILDER I am a letter-carrier at the Charing-cross Post-office On 4th Aug between two and three o clock I had occasion to go to the westminstor House of Correction and in consequence of information from the Porter I went into the place and remained till the prisoner was brought—he put a letter in my hand—after I had read the address he took it back—he said he had a re-direction for it to go to Little Chapel-street—he could not think of the name or number but said he would endeavour to do so—he asked me to bring him some pens and writing-paper out of his drawer and to know what time I could take his money and his wages—the warder gave me the key of his drawer to get the pape rs and I then left the prison—I saw him again next day—he said he was so confused the day before at being brought there that ho could not tell rightly about the letter but that when he was in Elliott s brew house on untying his letters there was 1s fell out and he found a letter with the seal broken that he thought it had come out of and he intended to keep it to send to the Inspector at Charing-cross for his opinion Cross-examined Q Have you had money tumble out of your letters in the course of your delivery A No it never happened to me—once in the course of my sorting in the office a sixpence fell out of a letter by accident and it was given to the Inspector who was present at the time—I have gone the same beat as the prisoner—I have not known him to put letters aside in his hat—I have put letters into my hat on a wet day when I could not get at my pocket MR CLARKSON Q Have you ever put them in the lining of your half A No if money dropped from a letter in my possession I should think is my duty immediately to communicate it to the officer on duty GEORGE FELTHAM I was the prisoner s partner in the delivery of the district of Pimlico On the 4th Aug the day he was taken he did not hand me any letters The letter being read mentioned the fact of 1s being enclosed in it The letter written by the prisoner was as follows — To

t18481023-2272  2272 JOHN MILLS stealing a sovereign from a post-letter the property of the Postmaster-General MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JOHN PLAYLE I am an inspector of letter-carriers to the General Post-office The prisoner has been a letter-carrier there two year—his was the Paragon district New Kent-road In consequence of complaints I received instructions to enclose some money in a letter—I saw a sovereign enclosed in an envelope with a letter—I marked it and saw it marked and sealed up securely by Mr Russell and addressed Mr C Dyer 6 Wey-mouth-street New Kent-road London —this is it— produced —I posted It at the public place at the General Post-office—Gardner took it from my hand at five minutes past five o clock in the morning—I did not see the prisoner in the office till eleven—he had then been out and returned—it was his duty to go out with letters about eight—this address is not within his district—I received the letter from Mr Bell of the London district department about nine the same morning—it would go to that office in due course—it then had no coin in it—the seal was not broken but there was a fracture on the upper right corner of the envelope in the crease large enough for the sovereign to be taken out the raw edge of the note came to the aperture it could be shaken out—eleven was the time the prisoner would receive his weekly wages but he was desired to go into Mr Kelly s private room—Peak who was there searched him and produced 19s in silver in one end of a purse—there were two crowns—I do not know what was in the other—he was asked if he bad seen that letter that morning—he said No —he was asked if he had changed a sovereign—he said he had not—he was asked if he had been into any public-house—he said No —he was detained—I was in the same room about four in the afternoon when he was again asked if he had been into any public-house and changed a sovereign—he said No —he was asked if he had not been to the Rockingham Arms that day—he said be bad to get a pot of porter which he paid for with a fourpenny piece receiving 1d change—he was asked if he was sure he had not paid for it with a sovereign—he said he had not—Duncan was then brought in and said in the prisoner s hearing that he had given him change for a sovereign that morning—the prisoner said I did change a sovereign—I did not like to confess that I had done so after having said repeatedly that I had not I found it on my seat —Mr Kelly said Why did not you give it up you knew it was your duty to give it up to one of the Inspectors —I do not remember his answer—this is the sovereign—here is my mark—it was given me for the purpose from the public funds of the Post-office Cross-examined by MR PAREY Q Did the letter travel from Manchester to London A No the Manchester post-mark was put here—I gave Gardner five or six letters to give to the superintendent of the sorting—all contained marked sovereigns and one other coin as well—the letters were in a lump in my hand—I did not count them there were not more than eight—I can see the mark without a glass—I marked each of the other coins in different ways—here is a memorandum of the mark I put on this sovereign it is a dot after Dei it is a Victoria sovereign of 1846 MR BODKIN Q A letter posted in this way would come into Gardner s hands A Not of necessity—this was a special case I made him a receiver for the purpose—it would undergo two or three different sortings THOMAS RUSSELL I am an Inspector of letter-carriers On 29th Sept I enclosed this sovereign in a letter—here is my mark on it—I put it into this envelope addressed to Mr Dyer—it was delivered to Mr Playle with others prepared for the same purpose Cross-examined Q Was the sovereign in the note A Put loosely into it and the note put into the envelope—it would not come out by fair means—it is a fictitious letter—I am positive of the mark—I have a memorandum of it it is a dot at the end of Regina —Mr Playle described the sovereign I examined it and found it correct—we both described it on the same paper and put our initials JOHN GARDNER I am a clerk in the inland-department of the General Post-office On 30th Sept I was on duty there and received a packet of letters containing coin from Mr Playle—I believe this produced to be one—I took them into the superintending-president s office and gave them to Mr Rice in the state in which I received them Cross-examined Q Were these post marks on it when you received it A Yes HENRY RICE I am superintending letter-sorter in the Post-office On the morning of 30th Sept I received several letters from Gardner—this is one of them—they appeared to contain coin—there is such a person as Mr Dyer at this address—if it had gone in its proper direction it would have found him—he would know the object of its being sent—I went about six o clock to the twelfth division of the sorting-office and placed this letter among those already sorted for the Paragon district—the collector takes them from those—the Paragon district is not divided into parts they are all given to one to deliver there—they would find their way to the prisoner the letter-carrier of that district—I saw him take them away ten minutes afterwards—this address is not in his delivery but it was intended to be done—it would be his duty to give it to the blind sorter as soon as he discovered it in going through his letters to set them which is done at his seat in the Post-office Cross-examined Q What time were they given to you A About half-past five o clock—the prisoner s duty commenced at a quarter-past—he signs the book at that time—he might have seen me when he fetched the letters I was close by—the letter would get to the London district in its ordinary course—one side of the New Kent-road is in the London district—the Paragon district is nearest the Post-office MATTHEW PEAK On 30th Sept about twelve o clock I searched the prisoner in Mr Kelly s room and found on him 1l 1s 8d in silver and 4 1/2 d in copper—there were two crowns—this letter produced was shown to him and it was stated that a sovereign had been abstracted from it—he said he knew nothing about it—it was said that it had been placed among his letters that morning—he said he knew nothing about it—he was asked if he had changed a sovereign that morning—he said No —he was asked if he had been into any public-house that morning to have anything to drink—he said No ROBERT POTTER I acted as blind-sorter at the Post-office—mis-sorted letters are brought to me—I keep no account of them I cannot tell whether this was brought if it was I should have sent it to the London district JOHN DUNCAN I am fifteen years old and am bar-boy at the Rocking-ham Arms New Kent-road The prisoner delivers letters there—he came there on the day I was taken to the Post-office for a pot of porter—it came to 3d —he gave me a sovereign—I gave it to Hodges who put it through a chink into the gold part of the till which was separate from the other and kept locked he gave me silver which I gave the prisoner—there were two 5s -pieces among it EDWARD HODGES I put the sovereign into the gold-drawer which was kept locked and gave Duncan the change ROBERT SINCLAIR I am son of the keeper of the Rockingham Arms On 30th Sept Tyrrell came—I opened the gold-drawer and gave it him to look at—he selected a sovereign from several there—I put a mark on it—this produced is it ROBERT TYREELL I am an officer of the Post-office On 30th Sept I selected this sovereign from others at Mr Sinclair s by means of a written paper SAMUEL BELL I am President of the London-district office—Mr Edwards a clerk in that office gave me this letter—it would arrive there being directed to Weymouth-street—it was found about eight o clock Cross-examined Q Who brought it A It came from the Inland-office with others in a box through a tunnel—they are sent by a messenger—if it was given to the blind-sorter he would transfer it to the messenger The Rev Robert Eden of Lee Essex and John M Nowland surgeon of Newington gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 25 —Recommended to merery

MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution HELEN VAVASSEUD I am the wife of James Vavasseud of Queen-street-place Southwark-bridge I have a sister named Elizabeth Moffatt at the Mission-school at Walthamstow—on Friday 8th Sept I wrote a letter to her and posted it next morning in Watling-street at ten o clock—this is the envelope produced —it was addressed Miss E Moffatt Mission-school Walthamstow —it was wafered—it contained these two notes addressed to my sister and Miss Kydd and a small padlock key—this is the remains of it—it has since been crushed BENJAMIN PARADISE I keep the post-office in Watling-street—a letter posted there at ten o clock in the morning would be dispatched at twelve and be forwarded to Waltbamstow the same day FRANCES AUGUSTA GIRT I am a governess in the Mission-school at Walthamstow—Miss Elizabeth Moffatt who is quite a child was staying there in Sept last—I received this envelope addressed to her on a Monday in Sept —it was then sealed with wax—we ought to have received it eight days before—I opened the envelope—it contained this key battered in this way and these two small pieces of paper with this pencil writing on them—there was no letter to Miss Kydd or Miss Moffatt—I delivered the envelope key and papers to Holmes THOMAS MILLER I am a mail-driver between London and Harrow I am the prisoner s brother—I believe both these papers to be his writing and also the pencil writing on this note—I believe these and other papers to be in the same writing ROBERT HOLMES I am a letter-carrier in the Walthamstow district On 18th Sept I received some papers and an envelope from Miss Girt—I enclosed them in a letter and sent them to Mr Smith—letters addressed to Walthamstow sometimes get mis-sorted to the Stratford district and sometimes to other places—the Stratford district does not adjoin the Walthamstow district it is some short distance— the two papers enclosed to Miss Moffatt were as follows — My name is wide awake I thought this was gold Ma am I sent the letter to the office I only get 12s a week—I shall thieve when I can Ma am and you can t help yourself MR ROBERT SMITH I am superintending president of the London district post-office The prisoner has been about three years employed as an auxiliary letter-carrier under the Stratford post-office and was so in Sept last—he applied to me and in consequence of his father s services he was appointed—he was paid 12s a week—I think his duty commenced about seven in the morning and he finished about twelve or half-past at noon—on 18th Sept I received by post a letter containing some pieces of paper amongst them were the two letters to Miss Moffatt and Miss Kydd—this is the cover—it was posted in East Smithfield—there is a great deal of pencil writing upon the papers— read I broke the key Bobby I thought it was gold when I opened the letter I have been in the office some years and was honest a long time but I shall not be so no more for 12s shillings a week I have a little money and I will have some more I find this last two years I am getting on better to make up my wages good Sir sometimes 22s and sometimes 32s you know Bobby Smith —these three other pieces of paper were also enclosed in this cover— read All the letters I have mis-sent to my office I burn except they got money in I mean to give you as much trouble as I can I will take the other men s letters and burn them in the fire Sir You never can catch me I take them home before I break the seals I never keep them five minutes in my place—fire fire fire fire I I think I can learn you a new game when I collect I look out for the money letters and work the article that way We a rnt all Essex calves Bobby Smith You know this paper you don t know this writing You may lay traps you may search my house but fire tells no tales 12s a week I came to London to-day so I send this to let you know that auxiliaries want more money I am short of money this week I roust have some too Sir This is one of my complaints fire tells no tales —on 28th Nov I received another letter by the post enclosing the fragments of five envelopes of post letters—the addresses were cut out—this was amongst them read If you remember I sent you a polite note some time ago about a latter direçted Walthamitow which was mis-sent to me Bobby and now I have sent two Mr Smith It lays in your power to raise my wages but you will not You think 12s is plenty of money for countrymen in Essex but I don t You take 700l yourself and keep a coal-shed too I think I have been in the office years enough for 12s but I shan t be in much longer but while I am I burn all the mis-sent letters and send you the covers To-morrow will be just a month since I had a coutre sent by post and I hope I shall soon have another that will set me on my legs to rights If I get ten years I shall laugh at the b—y judge Signed Calcraft —I did not know what a coutre was till I received this and then I was informed it meant a sovereign—among the papers in the last enclosure there was a portion of an official paper used by the charge-takers at the Stratford office—I knew the figures on it to be the charge-takers of the office to which the prisoner was attached and that directed my attention to him and I had him taken into custody—the envelope of the mis-sent letter to Stratford bears the inland office stamp of I think 9th Sept —it bears a second stamp of the 18th ten o clock forenoon MATTHEW PEEK I am an officer attached to the post-office On 6th Sept I took the prisoner into custody—I searched him and found a doorkey on him—I asked him several times where he lived and he said he would not tell me—I went to 20 Lambeth-street Whitechapel to the back room first floor and with the key which I had found on the prisoner I opened the door—there was nobody in the room—I searched and found some letters and papers two buttons and a seal which I produce—I have applied the button to the seal of the letter addressed to Mrs Girt and it corresponds—I afterwards told the prisoner that I had been to 20 Lambeth-street to the first floor back room—he said that was his lodging—I took him to Bow-street station and told him I charged him with stealing a letter containing a key and he would be charged with stealing other letters—he said he knew nothing about the letter containing the key or the other letters but the letter I found at his house he could not deny—I showed him the letter Prisoner s Defence The whole is a vile abominable conspiracy and the parties implicated in it have done it from feelings of envy and malice I was appointed between two and three years ago to assist a letter-carrier named Keasley on the East Ham Branch on 1st Sept I went to the office as usual and found a small parcel I opened it it contained three pieces of paper which they said belonged to a Miss Coutts one said something about getting 12s a-week and the other said something about I will not deliver this letter I placed it in my pocket and at once concluded it was a mean retaliation from some one at the office owing me a spite after finishing my delivery I went to the Green Man public-house to get my breakfast and waited there till the next delivery of letters was brought to me there after finishing them I went home I placed the papers under the bed intending to take them with me next morning to find out who sent it but next day I was taken into custody I did not tell the officer where I lived because the street was not very respectable they took me in a cab to the Stratford Postoffice and the officers had some communication with the letter-carriers and after leaving one of the officers asked if I was not a Chartist I said I was not he asked if I had not been to the meeting at Kennington-common I said I had but only out of curiosity I was taken to the Post-office and Mr Smith charged me with sending him two anonymous letters with covers and parts of other letters I told him I knew nothing of them some gentlemen in the office asked if I did not live in Lambeth-street in about three quarters of an hour the officer came into the office and showed Mr Smith a note which he said he had found in my place and he said the two batches of sealing-wax corresponded with the letter Mr Smith had received I at once perceived that the whole was a conspiracy my brother and a witness named Harris swore to my handwriting before the Magistrate I never wrote to my brother in my life and he has never seen me write since I left school eleven years ago and Harris never saw me write these letters have been written through spite Craddock and the other auxiliaries have frequently wanted me to change walks with them and I would not and they charged me with stealing a letter that was mis-sent but it was impossible for me to have got it for I was always last there of a morning and never opened the bags and the first man opens the bags and sorts the letters and if a letter is mis-sent he sends it away it is not the first time I have been robbed of my letters not long ago a man stole a money-letter belonging to my walk and was found coming out of the office with it in his possession and if he had not been taken I should have been charged with it THOMAS MILLIR re-examined I have not seen my brother write—it was very seldom I was in his company—I saw his handwriting some time ago—I have not seen him write for some time FREDERICK HARRIS I am a letter-carrier at Stratford in the same office with the prisoner I have seen him write a time or two upon letters that have been mis-sent or that he could not find out—he has to write something on them before they are sent away—I never saw him write in pencil— looking at the papers produced according to the style of the writing I have seen on the letters I believe these to be his writing—the first man that comes to the office of a morning opens the bags and sorts the letters for all the men—if the prisoner was there first he could do it but he was generally last—I have no recollection of seeing the letter directed to Miss Moffatt—the charge-taker would write upon all mis-sent letters MATTHEW PEEK re-examined I have looked at the handwriting of the pencilling found at the prisoner s lodging—it is the same as that on the letters and the same language—I found the letter between the bed and sacking GUILTY Aged 23 — Transported for Seven Years There was another indictment against the prisoner 
t18490226-648  648 JOHN WITHAM stealing whilst employed under the Post-office a post-letter containing 12 postage-stamps a half-sovereign and a fourpenny-piece the property of the Post Master-General —Other COUNTS varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution WAITER ROBERTSON SCULTHORPE I am one of the presidents of the London District Post-office On Saturday 17th Feb I caused a letter to be written and addressed Miss Davis at Mrs Clark s Ponder s-end —I put into it a half-sovereign a fourpenny-piece and a shilling s worth of postage-stamps all which I marked in Coles presence—I sealed it and gave it to Peak with instructions—the prisoner is a letter-carrier at Ponder s-end Enfield—on the Monday following I went to Mrs Clark s at Ponder s-end and in consequence of what was told me there I went in the direction in which I expected to meet the prisoner—I met him a little before nine o clock in the morning—I stopped him and asked whether he was the postman—he said Yes —I told him I was Mr Sculthorpe of the Post-office and asked him whether he had a letter that morning addressed to Miss Davis at Mrs Clark s Ponder s-end—he said no he had not seen such a letter—Pesk the officer then came up and joined us and I said to the prisoner Let me see what money you have got in your pocket —he put his hand into his pocket and brought out seven or eight shillings—I noticed that my money was not there—after looking at it I said You have more money than this about you —he then put his hand into his pocket began to fumble about and I said to Peak Search him —Peak then drew his hand from his pocket and in his band I saw my half-sovereign and fourpenny-piece—I said This is my money —he said That it is not it is mine I received it at three o clock yesterday in Oxford-street —he was then taken to the post-office at Ponder s-end and I there asked him whether he had any postage-stamps about him—he said no he had not—I ordered Peak to make a farther search and he took from one of his pockets the twelve identical stamps I had enclosed in the letter—I said These are my stamps —he said That they are not I took them from a young woman in Thomas-street Oxford-street yesterday —Peak took this paper produced from him in my presence—there are five marks of mine on it and it is a portion of what I enclosed the money and stamps in on the Saturday—the money and stamps are the same which I enclosed—every stamp is marked—Ponder s-end is in the prisoner s district—supposing a letter for Ponder s-end to be put in at Waltham-cross on the Sunday evening it would be forwarded on the Monday morning by the mailbag to Enfield-highway—it would be the prisoner s duty to deliver the letter before half-past eight that morning MATTHEW PEAK About two o clock on Saturday afternoon 17th Feb I received a letter from Mr Sculthorpe to put into the post it was sealed—I received others but my attention was drawn to this one—it was addressed Miss Davis Mrs Clark s Ponder s-end —I kept it in my possession till the following evening when I took it to Waltham-cross and dropped it into the box at nearly half-past seven—it was then in the same state as when I received it from Mr Sculthorpe—on the following morning I saw Mr Sculthorpe and the prisoner at Ponder s-end—I saw the prisoner take some silver from his pocket—after he had done so I said Have you got any more —he kept his band in the same pocket he had taken the silver from fumbling about and I said Take out your hand and with his hand he brought out half-a-sovereign and a fourpenny-piece which I gave to Mr Sculthorpe who said it was his money—the prisoner said it could not be his as he had brought it from London the day before from Thomas-street Oxford-street—this is the money—I went with him and Mr Sculthorpe to the Post-office at Ponder s-end and going along Mr Sculthorpe asked him if he had any stamps—he said he had not—I took him to the receiving-house searched him and found the stamps produced in his waistcoat-pocket and in his trowsers-pocket I found the piece of paper—Mr Sculthorpe said These are my stamps they were in the letter —the prisoner said that could not be for he had also brought them from Thomas-street Oxford-street JOSEPH HUNT I keep the post-office at Waltham-cross I made up the mail-bag on Monday morning 19th Feb for Enfield-highway—I noticed a letter addressed Miss Davis Mrs Clark s Ponder s-end —I placed it in the bag myself and it was forwarded with the rest of the letters by the mail-rider to Enfield-highway THOMAS CROSSINOHAM I am keeper of the post-office receiving-house at Enfield-highway On Monday morning 19th Feb the Waltham-cross mailbag arrived at half-past six—it was tied and sealed in the usual way—I opened it at a quarter-past seven took out the letters sorted them and they corresponded with the letter-bill—there were three for Ponder s-end—the prisoner came in about a quarter of an hour afterwards—it was his duty to take the letters for Enfield to Ponder s-end and he took those three—the Enfield letters he delivers to another carrier who deliver them but he delivers the Ponder s-end ones himself Crass-examined by Ma BALLANTIHE Q Was it your duty to open the bag A No 1 did open it on this occasion as I was expecting a letter from the country respecting a cousin who was dying and my anxiety to know about her health induced me to take it out ANN CHAPMAN I am a laundress On 19th Feb I was at Mrs Clark s at Ponder s-end—early in the morning a young man rung the bell and delivered me a letter which I gave to Eliza Bird who opened the door—the man only gave me one letter ELIZA BIRO I am servant to Mrs Clark who keeps a ladies -school at Ponder s-end In Feb there was a young lady a scholar there named Ann Davis—on Monday 19th Feb I remember receiving a letter from Ann Chapman—this produced is the envelope of it—it is addressed to Rodah Bunyan—she is my fellow-servant—I gave it

t18490226-776  776 EDWARD BROOM stealing whilst employed under the post-office a post-letter containing a half-sovereign and 1 sixpence the property of Her Majesty s Postmaster-general MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution WALTER ROBERTSON SCULTHORPE I am one of the presidents of the Lon-don District Post-office The prisoner has been a letter-carrier there about fourteen years and has been stationed at Deptford the greater part of the time—on 10th Feb I marked a half-sovereign and a sixpence in the presence of Mr Cole and folded them in this card produced —I did not turn down the ends I put it in the inner-fold of this letter put the whole into this cover sealed and addressed it to Thomas Jefferies Mickley near Ripon Yorkshire and gave it to Peak with instructions—if posted at Deptford or New-cross before four o clock that afternoon it would arrive in London about ten minutes to six—I was at the office when the Deptford mail-bag arrived—I looked for the letter it was not in the bag—I went with Cole Peak and Russell to the Deptford post-office we got there about seven—Cole and Russell parted from me—I followed shortly afterwards and found them at the prisoner s house in a street leading out of Pomeroy-street and found him there—Mr Cole said in his presence We have found the money and the letter —the money was produced—I examined it and found my marks on it—Peak then produced the letter—I examined it and said to the prisoner How do you account for this this is my money —he said the money must have shaken out of the letter when he called at New-cross for the collection he put it properly into his pouch and going to the office a man gave him a ride in his cart and the cart having no springs it must have jolted the money out of the letter—I then said Why did not you give it to the charge-taker at Deptford when you gave in your collection —he said I did not discover it in my pouch until after I left the office —I gave him in charge—the office at New-cross is a mile or more from the post-office at Deptford where he would have to carry the letters—there is a charge-taker there to whom it would be his duty to deliver his letters—I believe New-cross was the only place where he would have to call—to the best of my belief I found the letter folded the reverse way—I put the money in the inner fold—it was not there when shown to me the cover was torn as now and part of the wax broken away Cross-examined by MR DUNCAN Q Are not your duties amongst others to investigate the defalcations of the letter-carriers A Yes—I have never had to charge the prisoner with defalcations before he has borne a general good character but I should not have gone at once to him unless I had my idea of him—I left both ends of the card open—the letter was folded square with all the ends in and placed inside the envelope—there are receiving-houses at Deptford which send their letters up to London—it would be his duty to deliver his collection up at Deptford and assist in picking out the cross-post letters and telling up the number of letters brought in by the other collections which are all forwarded to London in a bag—there were about 288 letters that day—as soon as he had done that the London down-bag would be due it would then be his duty to take the letters directed to Deptford on his way to New-cross again that concluded his duty for the day—he does not have to return to Deptford—five or ten minutes is allowed for the dispatch of the up-bag—there is considerable haste occasionally—I have never caused test-letters to be posted at New-cross or Deptford before—not five minutes elapsed between my sending Russell and Cole on and my arriving—it may have been next day before I examined the letter I am not positive—I gave it back to Peak MATTHEW PEAK I am a constable of the post-office On 10th Feb I received from Mr Sculthorpe this letter sealed it appeared to contain coin—I pot it into the post at New-cross at twenty minutes to four o clock in the afternoon—it bears the New-cross stamp Cross-examined Q You went with Mr Sculthorpe to the prisoner s I house and found Mr Cole and Russell A Yes Mr Cole said We I have found your money Sir addressing Mr Sculthorpe who looked at it I and left the house with me ANN HAMMOND I keep the post-office receiving-house at New-cross If a letter was posted at the receiving-house at twenty minutes to four o clock it would be forwarded to Deptford at a quarter to five—on 10th Feb the prisoner came to the office for the letters one of them appeared to contain something—I gave it to the prisoner with the rest—he looked them over and put them together in my presence—I think there were between fifty and sixty Cross-examined Q Did you go through them one by one A I had I them all singly in my hand they are all laid ready for him to take up when I he comes in—two or three letters every time contain something—I did not notice this one at all—I was not examined before the Magistrate when the prisoner was committed—the postman is allowed a quarter of an hour between New-cross and Deptford—sometimes he has only just time to take the letters up put them into the bag and go away with them—the number of the paid I and unpaid letters is entered in the bill which is laid with them ready for him to take up—the paid are separated from the unpaid and stamped—the I practice is to tie up the letters with a piece of string before he puts them into the pouch CHARLES CRAWLEY I am & letter-carrier of Deptford On 10th Feb I and Evans another letter-carrier made up and dispatched the London-bag at forty-five minutes past four o clock that enclosed letters going from New-cross to the London District for six o clock—the prisoner brought the New-cross collection—I always ask him whether they are all right and he says Yes that is with reference to the number on the bill—it is his business to see that the number corresponds with the bill—he then proceeds to lay the country letters in for delivery—he does not assist in making up the London-bag he I merely hands them over to me and I put them into the bag—the letters are I not given out before the London-bag is dispatched—when they are given out he sorts them for delivery—he started on his delivery that afternoon I somewhere near half-past five—he would have no occasion to return to the Deptford-office after that—after his last collection it was his practice to hang up his pouch in the office and then go and deliver his letters Cross-examined Q You know the general practice of the Deptford postoffice A Yes the letters are already sorted when the prisoner comes in—his letters are placed in the bag—the bye-letters are taken off first and then when he says All right I understand all right for London—the bye-letters are deducted—the down-bag arrives sometimes at a quarter to five and sometimes at five o clock—it has occasionally arrived before the up-bag has gone—I will not swear that they did not arrive together—the down-bag is never put on the same side as the up-bag—if they do arrive together there is a little more haste to dispatch the London-bag—the time allowed between New-cross and Deptford is invariably fifteen minutes MR CLARKSON Q Do they always finish one bag before they comment the other A One man is sometimes sorting the down bag and the others are tying and sorting the London-bag but they are always kept separate—the same man does not interfere with both at the same time—if the prisoner has bye-letters it is his duty to give them to the post-master s assistant—they are separated at the receiving-house at New-cross—the number of paid and the number of bye-letters are put on the bill—if there are fifty letters and two of them bye-letters they would be deducted by the letter-carrier and the number would be forty-eight which added to the letters for the London-post would make up the number he had—it is his duty to ascertain that the letters for London only are passed to me—I then ask if all is right and he says Yes WELCOME COLE I am an inspector of letter-carriers to the London district I was present and saw Mr Sculthorpe put half-a-sovereign and six-pence in a letter—I saw them marked—these are the same—the envelope was folded in this way—the coin was in this card which was in the inner fold of the paper—on the same day a little after seven o clock I went with Russell the policeman to the prisoner s-house 4 Alfred-place Pomeroy-street Kent-road—we saw the prisoner—I asked if he knew me—he said No —I said I was inspector of letter-carriers and the person with me was the police-constable from the office and asked him if he was on duty at the Deptford-office when the five o clock bag was made up for London—he said Yes —I asked if he made up the bag—he said No I only counted some of the letters —I said there were two letters posted before four o clock that ought to have arrived in that bag but had not and asked if he knew anything about them—he said No —I said as one of them was posted at New-cross where he collected had he any objection to be searched—he said No —I asked what money he had—he put both his hands into his trowsers pockets and took from the left pocket half-a-sovereign and sixpence and from the other he put on the table 3s —I took up the half-sovereign and sixpence examined them and said This is Mr Sculthorpe s money —I examined two sixpences before I found the right—the second was the one that had accompanied the half-sovereign—he said That I found in my pouch it shook out of a letter on my way to the office —I said Where is the letter —he was about to put his hand into his pocket—I stopped him and told Russell to search him who took the letter produced from his breast coat-pocket with the seal broken as it is now—I did not take the letter out of the envelope till Mr Sculthorpe came—it was then in the same state—I told Mr Sculthorpe loud enough to be heard in the room that I had found the money and letter—the prisoner was taken to the Deptford post-office—he was asked where he put his pouch—he got up from his seat and showed me behind the door in the office and took it off the hook—he said he had not been at the office from the time of having been with his letters until he was brought back by me—I took the letter out of the envelope at the post-office and found the card in the inner fold in the other leaf of the sheet quite contrary to where it had been placed by Mr Sculthorpe—it was on the reverse side showing only the white of the paper instead of the writing—if the prisoner had found any letter in his pouch from which money had escaped it would be his duty when he arrived at Deptford to give it to the charge-taker Cross-examined Q Where is the seal broken A portion of the impression is gone and the paper is torn in the state it is now—a portion of this blue wax adhered to the under fold—it was very small only a speck—I do not know whether blue or fancy sealing-wax is used in the post-office for detecting crimes of this sort or that fancy waxes are more likely to open—I think it is more strong than the other—red or common black wax is much more likely to break than this this is much purer—the half-sovereign six-pence and card would not be a heavy weight for this envelope—if the money came out of the envelope it must in the first instance have come out inside the note and then if this piece of blue sealing-wax was to give way it would almost necessarily fall out if it was a single letter—I did not tell the prisoner when I went to his house that he was suspected of taking or stealing a letter or that what he said might be urged in a Criminal Court against him—I went on with the investigation without any warning to him—I received instructions from my superior officer Mr Sculthorpe—he gave me no specified instructtions—I have several times gone into people s houses without giving them warning—the officer took away some articles and among them a silver watch and some money—I did not direct him to take it—it has not been restored—it is in my possession now—the officer gave it me the same evening—I heard the prisoner say to Mr Sculthorpe The money shook out of a letter on my way to the office as I rode in a cart that had no springs —I did not hear him say he believed the letter had broken away from the string and shaken out into his pouch from the jolting MR BODKIN Q Does the money in the card when placed in the envelope fill it as near as possible A When taken from the prisoner it only reached to the seal—it filled up about one half of the envelope WILLIAM RUSSILL policeman I went with Mr Cole to the prisoner s house took the letter from his breast-pocket and gave it to Mr Cole in the state in which I found it Cross-examined Q Did you see the prisoner take a half-sovereign and sixpence from his left pocket A Yes and 3s or 4s from his right—the prisoner said he found the money and letter in the bottom of his pouch that he rode in a cart without springs and he believed it had jolted out—he said when Mr Cole asked him that he had no objection to be searched—he said he knew nothing about it

MATTHEW PEAK I am a police-officer attached to the Post-office On Tuesday evening 7th Aug about eight o clock I was at the back part of the Post-office standing behind a door which concealed roe from the persons coming up the steps until they got into the hall—whilst there I saw the prisoner coming up the steps into the hall—as he came up to the door he threw down a piece or two pieces of paper I could not see which—they fell near me—he turned round and saw me—he did not say anything to me—I did not appear to take any notice of him—he went across the hall towards the Alders-gate-street side—as soon as his eyes were off me I picked up the piece of paper—when he got near the entrance-door he stood behind a pillar—I then saw him tearing up some bits of paper and throwing them down—I then lost sight of him for about a moment—when I saw him again he was coming across the hall back again with a female—he came to the door where I was standing seeing the India boxes off and said to her This is our Foreign-office —he was showing her the different offices—he then went down into the back yard and said something to the female which I did not hear pointing towards the lobby door—he then came back again into the hall went across the hall and out at the front part—I then went to the pillar where I had seen him throw the paper away I there saw Clayton one of the messengers I called his attention to the pieces of paper and he assisted me in picking them up—he gave me what he picked up—I preserved them with what I picked up near the door till next morning keeping them separate—these are them produced —I made a report the same night—next morning I saw Mr Bokenham—I went to seek for the prisoner but could not find him till five o clock in the evening when he came on duty—I told him that Mr Peacock wanted him—I went up with him into Mr Peacock s office—he said What does Mr Peacock want with me —I said He wishes to see you with respect to the letter I saw you tear up last night in the hall —he made no reply to that—at that moment Mr Peacock came in—he requested me to repeat all I had observed which I did—the prisoner said he could not account for it he recollected having three letters on his inkstand one from his father which he tore up at the lobby door at the entrance of the hall—he was then told that had no reference to the one that was seen torn up behind the pillar—he said he had no recollection and could not account for that—he was then shown this portion of the envelope in the state it is now with the word Norwich on it—he said That is my writing —that was what I picked up near the pillar—he was searched and 7s found on him Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q When he threw away the first two or three pieces you speak of how far was he from where you were standing A Not two feet he threw them down towards me as he was walking across the hall—he could not see me then as I was behind the door taking an account of the boxes—he turned round and saw me after he threw down the paper he made no endeavour to recover the pieces—I did not follow him—one of the pieces which he threw down contained no writing and was not kept—I cannot say what has become of it—I lost it JOHN CLAYTON I am a messenger in the Post-office On Tuesday evening 7th Aug I saw the prisoner in the back part of the hall with a female—I picked up some pieces of paper near the pillar which I gave to Peak—we picked up all that was there ALICE WHITBY I reside at Haslar Hospital Gosport On 7th Aug I wrote a letter to my mother in Norfolk—I enclosed 1s 6d in a piece of silk sewed it to the letter put it in an envelope and directed it to Mrs Whitby Brinton Brinenham Norfolk —this is the envelope produced—this is part of the letter I wrote—here is a portion of the cotton to it with which I sewed the shilling—I gave the letter to Mrs Easton to post—I sealed it with a thimble I find the seal here MARY ANN EASTON I received a letter from Whitby on 7th Aug near twelve o clock to put into the post—I gave it to Coffin the postman JAMES COFFIN I received a letter from Mrs Easton on 7th Aug —I took it to the post at Gosport—it would be dispatched by the mid-day mail at twenty-five minutes past one MARY ANN LEGG I am assistant-postmistress at Gosport I made up the bag for the mid-day mail on 7th Aug it was dispatched to London in the ordinary course at ten minutes after one—this envelope bears the Gosport office stamp of that day JOHN GARDINER I am a clerk in the Inland department of the General Post-office The prisoner has been nearly ten years employed there—he was on duty at the Inland office on 7th Aug —a letter sent from Gosport by the mid-day mail would arrive at the Post-office on its way to Norfolk about half-past fivehe was employed as one of the inspectors of blind letters—a letter which has not a very intelligible address would go into that office—there was no post town mentioned on this letter—that would be called a blind letter and would as such come into the hands of the prisoner or the other inspector that evening—it would be the inspector s duty to write on it the post town to which it should go—this word Norwich is the prisoner s writing—I have seen his writing several times—after putting Norwich on it it would be his duty to send it out with the other letters to be dispatched that same evening—he would not have occasion to keep it in his own possession for any lawful purpose—it would go from the office at eight o clock—it has the stamp of the Inland office on it that indicates that it had arrived by the evening mail Cross-examined Q What number of letters would come into his custody on that evening A I cannot tell within 200 or 300 it is very uncertain—one other person Mr Johnson was engaged in the same department—it was no part of his duty to deliver letters CHARLES JOHNSON On 7th Aug I acted with the prisoner as an inspector of blind letters in the Inland department—I have no recollection of seeing this letter in the course of my duty—I believe the word Norwich on it to be the prisoner s writing—after putting that on it would be his duty to send it away with others by a messenger to be sorted Cross-examined Q Suppose a letter was torn would it be his duty to transmit it in that state or would it be taken to some other part of the office to be re-sealed A Torn letters are re-sealed in another part of the office—they are kept back for five or six minutes for that purpose—there may be perhaps fifty or a hundred letters of that sort of a night—I do not know whether he had any to be re-sealed that night—I did not observe any in our depart-ment—I never knew the messenger leave letters behind—I have known instances where letters have not all been written on and then they would not be sent till the next post MR BODKIN Q In this instance the word Norwich being written on the letter would it be necessary to do anything else A No it was in a state to have gone off by that night s post and ought to have gone GUILTY Aged 37 —Recommended to mercy by the Jury — Transported for Ten Years 
t18491029-1966  1966 MACKENZIE M KAY stealing whilst employed in the Post-office a post letter containing 1 neckerchief and 1s the property of the Postmastergeneral MR CLARKSON and MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution CHARLOTTE RADFORD I reside at Medina-place Brixton-hill On 15th Oct I addressed a letter to Miss Doughty Bankside near the Hoy Inn Margate—I enclosed in it a silk-handkerchief folded up and 1s wrapped in a piece of blotting-paper and then in a piece of tissue-paper—I also inclosed a letter fastened it with wax and put two stamps on it—I gave the letter to my father-in-law to post while I remained in the chaise—I saw him go into the shop—it was about five minutes to twelve o clock in the day—I believe this handkerchief produced to be the same I enclosed—I did not purchase it myself—this cover produced is my handwriting and these are parts of the letter—the handkerchief was produced to me that same night by Cole—this blotting-paper produced looks very much like that in which I put the 1s —it is in holes at the folds THOMAS RADFORD I am father-in-law of the last witness On 15th Oct I received a letter from her to take to the post-office it was directed Miss Doughty near the Hoy Margate—I drove to Brixton Church got out and posted the letter at a shop opposite in the same state I received it at five minutes before twelve o clock—I was present when my daughter-in-law inclosed the 1s she put it in a little bit of blotting-paper—I wrapped it up—she also inclosed a little neck-tie for the baby wrapped in a bit of tissue-paper—I have since seen one—I should say it was the same CHARLES MIDGLEY I am assistant to the letter-carrier at Brixton I find the stamp of the Brixton post-office on portions of this letter—a letter posted there at twelve o clock would be forwarded by the letter-carrier to Clapham at a quarter-past one MATTHEW PEAK I am a constable of the Post-office I produce a piece of blotting-paper which I got from the prisoner s waistcoat-pocket THOMAS RADFORD re-examined It was such a piece of blotting-paper as this in which the shilling was wrapped—it is the same sort as my daughter-in-law had lying on her desk Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q I suppose it is the same sort of blotting-paper that any daughter-in-law of any gentleman in London might have on her desk A I dare say it is ANN TURNER I am in the service of Mrs Radford On the morning of 15th Oct I purchased a neckerchief for her at Mr Bennett s at Brixton-hill—I brought it home and gave it to Mr Radford—it was such a one as that produced MART ANN BENNETT I sold a lady s neckerchief to Turner on 15th Oct to the best of my belief this it—I had six of them—the officer showed me this the same night I then had the other five in stock JOHN ROBINSON I am a letter-carrier at Clapham On 15th Oct about half-past one o clock I collected the letters which had been posted at the post-office at Brix ton-hill—I took them to the sorting-office at Clapham delivered the paid letters to Mr Baldwin and the stamped ones I tied up myself—I noticed two or three letters that were not included in the tied-up ones—they were not very thick but soft and were kept separate for fear they should burst they were put loose into the bag Cross-examined Q How many letters were put in loose A Two of three not more than three—that does not occur every day—the bag is forwarded to London by the mail-cart BALDWIN I am chief charge-taker at the Clapham-office—I made up and dispatched the bag to London on 15th Oct about five minutes before two o clock—the letters brought to me by Robinson were included in that dispatch GEORGE JOHN ROUGH I am driver of the mail from Clapham On 15th Oct I took the two o clock dispatch from the Clapham-office to the General Post-office—I delivered it there at twenty-six minutes past two Cross-examined Q Does your duty end after the delivery of the bags A Yes I have nothing to do with opening them WELCOME COLE I am an inspector of letter-carriers at the London District-office In consequence of what had occurred before on 15th Oct I placed myself in a situation to command a view of the water-closets without being seen by the persons in them—it was about half-past two o clock—some directions had previously been given to the plumber—between ten minutes and a quarter-past three I saw the prisoner enter the closet—I have known him upwards of eight years the whole time he has been in the office—he seated himself on the seat and took from his pocket a letter which he broke opeo and in so doing I observed that there were two postage labels upon it—he then tore the envelope twice cross ways and threw it down the sink on bis left hand—he then unfolded the letter took out a small portion of it which appeared to me to be dirty paper which he broke and from which he took a silver coin I could not say whether it was a shilling or a sixpence—he put it in his trowsers—pocket—he then unfolded the letter further upon which 1 instantly saw a lady s neckerchief—he destroyed the whole of the letter by tearing it in pieces apparently made use of it and threw it in the basin—he then got off the seat put the handkerchief in his left coat-pocket behind adjusted his clothes took the handkerchief from his pocket again unfolded it looked at it then pot it into his pocket and hurriedly left the closet—I immediately went and informed Mr Smith the Superintending President of that I had seen and in consequence of his directions I went to Blackburn the plumber and in a very few minutes I received from him these fragments of a letter and this envelope—I had sent him to the first of the two water-closets where the prisoner had been—after the prisoner had been taken into the President s room I accompanied Mr Sculthorpe down stairs and saw him take a great coat from a peg pointed out to him by a clerk—that coat was afterwards owned by the prisoner—he changed it in my presence for the one he then had on and wore it—I saw Mr Sculthorpe take from the pocket of that coat this handkerchief which I believe to be the same that I saw the prisoner with in the water-closet Cross-examined Q Will you swear positively that is the handkerchief you saw A No I will not but to the best of my belief it is—the water-closet only contains one seat—there is another closet adjoining it—I had been watching there before a little before one and then saw the young man who was last tried—I did not return again till half-past two o clock—I was watching near three quarters of an hour before the prisoner came in—it was at a time when a great many collections arrive from the suburbs—the persons would not quite have finished their duty—I saw no one but the prisoner during the three quarters of an hour—I have not given evidence in other cases of this description only the one this morning—I had watched the prisoner before that day—I had not watched others particularly I had seen them—I had no instructions to watch anybody until I observed the prisoner on a former occasion—I have watched the closet before 15th Oct and seen many persons enter but did not see anything destroyed—I have been a very short time employed in watching three weeks at various times—I have not given any evidence with reference to those three weeks only to-day—the place in which I was would enable me to see both seats—there is a separate door to each closet—they are parted by a partition—I was above the partition and looked down—I looked through an aperture not through any glass—there was space enough for me to see with both eyes—I occasionally looked with both and sometimes with one and sometimes the other—it was rather inconvenient for me to look with both—I watched both the seats from the same aperture—I could see both doors at the same time but not both seats—I am an inspector of letter-carriers and that is my duty—my duty is according to the instructions of my superior officers—I have many duties at the Post-office—it has been my duty to watch for the detection of frauds—I have been in the Post-office twenty-four years—that has not been my duty during the whole of that time—I have frequently had to do it—I believe that is pretty generally known in the Post-office—I did not go with Blackburn to the closet—I went with him within a short distance of it and told him which it was—he returned in five or six minutes—I have no other calling besides Post-office duty I am quite sure of that—I do not carry on any business besides—I had a son in the Post-office he was eighteen years old—he is not there now—he was discharged—I live at 2 Melvin-place—I have not got a greengrocer s shop there—I have nothing to do with it it is my son s—the same son you allude to—I have not the slightest interest in the business—he is now twenty-five or twenty-six years old—he has been discharged from the Post-office five or six years—his Christian name is the same as my own—the name of Cole is over the door—I receive a regular salary for my duty at the office I receive something in addition—I have received 2s for attending here to-day for refreshment from the Solicitor of the Post-office—I receive other additions to my salary very trifling—I am frequently sent eight or ten miles into the country and I have my coach-hire nothing more—I only receive the 2s for my expenses here—I did not receive 2s for the last case—I shall receive 2s a day for the days I have been away from the office on this business—I have only been one day before the Grand Jury and one day here—I shall only receive 4s nothing more except the expense of coach-hire which I have been put to—I was sent last evening to Brixton to order the persons to attend here—I went to Brixton in an omnibus—from there to Clapham and from there in a cab to Hayes-place Lisson-grove I charge 6s 6d for that—I came from Hayes-place to Pentonville in an omnibus—on one occasion many years ago I received 30l as a reward for detecting a man stealing a letter—ray salary is now 120l a year—I am not paid my additional expenses every week it may be in the course of a fortnight or a month—I present my bill whenever occasion requires me—I may not have occasion to present a bill for a much longer period—I have not received any other sum besides the 30l —yes I did I think two years ago—it was a portion of a reward offered by Government for the apprehension of a man who escaped from the Post-office—my portion was 10l —I never received anything else MR BODKIN Q Do you submit your expenses to a superior officer before they are paid A I do to Mr Smith the Superintending President and he certifies that they are correct before they are paid—the 10l I received was from the Solicitor of the Post-office—the reward altogether was 20l —Peak had the other 10l —I think the 30l was twelve years ago—I had then been nearly twelve years in the Post-office—it was ordered to be given me by the Postmaster-General—from the time I saw the prisoner enter the water-closet no one came in to draw my attention from him—the two closets open into the same room—I accompanied Blackburn within fourteen or sixteen yards of the closets the prisoner was in the first WILLIAM BLACKBURN I am the plumber belonging to the Post-office On 15th Oct about three o clock I was sent by Mr Cole to the first water-closet—I searched it and found some parts of a letter floating on the water—I took them out and gave them to Mr Cole—I bad previously stopped the pipe of the closet at a quarter to one—I was there at a quarter-past one Cross-examined Q Do you receive simply your wages at the Post-office in these cases or anything extra A Simply my wages—I am not paid anything extra for attending here to day WALTER ROBERTSON SCULTHORPE The prisoner has been in the employment of the Post-office for eight or nine years—he was on duty on 15th Oct last—the Clapham two o clock dispatch arrived at half-past two—the prisoner opened the bag—it was his duty to check the number and amount of the paid letters and to place the stamped letters on one side to be taken to another portion of the office to be sorted—if there were any stamped letters loose in the bag he should place them with the bundle of stamped letters to be taken away to be sorted—I saw him that day employed in the performance ofthat duty—in consequence of something I heard I sent for the prisoner about half-past three that afternoon—I took him into Mr Smith the President s private room and said There is a letter missing containing a handkerchief and 1s and you have been seen to destroy it —he was very much confused—Mr Smith said You hear what Mr Sculthorpe says what have you to say —he answered I have not seen such a letter —he was then searched by Peak—he had on his office or working coat—I asked if he had another coat down-stairs he said he had—I went down into a room where the men hang their coats up—a coat was pointed out by a man named Everett and in the left-hand pocket of it I found this handkerchief which has been produced—I then took the coat and handkerchief up-stairs to the prisoner—I asked whether that was his coat he said it was—I said I have found this handkerchief in the coat pocket —he said it must have been put there by design or accident as there were other coats hanging there—he took off the coat he had on and put on the other and was taken to the solicitor s office Cross-examined Q Is the witness Cole in your department A He is I believe he does not receive anything from the Post-office besides his annual salary—occasionally the Postmaster General has been pleased perhaps to make him a present of 10l for his services—I remember a case of that kind about three years ago—I do not remember any other—he may hare received more—I have only been connected with this painful duty five years—I feel it to be painful and in consequence of the painful nature of it I have declined to have anything more to do with it—the bag that comes from Clapham would be emptied on the table in the presence of a good many persons who would be waiting to carry the letters away to other departments—they would not be standing round the table but sitting side by side—they are porters the stamped letters are taken by a porter—I do not know what porter took the stamped letters on this occasion I have not inquired—one porter would not do the whole duty Q Has the prisoner at any time refused to perform any duty on the Friday before this transaction was he asked to do Sunday duty at the Post-office A I recollect on the Friday before he was seen to destroy another letter—that is the only thing I recollect about the Friday before—that was by Cole not by me—I had the letter afterwards in my possession—I am not aware that he had been asked on the Friday previous to do Sunday duty—I did not ask him—I believe all in the establishment were asked—I believe he refused I cannot say—he was in my department—I know the names of those in my department who refused because evervbody has refused and therefore I may say that the prisoner has—there were a great many coats hanging in the place where the prisoner s coat was there were seven pegs all full—there might have been one or two coats hanging on the same peg—I did not notice—the prisoner s coat was the first I took hold of it was pointed out to me—it is a common passage through which a great many persons would go from time to time—the prisoner may at times have called my attention to loose money that had fallen from letters it is frequently the case—I do not recollect his doing so MR CLARKSON Q How many years have you been in the Post-office A Twenty-five JOHN EVERETT I am a clerk in the London District Office I pointed out the prisoner s coat to Mr Sculthorpe—I knew it to be his there were no others hanging on the same peg there were close to it Cross-examined Q Was it the prisoner s duty to sort the stamped letters A No the stamped letters from the Clapham bag would be put down to some of the sub-sorters or clerks to be sorted MR CLARKSON Q There are letters which from their bulk and softness it is considered desirable not to strap lest they should burst A The letters do not tie so well together then and they put them in loose—it would be the duty of whoever opened the bag to stand those letters on one side they would be taken away together MATTHEW PEAK re-examined I searched the prisoner and found on him six shillings three sixpences and one half-crown Cross-examined Q Was there a 4d -piece A I think not—the blotting-paper was among the silver in his waistcoat pocket JURY to WELCOME COLE Q When the prisoner was in the closet had he the same coat on in which the handkerchief was afterwards found A I am not able to say they were both dark coats and the pockets were similar in both Rev Joseph Fisher of the Presbyterian Church of England Alexander Stewart surgeon of Aldersgate-street William Forsyth surgeon of

- CAPSTICK I am in the Inland-office at the Post-office I keep the house in which Nicholson and the prisoner lodge—they occupy the drawing-room on the first-floor and a bed-room on the second—Peak searched the bed-room on the second-floor—I know nothing about the papers found in the grate Cross-examined Q How long have you been in the Post-office A Four years—this bed-room was not kept locked but any one had not access to it—my wife attended to them she of course had access to the room—I make no use of the prisoner s room I only go at four o clock in the morning to call him up CHARLES JOHN WHITING I am a clerk in the Inland-office in the Post-office Supposing letters for Norwich to be posted in the Fulham-road at three o clock in the afternoon they would in the course of business arrive at the General Post-office that evening—they would have to be sorted and sent by the mail that night—I can see the stamp of the Inland-office on this envelope of the evening of 24th Oct —the postage-stamp is obliterated—here is the figure 7 which signifies the Inland-office—it came safely to the Postoffice that evening—the prisoner was a sorter there—here is the evening sorter s-book in which the sorters sign their names—on the evening of 24th Oct here is an entry of the prisoner in his own writing which signifies he was on duty in the Inland-office that evening—Nicholson was not employed on 24th Oct in that office—no person is permitted to be employed in that office without signing his name in this book—this letter is addressed to Norwich and had a double stamp on it—supposing it contained half-a-crown and had a double stamp it would probably go in with the packets which are sorted separately it would be the prisoner s duty to sort a letter of that kind—this would be assigned to the Eastern Counties division—the prisoner was employed at that division that evening—the letter-bag for Norwich would be made up in the Eastern Counties division Cross-examined Q Perhaps you can tell me whether Capstick was on duty that evening A He was in the Inland-office in the same department that the prisoner was—at first all the letters are sent to the sorters promiscuously it might have gone to Capstick or any other man—Capstick was not employed on the Eastern Counties—we do not keep a separate register only this one book GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Seven Years

t18501021-1727  1727 EDWARD COOTE stealing whilst employed in the Post-office a letter containing a half-sovereign the moneys of her Majesty s PostmasterGeneral MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution WALTER ROBERTSON SCULTHORPE I am one of the presidents of the London district offices of the General Post-office On Saturday 28th Sept for reasons I had I made up this letter produced and put into it a half-sovereign—I sealed it as it is sealed now and saw it addressed to Miss Mary Ann Ingram Cliff-terrace near Clifton-bars Margate Kent —I then gave it to Peak the officer and directed him to post it at the Tottenham North-office on Monday morning—if it was posted at half-past seven on Monday morning it would be forwarded by the mail-cart to the principal office at Tottenham where it would arrive about ten o clock—it would then be placed in the London bag and forwarded to the chief office in London—on Monday morning 30th I proceeded to Stamford-hill—I got there about ten o clock—I there met the mail-cart that was bringing the bag from Tottenham—I took possession of the bag and opened it—it did not contain this letter—I then went with Peak and Mr Cole one of the inspectors of letter-carriers to the principal office at Tottenham at which the prisoner was employed as a letter-carrier—I arrived there about half-past ten—I saw the prisoner leave the office and when he had got about fifty yards I stopped him and asked whether he bad cut open the Tottenham North-office bag that morning—I meant merely opened it in the usual course—he said No Bowers did — he is another letter-carrier employed in the same office —I asked whether he had sorted any of the letters—he said he had—I told him there was a money-letter missing—he made no answer—I then directed Peak to search him and I saw him take this letter out of the inner pocket of his coat—it was in the same state as it is now unopened—I then said to the prisoner How do you account for having this letter in your pocket —he said I did not know it was there —I then gave him into custody—the letter bears the stamp of the North Tottenham-office—there is no date to it— the witness here opened the letter and it contained a half-sovereign —this is my half-sovereign—I put some mark on it—the prisoner would in sorting the letters have the opportunity of seeing the letter and taking it if so minded—it has not been opened till the present moment Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Is there such a person at Miss Ingram of Cliff-terrace A There is not it was a fictitious name—I cannot say whether Peak knew there had been any irregularities—I merely gave him the letter with instructions to put it into the post—he could form a very good idea for what object it was—I did not tell him anything I told him to post that letter at such a time—I had many times instructed him to post letters for me—after the letter was posted by Peak it would be taken out of the letter-box by the receiver at Tottenham North-office and tied up in a bundle—it would then come into the hands of Bowers and the prisoner—there are four letter-carriers employed there—I cannot say which of the four it would come to—when I got to Tottenham I entered the office in company with Peak and Mr Cole—Peak was in plain clothes—I cannot say whether the men would know that Peak was an officer he has been an officer twenty years and a great many years belonging to the Post-office—when I entered there was only one person in the room Ellis an old letter-carrier—the four letter-carriers would be the only persons who would enter that room from the time the letter reached the office to the time I went there—their names are Ellis Bowers the prisoner and Cates—they would all have access to the letters—the letter was found in the inner tail-pocket of the prisoner s official coat—he has been thirteen years in the service of the Post-office MR BODKIN Q On finding the bag did not contain the letter you looked for you went to the chief office at Tottenham A I did I waited outside till the prisoner came out—the persons in the office had no opportunity of seeing me waiting outside—two other letter-carriers came out within two or three minutes of each other—the prisoner was the second—he was under my sight from the moment he came out till I went up to him—Peak was at the other side of the office—Mr Cole was standing with me—the persons in the office would not have an opportunity of seeing Peak—I saw no communication whatever take place between either of the other letter-carriers that came out and the prisoner MATTHEW PEAK On Saturday 28th Sept I received this letter from Mr Sculthorpe—in consequence of directions from him I retained it till Monday morning and then about twenty minutes past seven I dropped it into the letter-box-at the North-office Tottenham—I was afterwards on the same morning at the principal office at Tottenham—in consequence of directions from Mr Sculthorpe I searched the prisoner and found this letter with the seal unbroken in his left inside coat-pocket—I then took him into custody Cross-examined Q There was no outside pocket was there A Not that I am aware of—when we first went to the office at Tottenham I remained about 100 yards off behind a wall—the sorting-room is in the shop—there are windows to it—I should think any person in the room could see any person moving outside—Mr Cole has been in the Post-office twenty-five years—I should think he would be well known DIANA BENISON I live with my son who keeps the North Post-office at Tottenham I attend to the post-office business—this letter bears the mark of our office—on Monday morning 30th Sept I made up the bag—I always begin at half-past nine o clock and between that and a little before ten the bag is done—the mail-cart comes for it a little before ten—I delivered the bag to the driver of the mail-cart in the ordinary way—the bag contained all the letters that had been posted at our office that morning WILLIAM ELLIS I am principal letter-carrier and charge-taker at the chief office at Tottenham and have been so forty years—the prisoner is one of the letter-carriers at the same office—he was on duty on the morning of 30th Sept —I saw him assist in sorting the letters which arrived in the mailbag from the North-office at Tottenham—the local letters are separated from those that are to go to London—a letter for Margate in that bag might come into the prisoner s hands in sorting—if it did it would be his duty to tie it up and put it into the bag going to London by the mail-cart—the cart leaves the principal office about five minutes past ten and goes over by Stamford-hill Cross-examined Q You were not before the Magistrate I believe A No —BOWERS I am one of the assistant letter-carriers at the principal office at Tottenham On Monday 30th Sept I cut the string of the bag that came from the North-office that morning—the prisoner and Cates were there—all three of us were assisting GUILTY —Recommended to mercy by the Jury on account of his previous good character — Transported for Ten Tears Before Mr Justice Erle 
t18501125-50  50 JOHN EDWARD CUNNINGTON was again indicted for a like offence MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JOHN FORBES I am a messenger in the General Post-office On 13th Nov I was directed to watch the prisoner while he was sorting the letters of the Great Western division—I was in a small room near him—about twenty minutes past eight o clock he proceeded to sort and sorted all out of his hand and rose up from the table with his left hand closed and went over to a table a yard or two behind and spoke to a clerk there—I went close by him and saw him pressing heavily with his right hand upon his left which was on the table—shortly after he went across the two offices and went in a direction towards the water-closets I noticed that his left-hand was closed—I went into the adjoining closet—I could see from one to the other very well—I saw him sit down take a letter with a red seal from his left coat pocket open it take it out of the envelope take something out of the letter I could not see what and put it in his right hand—he then read the letter for a minute or so—I could distinctly see the letter and I read the words Rochester Nov 12 My dear father —after he had looked at it he tore it in four pieces and put it down the pan behind him—it is an open seat the pressure of the person on it causes the pump to act and the letter would go down into the trap—a person named Russell was with me—on seeing this I made a communication to him—I remained there till Blackburn the plumber came—no person had entered the water-closet before he came—he examined the closet on which the prisoner had sat and I saw him take out these four pieces of paper and the envelope which bears the postmark Rochester Nov 12 Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Were you watching from the same place that we heard of a little while ago A No my duty leads me about there—I went to the water-closet about half-past eight o clock—I looked through a grating between the two water-closets which are side by side—the grating is rather behind the seat—it is about an inch between the bars about two feet high and all the width of the wall—you can see from one plainly enough into the other—I do not think he could see me if he had looked because the closet I was in is dark—the one where he was is light—I could see distinctly—Blackburn came in about a minute or so at a few minutes before nine—the prisoner was not taken into custody or searched—nothing was done to him at all—I reported the case—nothing was said about it till he was taken up on the other charge—it is not likely that they would tell the prisoner of it—I may have been in twenty or thirty of these cases but have never watched persons in the water-closets before—what I have seen has been in the office WILLIAM RUSSELL I am one of the police-officers attached to the Post-office—I was with Forbes and saw the prisoner in the water-closet—I looked through the grating and saw him undo his breeches sit down and take from his left pocket a small letter with a red seal—I heard a rumpling of paper and saw him reading a letter and heard him put the paper behind him—he then got up—I remained till the plumber came and saw him take out these pieces of paper produced —Forbes had made a communication to me before this was found of what was on it—Forbes was looking over the prisoner s left shoulder Cross-examined Q Are there as many as twenty clerks engaged in sorting letters in the same department A I dare say there are WILLIAM BLACKBURN I am a plumber of the Post-office I went to the water-closet on this morning and found these papers in the trap—you can always find in the trap what the person who was there last has left—the papers do not always go away every time—there were several other pieces of paper there—each closet has a separate trap—the bottom of the grating is about one foot six inches above the seat and the top two feet—it is six inches deep and comes about the level of the shoulder JAMES FREDERICK FRY I live at Rochester On 12th Nov I addressed a letter to my father at Axminster near Devon—I put one shilling in it—it was in an envelope—this is it—it is in my writing—I sealed it with red and posted it at St Margaret s Bank about half-past seven o clock in the evening—I see no remains of the seal JOHN FORBES re-examined This is the letter I saw in the prisoner s hand—here is what I read WILLIAM BOKENHAM I am the superintending president of the Post-office On 13th Nov I had a communication from Forbes and on the following day the prisoner was taken Cross-examined Q How many communications from different people did you have about anything on that day A Fifty or sixty GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Ten Years

Notting-hill-square On 4th June I wrote this letter to my daughter and put this 10l -note into it—this is a memorandum of the number and date which I made at the time—I fastened the letter and also stuck on a black medallion wafer—I took it to the post-office at Notting-hill kept by Miss Underwood and gave it to her with a 6d for the registration-fee desiring that it might be registered—Miss Underwood was busy and put the letter into a glass book-case behind her and asked me to call again for the receipt—I asked to see the letter again to see that I had left the right one and the prisoner handed it to me—I merely looked at it and left it in her hand—I then left the shop and called in half or three-quarters of an hour for the receipt which I received from Miss Underwood—I do not recollect whether the prisoner was present—I afterwards heard that the letter was not right and made an application to the Post-office SOPHIA UNDERWOOD I live at Notting-hill and keep the post-office

registering it—Mrs Rice came again about 5 and I marked Registered letter on it and stamped it—this is my mark in red chalk—I tied it round with string entered it on the bill and gave it to the letter-carrier when he came—there was no other registered letter that dispatch—the prisoner had access to the glass-case—I may have been out of the shop at the time the letter remained at the office I do not recollect it—the prisoner was with me nearly the whole of the time Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q You tied the letter up separately with string A I tied string round it to mark it—a registered letter is always crossed with string—I never kept letters in the glass-case except on any occasion when I have not time to register them that they might not be mixed with other letters—if I had had time to register it I should have put it with the other letters which were going out—I think the letter-carrier had got it when Mrs Rice came for the receipt—after stamping it I put it into the same place till be arrived—I received a very good character with the prisoner EGERTON PHILIP OTLEY BARNES I am a surgeon residing at Alderney I married Mrs Rice s daughter I was present when the postmaster

husband who was in the shop—he gave me the change which I gave to the prisoner—she did not take all the goods with her—she directed me to take a piece of silk to a dressmaker s to be made up Cross-examined Q Had you known her before she lived at the post-office A No I saw her frequently she was in the shop nearly every day—I live about ten minutes walk from Miss Underwood s shop—I never saw her at the post-office—she told me she lived there JAMES GRIFFITHS I am the husband of the last witness I was present on 5th June when the prisoner bought these articles and paid for them with a 10l -note which I took—I paid it on 4th June to Forster and Co of Wood-street Cheapside to a cashier named Griffiths who wrote my name on it—this is it produced —I had no other 10l -note between 5th and 11th June Cross-examined Q Had you any 5l -notes A Yes my wife had access to the box where the notes were kept—she received money in my absence but would not pay it—if a customer came with a 10l -note and spent 2l she might give a 5l -note and three sovereigns in change—I took notice of the number of the note either when I received it or paid it away—I paid Mr Griffiths 42l in notes and gold—I have no memorandum to show what the notes were—I was behind the counter when I received the note—I put it in my pocket till I took the cash for the day when I put it in the cash-box—to the best of my knowledge I had not been to the cash-box to take out any notes between the 8th and 11th MR BODKIN Q Did you pay any other 10l -note to Forster and Co that day A No only one—the cash-box was left

his name on all the notes WALTER ROBERTSON SCULTHORPE I am one of the presidents of the General Post-office In consequence of a communication made there I went on 17th June to Notting-hill and found the prisoner at Miss Underwood s post-office—I asked whether she had bought any goods lately at Mr Griffiths —she said she had she knew me having seen me a few days previously —I asked her if she had changed a 10l -note there—she said Yes —I asked who she received it from—she said she had it before she left Mr Hall s on 1st Feb —I said The note you changed at Mr Griffiths s on 5th June is the note which was inclosed in a registered letter on 4th June and posted it your office —she said I received it on 1st Feb before I left Mr Hall s —I then gave her into custody WILLIAM RUSSELL I am one of the police-constables attached to the Post-office I took the prisoner by Mr Sculthorpe s direction—in consequence of information I went to Mrs Oliver s 1 High-street Notting-hill where I obtained a parasol a pair of cuffs a quantity of damask and other articles which I afterwards showed to the prisoner at Miss Underwood s—when I opened the box they were in she took hold of the shawl and said This is not the shawl I bought of Mr Griffiths when I changed the note —she selected this shawl the damask cuffs pair of gloves and parasol from the box—I received 6l from Mrs Oliver and 12s was found in the tea-caddy which the prisoner gave me the keys of and 11s 1d in a purse upon her ELIZABETH OLIVER I gave these articles to the officer—I got them from the prisoner—she left 6l with me I think on

previously but she had left the articles of dress with me to be repaired or made—I have known her three or four years—she has been a servant in that neighbourhood—her character has been very good indeed RICHARD ADTE BAILEY I come from the Bank of England This note was not in circulation till after 10th April 1851—there is only one note of the same number and date in circulation at the same time MR O BRIEN submitted that the letter was not a post-letter before it was stamped and that the note might have been abstracted before that time and that if the postmistress did anything inconsistent with her duty after the delivery of the letter it would have the effect of disposting it referring to Reg v Harley 1 Car and Kir where the letter was merely left on the counter with a penny before a servant not authorised to receive it it was held that it did not acquire the peculiar character of a post-letter MR BODKIN relied upon the words of the statute shall be deemed a post-letter from the time of its delivery to the post-office The COURT considered it to be a post-letter within the meaning of the statute Edward Bevan grocer of Brompton and Henry Fisher of

son Peter to post—the notes were new and quite entire PETBR PHARAOH JDN I received a letter from my mother in Sept last to put into the post it was directed to my father at Gravesend—I put the letter into the box at the post-office at Bitterne between six and seven o clock in the same state in which I received it GEORGE TOUTON I keep the receiving-house at Bitterne A letter posted there between six and seven o clock in the evening of 13th Sept would leave by the mail at seven for Southampton GEORGE FREEMAN I am a clerk in the Southampton post-office The bag from Bitterne would be forwarded to London the same night—I made up the bag on the night of 13th Sept and forwarded it in the regular way — MILLER I hold a situation in the General Post-office The mail-bag from Southampton of 13th Sept last arrived at the General Post-office early on the morning of the 14th—I was on duty there—it came sealed and in its usual state Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you receive it personally A It was brought into the office by a messenger for the purpose of being opened—I opened it and took out the letters HENRY BICKLEY I am a clerk in the General Post-office A letter arriving from Southampton in the morning of 14th Sept would be forwarded to Gravesend the same morning—I made up the bag for Gravesend that morning and dispatched it in the usual course PETER PHARAOH On 14th Sept last I was on my way to Gravesend—I was there on 16th—I expected a remittance from my wife and applied at the Gravesend post-office for it on 16th and again the following day I received no letter—upon that I made a communication to the Post-office authorities THOMAS WALKER I am assistant to Mr De Castro of 65 Piccadilly he keeps a post receiving-house In Nov last the officer Peak called on me about a 5l -note—this is the note he was inquiring about produced —I had received it on 15th Nov which was about a week before Peak called—I gave in exchange for it two or three sheets of postage-stamps and the difference which would be two or three sovereigns—the postage-stamps are 1l a sheet—Young is very much like the person of whom I took the note—I will not swear positively that he is the man—I believe be is—I noticed his dress—I have seen a coat which was produced to me by Peak—it was precisely the kind of coat that the man wore—before I changed the note I asked him his name and address which he gave as J Pharaoh Southampton —I wrote that on the note at the time Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Yon cannot pledge your oath as to Young being the person that changed the note A No I am not positive but I believe he is the man—this is my writing on the note by which I know it to be the note—Peak brought the coat to our shop I believe over his arm and held it up for me to see—I had previously given him a description of the coat—he asked me if that was like the coat it is like it and the same colour—it is a kind of an olive-brown I do not know what colour it is termed—there is the colour for you to see—I called it a sort of brown coat—it was about 6 in the evening that the person changed the note—it was not dark in our shop we had a gas-light—it was in the daytime that Peak brought the coat HARLES SOLOMON COUVES I am the postmaster at Gravesend Young was formerly a clerk in that office he resigned his situation in Oct last—he was on duty on 14th Sept last when the mail-bag from London arrived— the letters contained in that bag would in the course of business come into Young s possession it would be his duty to open the bag and stamp the letters—we have a box specially for letters addressed to the post-office are placed alphabetically in pigeon-holes—it would be Young s duty after stamping such a letter to place it on the counter to be sorted—I should most likely sort them and put them in the pigeon-holes—on 14th Sept the prisoner Muzzall was also employed in my house—he was my private clerk—he used to assist in the business of the post-office—when Young resigned Muzzall was appointed to his situation and continued in it till he was apprehended on this charge—he was most likely assisting in the post-office on 14th Sept I have no distinct recollection—most likely if any one called for a letter while he was there he would hand it out—he was employed in writing my private letters and so on sometimes in the back-room and sometimes in the post-office—his employment would give him access to letters that passed through the post-office—he was at the same time employed in the office of a solicitor at Gravesend—I think I first heard of Voller having made a communication to the post-office in July—this letter dated 9th July produced is Muzzall s writing I received it from him that day or the next—I think it was in June that I first heard that something improper had taken place and I received this either on the 9th or 10th July— Letter read— Gravesend July 9 1851 To Mr Couves Sir—I beg to tender you my resignation of the appointment I bold as clerk in the post-office Gravesend Wm Muzzall —I remember Mr Ramsay one of the superior officers of the Post-office coming down to Gravesend I think it was on 21st or 22nd Nov —my house was searched on the evening of that day Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Young was in the employment of the post-office A Yes he was there seven or eight years I always thought him a respectable honest young man his resignation was voluntary he complained of being over-worked and I understood he was about to commence business in London—he resigned on 5th Oct 1850—there are two clerks employed in the post-office one besides Young—it was Young s duty to open the morning mail—there are two mails from London one in the morning and the other at noon—Young used to open the bag that arrived at 12 in the day and I opened the other which arrived at 11 at night—a person named Bond was in my employment at that time—I am not aware that he is now in Maidstone gaol—he has been dismissed from the office for misconduct—he is not in gaol now he has been not for crime for debt—he was very much involved—he was dismissed about a month or six weeks ago—it was in Nov last when he was in gaol—I had no other clerk at that time but Young and Bond and my assistant Muzzall—the witness Ellen Voller has called at the office to see her husband Muzzall —she came once or twice and sat outside the gate not inside—Young had talked of leaving for more than a year before he left—a person named Carmody was in my service for one week only in 1849—he was not discharged we were not in want of hit services—he has not been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards since he has left the town Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Can you tell me whether Bond was at the office on 14th Sept A Yes I think he was—he had an opportunity of taking any letter that was there—I have seen him since this inquiry was going on I think I have seen him in communication with Mr Peacock the solicitor—I know Ellen Voller by sight—I do not know that she has been in the society of Bond I never saw them together—I have seen her in the neighbourhood of my office at the time Bond has been there—I have known Muzzall between three and four years—as far as I have known his character has been irreproachable I never heard any imputation on him except this—he was managing clerk to a respectable solicitor at Gravesend and I employed him as my clerk in after hours—he was not a servant of the post-office—he was my private clerk and assisted me in some assurance business also—I always found him correct attentive and respectable—I have no distinct recollection whether he was assisting on 14th Sept —there were occasions when he was not present—he might or might not have been present on this occasion MR PARRY Q Young did not attend the whole of the day I believe did be attend from 5 till 7 o clock in the morning A Yes then again from 11 till 2 being absent in the interval and then again from 6 till 10 at night—his salary was 50l a year MR BODKIN Q You have been asked about the conduct of the prisoner during the time they were employed there were complaints made of letters being missed A Yes many ELLEN VOLLER examined on the voir dire by MR PARRY I have been married to the prisoner Muzzall—we were married on 6th Aug 1849 at Aldgate Church London by a clergyman of the Church of England by banns Upon MR CLARKSON being about to put a question to the witness MR PARRY objected as the evidence at present stood the witness was proved to be the prisoner s wife if it was sought to invalidate the marriage that must be done by independent testimony and not by any examination of the witness MR JUSTICE ERLE was of opinion that any witness examined to a particular fact might be questioned as to the entire of her knowledge of that fact in his judgment even in a case of bigamy the second wife would be a competent witness to prove the first marriage if she happened to be present at it It could not betaken at present that the witness was proved to be the prisoner s lawful wife that was the subject under inquiry MR CLARKSON Q Had you an elder sister named Caroline A Yes she was Muzzall s wife—she died in Oct 1848—she lived with Muzzall as his wife for two years—I was present at her marriage—Muzzall quitted me in May last—he was married to my sister at Oving near Chichester by licence—it was at a parish Church and as far at I know by a clergyman of the Church of England a Mr Langdon—I was a witness to the marriage and signed my name as such—Muzzall was a National Schoolmaster at that time and lived at Midhurst—my father s name was Thomas Voller—the prisoner s father was not present at the marriage—ray sister bad not been married before—I knew Mr Langdon he was the vicar of Oving MR PARRY Q Are your father and mother alive A Yes my sister was seven years older than me—she was thirty when she was married COURT Q Were you and your sister Caroline bred up together as sisters by the same parents A Yes MR CLARKSON proposing to examine the witness generally MR PARRY submitted that as the prisoner s wife her evidence was not receivable He admitted that if it was clearly established that she was the sister of the prisoner s first wife that would invalidate her marriage and so admit her testimony but he contended that that was not shown to be the case her mere statement that she called her sister was not enough nor would the reputation of relationship apply in a criminal case the best evidence was that of the parents in the absence of which he contended the evidence should be excluded MR BALLANTINE urged the same objection the principle upon which such testimony was rejected was that from the connection existing between man and wife the ends of justice were not likely to be assisted by its reception This principle was recognised in Campbell v Trendhw 1st Price and to get rid of that principle the strictest possible evidence was required MR JUSTICE ERLE was of opinion that the evidence was admissible it was perfectly clear that if a person was questioned on the voir dire with a view to raise an objection to her competency as a witness she might also be examined to remove that primd facie ground of objection of being the prisoner s wife by showing that her marriage was void and did not create the relation of wife to the prisoner that being so the competency of the witness was established to show that the prisoner had been before married Then came the question was she competent to prove that she was sister to the former wife In his opinion although seven years younger she was competent to prove that relationship there was no rule of law requiring that it should be established by that which would be demonstration namely by the testimony of persons present at the birth The witness was then sworn and examined as follows —The prisoner Muzzall left me in May last—he stayed away from me a week—at the end of the week he returned—in consequence of what passed between us I then went into the service of Mr Thomas Varden—I am in his service now—whilst I was living with Muzzall he was in the service of a person of the name of Sharland an attorney at Gravesend he was also in the employ of the postmaster at Gravesend—in Sept last Muzzall brought two 10l -notes to me and asked me to change them—I asked why he did not change them himself—he said he had his reasons for it—I said I would not change them—about a week after he again asked me to go to London and change them—I asked why he did not do it himself—he said they were Tom Young s and he did not like to—I told him there was something wrong or else Tom Young would have changed them himself—he asked me if I would change them if he told me where he got them from—I said Yes —he said You don t mean it —I said Yes I do —he then said that Tom Young had taken them out of a letter that was posted at Bitterne near Southampton and that it was directed to the Gravesend post-office till called for—I asked him what there was in the letter—he said two tens and a five—I told him I would not change them and told him to take them to Tom Young and tell him to send them back to the person they belonged to—he said he should not be such a fool as that—I afterwards saw the notes in his waistcoat pocket in the bedroom that was about a week before the postmaster s house was searched—he was then at the office—they were two 10l -notes—I looked at them—they were dated June 1850—I think Muzzall came home about 7 o clock that night I do not know—it was in the evening—he came home to dinner—I told him what I had seen and where and when he came home at night he told me to put them away—that was the night that the postmaster s house was searched he told me to put them away as they might come and search his—I asked what I was to do with them if I was to burn them—he said no he wanted Tom Young to have them and he told me to take them to Tom Young in London—next morning I went to London and took the two 10l -notes with me—I took them to a house at Shepherd s-bush—I found Young there and gave him the notes—he said All right —I then returned to Gravesend—I have since been to the house at Shepherd s-bush with Peak—I pointed out the house to him—it was in Cambridge-terrace—I cannot recollect the number—a short time after I had taken the notes to Young I saw Muzzall with two sheets of postage-stamps—I asked him where he got them—he said Tom Young had changed the 5l -note and brought him 2l -worth of stamps and kept the remaining 3l himself Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q When was it that you first saw these notes A As near as I can tell somewhere at the latter part of Sept —I cannot tell how long it was after that when I saw them in his waistcoat pocket—it was a month and more too—it was the waistcoat he usually wore—it was in the morning after he was gone to the office—I was putting the waistcoat away—I found it lying on the bed—I felt in the pockets—I did not expect to find the notes there—it did not surprise me—there was nothing else in the pockets—they were not wrapped up they were loose—I had not seen them between the time he first spoke to me about them and my seeing them in his waistcoat pocket—I did not take the numbers of the notes—I looked at the date because he had told me they were quite new—the date was June 1850—I do not know the day—the 6th as near as I can tell—it was about a week after that I heard the postmaster s house was searched—I did not know what it was searched for—I thought there was something improper in my husband s giving me the notes to take to Young—I believed at that time they were stolen property—I have lived with Muzzall rather more than twelve months—I have had one child by him—that was born ten months after we were married—it is not now living—that is the only child I have had by Muzzall—I have not been married before—I have had one child before—that is six years ago—I know Bond—I saw him last when we were at the hearing at Bow-street—I talked to him—I have not seen him here today—I did not see him at all in communication with Peak—I have known him about two years—I knew him at Gravesend he was a clerk in the post-office—I have never been to see him there—I have been to the post-office—I have seen him there on duty—I have never spoken to him there—I have seen him after post-office hours—I have not walked about with him—I have seen him about the streets—I have not spoken to him on those occasions—I have not had any talk with him about this matter until the bearing—I did not give the information—I first gave information to Mr Phillips—he came to Brunswick-place to me—he is an officer in the post-office—I had given information to my brother a fortnight before Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Was it in Sept that you had this conversation with your husband Muzzall A Yes it was not then that he told me that Young had changed the 5l -note it was afterwards when Young was in London—I had not seen any account in the newspaper before I gave information to my brother—my brother is at home now ill—he was at the post-office as a clerk—he was not living in the same house with Bond—I have not frequently seen him with Bond—I saw him once with him before I left Gravesend—he came to see him at my house—my brother is not now in the post-office—he was dismissed about a fortnight ago since this inquiry has been set on foot—he is twenty-three years old—I have not seen him and Bond together more than once—they spoke together in my presence then they left the house together—that was in the afternoon—it was about a fortnight before I left Gravesend at the beginning of May—my brother then lived with me and Muzzall ANN SUSANNAH COUVES I am the wife of the postmaster at Gravesend Our house was searched on 21st Nov —Muzzall came to the office that evening about 7 o clock—I opened the door to him—he generally came to his duty about that time—I said to him Oh dear Mr Muzzall we are in great trouble there is a letter missing do you know anything about it —he said I must go home for a little time I shall be back in a quarter of an hour —he went away and was gone as near as I recollect about half an hour—I do hot know where he lived Gross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q He had been home on other occasions I suppose had he not A Yes I thought his going home rather unusual on account of his having been absent from duty during the day and I was on duty in the office waiting for his return—I made no complaint about it JURY to ELLEN VOLLER Q Was your brother allowed to enter the bed-room of Muzzall A No he used to go into my bedroom occasionally—he was not at the post-office at the time this robbery was committed—he had access to my room at all times after he was at Gravesend while he was at my house—I do not know when he went to the post-office CHARLES SOLOMON COUVES re-examined Voller s brother came to the post-office on 13th Oct —he resigned his situation three or four weeks since—he resigned voluntarily—I understood him that he expected a situation on the railway—I think he would very likely have been dismissed if he had not resigned on account of having a new clerk—he was not appointed officially only as an assistant CHARLOTTE QUINTON I live at 3 Cambridge-terrace Shepberd s-bush Peak the officer came to my house—I recognize the prisoner Young as a person having lived next door to us I think from Oct last year till the beginning of Jan this year MATTHEW PEAK I am a constable stationed at the Post-office On 8th July I received a warrant from Bow-street and took Muzzall into custody at the post-office Gravesend—I told him I took him into custody for stealing a letter posted at Bitterne near Southampton on 13th Sept last containing two 10l -notes and a 5l -note and that it had been stated that the 5l -note was changed by Young and he purchased two or three sheets of stamps—he said it was true Young bad sent him such stamps which he said were for a debt—he afterwards said that Young brought them to him and gave them to him personally—I searched Muzzall and found a letter in his pocket which he stated he had received from Young that morning—I asked for the envelope and he said he had destroyed it— letter read— 5 Mount Pleasant Dear Bill I got yours late last night and have sent to Frank S—to settle the County Court Let me know

been stated that he had changed the 5l -note and bought two or three sheets of postage stamps which stamps he gave to Muzzall and that Muzzall had stated he had brought him some postage stamps—he said Does Muzzall say that —I said Yes he did —he said That is your friends —the superintendent of Ramsgate who was with me asked him whether he did so—he said he should not answer that question—next day I brought him from Ramsgate to London—on our road I asked him if he ever lived at No 4 Cambridge-terrace Shepherd s-bush—he said Yes he did —I said I know you did —he said Have you been there —I said Yes I went there with Mrs Muzzall —when he came to the post-office he was asked again if he had ever lived at Shepherd s-bush—he said Yes —he was asked if Mrs Muzzall visited him there at any time—he

t18520105-181  181 EDWARD CHARLES MASTERTON stealing whilst employed in the Post-office a letter containing money the property of Her Majesty s Post-master General MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JOHN FORBES I am a messenger to the General Post-office—the prisoner was a clerk there and was on duty there on the morning of 31st Dec from 5 till half-past 9—for reasons I had I was noticing him and saw him feeling the letters as if to find out whether there was any cash in them—about half-put 7 I saw him crumple one up in his left hand and then go on sorting—I told the President on duty Mr Graham—about half-past 9 when the prisoner had finished his division he went down-stairs to the basement—his duty for that time was done—as he was coming up again adjusting his coat I stopped him leaving the Inland-office—the men s coats are kept on the basement—I laid hold of him and said the President wanted to speak to him—he gave a slight pull to get away—I said He only wants to speak to you —at that moment Mr Graham stepped up and asked him to step into a private room—he then said he had been informed that he had something about him which be ought not to have—the prisoner made no answer—he is not deaf—Mr Graham asked him if he had any objection to be searched—he faintly replied No I then sent for Peak the officer who proceeded to search him—I saw him take a letter from his pocket along with his handkerchief and afterwards he took another letter out of his trowsers pocket I think—these are them— produced —they bear the Inland post-mark of that morning and ought to hate gone off by the morning mail—they would have come before him that morning it the course of his duty as a sorter Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Do you understand the business he had to perform A Yes the letters would be stamped at the tables before they came to him—such letters as these would not be weighed—I have ascertained that the penny stamp would cover them—it is the duty of an officer if he finds a letter over weight to have it surcharged—he would not have to take it anywhere—there is a balance on the division—he would have to take the letters he thought over weight and put them on the balance and if they were over weight he would tax them that is done with pen and ink—it would then be put with the unpaid letters into a box in t division where the prisoner was—we often find over-weight letters—I had had directions some days previously to watch the prisoner told had been watching him every day to find out something—I did not know that he was in a bad state of health—he answered faintly MR BODKIN Q You bad been looking at him some time before you saw the crumpling up of the letter A Yes I did not see him take a pen to charge any letter or go to any balance—the balance was in the same room ten or twelve yards off—he had pen and ink—he had no occasion to leave the room to tax a letter COURT Q You say the balance was ten yards from the place when he was sorting is that so A Yes there might have been twenty of thirty balances in the room—his own division was as near as any that was about ten yards off—a sorter might collect all the over-weight letters and then weigh them or he might go to the balance immediately—there it is sorter to whom he ought to take them to weigh and tax them but the prisoner would tax them himself—when he was stopped at the door by me and introduced to Mr Graham he did not mention that there were some letters over weight GEORGE GRAHAM I am one of the presidents of the Inland-office On the morning of 31st Dec Forbes made a communication to me and I went up to the prisoner who was about to leave the office I said I wished to speak to him if he would follow me into Mr Bokenham the superintending president s office he did so and I said Mr Masterton it has been intimated to me that you have something about you which you should not have —he made no reply—I said Have you any objection to be searched —he answered very faintly No —I then told Forbes the messenger to fetch Peak who came and searched and I saw him produce from his person a letter with a pocket-handkerchief and another letter immediately afterwards—one is addressed Mr J Forward on board the Defiance cutter Weymouth Dorsetshire and the other Rev John Smith Moravian-chapel Devonport —the prisoner said I am sorry you should see me in this position I belong to a most respectable family and I believe it will be the death of my wife she has no other relation on earth but myself I cannot think what induced me to do it it must have been infatuation Cross-examined Q From the mode in which you speak I suppose you are well acquainted with him A I am I have known him ever since he has been in the office four years—I only know from

him MATTHEW PEAK I am a constable attached to the General Post-office I searched the prisoner and found these letters one in the inward pocket of his coat and the other in his left-hand trowsers pocket—they were crumpled up but the seals were not broken—they were opened before the Magistrate by his direction—there was one shilling in the one addressed to Mr Forward—it was sewn into this

named Joseph on board the revenue-cutter Defiance lying off Weymouth—this letter is my writing—I sent it to him—I put one shilling in it sewed in a bit of silk with a bit of selvage at the end—my

Strand and gave it to Stokes the butler to stamp and post it RICHARD STOKES I am butler to the Hon Mr Butler On 30th March I received a letter from my young master—I should say this is it from the look of it—I remember the direction—I also received from him two other letters—I put two stamps on this letter and one on each of the others—he gave me 6d to pay for them—I put the letters in a

Where does he hand you jour portion A In Surrey-street I meet him there—I did so that morning Cross-examined Q Are the letters that are handed over by him toyouseparated from his own lot at the

deliver of a morning—it is nearer 500 than five—I never delivered on the prisoner s ground and cannot tell about how many be would have to deliver—I do not know whether it is as extensive as mine—he

of the house—in consequence of what he told me I looked at the top of a clock case there and found a key with which I unlocked a drawer in that same room I there found this envelope and letter—it was broken open in the same state it is now—there was no money in it—I returned to the prisoner and asked him where he got it from—he said he could not tell he could not give any account of it Cross-examined Q You say they were his lodgings did he tell you so A He told me to go to 40 Westmoreland-buildings and I did so—I asked him for his address—the landlady took me up into his room—he only occupied one room a bed room—I did not see any one there—I do not know that another young man belonging to the Post-office lodged with him—I have heard so—he is here MR CLARKSON Q You say it was in consequence of what he said to you that you examined the top of the clock case and found the key A Yes I told him I was going to search his place and if there was anything locked it would be my duty to break it open to see what was inside—he said there was the drawer and I should find the key in it—I said Well if I do not I must break it open —he then said If it is not there you will find it at the top of the clock —Hone is the person that lodged with him HENRY FRANCIS HONE I am a General Post letter carrier—I lodged in the same house as the prisoner but I left the Saturday previous to Peak coming there—the prisoner occupied the left-hand room as you go up—no one else occupied that room of late—I have known him occupying that room alone for about twelve months—another young man named Michael Foy who was also employed in the Post-office lodged in the house—we both occupied the room on the right hand Cross-examined Q Were you in the same department of the Post-office as the prisoner A Yes and Foy also—while we lodged together we associated with each other and were very friendly—my delivery is in Wilson-street Finsbury—my bed room and the prisoner s did not open with one key—we never kept our s locked—there were other lodgers—Foy and I occupied the same room—it was the room facing the prisoner s—there was a landing place between MR BODKIN Q Look at that letter did you ever see that before it was in the officer s hands A No I did not MICHAEL FOY I lodged at 40 Westmoreland-place at the tame time at the prisoner—I and Hone occupied the tame room—the prisoner s room was opposite ours—I know nothing of this letter I have never seen it before to my knowledge—I am a letter-carrier—my delivery it now in the Strand near Temple-bar—I changed my district the day the

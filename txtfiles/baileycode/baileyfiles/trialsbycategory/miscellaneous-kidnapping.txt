Permit me to solicit you attention to an unfortunate young man who wishes to state as briefly as possible the peculiar circumstances of his case The course pursued by my prosecutor and his friends who through the medium of the press have branded me with the most gross and dishonourable epithets renders it necessary for me most respectfully to intreat that you gentlemen of the Jury will take heed lest unconsciously you give a verdict under the influence of a mind tinctured with prejudice I have as it were been hunted down and stigmatized as the worst of human beings - described as a wretch devoid of feeling - one whom every parent ought to detest Were I that infamous person I should at this painful moment shrink from your sight but with the indulgence of the Court I shall relate facts which I trust will induce you to cast back upon my accuser part of the odium he has industriously endeavoured to bring upon me - facts which I feel convinced will place the crime with which I stand charged in a different point of view You have heard the evidence in support of the offence imputed to me but you are strangers to the injustice and oppression under which I have suffered Let me intreat you my Lord and gentlemen of the Jury to listen to a persecuted much-wronged individual and decide with that mercy and liberality which so eminently characterizes a British Court of Justice I am the grandson of Mr Charles Rennett late of the Inner Temple In the course of his extensive and respectable practice he realized a considerable fortune He possessed several estates real and personal independent of money in the funds to the amount of several thousand pounds The principal freehold estate of the estimated value of 20 000 l situate in and including the manor of Wesmeon in the county of Southampton was given under my grandfather s will to trustees in trust for my father the only son and heir of his body He amply provided for his other children out of the remaining estate and funded property At his decease my father entered into possession of the estate bequeathed to him and continued in the enjoyment of it up to the time of his death which happened at an early period He left a widow a daughter and myself - from that time I date all my miseries Mr Charles Dignum the singer had married my aunt the sister of my father who was executrix under my grandfather s will and trustee of the estate bequeathed to my father who at the time of the testator s decease was under age upon her death Mr Dignum as her legal representative acted as sole trustee My father several years previous to his decease was of an imbecile mind and dcoiliated constitution he made a will in 1805 giving the whole of his property to his wife his daughter and myself naming his wife executrix and two respectable gentlemen his executors This distribution of property not meeting the views of Mr Dignum he in 1809 in concert with Mr James Agar of Hare-court Temple a man known to my grandfather by being often at his table Taking advantage of my father s mental weakness they got him to sign at Agar s chambers a paper previously prepared by Mr Agar which gave all his real estate equally between my sister himself and Agar s illegitimate child His personal estate was given to a prostitute who had been Dignum s servant and then cohabited with my father They named her executrix and themselves executors leaving his wife now unprovided for This scandalous will answered a double purpose - in the first place it was calculated to increase my difficulties in recovering my birthright the seizure of which was then in contemplation as my father s decease was an event supposed to be not very far distant - Secondly in case I ultimately succeeded in obtaining my birthright it might afford a comfortable provision for Agar s illegitimate offspring My father died surrounded by his wife and children under the impression that he had provided for his family by the will made in 1805 the only one known by them to be in existence he himself such was his mental incapacity having no trace in his mind of the will if it deserves the name made in 1809 Judge of our astonishment and indignation when this villainous document was produced and read to us at Agar s chambers - Dignum acted alone as executor After paying the tribute of crocodile tears to the memory of his departed brother and vowing that he would be the friend of the widow and children his first act was to lay claim to and take possession of the family estate he then put up to sale all the personal property left by my father including every article of furniture which having accomplished the widow and children were turned out of doors to do the best they could for themselves The property included the residue of a lease of some houses in Grafton-court the deeds thereof being in Dignum s possession which on being put up for sale found no bidders it being stated that the securities were lost Dignum the executor became the purchaser at one-fourth of the value Whenever I endeavoured to remonstrate with him on the injustice and cruelty of depriving me of my birthright he stopped me by tauntingly asking me why I did not take legal steps for the recovery of it well knowing in addition to my being under age and without a guardian that I had not the means of purchasing the necessaries of life much less to defray the expences of law proceedings He knew he ought to have given me possession as heir at law independent of which it was his legal as well as moral duty as trustee to institute a suit in a Court of Equity if he doubted my right to the property After a lapse of about five years I applied to a solicitor who at first warmly advocated my cause but after a meeting held at the chambers of my prosecutor s legal adviser he became the solicitor of my prosecutor who about this time he being in humble circumstances married Dignum s daughter Five years had then elapsed since my father s death during which my poor aged mother and myself underwent all the miseries attendant on the lowest state of poverty Dignum taking advantage of my distressed condition proposed to me that if I would give a release to my claim on the estate he would use his interest to procure me a situation in the East India House or some office under Government - I indignantly rejected the proposal Sunk in poverty and despairing of the restitution of my right I had no resource but to propose to these oppressors to receive a small compensation for my claim The business was negociated by my prosecutor on behalf of himself Dignum and a Miss Faruell who also claimed an interest in the property Every circumstance that appeared calculated to bring me into an acceptance of their own terms was eagerly laid hold of by my prosecutor My father s will of 1809 my poverty and consequent incapacity of prosecuting vigorously with legal proceedings were coutrasted with their ability to protract the suit for a number of years which Mr Horsley assured me it was their determination to do if we could not come to terms Thus situated I was reduced to the deplorable necessity of disposing of my title to an estate for a sum not amounting to one-half the proceeds thereof received by my oppressors since my father s death Under all these afflictions they would yet have enjoyed peaceable possession of the property had not their subsequent injustice have worked me almost to a state of frenzy Miss Farnell the young lady before alluded to was left an infant orphan under my father s roof I looked forward to her giving a proof of her gratitude to her benefactor in the person of his widow or children particularly as she was unmarried and had no near relatives - she was at this time in the last stage of a fatal disorder On the day of the compromise she told my sister she was very unhappy she had not a friend in the world and had ever lamented losing the protection of her uncle Rennett - no one had ever treated her with kindness but him Mrs Horsley used her very ill and she wished to alter the distribution of her property but had no power to follow her own inclination The following day she signed a will leaving her property except some gift to charity to Dignum Horsley my prosecutor and the illegitimate son of James Agar She died a few days after signing the will Dignum the executor appointed thereto sent a letter to my sister stating that she was remembered by the testatrix who had left her twelve yards of black ribbon - the rest ofthe family he said were not named The whole of this property amounting to several thousand pounds was derived from my grandfather Can it be credited that this young lady laying under the greatest obligations to my father and which she always readily admitted and after what had passed between her and my sister the day previous to her signing this will would if left to the exercise of a free will have so disposed of her property Could she then on the brink of eternity be capable of acting such a cruel ungrateful and deceptive part most assuredly not It is too revolting to common sense to suppose it This last act of avaricious villainy inflamed me to an excess I cannot describe and finally urged me to commit the offence which has brought me into my present unhappy situation My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury - here I entreat you to feel for my wrongs repeated injuries too often goad and drive men to the commission of crime - such has been the case with me I am sensible of having done wrong Reflection which brings conviction to the mind has shewn me my error but I hope and trust when the provocation is considered with the act you will say the offence is deprived of that false glare and enormity the prosecutor and his friends have given it This case differs from all others that have hitherto occupied the attention of a British Court of Criminal Justice A series of private injuries have given birth to a public crime Not possessing sufficient command to submit to the wrongs inflicted by my prosecutor and his friends I have committed an act which gives my prosecutor an opportunity he will not let slip of completing the ruin he has so successfully began unless shielded by the mercy of those whom I now have the honour of addressing The parental care and kindness that the child which accompanied me experienced proves that I am not that abandoned hard-hearted wretch which the prosecutor has described me By voluntarily acknowledging him to be the father of the child I enabled him to obtain immediate possession of him and return to England which he could not otherwise have done I made every reparation in my power and received in return his promise in writing of mercy I thought my prosecutor sincere in his profession of mercy At Bow-street he pretended that he gave the promise under the idea that my offence was punishable with death Can such ignorance of the punishment of my offence be credited in one whom it so essentially concerned is it not more reasonable to infer that he subsequently regretted giving the promise and wished to avoid it His endeavour to explain it away however destroys the effect intended for it proves that he did not give it as a promise of mercy and his repenting of it does not make it less a promise I have only to add that I have suffered six months confinement five of which I have been in a foreign country and that a beloved infant has perished in a prison where its mother was taken on suspicion of being an accomplice Relying on your candour I throw myself upon your most humane consideration GUILTY Aged 28 Transported for Seven Years London Jury before Mr Justice Bayley

I had seen that vessel before and knew her perfectly well - she was a small ship of about one hundred and fifty tons she appeared to be going to land off Mauritius Her mizen topsail was aback She was as close to the reef as she could safely be I suspected her and disguised the boat After I found her in a favourable position I left my station and went out to chase her in my boat - I came up to her about twelve o clock she was steering W N W off the land I boarded her and asked the captain for the logbook he said it was washed overboard on the 23d of last month I asked him for his papers and what cargo he had he said it had been bullocks The papers were produced they were in French He said the bullocks had been thrown overboard likewise on the 23d as it blew hard and he had split his mizen that he had come from Tamatave which is in the island of Madagascar and was going to Bourbon Q Was the vessel steering in a direction for Bourbon - A It was then but in coming from Tamatave to Bourbon she would not come to the Mauritius I examined the vessel - she did not appear to me to be a vessel fit for carrying bullocks from the peculiarity of her build she was too small between decks I do not think they could have stood upright The breed of bullocks at Madagascar appear to be larger than in this country - they are taller and have a hump They are the buffalo bullocks I never saw any others there Q Was there any appearance of bullocks having been in the ship - A Not the least I saw no soil - they make a great dirt on board a ship There were eleven tubs or kids on board the vessel had only ten men on board The tubs and kids were more than sufficient for that complement of men There were some particles of rice in one or two of them as if men had been fed out of them She was brought to anchor and the following day the same crew were on board I found twenty-two pair of handcuffs and three hammers for clenching the irons under the captain s bed-place in the lower bed-place The crew were sent on board our frigate General Downing is Governor of the Mauritius it is in our possession I do not know the prisoner Carrol Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q Do you understand French - A A little - I cannot read French papers fluently Neither of the prisoners were on board I had several interpreters on board the vessel She was ship-rigged which is unusual for a ship of one hundred and fifty tons She was only laying to she might have made more away if she pleased Q Did you say before the Magistrate that the vessel was unmanageable - A That was two hours after I took possession of her it was in consequence of their being very little wind A cargo of bullocks would be very inconvenient on board this vessel Q If she met with bad weather she would be more likely to throw them overboard - A My opinion is that it would be better to let them remain as ballast for she must have taken her hatches off to throw them overboard The captain said there were seventy bullocks - they would not roll about much The vessel was not at all adapted for cattle It could not have been driven up there by the the wind there was a trade-wind blowing there she would have been driven to the Cape of Good Hope We have hurricanes but they had passed before Q Is it not common for a ship to lose her reckoning after a hurricane - A Certainly I saw no slaves on board I do not know that the irons were rusty - they might corrode in half an hour Cross-examined by MR PLATT Q In that district there is a commandant and police - A I do not know it There are officers all round the Mauritius for the purpose of preventing the traffic The vessel was very near the reef I gave information to the Governor No slave was found to my knowledge It was moderate weather on the 2d and 3d of June - I was always able to go out in the boat I do not think the vessel could carry bullocks I will not say it could not Q Can you say the bullocks at Madagascar are all of the buffalo kind - A I have seen a cargo of three hundred landed and they were all of the buffalo kind and imported from Madagascar Q The vessel did not appear to have contained bullocks - A No she had no stalls nor ring-bolts to fasten the bullocks to It is usual to make cattle fast when they go to sea MR REYNOLDS Q Have you any recollection of there having been a hurricane - A We experienced a hurricane before but at that time this ship was in harbour - this was before April she had not sailed from Port Louis then The hurricane months are about the equinox The vessel had not the slightest appearance of having suffered from a hurricane JAMES CLANDOMIN through an interpreter I was servant to Mons Carrol in the Mauritius and embarked from there with him to go to Bourbon - I had been his servant about a month before that We landed at Bourbon and remained there two months we were three days on our passage We then went to Tamatave in Madagascar and were six days in our passage we went ashore and Mons Carrol went up the country - I remained at Tamatave he was absent two months and then returned to Tamatave with about fifty blacks they remained at Tamatave two days and were then embarked on board Le Jeune Adolphe About one hundred and fifty more were brought down and were all embarked together Mons Carrol came on board next day and we immediately set sail for the Mauritius When we got about two leagues from land at the Mauritius the boats of Mons Villemont came out to us in the night he was in one of them and came on board the vessel The blacks were all put into two pinnaces the prisoners and I went with them - I wasin the same pinnace with Carrol We landed at Mapoor in the Mauritius - Villemont landed the blacks they were first taken to his house which is about a quarter of a league from where we landed - I went there afterwards and saw them there they remained there about a quarter of an hour Carrol was there Villemont took the blacks away afterwards I remained at Villemont s - Carrol was ill at the time He was taken up very soon after Q Did you afterwards go to Port Louis - A Yes I was interrogated there Villemont was there I pointed him out Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Were you a freeman or a slave - A A freeman I was six months in his service I was not in prison before I went into his service I was never in prison except after this inquiry began I did not know Villemont before Q How many men were there on board Le Jeune Adolphe - A Ten sailors There were eight white men in all three were common sailors The first time I was interrogated I said Carrol had been to Tamatave to traffic in blacks Q Why did they put you in prison there - A Because the Judge knew I was Carrol s servant Q Had not Carrol been ill at Madagascar - A Yes A sea voyage was advised for the recovery of his health We were about half an hour landing the negroes The pinnaces took the whole two hundred at one trip As soon as the pinnaces came near the ship they began to count the blacks I put Carrol s trunk in the pinnace Q Had not your own father put you in prison - A No The Judge sent two officers with me They seized Villemont s pinnace I shewed them his house Villemont was at Port Louis I saw him there Q Had you ever seen Villemont except on that night and when you saw him at Port Louis - A No MR SOLICITOR GENERAL Q You saw Villemont on board the vessel - A Yes and afterwards saw him in the cabin I also saw him at his own house I am sure he is the person COURT Q In what way were the fifty slaves brought to Tamatave - A Carrol and a free man brought them they were chained The hundred and fifty were also brought chained and kept chained till they were put on board they were free on board The hold was secured at night by an iron bar the men were armed The men were in the hold and the women in the cabin they were allowed to come on deck in the daytime twelve at a time There were more children than grown persons they landed in good health We had been a month at sea The prisoner CARROL put in a very long written defence giving an account of different voyages in which he had been engaged and stating that Clandomir had been convicted of robbing the trunk of a passenger in a vessel in 1818 and in order to avoid punishment he told the captain M Villemont s clerk Mr Pilot had called him a rascal and a rogue and on the captain saying that he should take him into the presence of Mr Pilot that Clandomir came and told Mr Pilot that the captain was coming to quarrel with them he then ran away he was afterwards arrested and begged forgiveness that he afterwards took Clandomir into his service at the request of his father The only part relating to this charge is as follows - At the end of March I re-embarked on board Le Jenne Adolphe from Bourbon for Tamatave I fell ill of the Madagascar fever after my arrival and embarked again on board the same vessel bound for Bourbon and laden with bullocks We had dreadful weather which caused the loss of our cargo and were driven in sight of the Mauritius I was sent to Port Louis for advice being exceedingly ill The day after my arrival I was taken before the Commissary General and was sent to the hospital Clandomir had the impudence during our passage to England to come to me in the night ask a thousand pardons and to make excuses for the false depositions he had made assuring me he would make one quite contrary in London It is impossible to land two hundred blacks without being seen by the police who are exceedingly vigilant Search was made but none were found because none existed VILLEMONT S Defence written At the time stated I was at a considerable distance from my residence On the 2d of July I dined supped and slept at the house of Mons Le Grand - I left his house next morning and proceeded towards home having promised them my pinnace to go to Round Island my pinnace was not in a fit state and I borrowed one from them On the morning of the 7th I went to Port Louis and next day received a letter from my wife informing me that eight persons guided by a Mulatto had been at my house and had seized my pinnace and that which I had borrowed I returned and went to the police to be informed of the reason I was then arrested I appeal to any one whether it was likely that two hundred negroes could have been landed without any trace being left in an island so strictly guarded as the Mauritius I solemnly protest my innocence I could have escaped when I heard the charge but I preferred surrendering myself into the hands of justice CARROL -

he is three months old and his name is Thomas I saw the prisoner about half-past five o clock she said Little girl I will give you a penny if you will show me where Saffron-hill is when we got there she said I will give you fivepence more which will make sixpence if you will go to Smithfield for me and fetch a gentleman named Jackson from No 17 or 18 to come to me directly - she said she would mind the child till I came back I gave her the child and went to Smithfield - I could not find Mr Jackson but I saw a lad at No 16 who said his father Mr Jackson lived at No 19 and he would tell him to come the next morning at ten o clock - I went back on hearing that the prisoner had told me that her name was Johnson and that was the name I mentioned to the boy when I got back I could not find the prisoner and I did not see her again till she was at Hatton-garden three days after - she had told me when I left her that she would sit down at the step of a door in Peter-street till I returned - I came back in about half an hour I should not have been so long if I could have found the gentleman I went for - she gave no reason why she did not go herself to Smithfield I went all about the street and could not find her - I then went home this is the child- when she took it of me it had on a white frock a linen shirt a new flannel petticoat a white petticoat a calico binder and a cross-bar muslin cap - when I found it again it was dressed much worse Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q The prisoner was quite a stranger A Yes I was some distance from home when I saw her but I told her I lived on Back-hill - I went with her to Saffron-hill and carried the child myself she did not say she was ill she did not look ill then - I might have got back in a quarter of an hour if I had found the gentleman and made haste she might have said Go in the name of Johnson and tell Mr Jackson to come here she did not tell the particular number she said No 17 or 18 - there are a great many people about the place where I left the prisoner and a great many turnings a person might be lost sight of in a moment - she had sent me to get change for a shilling before I went to Smithfield she held the child at that time and when I came back she was still there with it -

it was then dressed quite differently to what it was when I sent it out the child was ill when it returned and has been so ever since - I do not think it had been ill-used HENRY FALL In consequence of information on the 19th of August I got my child from the nurse at Shoreditch workhouse Cross-examined Q Did you get information from the prisoner s husband A Yes I had bills stuck up about the street -

I could not see the size of the child when it was first brought in but I desired it to be wrapped up and put on the hearth while we attended to her and got her to bed - I did not take notice of the child that night I was so flurried we went to dress it the next night between seven and eight o clock and then I saw what it was - I certainly did not see enough of the child the first night to be able to state that it was the same I saw the next night I cannot state whether the prisoner appeared to be pregnant after this as she left my house so soon afterwards - I had signed for a box of linen for her CHARLOTTE CONSTABLE I am a midwife and live in James-street Manchester-square I was called to visit the prisoner on the 17th of August - I asked how she came to go so far from home being so near her confinement she did not make any answer but said she had been delivered in St Giles by a medical man I did not undress the child at that time but I did in the evening - I saw it was a child of some months old and demanded the letter of her that she had taken from the Queen s-hospital for me to attend her - she said she had been taken ill in St Giles and was senseless for three hours on the ground then she took a coach and came home and that some one must have changed the child Cross-examined Q How long had she had this letter for you to attend her A I should think two months - she had prepared to be confined it is the custom at the Queen s-hospital if any medical man attends one of their patients that they pay him and I asked who had attended her WILLIAM ATFIELD The prisoner came to Worship-street office on the 18th of August - she brought this child in her arms her husband was with her she said she was walking down Old-street-road that afternoon and at the end of Pitfield-street she met a woman with this child who asked her to be so kind as to hold it while she went on an errand to a shop up Pitfield-street that she had taken the child and waited three hours but the woman never came back - the overseer of Shoreditch happened to be there and he sent the child to the workhouse CHARLES WICKS I am a porter and live on Back-hill On Tuesday the 16th of August I came up Saffronhill and saw the prisoner there -

the prisoner said No you know me you need not be afraid of me I live in Peter-street my name is Johnson she took the child out of the girl s arms Prisoner s Defence The reason I changed the child s clothes was that they were so dirty and I could not take it out as it was -

to come into Crown-street about nine o clock at night—the prisoner was crossing to meet me—we met face to face—she stood and looked at me—I stood I could not speak I was so flurried—she looked at me again and then she ran—I chased her through several streets—she was exhausted with running and I caught hold of her by her shoulder—she said What do you want with me —I said You are the woman that robbed me of my baby —she straggled to get from me and said You wretch you are wrong I have got no baby —there was a little boy standing by about twelve years of age—I said My good boy will you look for a policeman —there were three women standing there—I said Women women for God s sake help me to hold this woman she is the woman that robbed me of my baby a few weeks ago —they never offered to assist me and the prisoner struggled and got from me—she ran up a court and I saw no more of her that night—I went to the station and gave information that I had seen her—on the 21st of March I went again to the station—an officer went with me up and down the streets and at last we went to a house in Crown-street which I think is No 28—I went up two pair of stairs knocked at the room door and asked for the name they had told me to ask for—the prisoner opened the door—she said There is no such person lives here get out and shut the door in my face—I called up the constable—he went into the room and I went behind him—the prisoner said to me You wretch what do you want —I said My baby you are the woman that stole it —she said I have got no baby but my own —the constable asked her if she had got a baby—she said Yes on the bed —he said I must look at it —he looked at it and said to me Mrs Swan come and look if this is your baby —I looked and knew my baby directly—I said My God that is my baby O you hussey for robbing me of my baby —it was this baby which I have now in my arms—the prisoner offered to strike me but the officer stood before me—she insisted on my leaving the room—I did so leaving the constable in the room and the baby—I saw the prisoner was such a desperate woman that I thought she would either kill me or my baby if I offered to touch it—the constable called to me and said Mrs Swan you must go down to the station and fetch another constable which I did—they then told me to go to the station and they would bring the woman—when I got there the prisoner came and brought my baby with her—the inspector asked her where she had lain in—she told the day of the month that she left her home and that she had lain in at Mrs Sullivan s—they made every inquiry and found it was wrong—this was on Good Friday and on next day my child was given up to me—I only know the child by its features—on the day I found the prisoner out I found the bed-gown the little shirt and two rollers which my child had on when the prisoner took it from me—I can swear to the clothes—these are them—they have been washed since I lost them—this is the gown the prisoner had on at the time she stole the child—this gown was hanging behind the door in her room when she was taken—it was about half-past nine at night on the 15th Feb when I lost my child Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What did you go to the Spotted Dog for A To have half a pint of ale—I had been out with my brushes and was tired—I could not leave my child at home—I had never seen the prisoner before—there is nobody here from the Spotted Dog—when she asked me to go to London-street with the message it did not strike me that she might as well have gone herself because she told me such a pitiful tale of the woman being such a cross woman and that she had had tea with her sister in the course of the week and she had had words with her—the child went to the prisoner directly she held out her hands for it—we found the prisoner in a second pair front room—it was rather a poor place but she was very comfortable and what she had was very tidy and clean—she said it was her child and nobody should take it from her and she would rather part with her life than her child—we were obliged to get the child handed to the clerk of the Court and I got it by that stratagem—she persisted to the last that it was her child—when we got the clothes the prisoner was not there—we went back to the room and got them—I know this bed-gown because my nurse lent it to me and the bottom of it is lined which is very seldom the case in a bed-gown and I know it by the drawing—I do not mean to say there may not be one like it—I never saw one—I only know the child by its features—I do not know it by any particular mark JANE DEANE I am wife of John Deane in Great Arthur-street St Luke s—he is a shoemaker I know this is Mrs Swan s child—I nursed her with it—I know this bed-gown it is my property—each side of the tape of it will draw up like a reticule—I lent it to Mrs Swan—I bought it ready made except the tape drawing which I put in myself—I am confident it is the gown I lent her—this flannel roller I know is here—I have the fellow roller to it myself—this is it—I had more flannel than I wanted and I let her have one—this is the one I let her have—I know the child by its features but by no mark Cross-examined Q This flannel is of the same quality A Yes—it came all off one piece—I cut it off and gave it to Mrs Swan—I know it by the quality—I nursed Mrs Swan s child and dressed it and I know the roller—I saw Mrs Swan make it CAROLINE SWAN re-examined I made this roller myself—it is my work and this cotton roller also is my work and these joins in it WILLIAM WESTLAKE police-constable E 102 I accompanied Mrs Swan to No 28 Crown-street St Giles s—she pointed out the prisoner to me and charged her with having taken her child—I told her she must go with me—she said she would not go the child was her own and she would rather die than lose her child she would not give it up for any one—after waiting half an hour I sent Mrs Swan for another constable and we got the prisoner to the station—we then went back and found this bed-gown shirt flannel roller and cotton roller JOSEPH HUGHES police-constable E 114 I produce this gown and boa which are said to be part of the dress the prisoner had on—I took them to the station—the prisoner said she had been confined at Mrs Sullivan s No 1 Little Clarendon-street Somer stown—I went and bund Mrs Sullivan lived at No 5 Upper Orenville-street—the door is at the corner of Clarendon-street—she was taken before the Magistrate and gave evidence but was not bound over MR PAYNE called MARGARET BIRDSEYI I am the wife of John Birdseye—I am the cousin of the prisoner s first husband I remember seeing the prisoner on the 8th of Feb —she appeared in the family way and told me she did not know one minute from another—I attended the christening of a child a fortnight before Easter Sunday at St Patrick s chapel Soho-square in the Catholic religion—I was godmother and my husband was godfather—I saw the prisoner again about a fortnight after I had seen her in the family way—it was about the Friday before the child was christened—she was then sitting on a stool before the fire and had a child with her—I cannot tell how old the child was which was christened on that Sunday—the prisoner has no husband—he has been dead three years GUILTY on the 1st Count — Transported for Seven Years

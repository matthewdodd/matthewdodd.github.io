t18350202-617  617 JOSEPH ADY was indicted for a misdemeanor MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution REV FRANCIS TEBBUTT I am a clergyman of the Church of England and live at Welton in Northampton I formerly lived at Lower Clapton—I have a brother who lives in Austin-friars—I came to town in the month of July last year and went to my brother s house in Austin-friars—my brother gave me this letter on my arrival—on receiving it I called on Mr Hammond—he accompanied me to the Circus in the Minories—I rang at the bell and a female servant opened the door—I inquired if James Laurie lived there—the defendant opened a door on the right hand of the hall and made his appearance—I believe that was before the servant answered my question—I said I have received a letter from James Laurie dated No 11 Circus Minories does that person reside here —he said Walk in I can manage that business —we went into the room on the right hand side out of which he came—Mr Hammond accompanied me—I gave the letter to Mr Hammond in the room—I think Mr Hammond put the letter into Ady s hand—his attention was directed to it—I asked him if James Laurie lived there—he said yes he did—I said Is he at home —he said No he is not at home but I can answer that letter —I then said Laurie is a singular name—I knew formerly a Mr Laurie when I was at the Cambridge University is your partner related to any of that family —he had said Laurie was his partner—I think that was when we first went into the house—we had the letter exposed when he said he could answer that letter—I said I knew Mr Laurie of Cambridge who was a nephew of the late Lord Mayor and said Is your partner at all related to that family —he said He is his own brother—we have been in partnership some time did you not know that Q Did you ask who he meant by his own brother A Sir Peter Laurie—I said No I do not reside in London I reside in Northamptonshire —he said Oh that is the reason every body in London knows it we have been in partnership for some time or for six months —I cannot exactly say which he said—I asked him when James Laurie would be in—he said he could not tell he was gone out but he could answer the letter and he then went behind the counter to his books—I said Is it in your power or James Laurie s power to tell me of 250l mentioned in this letter which I can receive on payment of a sovereign —he said It is —Mr Hammond then began a conversation with him and asked him whether he was sure the James Laurie mentioned in that letter was the own brother of Sir Peter Laurie the late Lord Mayor—he said Yes he is have not you teen any of our circulars or papers —I forget which—he then went to the corner of the room took some papers and gave one to Mr Hammond and one to myself—Mr Hammond again asked whether he was sure he could be informed of 250l which Mr Tebbutt could receive if the sovereign was paid and whether if the money was not forthcoming he would return the sovereign—whether he would give an acknowledgment to that effect—he said he would and gave an acknowledgment—this is the receipt he gave me—I had previously given Mr Hammond a sovereign—Mr Hammond handed it over the counter to Ady—Mr Hammond had before that asked him particularly whether in the absence of James Laurie his partner he was authorized to receive money on his own account —he said I am Q What induced you to permit Mr Hammond in your presence to pay that sovereign to the defendant A The belief that I should receive the information contained in the letter and that James Laurie was the person he represented—I do not think I should have given the sovereign if he had not represented James Laurie to be his partner and the brother of Sir Peter Laurie—upon payment of the sovereign this paper was given me as the information—I read it and when I saw the name of my brother who was dead and Mr Lloyd I knew it immediately referred to 100l stock my father had presented to one of Mr Lloyd s children—it never stood in my name but in my brother s name Thomas Tebbutt and John Lloyd—it related to 100l stock which my father gave Lloyd s child which was to remain in the funds until he attained his majority—I said to him This money has been had out of the funds to the best of my belief many years ago and I have no interest in it whatever therefore I will thank you to return my money —he said Are you not a better lawyer than that —I remonstrated with him for detaining my money but could not get it back—I told him repeatedly it did not at all concern me—he said he had only my word for that The documents produced were here read as follows — To S Tebbutt Esq April 28 1834—The undersigned is able to inform you of something to your advantage value 250l on payment to 20s by post or otherwise

country—Judge Vaughan MR TEBBUTT I was never a creditor of De Witt an insolvent Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q How long had you received the letter before you went to the defendant A Some few weeks—I had been in London perhaps a week at that time—I was engaged very particularly—I was never in town exceeding a week and I believe that was only once—I might have been in town twice for a week—Mr Hammond was unknown to me until a day or two before he went with me—I went to Mr Hammond s to call for my rent—I did not produce this letter to him on the first occasion—perhaps it might be the second time—I saw him twice in the course of the week—I produced it to him the same day as I went to the Minories—I asked his opinion—he said he would recommend me to go—that Laurie was a very respectable name and he had no doubt there was something in it—he did not tell me that he knew any of the family of the Lauries—I gave him a sovereign to give to the man as we walked along the street—I told him I did not like to take the leading part in it—it was not in my way at all—I did not understand the nature of it—I did not like to take the leading part in going for such a purpose—going to pay a sovereign to receive information—that was all that passed in my mind at that time Q On your oath was it not for the purpose of paying a sovereign in the presence of a witness that you might give evidence of it hereafter that you took Mr Hammond with you A It was not—I had no such thought or intention—I went and paid it under the idea I should receive information and benefit—I did not abuse Mr Ady at all—I believe Mr Hammond did—I do not know whether Ady was obliged to send for a policeman—I do not know whether he sent or the people on his premises—I did not see him send nor hear him—he did send I believe—he talked of it—Ady took Mr Hammond by the collar—Mr Hammond said he never allowed any man to take him by the collar and if he did not loose him he would strike him or something Q Did he say he would hit his nose flat A I cannot say the words he used—I do not remember the word nose —I never heard before I went to get the information referred to in the letter that there had been money standing in the names of Lloyd and Tebbutt and others which had afterwards been claimed and sold—I knew there was a property in the name of Charles Lloyd in the hands of trustees—Thomas Tebbutt was one of the trustees—he is dead Q Did not you know that it had been in the published list of unclaimed dividends for some years A I believe not for I believe the youth wanted the money and when he became of age it was sold out but I am on very slight terms with my family and know very little about it—I am brother to the attorney in Austin-friars—I did not confer with him about the letter—he gave it to me at the inn—I believe I did not see my brother during the whole week I was in town—I am not on terms with him Q Did you ever see such a book as this of unclaimed dividends and property in trust in the funds A No these are the names of the trusees of the property— looking at the book —the information was not that there had been money of that kind but that there was—I should think the money was paid to my nephew about five or six years ago but I have not seen him for the last ten years—I do not think I have seen him six times since he was born—I immediately demanded my money back from Ady according to the terms the receipt was written—I went to the Lord Mayor the day after—I did not go to Gray s-inn-lane or any where to make inquiry—I made no inquiry of Hay ward of Gray s-inn-lane Q Now I ask you very seriously on your oath did not Mr Hammond and you together or Mr Hammond with your knowledge go there for the purpose of making evidence of this case A I did aot—Mr Hammond did not tell me that No 11 Circus was Ady s house or that we were going to see Ady—he said Ady lives in the Minories —that was all he said—it was on the road—I believe he mentioned Ady s name after I gave him the sovereign—I gave him the money in the street—I believe on the road Mr Hammond said he had paid 1l to Ady add he mentioned either at the house or just before we went there that the information he got was not correct and he got his money back—I did not know I was going there to see Ady—I had no idea of it—I do not remember whether Mr Hammond told me it was Ady when Ady presented himself—I cannot swear he did not—after we were in the house Mr Hammond and Ady had some conversation and then I heard Ady s name—that was before the money was paid MR CLARKSON Q You were asked whether the money had been paid out of the bank some time before the transaction are you sure your nephew was of age before the 28th April 1834 A Certainly—I had nothing to do with the money when it was in the Bank—I did not know of such a person as De Witt—when I went to No 11 Circus I expected to see the person who had signed the letter—I know nothing of Ady - - HAMMOND ESQ I am a ship-owner and carry on business in Mincing-lane and Commercial Sale-rooms I am a magistrate of Kent and have been foreman of the Grand Jury this Session—I think the 10th of July was the first or second time I had seen Mr Tebbutt—he called on me on the 10th of July and showed me this letter—I accompanied him to No 11 Circus Minories—when we got there we knocked at the door and asked if a person named James Laurie lived there—during the time we were asking the servant the prisoner came up and said he dare say he could do that which we came about—we showed him this letter and asked him if a person of the name of James Laurie lived there—he desired us to walk in—we walked in and said we came in consequence of an application made to Mr Tebbutt respecting some money which that letter alluded to—I then asked him who James Laurie was—he said James Laurie is my partner and he is the brother of Sir Peter Laurie the late Lord Mayor of London —I said Are you authorized to receive the money by James Laurie —he said Yes —upon that Mr Tebbutt desired me to pay him the sovereign—with that the money was paid him and he accordingly set about giving us the information which the letter alluded to—something passed about Mr Tebbutt living in the country—I believe that arose in consequence of the letter being directed to a wrong place—Mr Tebbutt said he thought it was all right that he knew Sir Peter Laurie s family to be highly respectable he having been at college with his nephew—we asked the prisoner in case the information did not relate to Mr Tebbutt or that he could not get any thing by it would he return the money—he said he would—he gave the information and I think a receipt was given for it—it was asked for I do not know whether by Mr Tebbutt or myself and he gave it—I am telling the substance of what passed as far as I can recollect—he gave a piece of paper with what he said was the information—this is the paper and the receipt—they were handed to Mr Tebbutt—he said it did not relate to him and asked him for the money back—Ady said he would not give it back—I do not recollect any thing passing about a lawyer—he did not return the money—he was asked for it a great many times—we stopped in the house a great while and tried to get it and at last went away and made application to the Lord Mayor—the prisoner sent his servant for a policeman because we would not go out of the house with—out the money—I think Ady attempted to lay hold of me by the collar to force me out of the house—I had not used any violence to him—I did not approve of being taken by the collar and I think I said if he did take hold of my collar I should knock him down or any man who attempted it—he shut me outside the door and locked himself in—that was before the policeman came I believe—I and Mr Tebbutt went away together and never got the sovereign back Cross-examined by MR JONES Q Do I understand you that the 10th of July was the first time you had seen Mr Tebbutt A The first or second I cannot say which—he called on me because I had purchased some property of which he was the ground landlord and I wished to buy the freehold—I do not know what interval elapsed between his first and second call—I am not certain I saw him twice—the very first time he mentioned the subject to me I went with him—I do not think he told me that the letter came from the Minories—he gave me the letter—I knew I was going to the Circus before I went—I cannot say whether I mentioned the name of Ady to him as living in the Minories—I knew the name of Ady before—I had applied to him before and had paid money for some information—I think I received a paper from him—I called on him again and said the information was not what I expected—he gave me back the sovereign—I am sure I do not know whether I told Mr Tebbutt that Ady lived in the Minories—I might or I might not I cannot charge my recollection with it—I recognised Ady when 1 went into the room—I do not think I called him by his name in the conversation at all but I am sure I do not know—I recollect Mr Tebbutt giving me the sovereign to give to him as we were going along—I cannot tell why he did not keep it himself—I do not know that any thing particular passed when he gave it me—I think he said If we are satisfied the information is correct and the name the letter bears is the person who lives there with my consent you will give him the money—I do not think I told Mr Tebbutt that I had given him a sovereign for information and got it back—I do not recollect whether I did or did not but to the best of my recollection I think not—I do not think I mentioned it while we were in the house but I cannot recollect—I may have said so—I do not think I told Mr Tebbutt of that transaction before I got to the house—I might have done so while I was in the house Q You have said you never mentioned Ady s name to him while you were going there did it not occur to you that the letter might have come from Ady A I do not think it did at the time as it was signed Laurie —I do not think I told Mr Tebbutt that I believed the letter came from Ady—I cannot say I did or did not mention Ady s name to Mr Tebbutt before I went to the house—after the sovereign was paid some information was given—I repeated to Ady Sir are you confident that letter is the signature of James Laurie and that James Laurie is your partner —that was both before and after we paid the money—after the information was given to Mr Tebbutt vie asked for the money back—we did not ask for it instantly—it might be a quarter of an hour after—I will not swear about it—I am confident it was more than two minutes—I am confident more than two minutes elapsed between our getting the information and demanding the sovereign back—I cannot swear positively but to the best of my recollection I am confident two minutes had elapsed Q Did not Ady in reply say Go and make the inquiry first and then if you do not find it satisfactory I will give you back the money A No I do not recollect any thing of the sort—I will not swear he did or did not say so—Mr Tebbutt said it did not relate to him at all and as such he said Give me the sovereign back —I told Ady we would not go out of the house without we had the money—I told him I would knock him down if he collared me—perhaps I might have told him I would hit his nose flat but I have great doubt of it—he did not give me an opportunity of shaking my fist in his face for he shut the door in my face—I dare say we were in the house an hour or more—it might be two or three—I cannot tell how long we were in the house before we demanded the sovereign back—I should think it was more than ten minutes—I will not swear it was more—we might have remained two or three hours after he gave the information—we were trying to get the money back MR CLARKSON Q Probably you would have put your threat in execution if he had collared you A No doubt I should—I had paid him for information but got none—I got my money back after a great deal of trouble SIR PETER LAURIE KNT I reside in Park-square I have lately been Lord Mayor—I never had a brother James—I have no brother connected or in partnership with the defendant—I have no brother in London at all Cross-examined by MR JONES Q I believe you have known Mr Ady some years A I have—I had him once or twice before me when I was Lord Mayor—I did not direct measures to be taken against him—the Court of Aldermen did—I publicly advertised people to be cautious of him—I think for about a month once or twice a week it was done perhaps it might be longer—I remember stopping it myself JOHN LLOYD I am a corn-dealer and live in Leather-lane I was one of the trustees of a fund invested in the Bank for my son—Thomas Tebbutt was the other trustee—it was 60l bought into the Bank it purchased 100l stock—it was invested about twenty-four years ago—he became of age four years ago—the stock was sold in October 1831—I am sure there was no money of his in the Bank in 1834—I have the receipt in my pocket for the sale of the stock Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q What did it amount to when it was sold out A 160l odd—the dividend had not been invested regularly or it would have been more—it was invested about twelve months after he was born—if the dividend had been invested regularly it would have been more—I never knew Mr Ady in my life MR CLARKSON Q Do you know a gentleman named James Laurie A No FREDERICK LACY I am secretary to the Welch Charity and live at the school-house in Gray s-inn-road I have lived there constantly since the 24th of June 1831—no person named Hayward has lived there since that time—I know such a person by name Mr Adolphus addressed the Court and the Jury on the defendant s behalf Augustus Cole chinaman 31

t18410920-2322  2322 JOHN COMBER alias Merchant alias Durham was indicted for a misdemeanor MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution ELEANOR PETTIT MADDOX I am the wife of Thomas Slocomb Black-man Maddox and live in Smith-street Marlborough-road Chelsea In June last I had two ponies at my stable for sale—the prisoner came about them three times—I cannot exactly say the first day he came but it was in June—the last time he came was on the 26th of June—he at first said he came recommended by Mr Hetherington who he supplied with hay and straw to look at the pair of ponies—he did not tell me his name the first day—he afterwards told me he was a farmer living at St Albans that his name was Comber and that he formerly lived at Silverton in Northampton-shire he looked at the ponies—they had been looked at by a variety of persons before—he did not buy them the day—I had other parties in treaty for them at that time and told him so—he made no offer for them then nor on the second day—I did not tell him what the persons in treaty had offered—when he came on the 26th he said he had come to see whether I had disposed of the ponies—I told him I had not—he never had the ponies out of the stable he only looked at them in the stall—he said if he could not buy horses from looking at them in the stall he was not worthy of buying horses at all—he offered 60l I think first—I said it was a very low offer—I wanted 70l —they were thirteen hands high very handsome particularly good they were bay without spot or blemish black legs manes and tails—he said other persons might offer more money but they would give me bills—I said bills would not be accepted for I would either take money for my ponies or I would keep them—he then offered 61l —I called my mother to know whether I had better let him have the ponies—she said no I should certainly be doing wrong—I had him into the parlour—he put his hand up to his head and said Well I must have them I will give 62l for them but I cannot give any more —he said he wanted them for a lady who was returning from France and that she was such a kind woman the ponies would have such a good home and they would be kept in a meadow in front of his house till she returned—I was very fond of the ponies having had them three years—they were my husband s property—I agreed that he should have them for 62l and also a large Newfoundland dog into the bargain—he then took out a cheque-book and said he had a very large account in the Southwark branch of the London and Westminster bank—a great many cheques were gone from it and it appeared to have been worn—he said he was a very large dealer in horses that he supplied the Duke of Newcastle Mr Hankey and a variety of other persons he mentioned in Wales and else-where and he always paid in cheques for he never carried money about with him for fear of being robbed of it—I am sorry to say this imposed upon me—he wrote the cheque and gave it to me in my mother s presence—this now produced is it—he said that Mr Hetherington had been kind enough to lend him a man to assist him in leading away the ponies and that he was going with the ponies straight to Mr Hetherington s—after unfastening the horses he cast his eye round the stable and asked whether I would lend him one of Peat s hunting-bridles which was hanging up until the Tuesday following—I lent it him but he never returned it and I never saw him again till he was taken into custody—before the 26th of June I had seen a man named Peter House but I did not know at that time that it was House—I had not the least idea I had such a set about me—a man named Beament also came—I permitted the prisoner to take the ponies on receiving this cheque and on the faith that it would be paid—I should not have parted with them except on the belief that he had authority to draw the cheque and that there would be money to meet it when presented—I considered it exactly as cash—I have since seen one of the ponies in the streets of Oxford with Mr Rack straw an attorney riding her—they could be ridden as well as driven—they were remarkably good-tempered and docile from never having been knocked about or ill-treated and yet they would go at about fourteen miles an hour Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Did not the prisoner state that he came in consequence of an advertisement A No he never mentioned the advertisement—they were advertised—he said he came from Mr Hetherington—there was no one present but myself when he came the first and second times—on the third occasion my mother was present—he never mentioned the advertisement—they were only advertised once and that was in the Times to the best of my recollection—my husband is a surgeon—he was in the country at the time—he was backwards and for wards for some time in search of a practice—I was left with my mother—he had left me authority to sell them—I am quite sure the prisoner mentioned the name of Mr Hetherington—I did not mention it first—I did not refer him to Mr Hetherington for the character of the ponies—he said he had come from Mr Hetherington well assured of the character of the ponies—I certainly did not refer him to Mr Hetherington nor did I mention his name in the first instance—to the best of my recollection he first offered 60l for the ponies—that was not on the first visit—there was no offer made at the first visit—there were other parties after the ponies—he came and looked at them but I told him I could not say any thing to him then because there was another party in treaty for them—and when he came the second time I was waiting for the other party—I had asked a higher price of the other party—I had asked the prisoner 70l —he said it was too much for him to give because he had to make money by them—he said the ponies were worth it—that was on the last occasion—my husband is unwell and is not here—he was once before the Magistrate but was not examined—Mr Hetherington s name was mentioned on the first occasion—I did not see Mr Hetherington between the first and second or second and third interviews with the prisoner—I had mentioned to Mr Hetherington that we had ponies to dispose of and he had said he would recommend us and I believed that the prisoner came recommended by Mr Hetherington—three or four days elapsed between the second and third interview—I cannot say how long elapsed between the first and second—the prisoner has not paid me 5l lately on account of this transaction MR CLARKSON Q What time in the day was it that he handed you this cheque on the 26th of June A I can-not exactly say but I should say between five and six o clock—it was late in the afternoon JOHN HETHERINGTON I am a livery-stable keeper in Connaughtterrace I do not know the prisoner—I never recommended him to go to Mrs Maddox to see and purchase these ponies—I never saw him to my knowledge till he was at Queen-square ALEXANDER DIXON I am employed in the Southwark branch of the London and Westminster Bank 3 Wellington-street Borough—the prisoner opened an account there on the 18th of March this year and paid in 20l —it staid there about a month—he afterwards paid in another 20l which did not stay so long—he never paid in any thing more—on the 26th of June last he had no money in our bank at all—we had reason to look for him but could not find him—this cheque was presented for payment at our bank and refused because we had no assets—the account was closed on the 18th of May Cross-examined Q How long has the prisoner banked with you A On the 18th of March the account was opened—no cheque was presented on the prisoner s behalf which I refused to pay at first and afterwards paid— looking at the margins of two cheques —one of these purports to be for 30l and is dated the 22nd of March—that is not correct—he never had 30l at one time in our hands—this other is dated the 27th of March—I cannot say but this might have been presented but it was never paid being refused—I post the cheques and they are referred to me—I can undertake to swear neither of these cheques were first refused and afterwards paid COURT Q Had he in fact drawn out every shilling he had put in Yes there were a number of his cheques presented in consequence of which the cashiers had orders not to receive any more money—that was in less than three weeks after the account had been opened—we sent to the address he had given but could not find him—no person of that name ever lived there—he had been introduced to us by a person who formerly kept an account with us—he left a balance of 4l in the bank which a person took who brought a cheque for 16l —there was not another shilling of his in the bank THOMAS HENRY THOMPSON police-sergeant D 4 I apprehended the prisoner on the morning of the 9th of July at a house at Harrow-on-the-Hill—I told him what I took him for—he said Then it is all over with me —he asked me to allow him to kiss his wife and child who were lying in the bed—on our way to town he told me that the ponies were not more than forty miles off he could get them—he would not tell me where they were but said he could show me—he asked me if I could make it right—I told him I did not know I believed all the people wanted was their ponies—he said they were sold—in consequence of information I afterwards went to Oxford—I had not been ten minutes there before I met with a man and got some information in consequence of which I went to the premises of a livery-stable keeper in St Giles s-street Oxford—I there saw a pony which the prosecutor claimed—it turned out to have been in the possession of Mr Rackstraw Cross-examined Q Did you give the same account of this transaction before the Magistrate A I believe I did and believe I gave more than I have been asked here—I mentioned at the office that the prisoner said it was all over with him—I believe it was taken down—it ought to have been if it was not—I signed it—I did not see what was written—what I said was taken down and read over to me—this is my handwriting— the witness s deposition being read did not mention the expression It is all over with me The cheque was here read GUILTY Aged 45 — Transported for Seven Years

City-road —he left and said he would call again for them in ten minutes as I had to measure them which he did—I had then measured them—he asked if they were ready—I said Yes —it was necessary for him to go below where Dix our entering clerk sits to have them entered—he went below with me at my request to Dix who I heard ask him who they were for—he said Enoch Jones City-road —I left him with Dix Cross-examined Q Is not John and Frederick Cowper and Co written over your door A I am not certain—I have been two years there—I have seen another Mr Nash—I believe he is the company—he buys Scotch goods—I did not make a memorandum of what the prisoner said—I recollect perfectly well that he said the silk was for Enoch Jones—I saw him shake hands with Wish at the counter—Wish asked him who he lived with now—he said With Enoch Jones —that was the first time he mentioned Enoch Jones—it was not that he had been in Jones s service but that he was so I swear that MR CLARKSON Q Do you know any thing of Nash being a partner A No—I only know of John and Frederick Cowper as partners—I am sure Wish asked where he lived and he said with Enoch Jones City-road HENRY DIX I am entering-clerk at Messrs Cowpers —the firm is John and Frederick Cowper and Co but the partners are John and Frederick On the morning of the 21st of June the two pieces of gros-de-Naples were brought to me—I entered them—the lengths were one hundred and one yards each and the amount 25l 13s 4d —the prisoner came down with Norris—I did not ask who they were for but Norris had sent down a paper with them stating that they were for Enoch Jones—I said to the clerk next to me Take down to Enoch Jones JAMES NORRIS re-examined I sent down with the goods a slip of paper with Enoch Jones City-road on it—that paper is destroyed HENRY DIX re-examined I tied up the goods and delivered them to the prisoner who went away with them—I was not acquainted with him and as he was going up stairs I called him hack and said I had not the name of the person taking the goods—he said George Jenkins Cross-examined Q What is written over the door A John and Frederick Cowper and Co —I do not know whether Nash is a partner but believe not—Henry Todd used to be a partner but he has left—I saw the dissolution stated in the newspaper nine or twelve months ago—Nash is employed as Scotch buyer—I never neared of his being a partner—I saw the prisoner leave and am certain he took the goods—I know nothing of a letter being received from the prisoner from Dublin—I never heard of it MR CLARKSON Q The dissolution was before the 21st of June A Yes—the words and Co have not been painted out—it is a very usual thing to trade under the name of a firm when there is no partner WILLIAM WISH I was in the prosecutors service at the time in question—I had been in the employ of Enoch Jones with the prisoner eighteen months ago I was in the warehouse on the 21st of June when the prisoner came—I was passing through the silk-room and shook hands with him—I asked him where he was living—he said he was with Mr Enoch Jones again in the City-road—this was in Norris s hearing—I saw him select the goods Cross-examined Q How long have you known him A About two years—I knew he had left Jones and I had not seen him since—my question was not why he did not go back to Jones nor did he say he could go back if he thought fit nor any thing of the sort WILLIAM SLOPER I am clerk to Mr Herbert Lloyd of Cheapside solicitor—Messrs Cowper are clients of his and have been so some time The firm is John and Frederick Cowper—there is no other partner I know as I have had a great many legal matters to transact for them Cross-examined Q How long have you known the firm A Six or seven years—Mr Todd who had been a partner for four or five years up to thirteen or fourteen months ago went into business by himself—since that there has been no other partner—I have repeatedly prepared affidavits in bankruptcy cases that they are the only persons trading under that firm GUILTY * Aged 27 — Transported for Seven Years The prisoner had already undergone the sentence of transportation for a former conviction

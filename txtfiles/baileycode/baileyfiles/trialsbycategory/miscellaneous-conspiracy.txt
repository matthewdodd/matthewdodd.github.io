t18330214-227  656 CHARLES CASEY and WILLIAM HENRY TAYLOR were indicted for a conspiracy JOHN PHILLIPS I keep a coffee and chop-house No 32 Lime-street On the 6th of February about four o clock in the afternoon Casey came to me I had seen him before - he offered me a sample of brandy and hollands I approved of it and was to give him 15s a gallon - I ordered two gallons of each and two two-gallon casks came to me in consequence of the order about seven o clock the same evening Casey and some stranger brought them - it was not Taylor they took the casks into the coffee-room Casey had one cask tied in a handkerchief and the other had the other cask in a bag they were placed in the coffee-room - I was to pay for them then they came to 3l - when they brought them I desired my waiter to laste it and he said the spirit was very good but it was very thick and muddy and I declined having any thing to do with it but the other man said he had had it a long time and I should have it for 2l which I paid for it at that time I believed the casks were full of liquor - I went down stairs to pay them Casey said You will pay my friend it will be all the same I paid his friend they directly went away and in about three minutes I examined the casks I drew the hung and put a gallon can under them about half a pint run out of each cask into the can - I immediately got a ginblet and bored a hole in the head of each cask and dirty water came from it there was rather more than four gallons of water and spirits together - I afterwards examined the casks and found a bottle was fixed to the nose of the cask and was fixed to the bung so that the spirits would come out at the bung but not the water I immediately gave information to the Police - I understood Casey was living at No 14 White Lion-street Norton-falgate I sawCasey on the 14th by Moorfields chapel standing by a public-house and I gave him in charge of my waiter while I went for an officer and when I returned I found he had got away he was secured the same day I saw Taylor when we took Casey but he made his escape Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You were well acquainted with Casey A No I had seen him about six times he was introduced to me I did not know him as a commission-agent - he did not say it was not his liquor we were half an hour bargaining for it Taylor Q Did not you call at my house on the evening you bought the liquor A Yes and saw your wife - I called in White Lion-street I understood both the prisoners lived there his wife told me some blackguard had been there WILLIAM MERRITT I am in the employ of Mr Phillips I did not see Casey when the samples were brought I tasted them they appeared very good - I only tasted the brandy sample in about an hour or an hour and a half I saw Casey at master s with a lusty man - it was not Taylor they brought two kegs each holding two gallons - I heard it was to be 15s a gallon but the Hollands was thick Casey and the other man said they should be there in three weeks when they would call for the kegs and Phillips might pay them what he liked then - he gave them 2l immediately after they left I went to measure it - I put a gallon can under each keg the bunghole only ran half a pint from each - I shook the casks and each felt quite full we bored a hole and to our great surprise a great deal of dirty water came out of each cask - all the rest was dirty water we opened the casks found a pint-bottle was fixed to the bunghole and glued round - the water could not affect the spirits on the 14th I saw Casey at the bottom of Broker s-row standing facing the Brown Bear - master asked if I knew him I said Yes that is the man who sold the spirits - I went up and collared him while master went for an officer Casey said Don t let me stand in the street walk into the public-house which I did Taylor was there and said What do you do holding that man does he owe you any thing I said No but he has committed a great fraud on my master - What said Taylor I suppose you are vexed because you have been tricked but we shall trick you again if you don t mind he pulled out two pint-bottles one out of each pocket - he drew the cork of one and asked the landlord for a glass he poured out what appeared to be brandy - the landlord said it was very good he put the bottle into his pocket then laid hold of Casey and said Come along with me and I dare that fellow to follow you - I said If I can t hold you I shall follow you I followed him with the intention of giving him in charge to the first officer I met - Taylor told me about the middle of Broad-street-buildings that if I laid my hand on him he would knock me down I saw master and an officer coming and then collared Casey and Taylor ran away Cross-examined Q Who was the money paid to A Casey the Bear is about half a mile from Lime-street JOHN ISAACS I am a wine porter in the service of Mr Charles James of Fenchurch-street On the evening of the 7th I was at the Lamb Coffee-house kept by Phillips the prisoner Taylor was there - I am quite certain of him- Phillips was not in the way Taylor asked Mrs Phillips if Mr Phillips was at home - she said No he said he would wait until he came in he sat down had some ale and a pipe and told me he had put them up to the scheme of selling the brandy to Phillips I had called at his house with Phillips the night before at No 14 White Lion-street he asked me what business I had to come there and make a noise I told him we made no noise that Phillips sent there to inquire after Casey - he said he had put them up to it that he should not have known that he sold it to Phillips if they had not gone there the night they sold it and insulted his wife he said he went to the public-house that the party who was not in custody used and had put up three half-pints of gin to his score he said that the casks cost 6s - he left before Phillips came home Taylor Q Was not I smoking a pipe with the ale before me before you came in A No he had been drinking and was not quite sober or he might not have said this he knew what he said I should think Cross-examined Q I believe you introduced Casey to the prosecutor A No I knew him before - I never knew him sell on commission PETER KELLY I am an officer I apprehended Casey on the 14th in Liverpool-street - Phillips charged him with felony I detained him - he said he hoped he should not be charged with felony and walked quietly away with me - I took Taylor in Guildhall-yard he had been to visit Casey in the Compter and walked with him from there to Guildhall - he said he was Casey s master I said I hope you will come and get your servant out of trouble he said he would but when he got to the corner he started off - I told Phillips and in about two hours I saw him behind a chariot and secured him Taylor When he came to the Compter he found me there I said Casey was selling goods for me and if he was in trouble I would walk with him to Guildhall - I went and waited outside - he said Walk in with me and the Magistrate asked if I had been seen in the transaction till he had apprehended Casey - he said not the Magistrate said he should bind me over as a witness and afterwards that he would hold us to bail I knew nothing of it till after it occurred - I went home about eleven o clock my wife said a person had been there about some brandy - on the following day I found Phillips lived in Lime-street and went there to have an explanation I waited two hours for him and as it was getting late I returned - on the 14th when Casey was given in charge I said Does he owe you any thing for if he does I will pay you he said No he had defrauded his master I said Have you any authority to take him he said No I said Well we may as well walk on towards home then and in the street the officer came and took him into custody - instead of my running away as they say I went to the Bear and waited two hours thinking it might be settled CASEY - GUILTY Aged 27 TAYLOR - GUILTY Aged 38 Transported for Seven Years 
t18441125-95  95 HENRY MILLER SARAH DAWERS CHARLOTTE EDGE and SAMUEL EDGE were indicted for a conspiracy RICHARD GIBLETT I live at St Peter s-terrace Hammersmith—I am landlord of the house No 1 Peter s Cottages—I let that house to the prisoner Miller some time in Aug —he took possession of it about the 10th of Sept —he remained there till the night of the 26th of Sept On going out in the morning on the 27th I found people standing about the house and they told me the tenants had gone away in the night—I rang the bell and there was no one there—the police afterwards opened the house—I went in and found nothing but three empty casks—Miller had taken the house for three years—he had not paid any rent—when he took the house he gave me a reference to Mr Dell No 31 Windsorterrace City-road—I went there and to the best of my belief the prisoner Charlotte Edge opened the door—I do not swear to her—I asked for Mr Dell—she inquired my name—I said I was a stranger to Mr Dell but I came about a reference and I wished to see Mr Dell—she asked me in—I waited some little time and the prisoner Samuel Edge came into the room—I had asked for Mr Dell and Samuel Edge appeared—I addressed him and said I came to inquire about a Mr Miller who had taken a cottage of mine at Hammersmith and I wished to know if I should be paid my rent—he said Mr Miller was a very respectable man he had rented under hit father for some years and that his father and him were on very intimate terms—I then stated that mine was a small place and the rent was not very large it was 25l —I described the place and he said he should think it was a house exactly to suit the family—with that reference I was satisfied and I went to a house occupied by Miller where he had given me his card in Ashford-street Hoxton—the prisoner Dawers opened the door—I asked if Mr Miller was in—she said he was not he was gone into the City and he would be at home about four o clock—I said Will you tell him I am the person from Hammersmith and the reference is satisfactory —I did not see Miller for a day or two and I wrote him a note—I afterwards gave him possession of the house—I should not have let him had it if I had not had that account from Samuel Edge—the day before Miller quitted the cottage I saw Samuel Edge in the garden with Miller Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Was there any agreement made between you and Miller at any time that you were to receive any money or money s worth before he had the possession of the house A No—there was nothing due to me when he quitted nor for two days after—he left on the Friday and the quarterday was on the Sunday—I do not know whether I have mentioned before that I saw Samuel Edge in the garden with Miller—I should think I have mentioned it if I have not I did not know it was necessary—it is no interest to me—I should never have prosecuted him—I come here from day to day much against my inclination ROBERT CARR I am an ironmonger and live in King-street Hammersmith On the 24th of Sept about twelve or one o clock Miller came to my shop and asked if I had got any fenders—I told him I had not anything in the furnishing department—he did not say what he was—he said he had recntly given up business and left his old furniture behind and he thought he could buy new for as little as it would cost to remove his old—I said it would be so if he came any distance—he said he had taken No 1 St Peter s Cottages and he should want a few things that his servant would look in in the evening and select a few—he gave me his card which was left at Worship-street—between nine and ten the same evening Charlotte Edge came—she selected a broom and three other articles—she said Mr Miller her master had seen me in the morning and she requested the things to be sent home the first thing in the morning to Mr Miller s No 1 St Peter s Cottages and my boy took them home the next morning Wednesday the 25th of Sept —on the same day an old lady dressed very smartly who I believe was Dawers looked in at dusk just as we were lighting the gas—she said her servant would look in that evening for a few things that Mr Miller would be at home on Friday and the bill was to be made out then—between nine and ten that evening Charlotte Edge came again and looked out several more articles and amongst the rest two bottlejacks which were to be sent for choice—they were not sold and they were particularly requested to be sent home on the following morning—on the next morning Thursday Sept the 26th I and my boy took them between eight and nine o clock to No 1 St Peter s Cottages—my boy delivered them to a man—I saw the person but I did not exactly distinguish who it was—on that same evening Charlotte Edge looked in again between nine and ten o clock—she told me her master quite approved of the candlesticks she had the other night and would I let her have another pair —she selected several other things and desired them to be sent home—she particularly told me to send the bill in on Friday morning and leave a space for the bottlejack which they kept to be put in—I requested her to let me send the things home in the morning as I could not that night—she said No I will take them myself —I consented and she took them home to save me the trouble of sending—on the Friday morning the 27th I was sweeping my shopoutside and Mr Giblett spoke to me and I ran off to the policestation—I then went to the house and the prisoners were all gone WILLIAM HENRY DUBOIS police-sergeant N 14 On the 17th of Oct I went to No 3 Richard-street Islington and apprehended Charlotte Edge—I told her I wanted her for defrauding different tradespeople—she said Do you GEORGE KEMP police-constable N 82 I took Samuel Edge at No 3 Richard-street—I told him I wanted him for different frauds and felonies and asked him if his name was not Edge—he said You seem to know all about it FREDERICK COLE I live in St Peter s-place About six o clock in the morning on the 27th of Sept I saw four or five persons busily engaged gaged in removing goods and to the best of my recollection the two prisoners Edge were there—I rang Mr Giblett s bell and then the horse and van all moved away—the name of Edge was on the van MILLER— GUILTY Aged 57 — Transported for Seven Years SAMUEL EDGE— GUILTY Aged 40 — Confined Eighteen Months DAWERS— NOT GUILTY CHARLOTTE

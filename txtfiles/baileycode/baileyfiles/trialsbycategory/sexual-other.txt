I have lived in the Savoy thirty-four or thirty-five years and have known Dr Wilkinson ever since he has been there Q What is his character Wilson I can t say I know any thing material of his

and upright Mr Delaporte Mr Wilkinson told me that Mr Brooks his former attorney had used him very ill I have received three-score guineas in order to defend him upon which an action was brought against Mr Brooks There was a motion made in the court of commons pleas which application took up two terms there was a rule made and my lord chief justice order d Mr Brooks to return forty guineas and pay the cost upon seeing the extravagancy of the bill Mr Wilkinson always declared himself ready to surrender as soon as ever he got his papers out of Mr Brooks s hands He takes a paper in his hand I received this order the 24th of February and made enquiry about the out-lawry This is the substance of what I took from the sheriff s books for the county of Middlesex I found the out-lawry would not be compleated till September so I advised him not to surrender till then Q Could he have been prepared with his defence before now Delaporte Yes I believe he could last sessions that he did not surrender was by my advice Mr Sergeant Davy having been retained for him and not being able to attend this court was the reason he did not take his trial then Cross examination Q How long have you been concern d for him Delaporte But a little before I gave notice to Mr Sharp which was in August 1755 Q What papers have this day been used that were in the hands of Mr Brooks Delaporte Not one I thought there were some material ones Prisoner A brief could not have been formed had I not been served with every paper which I can now produce My whole brief is an extract from papers When I came from abroad I expected my brief was prepared and was for giving notice of trial I did not see my attorney for six weeks after and he secreted my papers I was told by gentlemen that I should not have a brief prepared in twelve months so I went to this gentleman Synge was minister of the Savoy but Dr Pratt was not Where the new church stands now there it was the inhabitants met Dr Pratt was lecturer and preached always in the afternoon and the lords of the treasury never once appointed him minister I have now eight years in arrear and am 500 l out of pocket The Lutheran minister I speak feelingly shall receive 40 l a year the quakers meeting shall be chearfully repaired but the church of England chapel is scarce fit for a stable I know my lord what is the foundation and the bitterness of this prosecution why - because I know too much of the tricks of some people I know how this arises there are estates appropriated for this use but they are sunk and become the subjects of rapine and plunder I married this way occasionally for 28 years that woman s father was minister and I lived in the house with him As to 1400 couple I don t know how the clerk came to make that blunder I have not married 1400 in thirty years This woman was confounded and she could not distinguish minister from lecturer I acquainted Mr Sharp that if he would pay me the 1300 l due to me I would quit the place This prosecution has been carried on with the utmost unrelenting malice I acquainted the archbishop of Canterbury I was willing to give up all on having my arrears paid Murder has been bail d treason has been bail d but I could not be bail d Council for the crown You never surrender d Prisoner I knew the consequence of that too well Council for the crown They have brought it down only to

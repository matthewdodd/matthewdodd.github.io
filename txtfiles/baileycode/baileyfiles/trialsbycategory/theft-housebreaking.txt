called for a pot of hot and after that for another till we had five which I paid for then they wanted to have another but I had no more silver so pulled out my money and changed a guinea After that we went into another room then they said they were hungry so I sent for some victuals and had it or fled I sat drinking with those two till about 12 o clock at night after supper Q What time did you go into that house Bass About ten in the morning Q Was not you in liquor Bass I was actually very much in liquor At the last pot of hot the prisoner Summers came in and had part of it This was about 12 o clock Q How many pots had you in the whole Bass I am not able to judge but believe about 15 or 16 Q Were they pints or quarts Bass They were quarts After this it was too late for me to go to my

it of her at the door then locked the door and put the key in her pocket Q Are you sure of that Bass I am my lord instead of both going into bed we were so much in liquor that we were neither of us

As an evidence he was brought to Bow-street on the Sunday morning by Jealous Townsend and me and he made a confession of all the things that he knew Is he admitted an evidence against Durham as an accomplice - No as a receiver buying them as receivers do in general from the people that steal them How did you find these goods - By Fleming s information when Sir Sampson Wright talked to him he said this was a part of such a robbery in such a place and part at such a place and part at such a place Was he at the time accused of this particular robbery - No not of this nor of any other that I know of but of some things that are to come before your Lordship another time when Sir Sampson Wright told him he would admit him an evidence if he would make a clear confession of all the things he had bought at different times Then he was not under charge for this particular fact - No Then before he gave that information he was not accused of this robbery nor of receiving those goods - It was not known to my knowledge till the time he gave information of it himself and several more as well as this What was Fleming apprehended for - He was apprehended for receiving stolen goods Mr Jealous and two or three more of our people went to a house somewhere near where he lived and there was a quantity of things and the woman said they belonged to Mr Fleming the next day Jealous Townsend and I went down to Fleming s and took him into custody says he what is this for says he I know what it is for it is for such things that were found at Mrs Burkett s last night yes it is says he very well I expected you to come I could have been out of the way but I staid in the way on purpose when he was brought to the office he offered to make a discovery Sir Sampson Wright would not take it from him at all then he desired him to recollect what he could then and he would give him time till Monday on Monday he came up and had wrote down several things and he said I have still more robberies Sir Sampson Wright said let me get through these you have told us already and write down what you have more to discover and if there is any part you dislike when you have wrote it down contradict it Jury Was you present when all this conversation passed at Sir Sampson Wright s - Yes Court Then all that he knew of this business was discovered in consequence of this - I believe so Had not Fleming an assurance of safety or protection in proportion to the discoveries he should make - Yes I believe so Sir Sampson told him that if he told every thing that he knew from the first of his connection to the present time he should be at liberty to deliver it and be safe and if he kept back any one thing he must expect no favour In consequence of this among other things he told you where these goods were - Yes Did he go with you when you found them - Yes my Lord but they had been moved from where he told us to another place which was his mother s he said they were at his sister s we did not find them there when we went to his sister s the husband of the sister was in bed he got up Is he here - I do not know I should think not we found the things at his mother s Fleming went with us to his mother s she was then gone to Fleming s the inside doors were fast he strove to open them and he could not so I kicked the doors open You know nothing of these things or any thing of the prisoner s connection with this robbery but what he told you - No Did Fleming tell you how he came by the knowledge of these things - Yes he said he had bought them from the different prisoners that were in custody sometimes one sometimes two as much as I know when he bought them of people that were present he mentioned their names and when it was said where was this done he said at such a place He admitted there that at the time they were bought by him he knew they were stolen - Yes Did he say whether he knew any thing of this robbery before it was committed or whether he had any hand in the robbery itself - No and I remember very well Sir Sampson asked him whether he had been with these people doing any thing and he said no Court It does not appear to me Mr Peatt that win this case Fleming stands precisely in the light of an accomplice he stands at present in the light of an accessary after the fact but not as an accomplice in the fact therefore I do not well see how I can avoid examining him and hearing what he has to say it goes very strongly to his credit but I doubt very much whether he stands in the situation of an accomplice my idea of an accomplice is a person that confesses himself guilty of the very fact the prisoner is accused of now this man does not stand charged by his own confession or otherwise but of one crime which is a crime greatly affecting his credit it is the crime of receiving these goods after the fact committed knowing them to be stolen and there is no doubt but the Court and Jury ought to receive the evidence of such a witness with great caution but I doubt whether there is any principle of law that I can decline examining him upon if he appears on the evidence to be an accomplice in the same fact with which the prisoner is charged and admitted as an evidence as an accomplice there being no other evidence to affect the prisoner I certainly would not call him nor permit him to be examined Mr Peatt I trust your Lordship will not receive his evidence in the former trial he was heard and considered in that light and the confessions he has made has been in consequence of promises and there being no other evidence I trust you will not receive him because he stands precisely in point of credit in the same light as an accomplice Mr Silvester He is not an accomplice nor is there any objection to his competency Call Francis Fleming FRANCIS FLEMING sworn I shall say nothing but the truth although I have been in court Court I hope you will not you took the officers to the place where the goods that have been produced were found - I did How did you come by the knowledge you have of this matter - One William Smith came into my house that is not the prisoner Court Then you must not tell us what you heard from other people - One William Smith brought part of this property to me some time last month it might be about the middle of November What do you call the middle - The fourteenth or fifteenth Where did you get the remainder of these things - Of the prisoner John Durham about four or five minutes after Smith came in Durham brought in a bundle also then I opened both the bundles Was Smith there when Durham came - He was What did Durham say - He said there were some things and desired me to look at them to buy them there was one Keep and Vanderberg in my house at the same time not in the same part of the house I looked at them and bought them What did you pay for them - I am not sure as I told Sir Sampson Wright whether it was four guineas or whether it was four pounds ten for the whole that they both brought Who did you pay the money to - I laid it on the counter and Durham took it up Did Durham take up the money for the whole or only for the things in his bundle - They were sold all together and Durham took up the money for the whole Can you recollect what day of the week this was - I believe it was on Thursday night What time of the night - It might be about eight o clock Did you make any enquiry how these things had been come by - No Then it was immaterial to you - I knew the men before and I had bought things of them before Did you conceive these things at the time you bought them to be honestly come by or not - I really thought they were stolen You thought so then - Yes Sir Sampson Wright told me the consequence if I did not tell the whole truth therefore I do Did Durham say any thing how they were come by - No How did these things get to your mother - I sent them to my sister first Did you put any mark on these things from any other things that you bought - No when I sent these things first to my sister I do not think there were any things there But how do you know these things to be the same things that were brought to you by Smith and the prisoner - Because there was one gown and coat that I bought with the rest of the things that I kept at home that gown and coat I delivered on the 3d of December to Macmanus and Townsend that was a part of the property Do you recollect whether that gown and coat was in Smith s parcel or in the prisoner s parcel - I cannot recollect that I know this corded dimity bed-gown the gores or gussets are not of the same sort I had sold the bed-gown and a person told me of it afterwards I did not examine it at the time Then you have only the word of the person you sold it to - That is all in that case I know this scarlet coat when it was brought to me the buttons were all covered with paper and some of them are now covered this is the same coat as far as the best of my knowledge will go it is a remarkable coat lapelled which is not as they make them now it was in one of the two parcels I do not know which here is a remarkable gown and coat this I sent to my sister and I brought it away myself and I sold it to Mrs Cox and I saw her make her mark she expects to lay in every day Court You must put that out of the case - Here are two pair of sattin breeches and a tissue waistcoat I cannot speak positively to those I have sold there are no other things that I wish to swear to this gown and coat this scarlet coat I can positively swear to Mr Peatt It is scarcely possible I think that more light can be thrown on your character than has been already Court As to character you need not give yourself any trouble Mr Peatt You have not been very strict I suppose at any time in asking questions of the persons that came to pledge - I have received things since I have been in business most likely in the same way I have received these I gave a full account of every thing I knew If you had had them things in your possession which were liable to be called in question do not you suppose yourself to be in danger if they were not ascribed to some particular person - Yes Sir I comprehend that these things that were found in my house if I had been unable to account for them I should certainly think myself in danger Jane M Kenzie I went out about seven to the best of my knowledge I was at home before eight Court to Mrs Pincutt Look particularly at the coat and the gown and coat - I have a bit of the gown and coat in my pocket I know it perfectly well I only know it from the pattern and having long sleeves Do you know any thing particular in the make of it - Only that it had long sleeves and a tucker in it not more than that The piece handed to the Court I know the scarlet coat to be ours by the buttons being covered Mr Pincutt saw it himself and said it was his he is gone abroad I only know it from the buttons being papered and lined with white silk Then you would not have known it only by the buttons being papered - No none of the gowns are marked the sheets are marked this I know to be mine PRISONER s DEFENCE I know nothing at all of the robbery of any kind I never had any dealings with the man he has taken away my life already I am in a halter already Mr Peatt Did you buy that gown yourself - No Sir I did not You would not have known that gown perhaps if you had seen it any where else - I should have thought it was like mine What do you suppose that gown and coat to be worth at a reasonable value as a second hand thing - I cannot say GUILTY Of stealing not of the burglary Transported for seven years Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr RECORDER

tea-board which I observed many times there are two patches on the bed which I put upon it myself one of the bolsters is broke very much which I knew all these things were the property of Patrick Neal The prisoner Pickering called five witnesses who gave him a good character JOHN MERRYMAN WILLIAM PICKERING GUILTY Death Mr Garrow My Lord before the verdict is recorded as to the capital part of the charge there is no evidence whatever besides that of the accomplice early in the case your lordship intimated an opinion that as to the capital part of the charge it was then done away in consequence of that a great deal of the evidence was not entered into and the situation of the case rests quite in doubt except as to the evidence of the accomplice because the poor poor woman is not here to give any evidence on the subject and the evidence of the accomplice negatives it the probability is that this poor woman either really being annoyed or fancying that she was annoyed ran out of the house and left the door open and in a case where the lives of two men are concerned your lordship will forgive me when I suggest that this probability that the wife had really gone out leaving the house insecure then supposing your lordship would resort to the evidence of the accomplice on which your lordship made all those humane and strong and sensible observations which all Judges make taking it on his evidence it amounts to this that one of the thieves came to the door he pushed against it and that he broke it open he did not apply any crow to it he did not apply any false key no he pushed against it and he entered taking it on the evidence of this accomplice unconfirmed it stands perfectly in doubt whether this poor woman had not left her door open and in such a case always bowing as I am sure it is my duty to do to the authority of the Bench and to the judgment of the Jury who I know will always remember mercy is the predominent feature in every verdict and that it is what your lordship kept in view particularly in your charge on this trial I took the liberty to make this suggestion in order that the Jury if they see fit might mitigate this case and not find these two men guilty of an offence of which it seems to me there is no evidence I am to intreat pardon for this and I know I shall very readily obtain it in a case in which the capital part of the charge seemed to be so much abandoned Court I am extremely obliged to Mr Garrow for taking the trouble of making these observations to the Court Gentlemen if you can see any reason to vary thatverdict you have found it is always my wish that mercy may be mixed with the exercise of justice as soon as Patrick Neale had began his evidence I did observe there was an end of the capital part of the case had the man s wife been here her testimony alone would have supported it therefore I thought it was unnecessary to proceed any further on that examination but on the further investigation of the business finding that evidence was given of that circumstance from the accomplice then I should have been glad that the prosecutor had been further examined with respect to any thing he could have said on that subject though I think he could not have carried his testimony any further than he did which was that when he came to the house at four in the afternoon the next day he found the staple of the street-door had been forced out he also found the house in that situation in which the woman could not have left it that coupled with the testimony of the accomplice I thought it sufficient to leave it to you so that the testimony of the accomplice did not stand singly by itself I thought it my duty to leave it to your judgment now gentlemen with respect to this case as to the evidence of an accomplice the Judges have lately had before them in order to consider a case tried by Mr Justice Buller whether a person could be convicted on the evidence of an accomplice only for there was no other witness he respited the sentence in order to take the opinion of all the Judges whether or no that person was properly convicted I was present as one of the Judges and they were all unanimously of opinion that an accomplice is a competent witness to be received but his credit is to be left to the Jury and where a person appears under such circumstances in order to purchase his own life by giving testimony against those that are on their trial Juries do not give credit to his testimony unless it is confirmed but I do not say in every circumstance for though that person s testimony is to be confirmed by the testimony of other witnesses yet if it is confirmed in the material parts of it that gives it a credit now this man s testimony has been confirmed with respect to the things found in Pickering s lodgings and in my apprehension it gives a credit to him but that credit how far it will extend is for your consideration it is not for the consideration of the Court but it is not to be narrowed as the learned Counsel mentions In my apprehension the accomplice s testimony he gave in the natural story of that transaction was confirmatory of the other testimony and my wish would have been that you should have found them guilty of the felony and not of the capital part of the charge but it is your province and not mine it is my duty to make such observations to you as may assist you to form your judgment if you agree with them you adopt them if not you reject them it is your province to decide and not the Judge s my wishes were that you would have found them guilty of the felony only Mr Garrow It is not too late the verdict is not recorded Jury My lord it was the general wish of the Jury to leave the capital part out but their doubts arose whether they had power Court Certainly you have power it is entirely in your province and really in a case so circumstanced as this is with respect to Merryman my wish was that you would have acquitted him totally because there was no evidence against him but from the accomplice only and I so pointed it out to you Mr Garrow Gentlemen the verdict is not yet recorded and I am sure it will reflect no discredit on the Jury to alter their verdict particularly after the humane observations from the learned Judge Clerk of the Arraigns Consider your verdict gentlemen JOHN MERRYMAN WILLIAM PICKERING GUILTY 4 s 10 d Transported for seven

it is all used as a warehouse On Saturday night the 28th of July between seven and eight o clock I locked up the warehouse and took the keys to Mr Valentine the clerk - I went back about half-past eight o clock on Monday morning opened the street door and on going into the counting-house found part of a bottle of wine and some glasses there - the lock of the counting-house door was broken open and the lock of the door leading to the warehouse up stairs was forced - I went up and found property gone from the first floor - I went to the first floor then came down into a little room and found a hole broken through the wall of an empty house at the back of ours that enabled persons to get from that empty house to this inner room which is on the first floor - I missed about 8 cwt of cochineal which I had left safe on Saturday night between seven and eight o clock - I informed Mr Valentine - VALENTINE I am clerk to the prosecutor It was Allan s duty to bring me the keys - he did so on Saturday the 28th of July about eight o clock they were in my possession till about half-past eight on Monday morning when I delivered them to him DANIEL FORRESTER I am a City officer On the 8th of August I went with my father and Herdsfield to No 9 Paradise-street we searched the first floor middle room which was open and found a cupboard over the stair-case which was locked - I went down and asked Mary Anne Dove for the key she said she had not got it for she had lent the use of that cupboard to the person she had let the front room to - I fetched a poker out of the kitchen to break it open and in putting the poker under the door it ran into one of the bags and the cochineal flowed out - there was about 300 lbs of cochineal there - I produce samples of it - I asked her to inform me where the young man was whom she had let the room to she said she should answer no questions On the 13th of August in consequence of information I Herdsfield and John Forrester went to the prisoner Chick s house in Bacchus-walk Hoxton and saw him there it is a small hovel built in a garden - it has only a ground-floor he was at work as a shoemaker - I told him I understood there was a quantity of cochineal there he whispered something to his wife and while she was in the act of speaking to Charles Hardsfield at the door I opened a door which led into a back place and there found a bag containing about 90 lbs of cochineal he said a man in a hairy cap brought it there on the Thursday of Friday put it inside the door and told him to take care of it Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q What day of the week was the 8th of August A Wednesday the 13th was Monday there was a bed in the back room - it is a very miserable place CHARLES HERDSFIELD I am an officer and was with Forrester he was talking when I went back his wife said to me Herdsfield it is here and we found the cochineal in the back place Cross-examined Q The wife said what you were inquiring about was there A Yes MR GUSTAVUS SMITH I am in partnership with my brother Charles Webb Smith we are drysalters and deal in cochineal - I was in the country when this happened I have examined the samples of the cochineal found at Dove s by daylight we prepare our cochineal by a particular process and can say this is our property it is in a finished state - that found at Chick s is part of the same parcel Cross-examined Q You prepare yours by a particular process A We believe so - I do not know how others prepare it but we always know our own when we see it in the market with other lots we prepare all ours by the same mode - it differs principally in two respects - there is a better state of colour on it a better face and it is lighter in hand as we call it - it has a different feel I think I could tell one lot of our preparation from another but not by candle light - by referring to my book I could see what quality was prepared at one time from another I saw this cochineal in its first state and followed it through all its different processes and know it to have been prepared at a particular time for a particular market and from particular samples the preparation is the same but the qualities selected are different in the first instance MR BOLLAND Q Where was this prepared for A For Chinn I am certain that this was prepared only a few days previous to the 28th of July MR VALENTINE I know this cochineal to be what was prepared in July for China I have seen it by daylight and by candle-light It was only prepared a few days previous to the robbery CHARLES WEBB SMITH I am in partnership with my brother - I came to town on Monday morning and found the premises in the state described - I missed the cochineal which had been prepared on the 26th or 27th and know this to be part of the same CHICK s Defence I have a witness who slept at my house from the 24th to the 30th of July THOMAS WESTON I am a boot-closer and know Chick - he is a shoemaker On the evenings of the 25th 26th 27th 28th 29th and 30th of July I was at his house and part of the day time I went there to ask him to recommend me to work I had come from Portsmouth and had seen him before - I slept in his house all those nights in the next room to him nobody could come out of his room without going through the one I was in nor without disturbing me - I generally got there about half-past nine or ten o clock and I in a measure spent an hour or two with him every evening he generally got up at six o clock in the morning - he never left the house on those nights or I must have heard him - he had more work than common at this time and I assisted him I was there occasionally for three weeks after or nearly four weeks going to assist him I was there on the Wednesday before he was taken and towards the close of the evening I saw a man bringa bag - it was Wednesday to the best of my remembrance - it might be about eight o clock Q Did the man say any thing A The only words I heard him mention was Let this remain here for a few minutes he might have said more but I am rather hard of hearing - he might have said the number of minutes - the bag was left in the outer room I went away about half-past seven o clock - he had not come for it then - I never saw him before I did not see the bag afterwards it appeared to be made of strong brown linen which I call Russia sheeting MR BOLLAND Q Where do you live A In Bell-alley Goswell-street I had no residence when I slept at Chick s - I had just come to town the rooms are very small and only a thin partition between them Q Are there two beds A Why it cannot be called a bed - it was a make-shift to save me from a lodging - he must pass very lightly through my room not to awake me - I am very wakeful - a person might perhaps go through the room without his shoes Chick wished the man to take the bag away - he did not open it nor ask what it was nor did I Nobody could go out and come in again without my hearing them COURT Q I thought you said your hearing was bad A Sometimes it is I lodge in Bell-alley on the first floor I left Chick s house at eight o clock on Sunday morning and returned about half-past six or seven o clock- I was absent all day I think I can say I did not return later than seven I keep no watch and there is no clock but I know the people were not out of church Q Out of what church A Out of the churches which I passed I went up Windmill-street and passed the Tabernacle the people were in there - I suppose that is over about eight o clock but I cannot say when I will swear I got to Chick s before eight for after I got there I heard the people passing by say it was eight I was then indoors The footpath is close to the door I heard the parents call their children in who were playing there and say it was gone eight I was talking to Chick and his wife at the time I went to bed on Saturday about eleven o clock - the bag was left at his house on a Wednesday about five weeks ago - I think it was about the 8th of August - I am confident it was Wednesday I was not there when the officers came - whether they look the same bag away I cannot say it was left by a stout man in a jacket but what his jacket was made of I do not know Q Did he wear a cocked hat or a round one A Oh it was not a cocked hat Q Was it a good round hat or a shabby one A That I cannot answer - he was at the door so short a time I could not observe he put it in and went away after saying what he did I cannot say whether his hat was shabby or not - I do not think it was very shabby I cannot say what his hat was whether it was new or old to the best of my remembrance he had a hat on but of what sort it was I do not know - he had the bag on his shoulder - I think it was large but what the size was I cannot say - I should think it would hold about two bushels I do not know what cochineal is he left it between five and six o clock - he put it just within the door the prisoner said You must not leave that here or words to that effect he did not throw it out of doors after him - I did not run after the man we did not go to inform a constable Worship-street is about half a mile off I was there about two hours and a half that day - I went to see about some work which he had promised me but there was none - I staid as I had nothing to do I made no inquiry whether such property had been lost The man did not run away that I know of - he went away we did not call him back I told the prisoner s father of this on the day he was committed from the Mansion-house as I was there I was not inside the office I cannot say that the prisoner ever examined the bag When I left the house it was on the same spot as the man left it I have not seen it since D FORRESTER re-examined I cannot be certain whether the prisoner or his wife told me when it was left the prisoner was present at the time - they were close together CHICK - GUILTY Transported for Life M A DOVE - NOT GUILTY E DOVE - NOT GUILTY

it was entire half an hour before when I was inspecting the outside of the window the property was safe when the officer spoke to me - we let it remain there the glass was split at the bottom and a crack down so that by pushing the glass in a hand could he put in but there was no hole then the officer pointed through the window to Simpson who was looking in at the window he walked away and as I suppose went round under the gateway of Pilgrim-street I turned my head round again and saw a man leaning against the window under the gateway and saw the glass pushed suddenly through by his elbows - his hand entered and he took at first six forks - the officer was undoing the door and went out to secure him he walked away I took notice of his face it was Jones I am certain the officer went out and I after him - we overtook Jones two doors from our s at Mr Eyles the linen-draper - he took him back and I saw him take the property from him in the shop it belonged to Mrs West ROBERT HOCKLEY I knew the prisoners -

I followed them thinking they looked suspicious and in Cheapside I saw them survey two or three silversmiths shops I then followed them to Ludgate-hill and saw them cross the street to Mrs West s shop - I saw them walk three or four times round under the archway and return again Simpson twice looked into the front-window on Ludgate-street - I went into Mr Alger s shop where the last witness lives and told him to observe the lad pointing him out - I then went down Ludgate-hill facing the passage opposite the Old Bailey came round through the archway and saw Jones talking to somebody I passed them and saw Simpson still standing at the corner - I crossed over to Mr Alger s and said to the witness You have kept your eye on the boy shall you know him again he said he should I then crossed and saw the boy cross his hand at the window - I went round the hill returned and saw the glass was cut across and down I went in and shewed it to Smith - I turned my eye and Jones was leaning with his arm against the corner - he forced the glass in some little distance I asked if there was another door - Smith said there were two side doors Simpson then put his hand up took the gass from the frame and put it into his pocket - Jones immediately turned round and drew the property out of the window I saw him draw out some articles - the porter opened the first door and in opening the second which leads into the street the bolt made a noise and they immediately made off I kept my eye on Jones - Simpson turned round and looked me full in the face I followed Jones up the bill and stopped him two doors from the house I asked him what he had been doing - he said Nothing I took him back to the shop and asked what he had got in his pocket - he said Nothing I found these articles in his coat-pocket Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Why did you not make somebody else take Simpson A I had not an opportunity - I was at one time on the opposite side and at another time by the gateway I saw him pass him hand across the window - the window was not broken but cut and starred I never saw one broken in that way by accident - glass so thick as this would not split by the pressure of the elbow without being first starred we might he not above six yards from Simpson - I saw nothing in his hand to cut the glass with he did not run - I cannot conceive that it could he done by accident in the way it was broken - Jones took the glass he took no goods out it rained at the time and there were a number of people standing under the archway - none of them are here the crowd would hide him the glass broken was in the gateway where the people were standing - the prisoners stood rather away from the people and were more conspicuous to me the persons standing up were looking on to Ludgate-hill - I knew Simpson had not got the property and by taking him I should have made a disturbance and the one with the property would have escaped the property was taken about four minutes after the window was broken I knew Simpson s person before - he had on a brown jacket waistcoat and trowsers and a black hat - his jacket was braided JAMES LEE I took up Simpson next day on Ludgate-hill - he had a blue coat on I had seen him in Jones company the day before in a brown braided jacket and black hat which I found at his lodgings in Prince s-street his mother went there with me THOMAS SHELSWELL I went with Lee to the prisoners lodgings Jones pleaded distress JONES -

I occupy the whole house On Wednesday the 2nd of February I went to bed about a quarter-past eleven o clock the house was then fastened - two female servants and the boy were up when I went to bed one female servant and the boy are here - it is my invariable practice to examine the doors myself every night I did so that night - they were all fast a little after six o clock in the morning the boy came up and alarmed me - I went down stairs and perceived every thing in the front parlour in very great disorder and a great deal of property gone there was about 300l worth gone - I looked over the house and on going down to the back kitchen I found an entry had been made at the back door by cutting a piece out of the door and unbolting it I had seen that door myself overnight - it was then safe when it became day-light we found a ladder from the adjoining house to mine - the two houses join within about four feet there is an addition of a back room built out at the next house and at the back part of my house is a yard covered in the houses are not quite close together - on the back room which is built out from the next house I saw some pieces of cuttings of scarlet cloth by which I suppose the property was taken out that way I had scarlet cloth in my house - I saw footsteps on the snow leading to the back of an empty house in George-street there appeared a good many footsteps - I then went round to the empty house and saw a female named Woodward who had the care of it in the back room coming from that yard there were several pieces of scarlet cloth and a quantity of wadding which some of the dress coats that had been taken from my house had been wrapped up in - I found them in the room of the empty house leading from the yard to where I traced the footsteps and in the kitchen of the empty house I found three silver spoons belonging to me - I went into the front kitchen there and saw there had been the same sort of work at the door of that house as well as mine a piece was cut out of the centre of the door where the bolt was exactly the same as mine - that is the door leading from the kitchen to the stairs there was no mark of any force having been used to any of the outer doors of that house no appearance of their having been broken open - I returned home and sent to Marlborough-street Office for Ballard I missed from my house a full dress coat for the West Somerset Yeomanry worth about 30l a full dress coat for the Grenadier Guards worth upwards of 30l and the front part of the embroidery of a coat for the Coldstream Guards I missed altogether about thirteen coats I think five epaulettes between sixty and seventy yards of woollen cloth more than that of kerseymere and about twelve yards of velvet -

she is not here I was present when Coy and Thompson were apprehended by Ballard - they had property belonging to me in their possession at that time they were apprehended in Dean-street Soho about three o clock in the afternoon of the Saturday following - Coy had a bundle with two pieces of scarlet cloth in it Thompson had a kind of a hand-basket with two coats in it - I do not think any thing was said at that time I know the cloth belonged to me and one of the coats - we got a warrant to search a muffinbaker s shop in Hanway-yard kept by the prisoner Gast the officers Ballard Goddard Schofield and myself went there on the Saturday - Gast was in the house and while we were searching Ellis came in with a bundle Ballard took him into custody and on opening the bundle there was a coat in it belonging to me - we only found in Gast s house about eight yards of cloth belonging to me in three remnants we then went to No 11 Tottenham-court-road kept by the witness Thompson a hosier - Ballard Goddard and myself went in and in the front attic of that house we discovered a great quantity of my property there was all the embroidery of the regimental coats the epaulettes five or six other coats a quantity of blue cloth and two regimental coats -

my house was broken open on the Wednesday night or Thursday morning and I went to Gast s house on the Saturday about five o clock in the afternoon he was at home - I believe he is married there was a family there - I have heard that Ellis is Gast s son-in-law and lodged in the house at least when we took the black cloth found there it was asked whose room that was in and it was said to be Ellis - the eight yards were cut or torn into three pieces I think it was on the second floor - there are no back rooms I was down stairs at the time but when I came up it was on a chest of drawers - I think it had been found before I got up I was called down once or twice Goddard and Schofieldwere in the room - I did not find it I have the head ends of it and the list to compare with it and have a private-mark on one piece - my name is not on it he certainly could not tell it was mine by any mark - I did not know Ellis before Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q How many persons sleep in the house A Myself my wife three female servants five children and a boy the next house was not empty - it was a house in George-street a door inside that house had been broken Q Was that towards the back part of the premises A No the front - I cannot tell whether the door of that house had been closed the night before of course I found the inner door broken the same as my own door - Ballard was present when we took Coy and Thompson Q And you say at that time nothing was said A I said I did not hear any thing pass DAVID WEBSTER I am servant to Mr Chambers I went to bed on the Wednesday night between half-past eleven and twelve o clock -

that door was shut over night I saw it shut - I saw the cases the regimental coats were kept in were standing open and empty Mr Chambers great coat and another coat laid on the floor - I immediately went up and alarmed master who came down I went with him into the back kitchen on the area floor and saw a piece was taken out of the door and a hole made to put their fingers through to undo the bolts the door was open - I went to the front kitchen and the two female servant s drawers were open I missed a pair of boots of mine out of the cupboard - on the Friday Goddard and Ballard brought the prisoner Clifford to master s house I saw him in the parlour - Ballard told him to take one of the boots off which he had on he did so and Ballard asked me if they were mine - I said they were he had both my boots on Q Did you go the same night into the back kitchen again after the examination A I was walking through the back kitchen in the dark - it was dusk I kicked a boot before me - I got a light and found the fellow to it they did not belong to me - I inquired of all the men in the house and they did not claim them I delivered those boots to Ballard - they were very old ones and I had only worn mine once Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Did not Clifford say in your presence that he had bought the boots at the Three Compasses New-cut Lambeth A No he did not I did not see the other boots put on his feet -

the epaulette boxes and things were about I requested Mr Chambers to show me which way he conceived they had got in the entrance of the house was effected through the sky-light of his workshop - it is an upright sky-light the window opens at the side - it was open it could be opened very easily - there appeared to be no fastening to that it opened and shut by pullies from the inside - it could be opened from the outside by a person putting their hands on the frame and pushing it down there was a string hanging from the inside of the window by which they could let themselves down and then descend into the house by a flight of stairs - the strings belong to the window they could let themselves down into the body of the shop which is about ten feet by taking hold of the cord - they then had to descend a flight of stairs at the bottom of which is a door communicating with the back kitchen - a hole was cut through that door in the corner just above the bottom stile sufficient to admit two or three fingers to work back the bolt it was some holes bored and then broken through - it had been bored by a large gimblet of this description producing one which is broken and part of it was found on Mr Chambers premises it was given to me by Mr Chambers servant -

I gave them to Ballard WILLIAM BALLARD Outside the sky-light in the snow was the print of a person s feet standing and moving about and marks of their fingers where they had laid their hands in different parts on the top of the sky-light and different parts of the window there were the marks of persons feet going over the back premises of other houses to the empty house in George-street - they had to cross one person s premises entirely to get to it there were the tracks of three or four persons and in the yard of the empty house were a great number of foot-marks and in the back room of the empty house I saw some wadding and cuttings of scarlet cloth laying about - I then proceeded down stairs in the empty house and found a door which communicates from the front kitchen to the foot of the stairs cut just above the middle stile where there was a bolt to fasten it a hole had been bored and then broken through so as to admit fingers to get to the bolt to unfasten it the same way as the other and on the board of one of the windows inside was a great quantity of tools belonging to a bell-hanger who had been working at the house at bell-hanging - there were no marks on the door there but on going into the front area there were marks on the wall of a person s toe as if a person had scraped it by dropping down into the area and a mark of one heel in the snow close up against the wall and at the window which was nearest to the cistern therewere marks of a person having got in at that window the shutters of which were not fastened I then inquired for the person who had charge of the house and from information received from Mrs Woodward I went in search of the prisoner Woodward at No 9 Fullwood s-rents - he was not there I searched the room and left Goddard there - I saw Goddard there myself till eleven o clock on the following morning Friday I went with Goddard to No 53 Cirencester-place - Goddard proceeded up stairs and brought Clifford down to me in the shop and upon asking him a few questions I desired him to put his feet up and said Where did you get these shoes he said I bought them I said when - he said yesterday I said where - he said over in the New-cut I said where there - he said in the skittle-ground of the Three Compasses kept by a man of the name of Pople I asked what he gave for them - he said 10s I asked if he knew the person he bought them of - he said No he did not he was a stranger I asked if the landlord was present - he said No I asked if the pot-boy was - he said the pot-boy came in and out he did not know that he saw him I asked what he had done with his old ones - he said he had thrown them over the bridge into the river as he came back we then took him to Mr Chambers showed Webster the shoes and he claimed them as his - we then took him to the office where I desired him to take off the shoes he had then on and to put on one of the old ones which I had received from Webster the shoe itself was evidently too long for him but the marks of his toes evidently came where the marks of the toes were in the shoes - here are marks of Jumps or bunions on the shoes at the same place in the old shoes which were found as in the new ones which were taken off his feet - there is the same tread Q Do you mean on the upper leathers or on the soles A On the upper leathers in consequence of information received I went with Goddard to Rupert-street on the Saturday and after waiting a considerable time I saw Coy go into a house he came out in about half an hour went down into Princes-street from there to Wardour-street and then returned home again to Rupert-street and after stopping in doors some time he came out and proceeded at a fast pace walking fast and running up to Mr Young s Marshall-street Golden-square just by Carnaby-market after some time he came out again and proceeded faster than before - Goddard and I followed him through Soho-square across Oxford-street and into Hanway-street- I did not see him go into Gast s house myself but after waiting about an hour and a half Goddard left me and before he returned I saw Coy come out of Gast s house with a bundle under his arm - he had no bundle when I followed him before I ran out from where I was standing and in Oxford-street saw Coy and then for the first time I saw Thompson in his company - he had a basket in his hand when I got out of Hanway-street they were about the middle of the street talking together I had not seen them join each other - Mr Chambers was with me - I allowed them to go on down Dean-street as far as Walker s hotel I then took hold of Coy and Mr Chambers secured Thompson - we put them into the hotel immediately I secured them and requested Mr Chambers to go for a coach which I put them into and took them to the office I told Coy at the office there had been a robbery committed and a great quantity of cloth stolen this was not taken down in writing - I said did he choose to say any thing about it he might do as he liked I untied his bundle and found it contained this scarlet cloth - he said he had got it of young Gust and that Gust lived at a muffin-shop in Hanway-street - that he received it from him in the bakehouse and he was going to sell it for him for the purpose of getting a few shillings - I asked him if he knew any thing about any coats he said he did not I asked if he had been offering to sell any coats to any person - he said No he had not - that Thompson had two coats to try to sell but he knew nothing about them I asked if he knew any thing about any cloth - he said he did not I desired Goddard to see what Thompson had in the basket which he did - I had no conversation with him about it Coy at the office the same evening pointed out Ellis as the person he had received the scarlet cloth from this was in Ellis presence I do not think the Magistrate was there but at all events it was not when any deposition was taken the Magistrate lives in the house a message was sent up to say that they were ready and I think it was before he came down I am however sure that it was not taken in writing - it was said in Ellis presence and he made no answer to it we proceeded to get a search-warrant and went off to the house in Hanway-street - the prisoner Gast was making muffins at the back part of the shop I told him we had a warrant to search his house - he asked for what I told him for woollen cloth and other articles and while I was searching the front parlour he said Well but what are you searching for and shortly afterwards he said But I have not seen the warrant I showed it him - he wanted to copy it I said I could not stop to give him a copy at that time Mr Chambers Goddard and Schofield were up stairs searching I was down stairs in charge of the door and after standing there some time Ellis came in - he had this coat tied in this handkerchief under his arm I said Here I am waiting for you - what have you here he said a coat I said Where did you get it he said I bought it I asked of whom - he said of a man named Jones but he did not know where he lived he had only seen him at a public-house I said Where were you when you bought it he said at his own house - I said What house do you mean - do you mean this house here he said Yes in a short time time I sent Goddard down to the office with him and in consequence of what had been found up stairs I told Gast it was necessary he should get ready to go before the Magistrate to give an account of the things found in his house he cleaned himself for that purpose - a female came in and in consequence of information we went to No 11 Tottenham-court-road and there saw Mr Thompson the witness - we asked if he knew Ellis he took us up to the front attic where we found a large quantity of woollen cloth here is a blue cloth in one piece and four coats one of which is not finished three epaulettes and the military dress coats as stated in the indictment - they were tied in a bundle and the epaulettes with them they have been shown to Mr Chambers On the Monday following in consequence of information I received I went to the house of Mr Smith Hop-gardens St Martin s-lane and there received from Mrs Smith a quantity of cloth and kerseymere on the 14th Mr Thompson delivered to Goddard in my presence ten yards of velvet Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Gast keeps a muffin-shop of some celebrity in Hanway-street A Yes- I believe he has done so for some years Ellis said he resided there but the room which was pointed out as Ellis had neither bed nor bedding in it it was a second floor room on the right-hand side going up - there are no back rooms I searched the shop and parlour but found nothing applying to this charge Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You found the tools of a bell-hanger at the house in George-street A Yes a great variety of tools I did not take the bellhanger up - I went to the Three Compasses and found Pople kept the house - he is here Coy said he had the cloth from Gust at the muffin-shop where I had seen him come out - I did not apprehend Ellis in consequence of that we were determined to search every place he came out of with property he said Thompson had two coats which was true - I do not know Thompson to be a dealer in muffins HENRY GODDARD I am a Police-officer I joined Ballard at Mr Chambers on Thursday morning the 3rd- what he has stated is correct I went on the day after the robbery with Ballard and Chambers to Fullwood s-rents to search for John Woodward - I staid there till one o clock in the morning of Friday but he did not return about nine o clock on the Friday morning I went with Ballard to No 53 Cirencester-place and in the two pair back room I saw Clifford dressing himself I desired him to come down - Ballard asked him several questions respecting the shoes I heard what he said and what Ballard has stated is true - the next day Saturday in consequence of information I went with Ballard to No 27 Rupert-street and after waiting some time saw Coy come out we followed and watched him into the house of Mr Young in Marshall-street but before that I had gained ground on him and went and told Young I thought he was coming there he went to Young s and stopped there a short time then came out and I saw him go into the house of Gast in Hanway-street and some time after I received charge of the prisoner Thompson - I had been watching in Hanway-street some time Q When Coy went into the house in Hanway-street did not you go in A No I remained watching and afterwards went to the Police-office where I received charge of Thompson - he had a basket I asked if it was his - he said Yes - I opened it and found it contained two coats here is one of them - I asked who he got them from and after some little hesitation he said from a person named Gust - I afterwards asked what he was going to do with them - he said to sell them and if he sold them he was to have 5s for his trouble I afterwards returned from the office with Ballard Schofield and Chambers to Gast s house in Hanway-street and in searching the second floor room on the right-hand as you go up stairs I found three pieces of black cloth - I asked whose room it was and was told it was Ellis it had no bed in it - the cloth was on the drawers tied in this handkerchief it is three remnants - I came down searched Ellis and took him to the office I found upon him about 8l in money the key of a clock and a variety of small keys I returned to Gast s house and from information I went with Chambers and Ballard to Thompson s in Tottenham-court-road and found the property described by Ballard after I took Ellis to the office I showed him to Coy - Andrews the officer who had him in custody was present the Magistrate was not present - it was in the clerk s office and before the office hours the clerk was not writing nothing passed - I afterwards locked Ellis up and then went and asked Coy if that was the person who he had the cloth from COURT We cannot receive his answer in evidence Witness After that in Ellis presence about nine o clock that night while the Magistrate was sent for but before he came down we had the prisoners in the office ready to be examined both Thompson and Coy nodded their heads at Ellis and said that was the person they got the things from - Ellis saw them nod and heard it but made no answer on the Monday following I went with Ballard to Smith s and received three pieces of kerseymere from Mrs Smith I got information from there that some blue cloth had been sent from there that morning to Mr Eccles in Spring-gardens and I got from there two pieces of blue cloth that is blue cloth which Ballard has not spoken to - it is here I got it from Eccles the same day on the 14th I received ten yards of velvet from Mr Thompson of No 11 Tottenham-court-road WILLIAM BALLARD re-examined I ascertained afterwards that the person who Thompson described as young Gust was the prisoner Ellis - he called him Gust his name being Gustavus GEORGE POPLE I keep the Three Compasses Lamheth-marsh I do not know the prisoner Clifford - I never saw him at my house that I know of there is no skittle-ground at my house the latter end of last summer I made some extensive alterations and abolished the skittle-ground altogether I had none at all at this time Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q How many persons serve in your house A I have three or four behind the counter - I have no tap-room all my business is done between the counter and the street door - I have customers who drink there I have a bar-maid and potboy - the bar-maid serves they are not here - they were in my service on the 2nd and 3rd of February and are still with me there is no entrance to the part of the premises which used to be the skittle-ground without passing through my counter where nobody has been allowed to go - for the last six months there has been no skittle-ground there CHARLES GEORGE THOMPSON I am a hosier and live at No 11 Tottenham-court-road I know the prisoner Ellis - he had the use of the front attic in my house and had done so for about a month the things found there were brought in by him - I saw him about a month ago bring some medicine-chests there which he told me he had bought at a sale - there was a key in the door but the room was not locked the room the officers went into was occupied by Ellis - he did not sleep there there was no furniture only what he brought - I do not know when he brought in any thing in particular except the medicine-chests he came into my shop about half an hour before the officers came and bought a purse - he did not go up stairs he was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards - I have seen him come in with bundles JOHN SMITH I am a woollen-draper and live at No 4 Hop-gardens St Martin s-lane I have known Coy about two months - I am not acquainted with him and had not dealt with him he called on the 3rd of this month - I believe it was on a Thursday - he brought some cloth and kerseymere for sale there was a good deal of it - it was in five pieces altogether three of kerseymere and two of cloth he said he had them to sell that they were not his own they belonged to a master tailor - he asked me to buy them which I agreed to and measured them I was to pay 10s 2d a yard for the cloth 3s 10d for two of the pieces of kerseymere and 3s 11d for the other - it was broad cloth I think I paid him 24l odd after folding it up I put it on the shelf with my own goods and on the Monday morning I took two pieces of the cloth to Mr Eccles of Spring-gardens - I gave the other three up to Mr Chambers and the officers Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q How long have you carried on business as a woollen-draper A These fifteen years - I do not know that I am in the habit of buying of people who bring things in I certainly have often bought of people in the shop - the broad cloth is not fine Saxony Mr Chambers is considered a respectable and fashionable tailor I can buy very good cloth for 15s a yard - I have given 28s for some this might be about 16s a yard from the manufacturer but things are bought and sold cheaper for want of money - this is very narrow cloth and there would be an allowance for that I could buy it for 16s for cash and should be allowed a yard in the score Q You thought that you were dealing honest by giving 10s 2d for it A I knew no more of its being dishonestly come by than a child unborn - I am pretty well acquainted with the quality of cloth it may be three inches narrower than the common broad cloth which is usually thirty or thirty-one inches this is twenty-eight or twenty-nine - I was never in trouble I am sure of that - I have invoices to show my respectability I was never charged with any offence at any time or place and was never in custody or charged with having property improperly in my possession belonging to another person - I was accused of a something once but I had nothing to do with it and never was in custody I forget who accused me - what you allude to I believe was about a Mr Chambers or Chamberlain a laceman - I had some lace in my possession which he claimed - I do not know how much there was on my life nor the value I do not deal in lace - I neither bought nor sold that Mrs Smith had taken it to ask the value at a customer s - it had been brought to our house Mr Chamberlain afterwards had it - I do not know what the value was it was twelve or fourteen years back - I did not deal with it I was astonished to find it in my house -I know how it came there COURT Q How did the lace come into your possession A A man brought it to my house to know the value - I told him I did not know the value Mrs Smith took it to a customer of ours he took it to Chambers or Chamberlain where it was lost from and he claimed it - I never bought it nor agreed to buy it I did not know the value ROBERT YOUNG I am a tailor I have known Coy ever since he was born On Saturday the 5th of February he came to my shop about eleven o clock in the morning he brought some black cloth and asked if I would purchase it - I told him I did not want any but asked to look at it he untied the handkerchief - I examined it and found it to be three remnants - I asked what he wanted a yard for it he asked me 10s I said it would not suit me and that was nearly as much as it was worth - he then asked if I wished to buy any new coats and told me they belonged to a master tailor who wanted money and they were to be sold cheap - I asked what they were he said one was a very handsome black frock coat which had a velvet collar and was faced with velvet in front - I asked what price the person wanted for it he said 2l 8s - I told him it would not suit me and he went away taking the things with him I had not heard of the robbery in Maddox-street at that time - he had not got the coats with him about an hour after that Mr Chambers called at my shop and described what he had lost - I gave him information and about three o clock Coy came again he brought no coat - I had previously been to his father s to tell him I wished to see the coats he came to my shop and I agreed that he should fetch the coats for me to look at - he promised to be back in half an hour with them but I saw no more of him till he was in custody Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q I suppose you cannot be mistaken in his identity A No the cloth might be worth 12s or 13s - there was a yard and a quarter of inferior which I said I would give 10s for WILLIAM DAVIS I am a writer and ornamental painter I have been acquainted with the prisoner Woodward about two years I do not know his mother nor where she lived - I never heard from him I had some conversation with him about a month ago or rather more in the street at the corner of Charles-street and Oxford-street - I met him and asked if he was going to stand something to drink he said No he had got no money - I said how was that and told him he was gammoning me he is a tailor I believe - I asked if he had any thing to do he said No he had done very little for a good while - he said he must get some money somewhere or other very soon and that he had tried to do something at his mother s but it was no go or something to that effect - I said Take care you don t get transported that is all that passed - this was a week or eight days previous to this robbery - I cannot exactly state the time Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q He was in want of money A Yes - I have stated the words he used as near as I can recollect MR THOMAS ANGEL I live next door to the empty house in George-street On Wednesday night about halfpast twelve o clock or rather Thursday morning I saw a person standing with his back against the door of the empty house talking to a Policeman - I will not take my oath who it was but I certainly think it was the prisoner Woodward I did not know him before - I did not know whether he had any thing to do with the empty house I only saw him while I was knocking at my own door and going in with a friend - on the following morning when I heard of the robbery I went to Mr Chambers house and saw the condition of the premises and the remnants of cloth on the top of the premises they had gone over ELEANOR IRWING I slept in the empty house in George-street from Friday the 28th of January till last Thursdaynight - Mrs Woodward had the care of the house I saw the prisoner Woodward for the first time on Wednesday night the night of the robbery - he was in the back kitchen between seven and eight o clock in the evening and his mother asked him to come back to supper he said he did not think he could as he was going to see for work but he would call as he came back - he came in that evening a little before ten o clock and did not stop many minutes he went out before ten - I did not see him there then but I heard his voice his mother asked him to come in and eat some supper but he went away directly - I was in the back kitchen and so was his mother he was in the front kitchen and on the stairs going towards the door I and Mrs Woodward slept together in the front attic - I heard no alarm in the night Mrs Woodward went down in the morning a little before eight o clock - she came running up stairs to me and said the house was broken open I went down and saw the wadding and pieces of cloth strewed about the little room - her bonnet and my cap were laying in the corner the door that leads to the stairs was cut through to admit a hand - the front area window was open Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You did not see him at ten o clock but heard his voice A No - I heard his voice on the stairs passing the door of the kitchen where we sat the house is four stories high from the kitchen BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD I am an officer of Marlborough-street On Friday after the robbery I went to Woodward s lodging No 9 Fulwood s-rents Holborn - he was at home and told me they were his lodgings it was a first floor front room I asked if his name was Woodward - he said it was I asked if he had a mother keeping a house in George-street - he said he had I asked when he saw her last when he was there - he said he saw her on the Wednesday night about ten o clock - I asked if he had any objection to inform me where he had been since that time he said that was his business not mine and he should say nothing till he got before the Magistrate I then took him into custody searched him and found 5s 6d on him - I then took him to George-street to the house his mother had been keeping for Irwing to see him and then to the office I found no property - he gave the Magistrate an account where he had been which was not taken in writing at that time he said he had been along with a man named Rogers at No 28 Great St Andrew s-street - I went and ascertained that he had been part of the time with Rogers who has since absconded as we went along I told him I was taking him before a Justice - he asked if the house had been broken into in which his mother lived and whether it had been robbed I said No it had not been robbed but they had gone through that house I believed to a house at the back Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q How long before had it been ascertained that this house had been broken A On the Thursday and I took him on the Friday The prisoner Ellis made no defence Clifford s Defence I assure you I was at home on the night of the robbery I went home about eleven o clock -I came out next morning when I was brought out by Ballard - the shoes I was found in possession of I bought where I stated paying 10s for them and if I had perpetrated the act I might have escaped Mr Chambers on my being taken to his house promised if I would inform him where to find his property or to bring to justice those who committed the offence I might take his word as a gentleman he would do what he could for me and afterwards in the Magistrate s private room he told me if I would tell him where to find the property he would not prosecute in this he was checked by Mr Conant and the officer who used every means to draw from me where the property was but I knew nothing of it Coy s Defence I called at Mr Toft s George-street Hampstead-road on the night of the robbery respecting a parcel he wished me to take to the City to go to his son on board the Duke of Sussex off Gravesend I went there with a young man named Cummings we got to Toft s about ten o clock supped there and did not leave the house till twenty minutes to twelve - I brought the parcel away with me went home to bed got up next morning twenty minutes before eight took the parcel into the City and called at Alexander s music-shop which supplied the ship with music to ask a young man if the vessel had left Gravesend he said if I went to Phillips the agent of the ship he could inform me - I went to the East India-house the porter said he had not come and directed me to a man whom I could not find I went to the Steam-packet office paid 3d and had the parcel booked - I asked the young man there if the ship had left Gravesend he said he could not tell but if it had the parcel would be returned as he had another one in the same way - I left and was going to Toft s to tell him the parcel would be returned if the ship had left I had to pass Ellis door and accidentally called to ask him how he was and he asked me to sell the cloth and kerseymere which I did - he went with me and waited till I came out of Smith s and I gave him the money which I received of Smith - I have the young man at the music-shop to prove I was there Thompson s Defence Goddard stated that he had found two coats in the hand-basket covered with crumpets which is false he took me to the office opened the basket and found the coats - be found eight crumpets in my pocket which I was going to take home to tea he took four from me and gave me the rest - he put the crumpets into the basket himself HENRY GODDARD There were some crumpets in the basket and some in his pocket I think about eight in all - he said he had them from Gust who had given them to him to eat Thompson in continuation On the fourth examination Ellis admitted that he gave me the two coats to sell for him - I have been in the habit of going to his house several times they have bought upwards of 5l worth of hardware and cutlery of me and said they should want more - I called at the house for that purpose Gast s Defence written My Lord and Gentlemen - I have very little to say in answer to this charge in which it seems I am supposed to be implicated because Ellis is my son-in-law having an apartment in my house that he had so I do not deny but I had no knowledge of any property being there that did not belong to himself much less any that had been improperly come by and when it is considered that three small pieces of black cloth and those lying on the drawers are all that were found in that apartment or in any other part of my house I rely that yourLordship and the Jury will readily conceive that I had no knowledge of the transaction that has been discovered I have not had the slightest participation in any portion of it or any of the property stolen and I trust a tradesman like myself who has borne all his life a good character will not be found guilty of any crime upon such evidence only as applies to me in this case JOSEPH RUMMENS I know the prisoner Coy -

he came home as soon as he got at liberty and I will answer for every hour of his conduct since I can give an account of wherever he has been during that fortnight at night and for the day also because he never went out except he went on business for me or that we knew where he did go when we sent him any where we knew where we had sent him and when he returned he accounted for the time he had been gone Q Who was in the house besides yourself your mother and brother A A young person who was at work for me - her name is Emma Adams she is a stay-maker - that is my business she slept up stairs in the back attic - there were a great number of other people in the house but they knew nothing of our affairs when my brother came in that night my mother and Emma Adams were in the room - I was at work making stays but put it down to let him in my mother was not doing any thing - she is sixty-one years old Adams was at work in the same room Q Well you said when first examined that the prisoner must necessarily go through your room to another - now you tell us that he slept in the same room A So he must go through the room I sleep in Q Why he slept in it A Yes and of course he must come through it to go out the beds were in the room we sleep in - we have only one room on that floor my mother and I slept in one bed - the prisoner came in at eleven o clock that night he had gone out about four - I did not go with him I only know where he went by what he told me he told me he had been to the New-cut and I had sent him to the New-cut to buy some steels - I gave him half a sovereign to buy them with and he returned without them I asked for the money - he told me he had given it for a pair of shoes which I scolded him for I had supped when he came back and so had the rest of us- we seldom take supper but I took a crust of bread and butter that night my mother took no supper nor Adams either - my brother most likely went to bed without supper for he is in the habit of doing so I cannot tell whether he had any I was minding my work - if he had supper he did not lay a cloth for it he breakfasted with us next morning and was made a prisoner at ten o clock in the room - I was in the act of scolding him for buying the shoes when the officers came I do not know what sort they were - I only saw them on his feet Q Were they shoes or boots A They were up to his ancles I believe ANN CLIFFORD I am the mother of the last witness and of the prisoner - we live in Cirencester-place The prisoner had lived with us for about a fortnight before the officer took him - I live with my daughter I recollect the circumstance of my son being taken I heard of Mr Chamber s robbery - my son came home on that night Wednesday as near as I can say between the hours of ten and eleven o clock because after eleven there is no admittance to the house without making a greatnoise with the bells - every person answers their own bell I recollect his coming home - he slept in the same room with us we made a convenience to have him sleep in the same room with my daughter and me - he went to bed and did not leave the house till after breakfast the next morning I cannot say the hour but it was after breakfast - I have not the least reason to suppose that he left the house from the time he went to bed till after breakfast COURT Q How long had the prisoner been living in that house A It might be about a fortnight over or under - we were not long there ourselves we were there before he came - we moved in I think on the 17th of November I and my daughter moved there - Emma Adams is in the habit of coming occasionally to assist my daughter - she does not live with us my son slept in the same room with me and my daughter every night during the fortnight - I would not permit him to have a lodging till we all removed together when my daughter had work to do in a hurry Adams would stay perhaps all night to be ready in the morning - when she staid she continued at her work she has not slept there since we have been in that house - she often did at the other house Q Then she staid and worked during the night A Yes my daughter was pressed for work at this time but Adams did not stay there the whole night I went to bed and left her at work - she never slept in that house to my knowledge there are three or four different families live in this house but none of my family but myself and daughter have any apartment there - we rent but one room and pay 3s 6d a week for that one room and for a few old things being in the kitchen my daughter went down to let my son in that night and so did I - I heard the bell ring and did not know she was gone before me I saw him come in and saw him go to bed - I never have any supper I do not know whether the others had - I believe they had a cup of tea in the dead of the night to keep their eyes open my son had no supper for he went to bed before me - I left the girls at work he did not get up early next morning just in time to have breakfast we breakfast between nine and ten o clock Q You say he came in between ten and eleven o clock how long had he been absent A I really cannot say I believe it was after tea that he went out - he drank tea with us about five o clock went out after tea and was absent during the rest of the time he was at home all the morning I believe but I am out and in on my daughter s business - I was at home all Wednesday morning and so was he he was not out in the fore part of the day at all EMMA ADAMS I am a stay-maker I know Mrs Clifford her daughter and the prisoner - they live in Cirencester-place I heard of a robbery at Mr Chambers the beginning of this month - I remember the prisoner Clifford being taken up on the Friday I have come to speak of what occurred on the Wednesday night - I was at Mrs Clifford s all day on Wednesday I am acquainted with Miss Clifford - we worked in the same shop for two years I recollect the prisoner coming home that night - I cannot say at what time exactly Q About what time A Between eight and nine o clock - he had been out once or twice during the day he came home between eight and nine or I think not so late- it was about eight I do not recollect his going to bed that night - I staid there till it turned twelve o clock and left him in the room I left him up I am sure of that - it had turned twelve o clock I had to go home as far as Little Chesterfield-street and it was near one when I got home COURT Q Had you been there much for some time before A Yes working for Miss Clifford - I had been there for the last month but not regularly every day because I work for a shop I always go home to my lodgings - sometimes I go about eleven o clock sometimes twelve I frequently staid late as when I went to her it was always in a great hurry and I always staid till the work was finished - I always went home I had seen the prisoner for a fortnight before when I was there there were two beds in the room but only one bedstead - the other bed was piled upon chairs the bedstead was a shut up one - he was out once or twice during the day Q How long do you think he had been out when he came back in the evening A He did not go out till after tea - we drank tea between five and six o clock he came home about eight - I did not hear him say where he had been Q You did not know where he was going A I believe I heard his sister send him to her other sister Mrs Davies in Chapel-street Soho to borrow some money I think - I did not see any money given him by his mother or sister Mrs Clifford was up when I went away - that was about twenty minutes after twelve o clock the prisoner was up and so was Miss Clifford MR CHAMBERS I have looked at the whole of the property produced to-day and have not the least doubt of its being all mine - one piece of the kerseymere I cannot swear to but I believe it to be mine every one of the others have something which I can swear to them by MR BARRY Q Have you any private-mark on the broad cloth A I have the headings attached to which is the list and that corresponds neither of the blue cloths are of the best quality - one cost me 17s 6d a yard and the other 21s 6d DAVID WEBSTER I know these to be the boots I purchased - I can speak to them positively I know them by a stitch dropped in the left boot and the cut here MR BARRY Q You had worn them but one day A Only one day - the stitch was dropped when I bought them MARY ANN STANFORD I noticed two or three stitches on the side of the boot being dropped and this boot is so The articles produced were a sort of half-boot described by some of the witnesses as shoes WILLIAM BALLARD When Clifford stated that he gave 10s for the shoes I asked who gave him the money and he said his mother gave it to him MR BARRY Q Did you state this to the Magistrate A I stated it to the clerk - it was not read over in my deposition I should not have thought of it if I had not heard the witness make her statement Prisoner Clifford It was said at Marlborough-street that the articles stolen were hawked about for sale at different public-houses and is it not as likely that I should have bought them at the Three Compasses as at any other place I did not say I bought them in the skittle-ground it is false the shoes it is said are too large for me and have marks of being worn by a person with corns or bunions - I should wish the Jury to examine the shoes I have on now I have worn them a fortnight Mr Chambers employs a great many men and they I believe are in the habit of wearing slippers - might not the shoes have been left behind by some of them Four witnesses gave Coy a good character and twenty-two deposed the same for Gast ELLIS -

I left the doors locked and went next door where some of my family live and about a quarter-past seven I sent my youngest sister into the house at the back door for some linen - I did not see her go in but in about four minutes she came back without the linen and alarmed me I immediately went to the house - I entered at the back door which was shut but not fastened I had not locked it but only shut it with a latch - I am not sure it was latched - I found it ajar when I came back on entering I saw three men coming down stairs - I was alone and had no light they had a lighted candle - I immediately collared the first who came down stairs which was Frayne I was immediately struck on the left arm with some instrument by the prisoner King who was the other man - the blow fell rather heavy I cannot say what instrument it was - it appeared in the shape of a hammer King had the light and threw it down - I have no knowledge of the other man - on receiving the blow I let go of Frayne I took hold of him again and then received another blow from King with the same instrument on the right arm - I let go of Frayne again but finding myself getting weak I called for help - they had then come down to the passage this all happened in the passage - the front door was shut I was between the back door and them - they could not get to it without passing me my mother came and she was immediately pushed against the side of the wall and by the push and her fright she fell - Frayne then laid hold of me pressed me against the front door and the other man laid hold of my mother King immediately unbolted and unlocked the front door and they all three ran away - I examined the ground floor room found the drawers had been taken out and missed all the articles stated in the indictment enumerating them - nothing was taken from the other rooms the clothes were taken off the bed and the things pulled about - the bed-room is on the ground floor I saw my property at the office in possession of Thompson Frayne Q Did you see me come down stairs A Yes you were the first who came down THOMAS HENRY THOMPSON I am a Policeman The prisoner King passed me on Sunday night the 6th of February near half-past six o clock - I was standing at the corner of Earl-street and Salisbury-street Lissongrove about half a mile from Edgcomb s - he passed me two or three yards I called him back knowing him and asked what he had got about him his appearance did not indicate that he had any thing - he said it was all right I put my hand into his trousers pocket and felt a small crow-bar called a jemmy which I have here - I took him to the station he unbuttoned his clothes as he went along- I suspected it was to slip out of his coat and told him to button them up he said I am not going to run away at the station-house I searched him further and in the same pocket as the crow-bar I found six tea-spoons two table-spoons a silver watch two salt-spoons a pencilcase two rows of beads a sovereign-balance two seals and a watch-key these were all in that pocket and on his back I found this black coat a black waistcoat and the front of an under waistcoat - he had them on over his own clothes he had two coats and two waistcoats besides his own - I found a black and a yellow silk handkerchief in his hat the black one had a pad in it - I also found a toothpick and a shirt pin I asked how he came in possession of the property he said he had picked it up - I took a hat from him which belonged to Edgcomb - on the following morning I took him some tea down to his cell he asked if I had found an owner - I told him I had and I was sorry to find it was so bad against him when he got to Marylebone-office a constable was there with two hats which had been left behind in Edgcomb s house - he is not here I received a hat from that constable and knowing King wore such a hat I presented it to him and said King take your hat and give me that you have on which he did - he gave me Edgcomb s hat and took the one I presented to him I do not know whether he heard the conversation between me and the constable about the hat - after I took King I went to different stations to find out where the robbery had been committed I was directed to the prosecutor s and in consequence of information I went to the Sun in Lisson-street about half-past ten o clock on the night of the robbery and saw Frayne with two others sitting in one of the boxes I did not then suspect him and did not take him - he was afterwards taken by Webster King The hat he gave me did not belong to me - he took the other off my head and said it belonged to another man Witness I gave him his hat and he gave me the other in return HENRY EDGCOMB re-examined When I came to examine the house I found they had entered it at the front for I locked the front door myself when I went away but did not bolt it the bolts being inside I went out at the back door - I am positive I did not bolt the front door but when I came into the house I found it was bolted I saw King make towards the door but whether he unbolted it I cannot say I had gone to it and found it bolted - then they seized me and I saw them remove the bolts top and bottom I heard the bolts drawn back - all these things are mine and what I lost that night the scuffle continued about ten minutes - I am positive the prisoners are two of the men my mother did not bring a light when she came- it was on Sunday PHILIP WEBSTER I apprehended Frayne at the Sun Lisson-street Frayne He said he had a charge against me for house-breaking on Sunday evening I said I knew nothing about it that I was in bed - I got up and washed myself at eight o clock and came out Witness He said he was not well and that he went to bed at eight not that he got up at eight - he denied the robbery JANE PRATT I am the wife of William Pratt and live next door to Edgcomb On the Sunday night on which the house was robbed I was standing at my door at four o clock in the afternoon and saw King pass with two others who I do not know King s Defence All I have to say is this young man at my side is innocent - he is taken for the wrong man I throw myself on the mercy of the Court JURY to MR EDGCOMB Q In what part of the passage did you first see Frayne A He had one foot on the stairs and the other on the floor King threw the candle down but it did not go out PRUDENCE FRAYNE I live at No 19 Queen-street Edgware-road -

I occupied the first and second floors the ground floor was under repair and was to be occupied by Messrs Toplis and Son - I enter by the front door from which there is no direct communication with Mr Toplis premises there is by a back stair case - I believe Mr Toplis Sen Mr Toplis Jun and their families reside there I have seen them and had communication with them COURT Q Do you know whether the Messrs Toplis sleep there or any of their family A I believe they do but I do not know it certainly - I have been repeatedly in their premises I had not seen any part of the premises fitted up as a dwelling-house - I had a servant slept in my part of the premises On Saturday evening the 9th of April between seven and eight o clock I went abruptly out of the premises and saw two persons looking up and watching the premises attentively - on seeing me they instantly turned and walked away that circumstance induced me to give some directions - I believe one of those persons was Phipps the prisoner Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Do I understand you rightly that you hire part of a house of Messrs Toplis A Yes the house is theirs what I hire is a lodging for the convenience of business - I pay no taxes nor am I recognized as holder of the house at all it is a private-contract between Messrs Toplis and me there is a communication from my premises to theirs Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You saw two persons as you thought looking attentively up at the house A Yes -

another youngman had slept there but left early in the morning I left no one there when I went out - I left all secure I returned about half-past one o clock and opened the door with the key I heard a noise which appeared to proceed from the first floor - I went and got assistance at the next house I just pulled the door too - the other door joins it within a quarter of a yard I got the assistance of James Gunnis and Hamnett Hill - we returned to the house opened the door and went in I met johnson the prisoner coming towards me within perhaps a yards of the door he asked me if Mr Williams lived there - I gave him no answer but seized him by the collar as he attempted to go out and so did Hill he struggled desperately but I did not leave his collar till Speechley and Rawlinson the officers came which I think was near a quarter of an hour - I accompanied them in taking him to the Compter leaving Smith and subsequently Willmott to mind the premises Gunnis stood by the door -Hill had hold of Johnson at first but when others came up he went for an officer after I had been to the Compter I went on the premises - I found a number of articles strewed on the first floor a crow-bar on the middle of the floor and this black bag with this one hundred and fourteen yards of silk this cambric this lawn and these Indian trinkets which are the property of Mr Maynard - they are worth 16l and had before been safely placed among Mr Maynard s property this bag is not Mr Maynard s - the door of the first floor had been forced open and there was a cash-box on the floor which had been broken open the premises are in the parish of St Gregory by St Paul s Cross-examined by MR HEATON Q Had you made any noise before you saw Johnson A No other than opening the door - not more than a minute had elapsed before I went back to the house I know no person of the name of Williams lived there because Mr Maynard had the entire of that house and Mr Toplis had the premises adjoining - there is a communication between them I had seen part of this property safe immediately before I went out - I am quite sure this same silk was on a table I was out from between ten and eleven o clock till half-past one MR BODKIN Q What was found on Johnson A Two skeleton-keys and a phosphorus-box HAMNETT HILL I am an apprentice to Mr Hurlock in St Paul s church-yard I went with Gunnis to the house and saw Johnson coming down stairs - he asked if Mr Williams lived there and made a rush to the door I laid hold of one said of his collar and Charlesworth the other - he dragged us out and got us twenty or thirty yards to the west and while he did that I believe the other prisoners got down he did not strike us but strugglad very much Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q He offered no violence A No he merely struggled to get away THOMAS RAWLINSON I am a City-officer On Sunday the 10th of April I was called to St Paul s church-yard - several persons had hold of Johnson and he was given to my care - seeing I was an officer he said he would go with me Speechley came up to my assistance as we were going along Warwick-lane to the Compter Johnson said It is no difference to you I will give you a sovereign a piece to let me go I said We don t do business in that way he then said as we went past the Three Jolly Butchers Let me have some beer I said he should have some at the Compter - he seemed to know what beer he should have there and he made a rush but we took him to the Compter I found on him three skeleton-keys two centre-pieces and a phosphorus-box JOHN SPEECHILEY I came up to the assistance of Rawlinson and took Johnson - what he has stated is correct he offered us two sovereigns to let him go - we took him to the Compter WILLIAM SMITH I am in the employ of Mr Benjamin Munday a tea-dealer in Old Broad-street I was in St Paul s Church-yard on the 10th of April about twenty minutes to two o clock - I was desired to look to Mr Maynard s premises but I did not see any persons come out Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you watch closely A Yes for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - then the witnesses and the officers returned and I went into the premises with them - I had seen no one come out and when I went in no one was there THOMAS WALTERS I live at No 96 Watling-street I was going up towards St Paul s church-yard I heard a hue and cry and went forward - I saw Phipps and he was taken at the corner of St Paul s church-yard I followed Williams and saw him brought out of Paternoster-row by a gentleman who said I have brought the prisoner the gentleman then let him go - I followed him and saw him taken by Pocklington when I first saw Phipps he ran past the end of Watling-street into St Paul s church-yard Williams was with him - they were both running I saw they were pursued but there was no person running before them - I was going towards them and if I had been soon enough I should have met them Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did one of the prisoners appear to be pursuing the other A They were so near that I could not tell they were not on the same side of the street - I only noticed one person pursuing them and he ran nearly in the centre of the street he was some distance behind them crying Stop thief he was after those two persons - it is rather a populous place but there were not persons about at that time it was about half-past one o clock - I have sometimes walked along there and not met more than two persons the moment Phipps was taken I ran on with the intention of pursuing Williams - a strange gentleman brought him back as far as Butler s the chemist and then let him go I did not lose sight of him after he was taken - I walked behind him any person might have taken hold of him MR BODKIN Q How far did he walk A From Butler s to St Paul s school and then he was taken - I walked behind to prevent his escaping I saw Phipps taken COURT Q Was Phipps one of the persons you saw A Yes he came in a direction from Mr Maynard s about seventy or eighty yards from it - Williams and him were both running JAMES GUNNIS I am in the employ of Mr Hurlock I was fetched by Mr Charlesworth - I stood at Mr Maynard s private door and saw Williams and Phipps come out I had not been there a minute scarcely when they came - I think Williams came out first they went towards Watling-street and one of them was going down Watling-street but a gentleman held up his umbrella and he turnedtowards Cheapside - I saw Phipps taken I never lost sight of him they both ran and I pursued about five yards behind them - after Phipps was stopped I followed Williams and was about three yards behind him when he was stopped in Paternoster-row - I had only lost sight of him for a moment as he turned the corner a gentleman stopped him brought him back and then went away - I followed him as far as Mr Newberry s door where he was taken Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Where was Phipps taken A By Mr Butler s door I kept on after Williams - I saw no one pursuing them but myself I was in the middle of the road -

I do not know whether any body else was in the shop - I called Mr Allnutt s attention to the window and ran off directly without waiting to see him examine it - I did not examine so minutely being in a hurry to cross after the prisoner I think I should know the one who crossed with the prisoner HENRY HARRIS I am a serjeant of the Police On the 28th of September about half-past ten o clock at night I saw the prisoner and another man in company with two females in Whitcomb-street St James - they were standing under a gas-lamp all looking at a pair of ivory boot-hooks when they saw me they all walked away together - I followed them to the bottom of Whitcomb-street the prisoner and one of the females crossed towards Charing-cross I lost sight of the others I met Stone a Policeman and we followed them into Parliament-street there stopped the prisoner and asked if he had any boot-hooks - he said Yes he pulled a pair out of his coat pocket - it was not the pair I had seen in his hand I told Stone to search him - he found two more pair in his coat pocket I asked how he came by them - he said he was the manufacturer of them and afterwards said he was a dealer in the article and afterwards that he was an ivory-turner we took him to Gardener s-lane station and searched but found nothing more on him we then took him to the station in Vine-street and in the morning found Mr Allnutt s window had been cut Cross-examined Q You have told us all that passed A Yes Stone was present - he said at last when I got him to the station that he bought them at the Black Horse public-house of a person who was a manufacturer and dealer - I do not recollect his desiring me at first to take him to the Black Horse to find the man - I will not swear he did not we passed the Black Horse with him I walked a dozen yards behind with the female I did not refuse to let him go in - I took him to the nearest station - the inspector did not refuse to take the charge but as Stone said a window was cut in Piccadilly he said he thought we had better take him to a nearer station Q On your oath did he not produce all the boot-hooks to you A I cannot say for Stone searched him he produced one pair which I saw - I turned aside to the female while Stone was searching he did not produce the whole pair at once - it was a black pair GEORGE STONE I am a Policeman About a quarter to eleven o clock on this night I was in Parliament-street and saw the prisoner the serjeant had given me information - I asked the prisoner if he had any boot-hooks about him he said he had - I asked him to let me look at them he pulled one pair out of his coat pocket I then felt his pockets and said Have not you got some more here he said Yes I have and pulled out another pair with a white handle - I asked if he had any more he made no answer I felt his coat pocket again and another pair rattled - I said Let me look at all you have about you for I shall be sure to find them and then he pulled out another pair - I asked where he got them he said he was the manufacturer and hawked them round at different places then he said he was an ivory-turner and made them himself we took him to the station in Gardener s-lane and afterwards to Vine-street - when he got there he said he had bought them of a man at the Black Horse in the Haymarket I asked if he should know the man if he saw him again he said No he should not he was an entire stranger to him and he never saw him before in his life I asked if he bought them in the tap-room or the bar he said No just outside the door Cross-examined Q Have you heard Harris examined A Yes he is not my serjeant - I stated thisconversation before the Magistrate I am sure it was at the station that he said he bought them at the Black Horse - he never asked to go to the Black Horse I told him to come with me and point out the man I offered to go with him - he said he did not know the man he was a perfect stranger I will not be certain whether I told the Magistrate this the boot-hooks were all in one pocket - when I asked if he had such things he produced them I took them from his hand I walked to the station with him - there was nobody else with us he never said he could point out the person at the Black Horse THOMAS SMART I am foreman to Mr Allnutt of Piccadilly On the night in question I left the shop at seven o clock all the windows were safe then and none broken - when I came to the shop at eight in the morning I found a corner pane of glass broken and these three pairs of boothooks which had hung in a corner close to the square when I left were gone - those produced are the same I know them all by a private mark on them Cross-examined Q Before you missed them had you been told they were lost A No I had hung them there myself the glass was broken right across the centre and a hole made sufficient to put a hand in and get them - we have a lamp in the shop near the window every night the hole could easily be seen outside - it depends on how a person looks the dwelling-house is Mr Allnutt s the property belongs to William Allnutt and his son who is his partner - the house belongs to the father I do not know whether the rent is paid by the firm - the father sometimes lives at Hammersmith and sometimes in town the son s name is Henry the father and his family sleep at Hammersmith -

the goods in the shop were scattered in all directions many silk rollers were lying about the silks had been taken off them - I missed from twenty tothirty pieces of silk - I missed two wrappers of shawls worth 60l or 70l and a whole box of lace worth about 100l or 140l the whole loss we estimate at 400l and upwards - my desk in my shop was broken open I lost nine papers of halfpence from that desk containing 5s worth each and each paper was marked with a figure of 5s - the iron chest in the shop was safe there had been an attempt made on it certainly but it had not succeeded - I found a chisel very near the iron chest it did not belong to me and a bunch of keys which had been taken out of my desk they were in the desk the night before - I have a cupboard in my breakfast parlour and from that was taken twelve or fourteen silver spoons - I missed some cigars and a variety of other things - I observed something very indecent had been transacted in the house - there was an imitation of a lighted cigar taken - I went into the kitchen and found part of the pannel of the door cut out the aperture enabled a person to put his hand through and undraw the bolt the door was open - the pannel was cut out of the cellar-door which was open and a small window at the back of the house had the glass taken out and the cross-bar and two squares of glass were taken out a person could get through there into the house - I tried it myself - my house was safe when I went to bed - Willis s father keeps some stables at the back of my house he goes by the name of Hutton there these stables are about four or five hundred yards from the back of my house - I saw the chisel applied to the door by Attfield it corresponded with the marks exactly - when Johnson was taken we found two chisels in his room they were applied and fitted exactly the impressions where the places were broken open one chisel had a small piece broken out of the corner and the space was wanted in almost every mark - Brock afterwards showed me a piece of silk and Prendergrass produced a piece to me - I went into Newgate soon after Willis was taken into custody - it is about two months ago - I found the female prisoner in Newgate and Willis too - the female prisoner had a light puce silk dress on I considered the silk the dress was made of mine I had one a similar colour and a short length of it and from the appearance of it I considered it mine VALENTINE BULLER I am shopman to Mr Goodman and live in the house On Sunday morning the 21st of April I was called up about five o clock and went through the premises - I observed the place broken open and the property removed - I afterwards went to the stables of Hutton Willis s father and could see there the traces of a cart or narrow wheeled chaise from Hutton s stables into the street and pursuing the track of the wheels I found a piece of lace which I believe to be Mr Goodman s there is a mark in pencil of the length of the lace it is one of our shop marks but not made by myself - I have seen Willis before at Uxbridge in company with his father and believed him to be the son of that man Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q When did you track the wheels A On the 21st of April the morning the robbery was discovered - the constable James Darvill went with me - the stables are four or five hundred yards from the house Q Do you go along the highway to them A No it is a sort of enclosed yard belonging to three houses - it was a dewy morning the grass was wet with dew - it was not market morning it was Sunday - I had not looked at the same place the night before - I should judge from the appearance of the grass that the tracks had been just made the dew appeared to have been brushed off - it was a narrow wheel JAMES DARVILL I am a constable of Uxbridge On Sunday morning the 21st of April I was called up in consequence of a robbery and went to Mr Goodman s house - I observed the track of a wheel leading from the High-street down to the stables in the direction it would come from Mr Goodman s house - I traced it down to Hutton s stables the track was quite visible - I thought Hutton s horse had been stolen from there and called his man up it was a fresh track the dew was brushed off - I received from Buller a chisel and some lace MARTIN SPENCELEY I am a groom I was in the employ of Mr Batty of Uxbridge - in April last I slept in Mr Hutton s stables - I know Willis Hutton passed as his father - I was sleeping in the saddle-room on the night of the 20th of April Mr Hutton gave me leave to sleep there - I knew Johnson before I never saw Johnson in Uxbridge before but Willis had lived there with his father - while I was in the saddle-room I saw Willis he awoke me by tapping at the saddle-room window he asked me where the keys of the gates were I said they hung up on a nail near the door Willis then came in and said Johnson has come down and we have brought a horse and cart I said Have you he said Yes and they brought the horse and cart into the yard turned the horse out and brought the horse into the stable there was only one horse in the cart I don t exactly know what sort of a cart it was it was a light cart there had been no other cart up the yard that morning not to my knowledge - Johnson and he both came in the stables Willis instantly got a light he got it in about a moment I don t know how he got it he got it from something he brought with him there was no tinder-box there - Johnson lit his pipe and Willis told me in Johnson s hearing that they were going to crack a bl-y crib - I don t know what that meant but fancy it meant to break into a house - Willis fed the horse with oats - they went away in about twenty minutes - I cannot say at what hour I was awoke I had not a watch but imagine it was near four o clock when they went away they came at near one o clock I suppose - they came back I did not see whether they brought anything with them - when they went away about four o clock they took the horse out of the stables put it in the cart and went away - I was in bed but I could hear them do that and about half-past five o clock I heard of Mr Goodman s house being robbed - the constable came down into the yard about five o clock I got up and dressed myself - I saw nothing found - I did not see the prisoners when they came back but I heard them stirring about as if in a great hurry - the horse according to what I could see as I lay in bed was a chesnut horse about 14 hands 2 inches as near as I can guess Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q You were lying in bed and the horse in the yard A No the horse was in the stables there was no stall in the stables he was standing by a rail - I thought it was a dark chesnut almost a brown - I did not understand what they meantwhen they said they were going to break a b-y crib - I rather judged it was to break into somebody s house - I have had nothing to do in that way myself - I remember living in Northumberland - I was never charged with robbing any body there - I did not live at a public-house - I was never charged with robbing my master nor any body else - I was never taken into custody till I was taken on this and then I could not find bail - I was fetched from Cambridge by Mr Goodman and an officer - I was taken into custody then and brought on this charge I told this story after that I had not told a word about it before I was taken into custody I never told it except to one man named Maddox - he is not a particular friend of mine he was a friend and he was not he lived with Mr Hutton at that time - he lets out flys and horses and gigs - I know where Mr Goodman lived - I heard of the robbery about half-past five o clock - I went to Cambridge soon after Epsom races about two months after the robbery I staid at Uxbridge until Epsom races that was about three weeks - I knew where the prosecutor lived but did not give an alarm I might have got 20l if I had gone near him but I had no hand in it and did not wish to make a disturbance there was 20l reward offered it is not offered still that I know off I have not the least notion of getting any part of it now - I was out of place when I left Uxbridge I went to Epsom and got a place with an old master who I had lived nine years with and staid with him till Mr Goodman fetched me away I went with my old master to Cambridge his name is Edwards he is a gentleman jockey - I did not bring seventy sovereigns from Epsom my pockets were very clear when I returned from Epsom I did not show any body seventy sovereigns and say I had made a good thing of it there nor did I show any money Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Is there not a reward still offered for the robbery A I don t know I know there was a reward before I left Uxbridge and I suppose it will remain - I don t expect to get any portion of it I never said I had made a good job or good thing at Uxbridge I remember being at the Ben Johnson in Shoe-lane - I never said there that I had made a good thing at Uxbridge and had been to Epsom races I made nothing at Uxbridge but what I earned by hard work I worked for Mr Batty that was the only thing I made money by there I was never charged with robbery at Newcastle I lived with Lord Kelburn in Scotland - I was never charged with committing robbery there I know a man named George - I did not go with him to Scotland I went with him to Yorkshire I was never charged with robbing his mother - I don t know whether he was I never knew George charged with robbery while I was with him there are several George s - none of them were charged with robbery while I was with them I saw the tracks of the wheels there were two tracks I looked at them in the morning as a good many people were looking at them the cart was in the yard and I was in the stable in bed I could not see the cart from my bed - I saw it once - I stood by the stable door then I was in bed before they came with the cart I got up to shut the gates and saw them going out they had not got quite out there were only two tracks on the ground the cart only had two wheels - I saw the prisoners plainer than I saw the horse MR ADOLPHUS Q It has been said you said nothing about this what was your reason A Because I was rather under obligations to Hutton not being in regular service he gave me leave to sleep in the saddle room I did not wish to make any disturbance as I had no hand in the robbery I thought they would find it out soon enough - I mean that I saw only the marks of two cart wheels JOSEPH JESSOP I am a carpenter and live at No 3 Charles-street Commercial-road Whitechapel Willis and the female prisoner lodged in my house as man and wife they lodged with me six or seven weeks on Sunday the 21st of April about half-past seven o clock in the morning I heard a horse and cart drive up to my door I took my little boy and went to my door and saw Willis and Johnson in the cart Willis got out and went up stairs and left Johnson in the cart I saw Willis come down and Johnson handed him a large parcel wrapped in brown wrapper Willis took it up stairs came down and took a second parcel he took them from out of the underneath part of the cart below the seat I walked away into my back parlour and heard one of the prisoners go up stairs twice I returned again to the door and Johnson said to Willis I think that is all he said No there is a small parcel which he gave to Willis who went up stairs it appeared to me to be five shilling papers of coppers tied up I walked away from the door they both went up to the room and in five or ten minutes Willis came down and drove away with the horse and cart the horse appeared to be driven very hard and it was very hot Willis returned in ten or twelve minutes and knocked at my back parlour door and paid his rent with five shillings worth of copper his rent was 3s 6d I asked him to take the change he said his wife should come down and take it there was a figure of five on the brown paper I untied the parcel of halfpence and put the eighteen pence out the female prisoner came down and fetched it Johnson dined with them that day and stopped all day until towards evening I am not a judge of horses but it appeared a chesnut horse with a white face and white foot Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Did you know that he came to your house from Tooting where they lived before A No I don t know where they lived but they told me they came from Uxbridge the halfpence were tied in a handkerchief but it appeared papers of copper I looked at the paper they paid me that had a figure of five on it - I looked particularly at it that was all that was on it I am sure it is very common to make halfpence up in five shilling parcels they saw me standing at the door and must have known that I saw what they were doing they continued to lodge in my house for four or five weeks after Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Have you ever said you would do all you could to convict the prisoners A Not to the best of my knowledge it is possible I might have forgotten saying such a thing I did not say I should like to hang the whole lot - on my oath I did not I never said anything at all like it - I will take my oath to the best of my knowledge that I never said I would do all I could to convict the prisoners I can only swear to the best of my knowledge if I ever said so respecting anyone of them I have forgotten it - I don t recollect it I believe I never did - I never had any quarrel with them HARRIET JESSOP I am the wife of Joseph Jessup Willis and the female prisoner lodged at our house I remember Willis and Johnson coming to the house on the morning of the 21st of April in a little chaise cart it had a lightish horse I saw them take two or three large parcels out of the cart wrapped in brown wrappers - I saw nothing else taken out they owed us one week s rent - I had not asked for it it was only due on the Saturday Willis brought the five shilling paper of halfpence to the back parlour door wrapped in a brown paper and it was marked with a figure of five with a long mark after it I burnt the paper in about two or three hours the female prisoner brought me several little bits of lace down and gave to me - I gave them up to the officer I am a dress maker on the Wednesday she brought me down two pieces of silk a piece of puce-coloured silk measuring eight and a half yards and a piece of lavender-coloured silk about forty yards I made her a gown of the pucecoloured silk and made a dress and bonnet of the lavender-coloured silk and returned her the remainder I think twenty-two or twenty-three yards were returned to her because she cut two or three little pieces off herself to make a bag of she gave me a yards and a half of the lavender-coloured silk afterwards I made up nothing else for her she never paid me money I considered the pieces of lace sufficient to pay me for making the puce-coloured gown and she gave me a yard and a-half of silk for making the lavender-coloured and a little bit more I saw in her possession a very handsome shawl and four very handsome handkerchiefs the shawl had a handsome green middle with a reddish border - the handkerchiefs were French colour I don t know what you call them some of them were figured - I gave her a shilling for a scarf and made her a bonnet for it besides all the things I had from her were delivered to the officer I sold the yard and a half of silk to Mrs Allen - I cut off a little bit to make it a yard and a half - On Saturday evening Willis and James went out together nobody was with them the woman returned about nine o clock as near as I can guess she came and sat in my back parlour and told me she had been as far as Charing-cross with her husband and that he was gone to Uxbridge to fetch their things home when they took my apartments they said they came from Uxbridge - they said they had been lodging at Uxbridge they brought nothing with them but what they had on their backs Johnson was in the house all day on Sunday and dined with them - I did not see any of the goods at that time Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q You always considered the woman Willis s wife A I did I never knew otherwise these transactions were all done while they were living together I don t know the value of the scarf here it is it is a gauze one soon after they came to lodge with me I remember their getting some goods from a tally shop I did not recommend them to the shop particularly Mrs Willis knew very well where the shop was I went with her to the tally shop and she procured some goods there a tally shop is where you pay so much a week for goods I did not advise them to go away and leave the tally man without paying for the goods I had not a word with them about going away - I had no idea they were going away I don t know what amount of goods they had from the tally shop - I don t know what the bill was they had the goods from the tally shop about a week before they left COURT Q That was after the 21st of April A Yes they had been but three weeks with me on the 21st of April MR BODKIN Q Had they any goods from the tally shop before that Sunday A Not to my knowledge I had not been with them to the tally shop before that ELIZABETH ALLEN I am a single woman and live at No 3 Charles-street in the house of Mr Jesop I purchased of Mrs Jessop a yard and a half of silk this is it I am certain - I gave it up to the officer THOMAS BAGLEY I live at the corner of the street in which Mr Jessop lives On the morning of the 21st of April I saw the two male prisoners in the street and a cart they stopped at Mr Jessop s house I saw a time-piece hauded out and carried into the house by one of them he took it out of the cart and took it in himself WILLIAM BROCK I am shopman to Mr Law pawnbroker No 1 Commercial-road On the 27th of April Willis pawned eighty-four yards of silk at our shop for £4 10s in the name of John Willis No 3 Charles-street I took it in I had seen him once or twice before and am quite certain he is the person on the Wednesday following Woodman came to the shop and brought the same duplicate as I had given to Willis and he Woodman took forty-two yards of the silk the remaining forty-two ramained in my custody I have it here - I am certain this is part of the eighty-four yards Willis pawned at the shop Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Did you know Willis before A Yes he gave me his own name and direction WILLIAM WOODMAN I am a jeweller and live in French-alley Goswell-street I bought a duplicate of Willis I gave him 1l for it - it was for eighty-four yards of silk pawned at Law s at the corner of the Commercial-road - I went there and took half the silk off and left half there I sold the half and pawned the half which I left for 2l 10s that produced appears to be the same Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q How long have you known Willis A About sixteen months - I have seen him at sales and have been with him at sales and have seen him buy silks and things at sales - I always considered him a man who dealt in such things I have seen Jessop several times - I went to Lambeth-street to give evidence but was not called and when I came outside the door he stood there with his wife and I presume his lodger - when I came out he was abusing the reporters for not inserting the robbery in the paper Q Did you hear Jessop say he would do anything A When I came out he said he should like to transport the whole lot and he should not be particular what he said in order to do it - he said that in my hearing my wife said Is that what you say - you cannot transport me - he said No I know I cannot transport you MR ADOLPHUS Q Did he mean to include you and your wife in the lot A I persume so I was perfectly sober and knew what he said - I think he is capable of saying anything SAMUEL PRENDERGRASS I am a constable of Lambeth-street On the 5th of June I apprehended the female prisoner and Willis in Newcastle-court Strand in a two-pair of stairs back room I searched the room - there was a chest of drawers in it and there I found two silk dresses this zephyr handkerchief a sham segar and a small piece of silk - I saw Willis pay 6s to a woman of the house he said it was for a week s rent - the house is a common brothel Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Do you know Jessop A Yes I did not hear him say any thing about what he would do MATTHEW NEWMAN I am a principal turnkey of Newgate The female prisoner was in my custody and was discharged at the Special Commission - when she was discharged I asked her for a gown which she had been in the habit of wearing - it was a puce-coloured silk gown she said she was turning it - I said Attfield the officer was waiting for it she said she would fetch it from her ward which she did and gave it me I gave it to Attfield - this is the gown it has my initials on it Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q How long had she been in prison A About three weeks she was not there on this charge it was on another charge of which she was tried and acquitted WILLIAM ATTFIELD I am a police officer of Worship-street On the 25th of June I apprehended Johnson at No 23 Harp-alley Farringdon-street I took him to the station-house in Black Horse-court and told him he was charged on suspicion of being concerned with others in breaking and entering the house of Mr Goodman at Uxbridge and stealing a quantity of silk plate and other articles - he said he was never at Uxbridge in his life and knew nothing about it I asked if he knew a man named Willis at No 3 Charles-street Commercial-road he said he knew him perfectly well and had been there a good many times - I found a phosphorus bottle in his pocket which I produce after finding that in his pocket I went back to the house in Harp-alley with Mr Goodman and in a back room on the second floor in a table drawer I found two chisels and a bunch of keys two of them are latch keys - when before the magistrate at the office the chisels were produced he said they were his chisels I took those chisels out of the same drawer as I found the keys in - on Thursday the 27th of June I went to Mr Goodman s at Uxbridge and examined the premises - I examined the inside of the cellar door I observed a mark where the staple was drawn and a mark about three inches under that I applied this large chisel to the marks on the cellar door it exactly fitted the indentations - one corner of the chisel had been broken and that corner was wanting in the impression and there was a notch in the chisel which corresponded - I have not a doubt that chisel was used for that purpose - I observed the kitchen door had part of a pannel taken out and there were two impressions there which I applied the chisel to and they corresponded - there was the deficiency in the corner of the chisel in one of those impressions - on the shop door leading from the passage there were two impressions apparently of the same chisels they fitted it I observed impressions on the cupboard I applied the smaller chisel to one of the impressions and it corresponded in every respect and the larger chisel corresponded with some of the impressions on the cupboard door as exact as possible and on a cupboard on the left hand side were impressions and both chisels fitted them - a large desk in the shop was broken open on which I found ten impressions of the large chisel several of them very clear and one impression of the smaller chisel - Newman gave me a puce coloured gown which I produce - on the 24th of June I received a zephyr scarf from Mr Jessop - I received a yard and a half of lavender coloured silk from Mrs Allen WILLIAM GOODMAN re-examined I can identify many of these things but can only positively swear to two of them - I lost such things as these I have a scarf exactly corresponding with this in my pocket and the silk has a mark on it I bought it at Morrison s this scarf I cannot swear to - this puce coloured gown which the female prisoner had on I can swear to by an ink mark on it which is the mark of my young man who is present - I have pattern prints here corresponding with all the silk and all the lace I identify them positively but have not a mark on them - I lost such things and have corresponding things remaining behind and I have marks on the other two MR BODKIN Q When you sell silk you do not rub off the private mark A I cannot it is in ink VALENTINE BULLER re-examined My mark is on this puce coloured gown and this puce coloured silk was marked by me also - I can see the figures 84 - the other things resemble goods we lost - I believe them to be my master s property - this imitation cigar I cannot say any thing about Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Let me look at the mark 84 - was this marked at your house or the manufactory A At our house - the manufacturer charged it as 82 yards - I marked and measured it and made it 84 - the manufacturer don t mark the length I mark all the goods that is not a fashionable colour particularly it is saleable - we only had this one piece of that colour the gown is a different colour we had eight yards and one-eighth of that and that is the mark on it - it was a remnant we had not sold it - we had had that some years being a short length it is about three years since we had the whole length - I had seen it a week or ten days before the robbery one or two other persons served in the shop besides my master - but the silk goods fall particularly under my department MR GOODMAN I had such a cigar as this and lost it Johnson s Defence I am quite innocent Sarah James s Defence I am quite innocent Margaret Sconser of Easton-street Spafields and Mary Grub gave the prisoner James a good character WILLIS -

I had a silver pepper-box I had left that one on the shelf and it was removed off to another Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q When you were going out did you try if the lock was fast or not A Yes I did and am sure I double-locked the door it is my dwelling-house some call it St George s Middlesex and some St George s-east - I am sure of that I have paid rates for a number of years JOHN GINGER I am a gold-beater and live at No 3 Upper Chapman-street On the 24th of November I was near the house No 5 standing within four or five yards of the house I saw four persons at the door whether the prisoner was one I cannot say there is a court leading into the street about half-a-dozen yards from the prosecutrix s house on the opposite side of the wasy - it is not quite opposite I saw the prisoner under that court at half-past seven o clock he was about six yards from the house we went under the court and found him standing there and took him the policeman my brother and I went up to him and asked why he was standing there he said he was waiting for a female the policeman said he must come to the station-house and we proceeded on very quietly till we came to the bridge over the London dock basin - my brother was close behind him talking to him he turned round to make a reply and put his hand over the rail of the bridge and dropped something into the water which made a great splash and directly opposite the station-house he pulled an iron jemmy out of his pocket and put it on the sill of a chandler s shop window I took it up and gave it to the policeman Clark the prosecutrix s daughter in-law came forward into the station-house as she went into the station-house the prisoner went towards her and said You are another one that has come to swear my life away that is all that passed in my presence Cross-examined Q How broad is the street A Half a stone s throw I think about four yards and a-half there is an arch over the court it was raining very hard at the time the arched court would protect the prisoner from the rain there were four men round the door - I am not certain the prisoner was not one of them - according to the best of my memory it was half-an-hour after seeing the four men that I saw the prisoner under the arch the court opened into the street - anybody passing up the street could see the prisoner if they looked there was no one else sheltering themselves at the time I did not observe Mrs Clark s door when the four men were round it - they appeared to surround the door a short man stood next to the door - I could see them by the gas-light I thought it not prudent to speak to them I saw the policemen about twenty minutes after seeing the four men my brother went to look for them it was half-an-hour from the time he first went till we took the prisoner out of the court I did not know any of the four men WILLIAM BUTLER policeman K 48 I was called to Upper Chapman-street on the night of the 24th of November I got there after seven o clock - I cannot say how much I saw the prisoner in the archway opposite the prosecutrix s house I asked what he was waiting there for he said he was waiting for a friend - a female I asked how long he had been there he said Not above five minutes I said he must go with me and I took him to the station-house on the road he threw something over the bridge in Old Gravel-lane I said he had thrown it away he laughed and said What will you do with me now I said Witnesses have seen you throw it away he told me not to name it to the magistrate that he had thrown anything away if I did it would be a doner for him - and he would give me a sovereign in the morning when his friends came I said I must do my duty I saw him lay something on the cill of a window Ginger took it off the cill - it was a jemmy that window is about fifteen or twenty yards from the station-house he said he knew nothing about it that I had laid it there to put a plant on him I took him into the station-house plant means I had put it there to convict him or something I afterwards took that instrument to the house No 5 Upper Chapman-street and examined the state of the door and premises and applied the jemmy to the marks there is one mark of the point of it on the door-post and of the shoulder on the door in a position which would enable a person to open the door as if the shoulder had rested to give force to the other part and the marks corresponded with the shoulder and point of the instrument exactly the impression was quite perfect as if it had been moulded in clay I can say positively it must have been done with this instrument or one exactly like it I only applied it to two places on the door where the latch was wrenched off the impression was fresh and strongly marked - I have no doubt that impression was made by this instrument Cross-examined Q If he had been one of the four men he could have got more than fifty times the length he was from the house in half-an-hour A No doubt of that I call this a very good instrument one of the same size would of course make the same marks Ginger was across the way when the prisoner offered me the sovereign he could not hear for the prisoner whispered it to me - he did not whisper about the plant Mrs Clark came to the station-house with me he asked if she was come to swear his life away the house is in the parish of St George s-in-the-east SARAH ANN CLARK I am the wife of George Clark the son of the prosecutrix I live at No 42 Richard-street Commercial-road on Tuesday evening the 19th of November I was in Walbeck-street one end of which leads into Upper Chapman-street I saw two men at the corner of Walbeck-street - I passed by them and walked on the opposite side of the way I looked over and saw a man at Mrs Clark s door I crossed over and asked him which was No 8 - I was afraid to ask him what he wanted there he turned himself round from the door keeping his hands behind him and said Further on further on the other side of the way there was a gas-light there I could see his face - I know it was the prisoner he was standing in the door-way of No 5 this was on the 19th of November I said to him No I think I am near it and I knocked at the next door to No 5 which is Mr Potter s and he walked away Mrs Potter came to the door with a candle in her hand I afterwards saw the same person pass in the street two or three times when the prisoner was in custody on the 24th of November I went to the station-house and he made a rush towards me and would have struck me but the policeman pushed him back again and he said Here is one I know now come to swear my life away I saw the jemmy applied to the door it agreed as if it had been moulded in a bit of clay Cross-examined Q You did not hear the policeman make that observation A No it was the Tuesday before the robbery I saw him which was on a Sunday I did not live with the prosecutrix the house is No 5 nothing happened to the house on the 19th of November the name of the parish is St George WILLIAM BUTLER The parish is always called St George s-in-the-east SARAH ANN CLARK re-examined I always heard the parish called St George s east the church is an old one MRS CLARK I have always heard it called St George east DANIEL RICHARD HAWKINS I am an officer of the court and a parish clerk of St Stephen s Coleman-street I know the parish is always returned in our bills of mortality as St George in the East Prisoner to SARAH ANN CLARK Q When you came to the station-house did not you state that I was the man you had seen at your mother s house and you knew me by the buttons shining on my coat A I never spoke to you at all - I did not say it was by the shining buttons I spoke to him - he rushed towards me and spoke himself - I said at the Thames police that he had shining buttons I did not give that as my reason for knowing him - when I saw him at the foot of the door I thought it might be the prosecutrix s son but when I saw his shining buttons I knew it could not be him and noticed him EDWARD GINGER I am the brother of John Ginger I was in Chapman-street on the 24th of November my father s house is only two doors from the prosecutrix s I saw the prisoner forcing the street door of Mrs Clark s house open I took no notice of him but proceeded on and two of the gang came running over we left there immediately went to a public-house and brought a witness out and consulted what was best to be done he advised me to go for an officer - I brought Butler and as we came back I pointed out three or four of the gang and on coming into Chapman-street I saw the prisoner down the court I took the policeman over and said that was the man who was at the door the officer asked what he did there he said he was waiting for a female the officer took him and in going to the station-house on the bridge he made a kind of a stop I thought he was going to strike one of us he hallooed out and threw something over the bridge which made a great splash he said What will you do with me now the officer took him on he said Do not you say what I threw over the bridge to the magistrate and my palls in the morning when they come down shall give you a sovereign and we will always be a friend to you when we got near the station-house I saw him take the jemmy out of his side pocket and before I could lay hold of it he laid it on the cill I afterwards saw the policeman apply that to the marks on the door of No 5 and it fitted as if it had been put into clay - I did not hear anybody make that observation at the time - there was the print on the door - it fitted exactly Cross-examined Q You did not observe any clay there A No my brother and I were living in my father s house together at the time - I did not point out to my brother the man who was forcing the door open - my brother was walking arm in arm with me - he did not perceive it at the time to my knowledge not till I told him of it which I did when we got to the court in about half-a-minute - I think there were three or four men at the door when I saw the prisoner - we had just got to the corner when I pointed out the man - I told my brother there was something wrong there and pointed them out - I did not point out this man in particular - the policeman told me that the prisoner said his friends in the morning would come and give him a sovereign - I did not hear him say that myself - I saw him put the instrument down myself - I should think it was not more than ten minutes after I saw the man forcing the door open that I gave him into custody ISAAC BOOKING I live at Great Smith-street Westminster On Sunday evening the 24th of November Mr Ginger came to me and requested me to go with him as he thought there was a plot laid on Mrs Clark s house - I went out and met the prisoner in Chapman-street a little after seven o clock walking down towards Cannon-street we then went back after Ginger had shewn him to me we got a policeman and took him under the archway - I went with the officer when he was apprehended - I had not seen him do anything in Chapman-street - I saw him there twice I was with Ginger the second time it was not above seven or eight minutes after the first Cross-examined Q It was not half-an-hour A Not from the first time of seeing him to the second Edward Ginger fetched me - I am a bookbinder - he was walking in the street when I saw him first - I had just come out of the house - Ginger came into my mother s house to apprize me of it and his brother but the brother left us when we came in the street -

he said he heard that I had had a loss - I said Yes I have - he said How much do you think you have lost I said No great deal and I said I have just been saying to my boy who was with me that I was sorry such a thing should have happened and if I could get my trinkets again I should be very sorry to have any trouble about it - he said I suppose you don t wish to prosecute - I said I did not know anything about that that the things taken were found on Davis and I certainly must swear to my property - he said if I could get it put off at Worship-street till tomorrow he thought we should have more time to talk about it and I could receive my property -

he said nothing about it then but hung about the door Davis s Defence written I beg leave to say that this is the first time in my life I was ever charged with any offence against the laws of my country which can be proved by several respectable persons in the court that up to this time my character would have borne the strictest scrutiny as to honesty Another circumstance I must state in justice to the prisoner Ballinger I can assure you that he was an utter stranger to me until I saw him in custody in the prison of Clerkenwell I now throw my case and my future destiny into the hands of a merciful Judge and an enlightened Jury who will be as lenient as the circumstances of the case will allow for the sake of my wife and infants JAMES OXLEY I know the prisoner Ballinger -

my windows were cut by some instrument outside and the property taken - the upper part of the window was cracked - I was not at home when it was done JOHN DORSET I live in Grey Eagle-street Spitalfields I know the prisoners - I saw them on the 25th of February at half-past ten o clock at night at the prosecutor s shop window - Bradley was nearest to the window - I saw him with his hand as if he was screwing something out of the window - Castles was walking backwards and forwards to another person who stood on the pavement and who is not taken into custody - I passed on and walked up Brick-lane again and saw a policeman and gave him information - I walked by them again and turned my head round - they saw me look at them and both walked away together - and the policeman took them into custody - I do not know what became of the third man CHARLES EAST I am a police-constable On the 25th of February Dorset gave me information - I was on duty in Church-street Bethnal Green - at the top of Brick-lane - I walked down until I came within two doors of the prosecutor s shop and saw the prisoner Bradley stooping down to the window and Castles walking backwards and forwards about a yard each way - Bradley was stooping down with his hands to the window but what he was doing I could not see - I crossed over and both the prisoners then came from the window and came towards me - I immediately seized them both and took them into Mr Harper s the baker s shop in Brick-lane - I searched Bradley and found on him a steel chain a metal seal and a pair of ear-rings - but on Castles I found nothing belonging to the prosecutor - I took them to the station-house with the assistance of my brother officer - I afterwards went back to the prosecutors and saw a pane of glass broken - the putty seemed as if a sharp instrument had been put in to break the window - I do not consider sufficient of the glass was gone for a man to put his hand through - the prosecutor s daughter gave me a piece of wire crooked at the end - I have it here PATRICK HENNESSY I am a policeman I was present when East had the prisoners in custody - I searched Castles - I took him to the station-house and found on him two seals and a chain concealed under the waistband of his trowsers close to the small of his back -

the two seals on it arenot my father s - Mr Harper s lad gave me this wire and I gave it to my father - East was not present - I know the steel chains - I had seen them in the window on the Saturday they were taken on Tuesday -

in about a quarter of an hour after they were gone I found a piece of wire on the floor - before they came in I had not noticed the floor for some hours - I gave it to Thomas Smeaton desiring him to take care of it in case it might be wanted THOMAS SMEATON I received the wire from my master- I saw him pick it up - it remained in my possession till next morning I then gave it to Miss Bouchard - I had swept the floor half an hour before the prisoners came in- the wire was not there then - a great many other persons had been in the shop CHARLES EAST I saw nothing of the wire I had not dropped it there PATRICK HENNESSY I saw nothing of the wire - I did not leave it there - the metal chain was found on Castles JOSHUA BOUCHARD re-examined This steel chain belongs to me - this seal and these two ear-rings and this metal chain belong to me - I went out about a quarter after nine o clock that day and was returning home when I met the policeman - the window was safe when I went out - I looked at it when I came home - if the glass had been out they could not have put a hand in as I have a guard but this wire could reach all the things out - this metal chain found on Castles is mine Castles When I was taken into the shop I had the metal chain and two seals tied to my fob and the policeman never took them from me PATRICK HENNESSY re-examined I took it from him with the two seals attached to it Castles Defence He said the young girl gave him the wire and she denies it I bought the chain C EAST The girl gave me the wire herself MARIA BOUCHARD I gave it to my father JOSHUA BOUCHARD My daughter gave me the wire I was going out on business -

I deal in clothes and sometimes other things in Petticoat-lane - about ten weeks ago I sold Castles a chain like that but there are so many hundreds alike it is impossible to say this is it - as far as I can take my oath it was exactly like this there was no seals to it - he put two seals on it - a woman brought me to the dock to see if I could identify him as the man and I could - I know him because he asked me to give him a stoutish pin I gave him one and he pinned the chain to his fob - I thought it strange to buy a chain without a watch which made me notice him - this happened at my stall in Petticoat-lane Castles The seals belong to my father - the prosecutor would have sworn to them before the magistrate if I had not said so JOSHUA BOUCHARD re-examined I said I thought one of the seals was like what was in my window but I did not like to swear to it - a great many more things were missing from my window - I do not swear to the seals WILLIAM CASTLES I am the brother of the prisoner - I can take my oath I saw that chain in my brother s fob before he was taken and the two seals belong to my father - he had the chain in his possession a fortnight before he was taken - I did not see him buy it - he has worn the seals ten years - my father is alive but is not here Castles Dorset went to my mother and said if she would pay him his expenses he would not come against me JOHN DORSET re-examined I did not do so -

I went up three pairs of stairs - I came down again and when within three yards of the bottom I thought I saw the door shut as quick as lightning - the prisoner was still there - he seemed very much agitated - I told him the nurse said she could not come and he went away - that was about half-past seven o clock in the morning - the nurse came down stairs about eight o clock and went into the parlour - I went in with her - and we then discovered that a cruet-stand knife-rests salt-spoons and a coat were gone - the plate was standing on the sideboard and the coat in the parlour closet - I had seen them just before Seall came - nobody but Seall had been at the street door before I went up stairs that morning Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How old are you A Sixteen next August - I desired him to walk into the passage while I went down stairs and when I came down he was still there -

two came out a little before the last - I did not perceive the door closed when the two came out - Seall came out last and I know Simpson I think by his dress but I am not sure he was one of them - I believe it was him - one of the two that came out first had a coat - I believe it was Simpson - it was a sort of brown coat a thick-looking coat - I think it was rough - two of the men went up the street and Seall turned the other way Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You do not take on yourself to swear positively to Simpson A No I may be mistaken Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How long had you been up A I was up at six o clock and had been in the parlour all that time I saw three men come out -

it escaped me to mention that at the moment - I did not say he might as well tell me all about it - on the contrary I told him if he said any thing I should use it in all probability against him in evidence - it was when he was going from the station-house to Hatton-garden he mentioned about beckoning to the men in the same conversation but after that - I knew where to find him from information I received from Mr Webber first and subsequently from his servant - there are two servants - I think it was Cotter not from the nursery-maid - they were both in the room at the time MARY COTTER It was not me Witness Then it must have been from the nursery-maid - I got the information from one of the two - they were both in the office of Mr Webber at the time - the nursery-maid was never before the magistrate - it was asked at the office and Mr Laing told me it was not necessary - Mr Laing asked if she was present and Mr Mallett gave some explanation why she was not there which satisfied him -

t18340703-194  Second Middlesex Jury before Mr Recorder 1086 SOLOMON NATHAN was indicted for feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of James McKinly on the 8th of March at Christchurch and stealing therein 33 yards of silk value 7l 10s the goods of Elkan Hyman and 20 yards of satin value 4l 10s and 2blankets value 7s the goods of Levien Morris MR PHILLIPS conducted the Prosecution ELKAN HYMAN I am a journeyman silkweaver and live at No 6 Gibraltar-walk Bethnal-green I am employed by Mr Moore of Milk-street Cheapside - on Saturday the 8th of March I lived at No 47 Brick-lane Spitalfields in the attic - Levien Morris lived with me - I am a Jew - I left home that morning about eleven o clock locked my door and left the key in an empty room - Morris went out before me - I returned about seven o clock - I sat with my landlady down stairs for some time - I found the key of my room where I had left it - I went up to my room and found the door burst open and my work stolen - two looms work were cut out and taken away - it was in a finished state and five yards finished remained in the loom still - I missed from my loom about thirty-six yards of black silk worth about 9l - Morris and I jointly pay for the room - the landlord lives in the house - his name is James McKinly - Morris had some silk stolen from his loom - I should know my silk again COURT Q Can you go from your landlord s room to yours up the common stairs A No it is a coffee-shop there is one door leads into the coffee-shop but we enter at the second door at the left of the stairs - there are other lodgers - the landlord s room is on the ground floor - there is only one staircase to the house and only one door LEVIEN MORRIS I lived in March last in the same garret with Hyman - I went out between seven and eight o clock in the morning and left my work safe - I returned about eleven - I left Hyman behind - I was working at green satin - when I came back I missed twenty yards of it - it appeared cut off the loom - I should know it again - the value of it would be 4s 9d per yard - the house is in the parish of Spitalfields I believe Cross-examined by Mr CLARKSON Q Had you a young lad in the service of Mr Moore who has lately been discharged A No not in Mr Moore s service - there was a young man living with us for about three months but he left three months before - I never said I knew who it was that cut away the silk - we had the young man up on suspicion - I said I suspected he would do so - we had a witness at Worship-street to prove that he had threatened it MR PHILLIPS Q Did you hear him threaten any thing A No I said I had reason to suspect him because I was told what he had said - the boy s name is Lyons - he is not here - the magistrate discharged him MARY BOSTON I live in Booth-street On the day the silk was stolen I was in the employment of Mr Moore to wind quills - I went to the prosecutor s house about two o clock on the 8th of March - they were not at home - the key was kept in the cupboard on the second floor - I went into their room and their work was all safe then - I remained there until about a quarter after three - I fastened the door - I double-locked it and tried it to see that it was fast - I put the key where I found it Cross-examined Q Do you know Lyons A I never saw him to my knowledge - I know Morris and Hyman - I never heard them say they knew who cut away the silk MR CLARKSON to E HYMAN Q Have you ever said you knew or suspected who cut away the silk because when the boy went away he said he would serve his master out A He never said so to me - directly the silk was cut I gave him in charge on suspicion - I suspected him or I should not have given him in charge SAMUEL MILTON police-constable H 27 On the 8th of March in consequence of information I went to the attic-of this house - I found two looms - some green silk laid on the floor - some appeared to be cut away from it - I examined the door - it appeared to be broken open by a chisel or crow-bar - I found a chisel in the room which corresponded with the marks on the door - I have been looking for the prisoner ever since about the middle of March till the was apprehended - I knew where he lived and went to his house several times but in vain CATHERINE LAZARUS I live with my brother Joseph in Palmer-street Spitalfields I remember seeing the prisoner there about the 13th of March between seven and eight o clock in the morning - I showed him into the parlour - my brother was not up - I called him and left him and the prisoner together in the parlour - I had occasion to go through the parlour while they were there and saw two pieces of silk lying on the table - a piece of black and a piece of green JOSEPH LAZARUS I am the brother of Catherine Lazarus On Thursday the 13th of March the prisoner came to my house and showed me two pieces of silk and asked me if I could sell them - they were green and black to the best of my recollection - I am in the habit of selling goods for him - I sold them both to Mr Samuel and paid the prisoner the money - I sold them for 7l 5s 9d but received only 7l 5s 6d - I gave the prisoner 7l - I went by desire of the officers to look for the prisoner - I was uneasy on account of my character when I found it was stolen - I went to the prisoner s house with the officers but could not find him - I have looked for him in vain till the officers found him COURT Q When did you first go to look for him A On the Thursday I bought the property and on Monday it was delivered up to Mr Hart and I went to look for the soner Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Who did you sell the silk to A Mr Samuel who sells linen-drapery - he lives in Mansel-street - I had known him a long time and had several dealings with him Q Did he ever get into trouble in consequence of his dealings A I am not bound to answer that question - I never got into trouble MOSES SAMUEL I lives in Mansel-street Goodman s-fields and am in the general way On the 13th of March I bought twenty yards of green silk and thirty-three-yards of black of Joseph Lazarus and gave him 2s 9d a yard - it came to 7l 5s 9d - I have his invoice in my pocket - I paid the whole of the 7l 5s 9d exactly - on the very sameday I sold fourteen yards of it to a casual customer at 3s a yard for a dress - Lazarus came to my house in consequence of something and I packed up the rest of the silk in a parcel put my seal to it and delivered it to Mr Hart at his private residence - I am certain it was the silk I bought of Lazarus Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How many Sessions ago had I the pleasure of seeing you A About seventeen months ago it is since I was imposed upon by the very man at the bar through his son - and I believe you were counsel in the case - it was tried before his Lordship - I admit it - I have no reason to be ashamed of it - I was tried in the New Court - it was an unfortunate event which I am not ashamed of being an innocent man - I was not acquitted - Mr Bodkin defended me - I was sentenced to six months in the House of Correction but in consequence of my previous character I was liberated after five-weeks - previous to that I was secretary and founder of a charitable institution and have retained it since - my friends are convinced I am innocent and was most unjustly convicted COURT Q Was it a charge of stealing some handkerchiefs where the patterns were not complete A Yes it was - they were sold with the maker s name on them MR CLARKSON Q Do not you think it unfortunate that you should purchase stolen silks in so short a time afterwards A Undoubtedly but there are events in a man s life over which he has no control - I used every caution and bought them of a respectable man - the goods came to 7l 5s 9d and I paid Lazarus the full amount - I have some of the satin here - I should think 2s 9d a yard is a fair price for it - it is not worth 4s or 5s in the job trade - the job trade is goods which come into hands from the decline of the season and various modes - I do not exactly recollect how I paid the silver to Lazarus - it the 9d was paid at all it was in pence - I paid the whole of it- on my solemn oath I paid Lazarus 7l 5s 9d - I did not keep back any portion of it to my recollection - not a penny- I will not swear positively as to the pence - I paid the pence to the best of my recollection - I believe 2s 9d to be a fair price - I have dealt in silks some years - Lazarus said it came out of pledge - that was in consequence of my remarking to him that the silk was out of condition - it was rather tumbled which is not uncommon in job goods - I certainly will swear it is not worth 4s a yard - I sold it for 3s - the person is not here who bought it of me - I sold it to a casual customer Q Do you keep an open silk mercer s shop A Yes it is a shop consisting of two front windows - it was a parlour originally but is converted into a shop - there is no shop window - goods are in the window - there is no name over the door - the door which leads to the shop is open by day - the street door is not shut it many be occasionally - I swear there are goods in the window and have been for years - there is a counter - the things in the window can be seen outside - I place sometimes ribbons sometimes handkerchiefs and flannel in the windows - the door is not open at night to my knowledge - if it is it is not with my permission - the outer door is left open during the day for customers to come into the shop - I have got no light in the passage Q You sold fourteen yards of the silk - what became of the rest A It was packed up and taken to Mr Hart - I make no entry of what I sell - I keep an invoice book for all goods which I buy - I do not keep an account of sales - Mrs Samuels was by when I sold it MR PHILLIPS Q Whether you keep an entry or not are you sure the silk you got from Lazarus was the same silk you gave up to Mr Hart A It was JOSEPH LAZARUS re-examined Q Did you represent to Samuel that the silks came out of pledge A I told him the party who sold it to me told me it came out of pledge which the prisoner did ABRAHAM HART I had a brown paper parcel which I gave to Vann the police-officer - my father desired me to take it to the office JOSEPH SAMUEL re-examined Mr Hart called at my house to inquire after the silk and produced the patterns and said Have you any like this - I said Yes here it is and gave it to him THOMAS VANN I am a constable of Worship-street Mr Westmacott has the parcel I received it and delivered it to Mr Moore - here are six yards and a half of green and thirty-two and a quarter of black - the house is in the parish of Christchurch Spitalfields THOMAS WESTMACOTT I superintend Mr Moore s silk manufactory - I produce the silk which I got from Vann - it is worth 4s 6d a yard - when taken from the loom it would be in a rough state but the value of the material by the weight and quality is 4s 6d Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Look at the green silk if that was in a state for sale what would it be sold at per yard to the public A 5s Q Is 2s 9d any thing like a fair price A It depends on the condition it is in - I should not like to send it out of our establishment in that state - any dealer that understands his business would see that is not fit for sale ELKAN HYMAN re-examined This black silk is mine - I know it by the general appearance of the work and I have a particular mark to the selvidge - it is the same quality of silk as that taken out of our loom Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Do not you have that particular mark on all the silk you work on A No- it was through a mistake made in the entering LEVIEN MORRIS re-examined This green silk is the same quality as that taken from my loom - I know the work by the general appearance - I can tell my own work- it corresponds with what was left behind Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Is it the same silk as you went before the magistrate about and charged the boy with stealing A Of course THOMAS WESTMACOTT re-examined I believe this to be my master s silk - there is a general appearance about the silk the witnesses manufacture Witness for the Defence EDWARD PORTER I am a linen-draper and live in Regent-place Globe-road Mile-end I have known the prisoner between three and four years -

I gave my testimony to the solicitor in this case - I did not give him the name of any individual who I met - I believe I saw Nathan again on Wednesday the 12th at his house No 6 Greenfield-street Whitechapel-road - I went to him on business - he sells handkerchiefs - I never saw him sell silks - we took silk handkerchiefs ribbons and lace down with us - he did not deal in silk - he was a general dealer - he has not shop- there is a room you may call a shop but it is a private house - things hang up in the window - I never saw silks there - I never saw him since this Wednesday that I know of- I may have seen him but have forgotten it - I have been at his brother s many times - I cannot tell whether on any of those times I have seen him - I may have seen him - I cannot swear whether I have seen him at his brother s since or not - I saw him on the 12th at his own house - I cannot swear that he has been out of the way but I have heard that he has been in the country -

nobody did but Hayes—I know she went up after—I cannot say how often—I found the lock of the door open—she had access to the key when she wanted to go into the room—she went up for no purpose but making the bed and doing her household work—she has confessed that she broke open the door—my business keeps me up till four or five o clock—it kept us up that night but the doors were not open—they were open and shut occasionally—that is the custom of the house—it is called a night-house—we are in the habit of having it open till four or five o clock sometimes but very seldom Q How happened it if you thought your property had been stolen that you omitted sending for an officer for five hours and a half A It was such a time in the morning to send for an officer—we thought we would leave it till the following morning—we were engaged with the brewers who came with the porter that morning—I remember Hayes taking up some warm water to my husband—I cannot say what morning it was—she went by the name of Mary—I do not remember her going into the club-room and not finding the pail or going down into the cellar to Mr Robinson for it—I do not remember his calling to me to send the pail down by her—about nine o clock on Saturday morning I asked her if she had seen the brooch or ring which I had left on the table—she told me No JAMES DAVIS I am a policeman On Saturday the 6th of November about eleven o clock I was applied to and went to Mr Robinson s house—the prisoner was called up from the kitchen to me and I questioned her if she knew any thing about the things—she said No —I then told her she was a prisoner and sent her into the bar for her mistress to search her—a letter dropped from her which excited my suspicions—I went and searched her room—I could not find any thing—she came down and went into the bar with her mistress again—I was going to take her to the station-house when she told me if I would go up stairs again 5s of the copper was behind her bedstead and that

Hayes overnight—she said she had given her a parcel containing the necklace and the prisoner Maher brought me a bag containing the necklace and brooch—I brought them both to the station-house—I searched Maher—she said she would tell me the truth that the ring was hid in the cradle—I went back with her to the house and she turned the ring out from among some shavings—I produce the property Cross-examined Q Julia Hayes told you you would find the copper behind the bedstead A Yes several people were present—Mr Robinson was ELIZABETH ROBINSON re-examined I believe this to be my husband s

wished for and as soon as mistress was confined he would make me comfortable and buy me new clothes—I said I had new clothes but they were in pawn—he opened the cupboard door and told me to take out what would redeem them—he had hold of my hand but he heard footsteps coming up and he let go—I had hold of the door and a screw came out—he told me not to tell mistress but whatever I wanted I should have—he gave me all the things—he gave me the brooch into my hand—I took them to my mother s—she told me to ask mistress s leave to go out and I had the things which he told me to take—I had given them wrapped up to Mrs Woolahan but she did not know what was in the parcel—he made me promises every day and when mistress went out he told me not to toll her but he would make me comfortable and buy me new things—he told me to take the money out of the cupboard Woolahan s Defence I took the things when she gave them to me and left them in the bag till the policeman came—I then told this woman to

got my coat and gave him into the custody of Ford a policeman—he told me he was very sorry for what he had done—I asked him what he had done with the property that was all—he said he did not know what made him commit the offence that it was his first offence—the articles were worth about 5l 8s 9d including the money which was 2l 15s 6d —if I wanted to sell the articles I think I might have made 30s of them Prisoner He says I took five pairs of stockings—he knows very well he had no such things in his possession Witness I am sure there were five pain of stockings Prisoner On the Sunday previous he shewed me 13s and declared it was all the money he had in the world Witness I showed him six half-crowns and a sixpence in my purse but did not say it was all I had—I kept him as long as I could

the shirt studs away with him—they were plain studs—I do not know whether they were metal—some of them were mother-of-pearl with gilt edges—he had a wedding ring tied to the end of his handkerchief—I was taken into custody on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery and discharged—directly the policeman told me the robbery was committed he was about to search me and then I gave the bodkin up—I

one he brought to me on the 11th of November—I only know it by the pattern—it is very handsome—this brooch is the same as was in the box with another one which I saw on the 11th—I cannot swear to it

t18350105-460  460 JOHN GREEN and CAROLINE ALLEN were indicted for feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of James Thomas Vallance on the 23rd of December at West Ham Essex and stealing therein 1 watch value 15l 1 watch-chain value 5l 1 watch-key value 6s and 1 seal value 6s his property JAKES THOMAS VALLANCE I am a surgeon and apothecary and live in the parish of West Ham in Essex I went out on Tuesday the 23rd of December about eleven o clock leaving a gold watch and chain seal and key and a mourning ring on the table in the surgery at the back of the shop—I returned home aboit a quarter to one o clock and was informed they had been stolen—the female prisoner was there in custody—I asked her who had given her the basket of lemons and oranges which she had when taken—she stated that a man in black gave them to her to hold and then ran away and she had never seen the person before—while I was in converstion I was informed that the male prisoner was taken—I then went out and saw him in the custody of the constable of West Ham—he was then taken to my house—I asked him what he had done with the property he had taken—he said What property —I then begged of him to state the truth and tell me where he had placed what he had stolen—he was then searched and 4s found on him but no portion of the property I then went out of the room and heard him in conversation with Mrs Fenner who was in the house when the property was stolen—she was endeavouring to persuade him to acknowledge where he had placed the property—I held him say If they would let me go I would tell where I put it —on hearing which I entered the room and told him if he would tell me where he had peaced the property I would do all I could that he might not be punished—he said he was afraid I would not keep my word or he would show me—I then said Well then you must take your course I am no liar —he then said if the handcuffs were taken off he would company me and one officer and show us where he had Placed the property—I said Do so and all that man can do for your discharge I will do —he then accompanied us to the marshes where he had been taken and said he had plunged them with his left hand into the ditch both the watch and the mourning ring—he was allowed to go into the ditch and was searching about from one ditch to another for three hours but we began to suppose he was merely losing time and refused to remain any longer—he still swore he had placed it in the second ditch and was then taken away in custody—I have not found any part of the property—the ditches have been searched Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Where wer you when you overheard part of the conversation between Mrs Fenner and Green A In the passage—the door of the room was open—I could distinctly hear any thing that was passing—Mrs Fenner was telling him the dangerous situation he had placed himself in from what he had done and he had tears in his eyes and looked very pitrful when I entered the room—she said if he would show where the property was it would be much better for him and she knew I would keep my word with him—I should think that was repeated more than once but I might not have overhead every word as Mr Champion was conversing with me at the door part of the time—when they were going up to my house previous to his seeing Mrs Fenner he said What watch I know nothing about it Q Did not he then in your hearing more than once say while she was endeavouring to persuade him to go and look for it that he knew nothing of the property A He did not use those very words but he might have said something meaning that—he had offered to Mrs Fenner in my hearing before any persuasion that he would show where it was if he was let go—when he was feeling in the second ditch it appeared as if he knew the property was not there—he then hesitated and said it was at the ditch where a man on horseback overtook him where the horse would not leap the ditch—a farmer had been in pursuit of him—he tried the second ditch first—I believe he had to go over four ditches before he was taken in the river Lea according to the information I received—he was about twenty minutes searching the first ditch—the second ditch he went to first—we sent for the person who had pursued him on horseback—we were a full hour searching that ditch I should think—I have had the ditches searched since and the water thrown out—nothing has been found—I thought he had done it to afford time for others who were connected with him to escape with it for I was informed there were three others concerned with him MARY ANN FENNER I lodge at Mr Vallance s—I had charge of his house On Tuesday the 23rd of December I was in the surgery—a gold watch and gold chain seals and key and a mourning-ring laid on the table—I left the room about twenty-five minutes after twelve o clock—I shut the surgery door and went down into the kitchen which is under the surgery—the outer door of the house was open—I was gone two minutes at the outside when I thought I heard a footstep over my head in the surgery—I directly came up and saw the prisoner Green leaving the front door with a basket under his right arm with oranges and lemons in it—I thought it appeared very strange his leaving a house without either knocking or ringing—I went and looked into the shop and then saw the surgery-door open which I had shut when I went down—there is another door leading to the kitchen stairs which was likewise shut—seeing the surgery-door open I directly missed the watch and rings—I then followed as quick as possible and saw Green give the basket to Allen who turned her head and saw me coming—she said something to Green what I cannot say and then Green ran—I directly went up to Allen and asked where the man was who gave her the basket and what he ran for—she said she did not know she never saw the man before in her life—I cried Stop thief —I took hold of Allen brought her into the shop with me and sent for an officer—she still declared she had never seen the man before and that she had not broken her fast—it was then half-past twelve o clock—I took the basket from her hand in the street and placed it in the shop till the constable came—the constable wished me to search her—I did so and found a half-crown some halfpence and the key of a door in her pocket—I then asked her how she could say she had no means to break her fast when she had money in her pocket—she had said she had no means to break her fast—I asked her what brought her to West Ham—she told me to look for shoe-binding which she had inquired for at one shop as she said—John Green was brought back about half-past one o clock to Mr Val-lance s shop—he was then nearly up to his shoulders in mud from the ditches he had been jumping in—I then asked him how he came to take the property—he appeared to be very confused and said What property —I told him the watch and ring which he had taken from Mr Vallance s surgery—he ihcn burst into tears and said If I tell Mr Vallance will prosecute me —I said You had better tell what you have done with them —he then said If these handcuffs are taken off I will tell —I then said Who will you show where you have put the property —I held out no threat to him nor tell him he should be liberated for I could not tell him so—he then said he took the watch from his left hand pocket and the mourning-ring and plunged them into the water in the second ditch half-way up his arm and that the ditch was very weedy and muddy Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How far from the shop door was it that you saw Green band the basket to Allen A About six doors from our gate my eye was scarcely off him—I should think it might be two minutes after he left the shop—he ran in consequence oi something she said as I suppose—she turned round looked me full in the face said something to Green and he ran directly—she took the basket and tried to hide it under a child she had in her arms—she tried to put the child on the basket—I should not think that was the most convenient way of holding it—it is a flap basket—she had the child on her left arm and put it under the child with her right and nearly let it fall—I lost sight of the man in turning the comer by the workhouse—I pasted her but did not follow the man because I returned to the bouse—I looked into the basket and then passed her turned back directly and took her back—she had no opportunity of going away—she could not get away from me with a child and a basket in her arms—I did not say Come with me to our house —I took hold of her left shoulder and took the basket in my right hand—I told her to come home with me and sent for an officer who was at our house in less than five minutes—she told me she had not broken her fast—she said she had not broken her fast that blessed day and had no means to do so—I told the magistrate those words Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Where were you when you came out of the room A I was under tfie surgery when I heard the noise—our passage is not very large—I saw the person s back—he walked away quietly—when I saw him give her the basket he was about half a dozen yards off—I was then in the street—his back was still towards me—he ran away directly the woman spoke to him—that was about half-past twelve as near as can be—it was nearly an hour between that time and when Green was brought to me and his clothes were all over mud—he was taken into the shop—the conversation that I had with him took place in the shop—Mr Vallance was in the passage adjoining the shop—I asked him once how he came to take the property—he said What property what watch —I said You know you took it —he then burst into tears and said If I tell Mr Vallance will prosecute me —I am sure I did not more than once ask him to tell—I am quite sure I did not ask him to go and search more than once—I did not threaten him—I should think he was kept in the house a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before he was taken away to search for the watch—I have not said Green was not the man—I said he was the man when he was first brought—although he was disguised in mud I knew him again—I had the person who left the house about two minutes in view—I was confused at the property being stolen—I did not feel confused further than to want the man stopped—I was not hurrying after him—I walked—when I saw the basket given I noticed both the man and the woman but I saw the man before I saw the woman—he was walking from the door COURT Q How near was he to the door when you first saw him A Just turning out of it—I went back and looked and missed it—I then went out and saw him give the basket to the woman WILLIAM STEVENSON I live with Mr Ducket a baker about six doors from Mr Vallance s On this Tuesday I saw both the prisoners in company together and in conversation before they came to Mr Vallance s house—they were just by the railing three or four yards from the house walking along—I saw Green go into Mr Vallance s house and the young woman pass on—Green had a basket in his hand and the young woman a child in her arms—she passed on about twenty yards and stopped in the middle of the road—Green came out of Mr Vallance s in a very hurried manner—the young woman then followed him—he passed her when hje came out—she was standing looking over the church wall—before she followed him he turned round and gave her a kind of a beckon to follow him and she did—he then gave her the basket and ran away as fast as he could—Mrs Fenner immediately came hurrying out at the door and I heard the watch was lost—I immediately gave pursuit after him—a young man joined me in the pursuit soon after and two or three more as he went across the marshes—he ran about two miles across the marshes and we took him in the river Lea—I asked him if he had got the watch—he said No —the mob collected round him and asked him several questions—I asked him no more till we got a mile on the road—I then asked him if the watch was in the mud where he was taken from—he said If you think it is you had better go back and look —the constable took him away Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Where were you when you saw them together A Opposite Mr Vallance s house out on my business—I had just been taking some dough out and was returning home—it was about six doors from Mr Vallance s that I saw the basket given—it was opposite our shop—I saw them together about four yards before they got to Mr Vallance s gate—that was the first of my noticing them—the man went into the shop directly after—when the man came out he shook his head—I could understand he meant her to follow him—I am sure he beckoned to her—Mr Vallance s shop door was open—there is a passage first and then the shop door—he ran away directly he gave her the basket Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Mr Vallance s door stands open A The first door does—I kept sight of the man almost all the way except when he turned the corner—I only lost sight of him in turning one corner—he turned two corners—George Parkins a butcher joined me in the pursuit—I had him in sight half an hour before he was taken—his back was not towards me all the time COURT Q Was there more than one person running before you A No we were all running in different directions as we were on each side of him—only one person was running from us and I kept him in sight except when he turned the corner from the house and when I got round that corner there was nobody else in the lane JOHN ELSTON I am a constable On this Tuesday I saw both the prisoners at Plaistow about a mile from Mr Vallance s—the woman was between four and five yards behind the man—they were walking in the same direction—I saw them for perhaps two minutes not more—I did not see them speak together—they went on—the man had a basket—this was near twelve o clock perhaps a quarter or twenty minutes before twelve o clock—they were going towards West Ham Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q They did not speak to one an other A No they were going together—they were following in the same track Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Are you sure they are the same persons A Yes I took particular notice of them EMMA KITCHENER I live with my parents at Plaistow On the Tuesday of the robbery I saw the prisoners in Plaistow walking together—I saw them speaking to one another and walking on till they came to a gate and then the man went into the gate—it was the gate of a field leading to a cottage—he told the woman to go on sharpish and he would overtake her and she did—she came to a stile and then she asked me what it was o clock—I told her almost twelve—she said Is it not gone twelve —I said No —she said It is a fine day —I said Yes and she sat on the stile—I left her there—that was about a quarter of a mile from the gate Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Where were you A Going with my brother s dinner—I did not see Elston—I saw them first together by the Black Lion at Plaistow—they went on together about twenty yards—I know Elston—I have not had any conversation with him about this—I live in Balaam-street Plaistow—my father is a plate printer—I was before them—I did not take so much notice of the man—I will swear he is the man—he had a pocked face and brown coat DANIEL GEE I live with my father at West Ham—I know the nature of an oath On the Tuesday when Mr Vallance s house was robbed I was at Mr Smart s corner about twenty yards from Mr Vallance s house—I saw the male prisoner run past the corner—he had a watch in his hand—the chain hung down out of his hand—it was a yellow metal watch—I could see it Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q How long had you him in sight A I only saw him turn the corner—I was by the side of him crossing the road—I saw him for three or four seconds CHARLES SMITH I am a constable I took the prisoner Allen into custody—I asked her what Mrs Fenner had brought her there for—she said some man had been stealing a watch and she was brought there on suspicion of being with him—that the man ran to her and gave her a basket but she had never seen the man before in her life—she had a young child with her—I said It is not very likely having a young child that you would carry a man s baket if you knew nothing of him —she said so help her God she never saw him before in her life—I asked her where she came from—she said from London and as she was a poor unfortunate girl her father and her had had a few words and she came to look for some shoe-binding and she had not broken her fast for two days—the man was afterward brought to Mr Vallance s house and Mrs Fenner identified him—they asked him what he had done with the property—he said if we would take off the handcuffs so help him God he would show us where the property was—that it was either in the first ditch or the second—I said it did not rest with me—Mr Vallance said he would try all he could to ease him in the punishment—he said in the first instance that he was not the man—we accompanied him to the marshes but did not find any thing Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q She told you she had not broken her fast for two days A She told me so—Mrs Fenner was in the shop when I had the convenation with Allen Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Where were you when Green said if the handcuffs were taken off he would go and show where the property was A In the shop—Mrs Fenner was there—I stayed there the whole time she and he were in conversation—I never left the place—he said this without any suggestion from any body and said he was in such a fright he could not tell what ditch it was in but it was in the first or second—Mrs Fenner said if he would tell her she would do all she could towards easing his punishment or something to that effect Green s Defence I know nothing at all about it—they are swearing quite false—Mrs Fenner at first said she would give me half-a-sovereign if I told her where it was—they were at me nearly an hour and a half in the shop to tell—I said I knew nothing about it but at last I said Take the handcuffs off and if you will let me go I will go and show you —I was forced to do it or they would not take the handcuffs off—they kept me out until nine o clock and kept giving me liquor in the public-house Allen s Defence When the man was brought into the shop they asked if that was him—I said I did not know for all I knew him by was a black coat and handkerchief—a man came in and said the doctor says Let the woman go I do not see what she has to do with it —Smith said Oh yes we can get people to say any thing

100lbs weight of solder value 2l 5s his goods ROBERT LEACH I live at No 16 Old Broad-street in the parish of St Peter-le-Poor in the City On Tuesday afternoon the 27th of January I left my shop about four o clock—I rent the wholehouse—it is my dwelling-house but I let out part as offices—I returned about twenty minutes or half-past four o clock and observed the prisoner Lock in the middle of my shop which is the darkest part of the shop—it was quite daylight—I went into the shop and Lock retired to the head of the cellar stairs—it was darker there than where I first saw him—I said Who is there —he made no reply—I repeated the question again and said What do you want come out and let me see what you are like —after some hesitation I saw him take two bars of solder out of his left hand breeches pocket and put them down by his side against the cellar stairs—he then came to me at I stood in the middle of the shop—I saw two more bars of solder in his right hand breeches pocket—I asked him what business he had there—he said he had been to ease himself and shrunk his shoulders up as if he was ill—I said It appears you came to load yourself instead of easing yourself —I took him towards the shop door then collared him and drew the two bars of solder out of his pocket—he then began begging for mercy and said one of my men bad given him the solder—I said he was one of a gang which infested plumbers shops and I would make an example of him and give him in charge—I had about 12cwt of solder in a pile in my shop and from that pile I missed about 1cwt which is six casts—a cast is four bars together—I went into the cellar and found Crawder concealed in the dust-bin and observed some solder bars there—that was not the place they should have been in—I kept some of my solder in the counting-house but never kept any in the cellar—Crowder worked for me last summer—I lost more solder than I found either in the cellar or on Lock—feeling it could not all be taken at one time by one man mode me look in the cellar—I found three casts close to where Crowder was concealed in the cellar—the solder found is mine Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you know Lock before A Not at all—there was no solder in the dust-bin—it was standing outside the dust-bin not concealed—I cannot say whether I had been in the cellar that afternoon—I saw it in its usual place before 1 went out—there was 10 or 12cwt in a pile which was up to as high as they would go under a shelf—as high as possible—I have but two men in my employ—I left neither of them on the premises—I left nobody in the shop when I went away—my men were both out—the shop door was shut but not locked—it was on the latch—there is a secret latch which none but those acquainted with the premises can open—they can open it by leaning over—it is a short hatch door about three feet high—the folding door over it was left open—a man might get over the hatch door—my house it in a yard which is open to the street—the shop communicates with the dwelling-house and is under the same roof COURT Q There was nothing to prevent a person climbing over the open door into the shop A Nothing whatever—the solder taken that day is worth 2l 5s WILLIAM PARTINOTON I am in the prosecutor s employ I came into the shop about four o clock and shortly after Crowder came in with another man and asked me for a job—I said we were very slack and had nothing to do—they stopped there about five minutes and then we all came out together—they opened the door and came in—when I had got the square of glass which I was cutting to put in a window they came out with me—we all came out together—I went to pot in a square of glass and know nothing further JOHN KIMBER I am a ticket-porter and live in Charles-street Hackney-road I was in

the wife of James Long who is a weaver living in Wellington-row in the parish of St Matthew Bethnal-green On Wednesday afternoon the 28th of January I was up stairs at my work—I left work about a quarter before five o clock and came down stairs to get tea ready—I heard footsteps in the passage and a noise in the bed-room—I heard two persons go out of the house—I called to know who was going out but got no answer—I found my bed-room window open—that is the front room on the ground floor about two feet from the pavement—I opened the street door and about ten yards from the door on the right hand I saw two lads walking slowly side by side—on my left hand a stranger was passing—I made inquiry of the stranger—I saw Jordan s face and observed that they each looked round at me and turned their heads but I did not observe the face of the other prisoner—I observed Jordan so as to know him again—the other person had a round brown cap on—when Smith was apprehended he had such a cap at Worship-street office in his hand—I spoke loud enough to the stranger who was passing for the lads to hear me—I asked whether those lads came out of my house—I cannot not say they heard the answer—I immediately said We are robbed and when I uttered those words the two lads both began to run—the man I questioned ran the same way and my husband followed—Jordan was brought back to my door—I immediately recognised him to be one of the boys who had turned round and looked me in the face—I searched my bed-room found the drawers open and my husband s clothes taken out—the glass of the window was cut and the screw which fastened both sashes together was gone—the window was fast to my certain knowledge at half-past twelve o clock—it was screwed—nobody could open it without breaking the glass and that would admit a hand to undo the screw—the window-sash had been raised up—I received from my apprentice a great-coat a pair of trowsers and a waistcoat—I had observed that some clothes were gone out of the drawer but did not exactly know what—I afterwards missed two coats from the drawer—one of them had a silk pocket-handkerchief in it—I found my gown some children s cloaks and a shawl removed from my own bed where I had left them and put on the children s bed JAMES DEAN I am a shoemaker and live in Wellington-row On the afternoon of the 28th of January I was in my garden—I heard a cry of Stop thief proceeding from my left hand about thirty yards in the direction of the prosecutor s—I saw two lads running towards me from the prosecutor s—I had a full view of them—the prisoners are the two lads I am certain—I stopped Jordan—Smith got away—I am not quite certain of Smith as he turned his head very quickly—I had a full view of him for a short time—I will not undertake to swear to him JAMES LONG I am the husband of Elizabeth Esther Long and live in Wellington-row When my wife had been down stairs about two minute she gave an alarm—I ran down stairs—I asked which way they had run—I ran after them but did not see them and about one hundred yards from my own house I picked up my great-coat trowsers and waistcoat lying all in a heap together—they are worth 2l 15s —I missed two other coats—I found the articles in the direction the boys ran—the pane of glass had been broken at the corner and mended before—I found the corner had been dug out and the window screw gone JOSEPH ROBERT ONION I am a bonnet-shape maker and live in Wellington-row I went in pursuit of the thieves hearing the alarm—I saw Long pick up the trowsers coat and waistcoat from a ditch—as Jordan was taken back to the house I was behind him and saw him take his hand from his left hand pocket and drop an instrument which will be produced—a lad took it up by my direction—I afterwards saw the policeman try the instrument to the marks made in the putty of the window—they were exactly the marks such an instrument would make and were made by it in my opinion—the corners of the chisel are both broken off and there were marks of that on the putty JOHN HERSCROFT police-constable H 75 I received Jordan into custody from Long and took him to Long s house—on the road I heard something chink on the stones and this chisel was delivered to me by the apprentice boy I believe—I said to Jordan These are the instruments you make use of are they —he said I picked that up in Bethnal-green-road —I applied it to the marks in the window-frame—the centre square of the top sash—it is a very remarkable chisel and it fitted the marks exactly—I merely laid it into the old mark—there was only one mark in the window—I have no doubt that instrument made that mark JAMES THOMPSON police-constable H 178 I was on duty in Went-worth-court on Wednesday the 28th about a quarter past five o clock in the afternoon and found Smith at William Sheen s lodging-house in Elgar-place which is a house of ill-fame Whitechapel about a mile and a half from the prosecutor s—when I went into the room he was in the act of pulling off this coat with a velvet collar—he had it off all but the sleeves and was putting it on the bed—I said You are my prisoner —my brother officer took another coat off a table in the room JAMES LONG re-examined These coats are mine and were in my drawer that afternoon—they are worth 1l together—there was a silk handkerchief in the coat with a velvet collar—that has not been found—my wife has the cloak and gown only they were not taken out of the house Smith s Defence I had not got the coat on—I was laying it on a box —I had been to sleep and directly I got up I saw the officers come in I put my clothes on the table—he came in and took hold of me—I do not know who put the coats there Jordan s Defence I picked the chisels up in

I was in the garden and saw Wade handing an urn out of the window to Jones—Wade was in the house on the store-room window on the ground floor—Jones was standing outside—I had seen that window shut

consequence of information and got the counterpanes and a sofa-cover which I have had ever since Cross-examined Q He never concealed where he sold them nor who was with him A No WILLIAM HARPER re-examined That is the clock I bought and took to Colonel Barne s JAMES GILL I know the prisoner—he has pawned articles with me—he brought these counterpanes and a sofa-cover to my shop to pawn and I stopped them on the 25th of November—he said he was sent by his father to pawn them—I refused to take them and he left them with me—I afterwards gave them to the officer WILLIAM AMBER I am butler to Col Barne This tea-caddy is his property—it was in the house when I left town on the 22nd of July—the clock also belongs to him and was in the house when I left—I have examined the marks on the counterpanes and they belong to the Colonel—the witness was left in charge of the house—she wrote to Colonel Barne on the 25th of November giving information and he sent me to town on the 26th form Suffolk—the clock is worth 14l and the caddy 2l MARY WARDEN re-examined I have examined the counterpanes—they are what were in the house—and the clock and caddy which I missed on the 24th of November Cross-examined Q Do you know the prisoner A No I never saw him till he was at the office—none of the drawers were locked where the counterpanes were—I was not alone in the house that day—a woman named Atkinson was with me—she slept in the house on the 23rd of November—she used to hold a situation in the Bazaar—nobody else was in the house to my knowledge—on the 23rd a young man named Goodwin called but he only staid a few minutes—there was no man in the house on the 23rd or 24th—on man slept there—on my nobody but myself and Mrs Atkinson slept in the house that night—there was no man in the house on the 24th—I never said there was Q Did you ever say among some friends who called to see you that there was a man and woman who staidthere and were allowed to sleep A Not on the 23rd—it was before that—the man s name was Morris he called to see me out of friendship and formed an acquaintance with Mrs Atkinson which I did not allow—I disapproved of it—Morris slept in the house—that was three weeks before the robbery—he first called din October—he came three times in October—he only slept there one night—he was speaking to Mrs Atkinson—I did not think he would take the liberty to sleep there—he did sleep there but not with my consent—I did not know it—I found it out afterwards—I knew he slept there—he slept in the attic—Mrs Atkinson slept in the same room—Mrs Atkinson did not quit the house afterwards—I allowed her to stay there after that—she used to go out occasionally in the day-time Q As you never saw the prisoner in the house and as the house was not broken open what was there to prevent Mrs Atkinson at various times taking the property and giving it to people A she did not for on the afternoon the property was taken I went out and Mrs Atkinson with me—I do not know where she is now—I knew her twelve month—she slept in the house nine weeks with me—she was an acquaintance and through distress I allowed her to sleep not thinking she was a bad disposed woman or I would not have allowed it—she remained in the house as long as I did—she said had no place to go to and I did not know she was a had woman—I knew she slept with Morris the night he stopped there—she was not in health then—she went out—I acknowledge myself very much in fault for letting her stop there after that but she was in want and my heart was kind to assist her a little—she was no friend but an acquaintance who has injured me very much—I do not know where she lives now—I have not seen her for three weeks—I have not inquired after her—she went out with me and I left the property in the house at that time—the drawers were left unlocked—we went out at half-past four o clock on the 24th and returned at nine o clock or a little after—I found the door locked as I had left it—I believe the house must have been entered with a key—the lock of the door was not at all hurt—Morris called once after sleeping there COURT Q You mean to say you left all the things safe 24th and all were gone when you came back A Yes Mrs Atkinson is a single woman and is fifty years old—she is not married to my knowledge—she passes as a single woman MR PHILLIPS Q Why tell my Lord that you missed some of the preperty at twenty minutes past four o clock A I said that property was all there at twenty minutes past four o clock Prisoner s Defence The things were given to me as I said to sell at a public-house—I sold the caddy and clock for 4l next morning the same man gave me the counterpanes and things JURY to MRS WARDEN Q Was the key of the house in your possession at the time you were out A Yes I had it in my pocket—I always kept it in my pocket—there is no second key to go out of doors with—there is only one key to the door—there is a large key inside but the large key was in the door when I went out and when I came back—there are two locks on the door—it is not called a latch-key James Paul omnibus-driver Paddington John Wingate carpenter Warren-street Fitzroy-square and James

t18360229-702  702 WILLIAM JORDAN alias John Leary and THOMAS SULLIVAN were indicted for feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of our Lord the King on the 27th of November 1834 at St Dunstan in the East London and stealing therein 70 sovereigns 10 half-sovereigns 2 crowns 4 half-crowns and 29 shillings 4 £300 1 £200 8 £100 10 £50 2 £40 5£30 53 £10 15 £20 and 28 £5 Bank-notes the property and monies of our Lord the King and 5 sovereigns 1 £10 and 1 £5 Bank-notes the property and monies of Frederick Thomas Walsh and 4 £100 Bank-notes the property of William Billings and HENRY MOTT and THOMAS SEALE were indicted for that they before the said felony was committed on the said 27th of November feloniously and maliciously did incite move procure counsel hire and command the said William Jordan and Thomas Sullivan to do and commit the felony aforesaid —2 other sets of COUNTS in the first of which the principals are charged with breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Elizabeth King Kelly and in the last the counting-house of our Lord the King and the other parties are charged as above MR ATTORNEY GENERAL MESSRS ADOLPHUS BODKIN CHAMBERS and BARLOW conducted the prosecution FREDERICK THOMAS WALSH I am Receiver of fines and forfeitures in his Majesty s customs and was so on the 27th of November 1834 I do my business in the Custom-house—there is an outer office called the receiver of fines office and I have an inner room to myself—this plan of the place looking at one appears to be tolerably correct—the entrance from Thames-street and other place are accurately described—in November 1834 there was a considerable sale of property at the custom-house—the produce of the sale would come into my hands as receiver of fines—a few months before that there had been another sale upon which the amount was considerably less which would leave a less sum in my hands—on the 27th of november 1834 the amount of money in my hands was 4292l 11s 9 1/4d belonging to the Crown and about 20l I think of my own and Mr Billings had given me 400l to take care of for him—that was all in the chest on the night of the 27th of November—the property was principally in Bank-notes—on the morning of the 27th I had sent a great quantity of gold to the Bank and received bank notes for it—there were two of £300 notes belonging to the Crown and one in particular which I remember besides those—I have a list of all the notes here—I made the balance myself—another person entered the figures—I counted the notes over at the time—there were four of £300 one of £200 eight of £100 ten of £50 two of £40 five of £30 fifteen of £20 fifty-three of £10 twenty-eight of £5 and 70l in gold and cash 7l 9s 1 3/4d —that might be silver and copper—there was more money belonging to the King about £200 in notes 94l 10s 6d 30l 12s 1d and 180l and 10l —that makes up the sum I first mentioned—there was a £10 and £5 note among my 20l and Mr Billings money was four £100 Bank-notes—this money was put into the King s chest which is in my own private office in the inner room—it was secured by two padlocks and there was another lock to it—the key of that lock was out of order—it is called the stop-lock—the keys of the two padlocks were kept one in my custody and the other by the Accountant of petty receipts—the chest could not be properly opened without the concurrence of us two—I occasionally kept my key about my own person and occasionally locked up in a drawer in my office—my office is private and separate from all other business of the Custom-house—no body should come there except my two clerks and the Accountant of petty receipts—when persons come on business they come from a door facing me—there is not any separation between me and them—the door communicates between the inner and outer office—persons who buy goods at the Custom-house sales come to me to deliver their tickets and pay money—they come into the inner office—I was at the office on the 27th of November 1834 till about twenty minutes to four o clock as near as I can recollect—I left the money all safe in the chest and the chest locked—I left my own key in the drawer where I usually put it when it was not about my person—I went to the office next morning at a few minutes after ten o clock— I was not the last person in the office that night —when I came in the morning there was a rumour or clamour about what had happened—when I entered my office I found two persons present—I found the Accountant of petty receipts padlock to the chest was violently broken—my own was locked and the key in my drawer—the drawer was broken open—it had been forced open—all the notes I have mentioned and the money were gone—I had some private bonds which were left—they were foreign securities—they remained there—they must have been touched—the cash-box was of considerable weight—there were three cash-boxes—the money belonging to the Crown was in one cash-box—Mr Billing s money was in a private cash-box and my own also—they were all gone Q When you had the cash and had not changed it for Bank-notes was the cash-box of considerable weight A Yes—I had changed about 700l of gold for notes Q When the money was in the cash-box and in its proper place could you move it with one hand or two A Very likely I moved it with two if I had occasion to life it out of the chest I think I must have used two hands—the prisoner Mott was a clerk in the King s warehouse—I do not know Seale—I had a book in my office in which I enter the notes I receive from persons who came to pay for lots sold—I enter the name of the person paying money his address the amount he paid and the manner in which he paid it—not the number of the notes but whether in notes or cash—I am not certain whether I left that book on my desk or in the cupboard on the night of the 27th—when I came in the morning I looked at the book and all the leaves that were written upon were torn out—I do not particularly remember any person coming and paying me money shortly before the robbery—at that time there were a great many persons paying as it was near prompt day—there is a day fixed at which the lots must be paid for—the sale was on November 11th 12th 13th and 14th—the prompt day was the 28th of November—they were obliged to pay on or before the 28th or the deposit would have been forfeited—I am not quite sure whether Mr Billings was our auctioneer on the occasion—I am not aware of any regulations prohibiting any clerk or person employed there from buying at sales but there may be—this 50l note looking at one has my own hand-writing on it—I have wirtten on it 329-57 —that means lot 329-57th sale—there is written on it John Leary East-street Kent-road —and there is the same signature on the back—I do not remember whether that was on it when it came into my hands or whether it was written in my presence—that note was paid me for lot 329 which was a lot of rum—the lot amounted only to 11l I believe—I should have to give change for the note looking at a catalogue T C Jones bought that lot—I do not know in what name it was cleared as the book is destroyed by the leaves being taken out in which it was entered—I believe these three 300l notes to be part of the property stolen that night looking at them —I know them by the date and number—I have not any memorandums of my own of what the numbers were—there is nothing of mine written on the notes—I do not see any memorandum of mine on this 10l note—my office is in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-East—the warehouse is part of the Custom-house—Miss Kelly the housekeeper lived in the Custom-house—she lived and slept there as servant of the Custom-house—you can go from my office to any part of the Custom-house at all times within office hours—it is part of the Custom-house Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Was Miss Kelly housekeeper of the whole building at that time A Yes she is since dead—her apartment was in the eastern wing a considerable distance from my office—there is an internal communication from her chambers to the rest of the Custom-house—my office is in the centre of the building towards the Thames side—I could get to Miss Kelly s apartments without going out of the Custom-house—I do not live there—my hours of attendance are from ten o clock till four—there is a paper kept for the clerks attending daily to inscribe their appearance upon—on the 27th of November I think I left at twenty minutes before four o clock having made up my balance I left earlier than usual—I left others in the office—I did not take the key of the chest with me as I thought it would be more secure in the King s warehouse and had constantly left it there before—I left my two clerks Wood and Cooper in the office—they would have nothing to do with the chest after I left—the Accountant of petty receipts or his clerks would have the other key of the chest—he had left the private office before I left—the list of the contents of the chest I have read was made about half-past three o clock that very day—the Accountant of petty receipts was with me at the time—I read over the list in his presence and can swear the notes and money were in the chest at that time—I saw that gentleman again on the following morning—I arrived there a few minutes after ten o clock and immediately learnt what had occurred from the two persons in my office—there is a book in which I enter the description buyers at the sale give of themselves—I have that book here—the entry of the proceeds of the sale I have not here as the leaves were torn out—that was the first memorandum of any payment made COURT Q Is it the deposit or purchase money A The deposit was made at the time of the sale—the book the leaves are torn from is called the receiving-book—that contains the entry of the completion of the purchases after the sale—that book was kept by myself Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are you sure as to the parish your office is situated in A I have seen a plan of the building—I am not positive—I hear the Custom-house is in two parishes Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Can you tell whose business it is to keep the keys of the outer doors of the Custom-house A I do not know officially—the money belonging to the Crown had been accumulating for same weeks and some part of it for months—change had been given out of the money received but not to any extent—I cannot say to what amount positively but none of the large notes had been changed—I had been in the receipt and payment on money while this was accumulating—I had received some thousands probably within the time this had been accumulating—by looking over my cash book I could tell the payments MR ADOLPHUS Q Whatever receipts or payments you made were the bank-notes you have described locked up in your cheat on the night in question A Yes they were MR CLARKSON Q Are you able to speak with accuracy as to the that of the warehouse over which you have the superintendance being under the same roof as Miss Kelly resided A Yes I can get to it without going into the open air—the doors and passages are open when the offices are MR ADOLPHUS Q Is there any outer door to your inner office A Yes that was not at all damaged—on the morning of the 28th of November there were no marks of violence on it—the closet in which the cheat was was burst open—a person named Beaston is a clerk in the Accountant of petty receipt s office—he was in the office on the 27th of November but not at the time I left it—he left before me as far as I am recollect COURT Q Where was the key of the closet in which the chest was A In my drawer with the key of the chest and I had the key of the drawer with me—I found that drawer had been forced open JACOB WRAY I am an inhabitant of the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-East I have been church warden and overseer—that part of the warehouse where Mr Walsh transacts his business is situated in our parish Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q How do you know that A I have lived in the parish all my life—I only know it by living in the parish—the parish boundary crosses in the centre of the Custom-house—I have walked the boundaries for many years—I have not walked through the Custom-house we go round it—that which we walk round we take to be in our parish—I served the office of churchwarden before the new Custom-house was built—the old house did not stand where the present one does—I know the King s warehouse in the new building is in St Dunstan s parish by going the bounds and many other circumstances I have been there many times—no part of the old building was in our parish—I have not done anything as churchwarden since the new building has been erected Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you happen to know that the whole of the Custom-house is in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-East A No it is not—not the whole of it—it in St Mary-at-Hill and our parish—when I walked the bounds I walked the bounds of the old Custom-house—there is a very small portion of the house stands is St Mary-at-Hill it is the western end—there is a boundary mark cut in the stone in the front of the Quay and painted also in the south front of the house COURT Q I presume some warehouses stood on the spot on which the Custom-house now stands A Yes—those warehouses were in our parish and paid rates to it—the spot the present King s warehouse is on is in our parish—I have received poor-rates from the houses and warehouses JOHN BEASTON I am in the employment of the Custom-house On the 27th of November 1834 I was assisting in the office of the Receiver of Fines—I checked with Mr Walsh the account of money the produce of a sale which had been held before in the Custome-house—I did so about half-past three o clock or rather sooner—I ascertained that the balance was correct—the money was placed in the King s chest—I left the office about twenty minutes before four o clock leaving Mr Walsh and his clerks Wood and Cooper there—I fastened the Comptroller s padlock on the iron chest and took the key up-stair and deposited it in the place where it was usually kept—I am clerk to the Comptroller of fines and forfeitures—I have every reason to believe this is the Comptroller s lock looking at a padlock —this is the key—I arrived at the Custom-house about five minutes before ten o clock next morning—I applied for the key of the Comptroller s padlock where I had left it the night before and obtained it—I went to the Receiver s office and found a servant girl there—it was one or two minutes before ten o clock—no other clerk or any person of the establishment was there when I arrived—I did not look at the state of the Comptroller s padlock immediately—I could not do it as the cupboard door was closed—when one of the clerks arrived about five minutes past ten o clock I went to the cupboard—I found the cupboard door unlocked the lock having been forced off it and the door open—I found the Receiver s padlock on the chest locked the Comptroller s padlock had been forced off and laid down by the side of the chest—I afterwards saw Mr Walsh apply the key to that padlock and it opened it Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q When you sit in the Receiver s office the closet is out of sight A I sat in the inner office—I can see the closet from the Receiver s office—the inner office and the Receiver s office are not separated—there is a partition between the inner and outer office but they are both the Receiver s—a doorleads from one to the other—the closet is in the inner office and the chest is in the closet—a man in some parts of the outer office could see the chest—a person would go to the inner office to pay for a purchase at the sale SAMUEL STERCK In November 1834 I was employed in the Custom-house as an extra tide-waiter It was my business to attend to the fires in the King s cellar and warehouse—when the clerks left the office it was my duty to go into the office and put out the fires—I recollect going into Mr Walsh s office on the night of the robbery—I saw the clerks leave the office—there is a door which opens from Mr Walsh s office into the lobby—that door is closed when the clerks leave the office—it is fastened by a spring lock—that door was closed on the afternoon of the robbery after the clerks left but not fastened—I closed it myself—after closing that door I went to fasten the door leading into the lobby on the north side after the clerks were out of the office Q Was there time while you were fastening that opposite door for any person to have got into the door you had just latched too A Yes plenty—my back was turned to that way anybody could come in without my seeing them—I locked the door on the south side with the big key and took it to Mr Billing s house No 7 Albion Mills by Blackfriars-bridge—I went on the following morning to the Custom-house—I got the key from Mr Billing s—I was there at half-past eight o clock as near as possible and at the Custom-house at nine o clock—I opened the south-side door which I had fastened—I found every thing apparently as I had left in the night before the door from Mr Walsh s office into the passage was closed the same as it was over night Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Mr Walsh s door shuts by a spring so that it shuts by itself A Yes it will—I go to put out all the fires two or three minutes after the clerks leave—all the clerks leave about four o clock—there are a great many persons going out at the same time—sometimes so many as to creat a confusion so that I do not observe persons very narrowly—it is according to the press of business—I went to put out the fires on the 27th about ten minutes before four o clock—I think Wood and Cooper were there SAMUEL WOOD I am clerk to Mr Walsh the Receiver of the fines and forfeitures of the Custom-house In October 1834 I received a cheque from the Receiver-general of the Excise which I carried to the Bank of England and received and deposited with the Receiver of fines—this £300 note No 7988 dated 4th October 1834 is one I received from the Bank of England—I merely know it by the account given to me by the Bank clerk—I received three notes of 300l each—I placed them in the hands of Mr Walsh—I did not take the numbers of any of the notes—I only received one of these three notes COURT Q What cheque was it you went to the Bank with A 2974l 15s drawn by the Receiver General of the Excise WILLIAM COOPER I am a clerk to the Receiver of fines at the Custom-house I took about 700l in gold to the Bank of England in November and received for it 620l in notes—these appear to be the notes I received— looking at some I know them by numbers—I took an account of the numbers the day after the robbery COURT Q Did you take it before they were stolen A No I had them given to me from the Bank JOSIAH FIELD I am a clerk in the bank of England in the Bank-note pay-office Two of these £300 bank notes I know—No 2309 dated the 14th of November and No 2310 dated the 14th of November 1834—they were paid out on the 27th of November—they were part of the same payment paid for a teller s ticket amounting to 620l —it was ticket which a teller would give if a person had given him cash for it—a person wanting to exchange cash for notes goes to the teller gives him the money and he gives him a ticket which he brings to me and I give notes for it—I do not know anything of the other note—I have no recollection of the person to whom I gave the £300 notes—I produce the teller s ticket WILLIAM COOPER re-examined I believe Mr Field to be the gentleman I received the notes from—I should say this is the Teller s ticket I received when I paid the sovereigns—I took the gold to the Teller s office and received a Teller s ticket which I took and received the notes for it Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you know anything about the identity of the ticket at all A I should say it was the ticket I received—I remember the name of Little Hales being put on it—that is partly torn off now JOSIAH FIELD re-examined Little Hales is a teller—he would very likely sign many tickets that day but not all of them WILLIAM HARY I was appointed a land-waiter of the Customs about September 1827—my father was a Collector of customs at Drogheda in Ireland—I became acquainted with seal after being a landing-waiter at the customs in London—he was a landing-waiter and searcher in the customs like myself—I was intimate with him—I had some difference with him which was made up some years afterwards—about June 1834 when I became very intimate with him again—he made some proposal to me shortly after we renewed our acquaintance—he mentioned to me that he had it in contemplation to rob the Custom-house—we were stationed together at the London-dock at that time—I used to go with him to public-houses constantly out of business-hours—to the Duke of Sussex at Peckham frequently and to the Royal-Mortar in the London-road—I frequently met him at the Castle Old Kent-road—I was once or twice at the Three Kingdoms public-house with him—at the time he mentioned this to me at the London-dock he asked me if I would accompany him to the Three Kingdoms which is in Harp-lane opposite the Custom-house to see a friend of his named Mott—I went with him at the time to the Three Kingdoms and Seale sent to the King s warehouse for Mott—I had not known Mott before to speak to him—I knew him by sight—he came over immediately—Seale introduced the subject to him of robbing the Custom-house and mentioned the office of the Receiver of Fines and Fortfeits—Mott answered him by saying that the King s sale which was then coming off would be but a small one and he thought it more prudent to defer such a thing to the next sale which would be larger one—Seale acquiesced in that—I went to Ireland about the beginning of the August 1834—I frequently mentioned the subject with Seale and Mott before I went—I frequently met them at the Duke of Sussex—the first time I saw the prisoners Jordan and Sullivan was I think in June 1834 at the Royal Mortar in the London-road—I became acquainted with them by meeting them in company there—I have gone there with Seale and Mott and met them there—I was not introduced to them but became acquainted with them by meeting them there through Seal and Mott—nothing was said about the Custom-house in their presence before I went to Ireland—I had met them perhaps a dozen times before I went to Ireland—when I went there I met Sullivan and Jordan in Dublin on the day I came from Drogheda in my way to England—they then asked me some questions about robbing the Custom-house of Dublin or Drogheda or any thing of that which I could assist them in—I told them I could not assist them there in anything of the kind and I left Dublin that day for England—I returned to London about the 4th of September—I met Seale immediately I returned to duty at the London-docks—we were stationed there together and the subject of the Custom-house was mentioned several times—the subject was discussed between us as to who were the parties they should employ to commit the robbery at the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures—Mott had been on leave of absence for a fortnight at that time and on his return the subject was frequently mentioned between us of an evening when we met at the Duke of Sussex at peckham and frequently also at Seal s own house at Peckham which is close to the Duke of Sussex I lived with Mrs Godfrey at No 17 Trinity-terrace Borough at the time Seale had mentioned two parties names—a man named walter and Harry Newsom as he called them—he said they were both experienced cracksmen but afterwards on inquiry Seale found Newsom was not in this country having gone to America—Seale told me so and that Walter was out of town—Mott mentioned the names of Sullivan and Jordan—he said he had met them at the Royal Mortar and had mentioned the subject to them and had made an appointment for us to meet them at Jordan s house No 4 East-lane Old Kent-road—Seale Mott and myself went there and met Sullivan and Jordan—as near as I can recollect that was about the beginning of October—the subject was introduced by Mott and Seale and the conversation was on that point only the point of the robbery —Sullivan and Jordan inquired what the contents of the chest might be in the Receiver of Fines and Forfeiture s Office—they inquired that of Mott—he said before the King s sale took place he should be able to ascertain what the actual contents of the chest were—Jordan and Sullivan said they would inspect the place the day after or the following day when it suited their convenience and it was taken arranged that we should meet at Jordan s house a few evenings after they had inspected the place the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures and the King s warehouse in the Custom-house the situation of the place was described by Mott—we met again a few nights afterwards at Jordan s house—Jordan and Suillivan said they had inspected the place and they considered it would be a very easy matter to accomplish the fact—meaning to rob the place—the subject then spoken of was which was the best way to accomplish it—Sullivan said he thought the best way would be to fit the locks of the door provided they could get impressions of the keys—that was the door going into the King s warehouse from the esplanade—the outer door—the esplanade is on the south side—Mott was not present at this meeting only Seale Sullivan and Jordan—I said I would mention the circumstance to Mott when I saw him and find whether he could get imperssions of the keys—I met Mott the next evening and told him what had passed—he said he could get the impression of one of the keys mentioning the large key but the impression of the key of the padlock he was fearful he could not get—I communicated this to Sullivan and Jordan and appointed for us all to meet the following evening at Jordan s house and we all met on that occasion there—Mott on that occasion produced the large key of the door leading from the esplanade which he said he had taken from the chest of Mr Bunnett a clerk in the same office in the King s warehouse-keeper s office and that Mr Bunnett at the time was absent on sick-leave from sickness—an impression of the key was taken in beeswax at the time by Sullivan—Mott brought the key down rolled up in a piece of paper of paper folded at the ends—I think it was white paper—after the impression was taken the key was put up in the same paper with the intention of returning it to Mr Bunnett s desk the following morning when he returned to duty—Seale asked if they would not require the assistance of a third party to effect the robbery—Jordan said he thought they would and Seale then mentioned the name of William May—it was merely proposed on that occasion that he should be employed to assist them—we then made an appiontment to meet again a few evenings afterwards which we did at Jordan s house—Mott Seale Jordan Sullivan and myself were present and May was introduced—a skeleton-key was produced by Sullivan which was made from the impression which had been taken—they then stated that this key they had tried at the Custom-house—Jordan and Sullivan said they had tried it to see if it would fit—they described that it would partly fit but it being rather weak in the shank they were afraid to force it and they said they would make another key on a stronger principal—at that meeting Mott produced three small padlock keys and said it was likely that one of them would fit the padlock outside the door leading from the esplanade—an impression was taken of those three keys in beeswax and an appointment made to meet again a few evenings afterwards which we did—I was there—Seale May Jordan and Sullivan—Mott was not there—we all met but him—May Sullivan and Jordan said they had tried these small keys and none of them would fit and they mentioned that they considered the best way of doing it was stowing away meaning one of the parties to conceal themselves in the Receivers of Fines and Forfeiture s Office—May volunteered to stow away—they then spoke about which was the best way of effecting this object and mentioned that they would go and inspect the place again for that object to see which was the best method of doing so—we met again at Jordan s house—we were all six present—it was then coming very close to the King s sale and Jordan said they Sullivan Jordan and May should like to know whether the money was actually in the chest or not—and it was spoken of how they should find out whether the money was there or not—it was proposed that one of the parties should purchase a lot at the King s sale and by so doing they would have an opportunity of paying for it in the Receiver of Fines Office and would have an opportunity of seeing the chest and the contents of it—Mott said he had purchased a lot or a friend had purchased a lot for him of twenty gallons of rum—he desired me to tell Sullivan and Jordan so a day or two afterwards and I told them—he said he would give the ticket for the rum to Jordan and he could go and see what the contents of the chest were—he said the Custom-house agent had bought the lot for him—he gave me the ticket which I handed to Jordan to pay for the lot—I gave directions to Jordan to take it to the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures to present it to the Receiver and pay for the lot—he then said he had better first go and see the Receiver to get a knowledge of his person with the intention of following him into the office the first thing in the morning before he could have change in his pocket or drawer to give him for a large note which he intended to present him for payment—an evening or two afterwards we met again—Seale myself Jordan Sullivan and May—all but Mott—Jordan said he had seen the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures and had procured a note which he meant to present next morning to the receiver—he said it was a £50 note—he mentioned some circumstance at the time about having some misunderstanding with the banker on receiving the note that day—we met I believe the following evening which I think was the 26th of November at Jordan s house—he described that he had watched the Receiver in the first thing in the morning a few minutes after nine o clock followed him right into his office and put the ticket down for the fifty gallons of rum and the £50 note—that the Receiver felt his pocket and opened his drawer and had not change as he anticipated —and then the Receiver went to the strong chest and opened one padlock but the other did not open because the key was kept by another party—I think he said he was obliged to wait a moment or two before the party came with that key—that the chest was then opened and the Receiver took the large cash-box with both hands and it was as much as he could do to lift it up on the counter with both hands and from the quantity of gold and notes under the gold there must be upwards of 5000l —he also described that he wrote his own name on the back of the note or the front and gave his own address—he went wnt at that time by the name of William Sullivan but his right name is Leary—he said he wrote the name of Leary No 4 East-lane Kent-road and Mott at the time said it was bad judgement to do so for he said the book in which they kept the numbers of the notes and the addresses of the parties who gave notes on looking at it would lead to certain detection and it was then agreed that the leaves of this book should be cut out or torn out—it was arranged that night that on the following day a little before four o clock William May should conceal himself in the office of Receive of Fines and Forfeitures behind the door that he should go a little before four o clock about seven or eight minutes accompanied by Jordan and Sullivan and at the time of the confusion and bustle of the different officers and clerks leaving the department of the King s warehouse May should take an opportunity of walking into this office and standing behind this door which was left open all night—the door of that particular office is left open all night—it was also arranged that on the following morning at nine o clock which is the legal hour for the different officers to attend at the time the door was open that Sullivan and Jordan should be in attendance on the esplanade and three or four minutes after the door was open and after the watchmen for the night had taken their lamps and walked through the passage leading by the Receiver of Fines Office Jordan and Sullivan were to walk through and give May a sign to come out and Mott should assist them as much as possible by detaining the parties in his office who went in to sigh the appearance sheet—it was also arranged that night that we should meet on the morning of the 28th at Seale s house at New Peckham to divide the money—we then separated for that night—I was absent from duty on the 27th—I had been unwell and was absent four or five days by a sick note—about half-past four o clock on the evening of the 27th Seale called on me at my lodging No 17 Trinity-terrace on his way from the London-dock and about a quarter of an hour afterwards Jordan and Sullivan called—they told me May had been safely lodged and described the manner in which it was done—they said that about ten minutes before four o clock the clerks in the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures Office left their office and two or three minutes after they Jordan Sullivan and May walked into the passage leading from the esplanade throught the Custom-house to Thames-street and took the opportunity by opening an umbrella to cover May and give him an opportunity of going into the office unseen by any parties who stood about—they said they stood about on the esplanade for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour till all the doors were locked for the night—they said Mott was one of the last parties that came out of the warehouse that he on seeing the doors locked and the man safely lodged gave a sort of jump for joy—Sullivan and Jordan stopped at my house about half an hour and went away appointing to meet us the next morning at seven o clock at the Lord Nelson Old-Kent-road to walk across the fields to show us Seal s house at Peckham where we had agreed to meet the following morning—Seal stopped with me till about half-past six o clock—he and I then went down to the place appointed and met Jordan and Sullivan close to the Lord Nelson—we walked across Peckam fields to Seal s house—Seale pointed out the house and we separated—I stopped with Seale a short time that evening at the Duke of Sussex at Peckham Which was close by and from there went to the Castle in the Old-Kent-road—On the morning of the 28th of November I left home about half-past eight o clock and went down to Peckham where I was to meet Seale on the Canal bridge a short distance from his house—I went there and went into the Waterman s Arms there and had some tea and ale and about in hour afterwards I saw Seale close to the Waterman s Arms—I opened the window and he came up-stairs to where I was sitting and we there sat till we saw May Sullivan and Jordan coming across the Canal Bridge towards the waterman s Arms—we then came out and met them and went from there direct to Seale s house—Mott did not come—he remained at his office—we went into Seale s front parlour—May took the money out of his trowser s pocket in bank notes and sovereigns—Seale then brought in some lunch a bottle of stout and so on—May described what took place during the night—he said that shortly after the doors were locked he set to work at the lock Q Did he say where he went to A He was in the Receiver or Fines and Forfeitures office—he said so—he said he first procured the key which opened the Receiver s lock from his drawer which had been described to him by Jordan who saw where the Receiver took it from—he said he then burst the lock open and then opened the chest and took from there the money—he also said he cut the leaves out of the book which contained the numbers and names of the parties who paid money there and he produced the leaves of the book—we looked over them and saw the name of Leary—the leaves were then burnt—we then counted the money—it amounted to 4 700l in notes 122l in gold and about 50l in silver—we then divided the money into six equal lots we tossed up for the choice of lots and after we tossed for the lots we took our different lots and there was then a deduction made by them for expenses by Sullivan Jordan and May there was an odd note left I believe a £20 but I don t know we were confused and in a hurry—I did not see the amount of the note but I think it was 20l —that and the odd silver and two odd pounds in gold they kept for expenses—there was a 50l note with Leary s name on it which he described as the one he gave Mr Walsh and Jordan requested to have that himself and he had it—Mott was not present at the time—Seals kept his lot mine and his own together—he took them up-stairs and put them into a package with the intention of sending them out of town that day—the other parties Sullivan Jordan and May went away each taking their own lot—I met Seale in the evening at the Duke of Sussex and he told me that our money by that time was sixty or seventy miles out of town—he did not say where then—some months afterward he told me it was gone to Leicester—I went down for it by his request and Mott s in February 1835—Seale directed me there to call on his sister-in-law Mrs Donoram and she would give it to me—I went to Leicester and applied to her—she took me to a house some distance off—she went into the house and brought the parcel out and gave it to me—I brought it with me direct to London to my lodging in Trinity Terrace and the following evening I had Seale and Mott with me and I then opened the parcel—it was a small deal box about six inches square—I found the three parcels inside with the initials T S W H and H M written in pencil—we then opened them and we counted our lots separately—they amounted to 745l in notes each lot Q Was that the sum you had allotted to you on the morning of the 28th of November A That was the sum my lot amounted to—Seale did not count his money that morning but I counted mine—Mott and Seale gave me their parcels and requested me to keep them for them which I accordingly did with the intention as they said of getting an opportunity of disposing of the notes Q What did you finally do with their parcels A I gave Jordan part of the money for which he gave us sovereigns deducting 20 per cent —for all notes under 50l which he said were not advertised he said he would take from me at a discount of 20 per cent and I brought him I think 270l —they were altogether out of the three parcels I got sovereigns for them from Jordan and some time afterwards I lead another transaction of a similar kind with Jordan—he undertook or take all the notes I had under 100l which were not advertised at 20 per cent discount—I brought him I think about 1l I met him at a house opposite Astley s theatre kept by Procter and there gave him the notes and a few nights afterwards I met him again and he gave me the gold for them—I gave Seal his share and Mott s share I kept for him—the rest of the money I put into a parcel in a tin case and concealed it in Camberwell church-yard where it remained for some month buried in the ground—I had changed my residence shortly after time—a few months after this Seale told me we had better try and get rid of the remaining part of our notes and he said he knew a man who was trustworthy who would go on the Continent and circulate them—he mentioned his name Henry Morrison—he said he know where he lived and would take me to him—I went with him to Henry Morrison s house and saw Morrison—Seale mentioned the subject—Morrison said he would consider of it and give us an answer in two or three days—we appointed to meet him in two or three days at the Leopard coffee-house near London-bridge—we met him there and it was agreed that we should give him part of the notes and allow him 30 percent for circulating them on the Continent—I brought him part of the notes a few nights afterwards to his house—I brought him three of £100 two of £10 and a £5 note—he was absent about ten days on the Continent and brought the gold to my house for the notes—I was then living at Peckham—I gave Seale his share of the gold and kept Mott s for him till he required it—I used frequently to meet Mott on the subject at the Duke of Sussex and he frequently called at my house—I still kept the remaining part of the notes for a few months—in September last I had another transaction with Morrison of the same description—Mott and Seale were privy to that—it was by their consent I gave Morrison more notes and he brought me gold for them from the Continent—I then had three £300 notes left—I was then living at Walworth—I concealed those notes in a cup-board-door at my own house—I bored a hole with a centre-bit in a part of the door near the hinge—I there placed the notes putting a cork on the top to them first tying them round with a bit of white tape and paper—I put the cork into the hole and puttied it over and then painted it—I believe this is the cork and string and it was such paper as this looking at them —I was taken into custody four or five weeks ago—I am not married—a woman lived with me as my wife—she knew I had something concealed there but did not know it was Bank-notes—the three £300 notes were still concealed there when I was taken into custody looking at some notes I did not take the numbers of the notes—my father came over here while I was in custody on this charge and I made a statement to him of what I have told you Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q I collect from what now—I came from Ireland to the custom-house in 1827 and have been employed there till I was apprehended in January last—I was a you say that you are a native of Ireland A Yes my father lives there landing-waiter the same as Seale—I am about thirty-two years old—I had no employment before I went to the custom-house—I lived with my parents in Ireland—Seale and I became acquainted through my joining the Custom-house and we quarrelled six or seven months after we became acquainted which was three or four months after I went to the Custom-house—it was open quarrel—we had no intimacy for some years after the difference—the reconciliation began about June 1834—the steps for this robbery commenced very shortly after our making it up—we became very intimate friends immediately after the reconciliation—I was not living with Mrs Godfrey in June—I was living in Lime-street City—Dr Farrant was my landlord—I went from his house to Ireland and when I came back I went to lodge with Mrs Godfrey—she did not know me before I went to lodge there to my knowledge—Dr Farrant knew me before I lodged with him—I think he brought me a letter of introduction from a friend of mine—he knew a relation of mine Dr Huey who lived at No 12 Lime-street before he went to live there and he had been my doctor before I went to lodge there as I had been ill—I went to Ireland on leave of absence—my father requested me to come over to see him—he is a collector of customs at Drogheda—I got into no trouble in Ireland at that time—I returned about the 4th of September—I knew Mott as a clerk by sight but not otherwise until June 1834—I knew nothing of him till he was introduced to me by Seale for the purpose of committing this robbery—the first interview to plan the robbery was at the Three Kingdoms in Harp-lane—I went there with Seale—Mott was sent for by Seale and come—we held various meetings at that house—the Duke of Sussex the Royal Mortar and the Castle were generally our places of meeting—we generally met of an evening after the Custom-house business was over—nobody was present at the first meeting but Seale and Mott—the conversation was between us three Q Was the whole plan arranged there or was it only just suggested A It appeared as if the conversation was an old one between Mott and Seale—Seale proposed breaking open the chest to me—I was rather willing and acquiescing in it—I cannot recollect whether I hesitated about it or not—I did not say I would not mix myself up with it—it was all that time in contemplation till November—we have frequently been seen together at the Duke of Sussex kept by Mrs Gurney—her son-in-law has seen us there continually—I do not know whether he is here—he acted as landlord—I do not recollect his name—he used to bring liquor into the room—we took care that nobody should hear our conversation on this subject—Peck keeps the Royal Mortar—he waited on the customers and knew as very well and also the man who keeps the Castle—we occasionally met there as well as at other houses—Mott was not present at all the meetings Q Will you swear he was ever at any conversation except at the meeting when Seale sent for him from the Custom-house A Yes several and they were in the evening—I kept no dates—the robbery was to be done on the 27th—I did not point out the mode by which it was to be done—I was a sharer and accessory—I did not take any part in pointing out how it might be done for I was never in the Receiver s Office in my life where it is now situated—the office was originally differently situated—it has been lately removed to the King s Warehouse and in that office I never was in my life—I could not furnish any means how it could be accomplished Q Did you know any thing of the use of cracksmen and such phrases A I was not acquainted with them at first—I judged what they meant by stowing away—I fancied what a cracksman meant but did not know to a certainly—I did not know what it was till it was explained—I asked Seale what it meant—I suspected what it meant and asked to make myself certain—I was never a witness any where before in my life—I never wrote down an account of this transaction since I have made the disclosure I gave an account of it but not before—I made a disclosure to my father and Mr Rowan a friend at the same time—I was in custody at the time it was not written down then it was first written down I think about the 23rd or 24th of January—I was then in Giltspur-street complete—Mr Rowan took some notes of it and some days afterwards Mr Walford and Mr Hobler took it down Mr Rowan has been a friend of mine for years—he took down what I had to disclose with a view to make a full disclosure to his Majesty s Customes it was to have the particulars of my disclosure for the purpose of detection—I requested Mr Rowan to goto the Commissioners and say I would make a full disclosure and confession of my guilty knowledge of the transaction—he took it down because he said he could not know what it was unless he did take it down Q did you give the account to save yourself or for the purposes of justice A My object in doing it was for the purpose of saving Mr Rowan from blame which might be attached to him for his friendly conduct towards me and in the next place as a sort of justice to my father and family for the disgrace I had brought upon them—as to myself I said at the time I should have no mercy for I should be transported for life—my family first knew of it when my father came to town—that was about the 19th of January—my father knew nothing of it from me till I was taken up—he was on his way here and came to town the day I was apprehended—I made a full confession of every thing at the time and Mr Rowan took it down in writing—he took a note of it and I afterwards gave it to Mr Hobler and Mr Walford—Mr Hobler took down the whole of it from the beginning to the end as near as I can recollect—I told him the same as I have repeated here to-day as near as I can recollect—Jordan and Sullivan came to me at my own house on the 27th and remained there half an hour—Jordan Sullivan and May came to me at the Canal-bridge on the 28th—we then proceeded to Seale s house—we had to go about 100 yards from the Canal-bridge a woman waited on us at the public-house before we went to Seale s—I have not seen her since to my knowledge—there was nobody in the house but Seale and myself—we sat in a room below and when we saw the other parties coming across the Canal-bridge we came out and met them—I saw nobody but Seale when we got to his house—I did not see Mrs Seale she might have been in the house but I did not see her—Seale went on before and had the door opened—Seale told me he did up the parcel that was sent to Leicester—Mott had a portion of the money—on my coming back from Leicester in February 1835 with the parcel it was opened and the seals broken—that was at Mrs Godfrey s in Trinity-terrace—Mrs Godfrey did not see it done—Seale Mott and myself did Q May I ask you why you kept this in your mind till January when you were apprehended did you mean never to disclose it if you had not been apprehended A I do not know that it is a question I can answer—I might have been induced to disclose it but I cannot say I would not nor that I would—being apprehended I disclosed it at once for the reasons I have given—I frequently dined out—I occasionally dined at house nobody knew I had the money—the woman I lived with knew I had something concealed she did not know what it was I had before that put in the church-yard I know a person of the name of Bevan—I deposited a box with him in November 1834 I think it was a day or two before the 27th the box contained private documents and things of mine some papers and other things Q What other things A I do not know that I am obliged to answer—it was before the robbery—unless I am obliged to answer I decline—it cannot criminate myself—it has no connexion with this matter COURT You say you have no apprehension of its criminating yourself A It may in one sense of the word it does not at all belong to this case MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q I ask you on your oath to tell me what the box contained which you deposited with Mr Bevan a day or two before the 27th A Unless obliged by the Court I cannot answer because in one sense I may criminate myself—I have got the box from him again—it might be a month or two afterwards it was before I was taken up—I have kept it in my possession ever since—I do not know that I have it now—I have never been accused of taking money from any man—we had a landing-waiter named William Pitlam belonging to the Customs—we very rarely kept company—we did not spent out evenings together—I used to be with him on business at the London Docks—I was with him twice on an evening—I was never charged with having a 5l note of his not a book—I dined with him one day—Seale brought him one evening to dine at my house—he and Seale both went away tipsy—there was never a dispute about a 5l note that evening—I never said I had shaken him of a 5l note—I do not know what shaking means—I recollect nothing whatever about it—I never said I got a 5l note by shaking him against a wall—Mr Rowan has been a very zealons friend of mine for some years—I have already stated that my motive for making confession of my guilty knowledge of this transaction was a sort of feeling to make some sort of compensation to my father for the ruin and disgrace I have brought upon him and the disgrace I have brought on Mr Rowan and all through his friendly feeling towards me and thinking I was innocent he did commit himself—that was the feeling that dictated my confession to them Q Do not you expect to be saved yourself A I do not know what to expect—it was no expectation of that kind that induced me to make a confession—perhaps I may be saved to a certain extent—I have not been told that I shall not by any body—I believe to a certain extent that I may be saved COURT Q Do you expect to be benefited by giving evidence A I do not expect to be benefited MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Do not you expect to be saved from punishment by it A I cannot say but I do expect it may be less—I may expect to be saved to a certain extent because my punishment may be mitigated—I cannot know what will happen—I do not know whether I shall be indicted and tried—I have never thoroughly considered the matter—I do not know what the consequences will be—I believe and think that perhaps my punishment may be mitigated Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are you a married man A No I am not nor ever was—I have left nobody in Ireland who I called my wife Q Nor any children you call yours A Not legitimate children—I never lived with any body as my wife except the woman in England that I swear the children were at Drogheda—I think I have had only two—I have had the credit of having two—I cannot positively say they were mine—my father is a collector of the customs at Drogheda and lives in the Custom-house—considerable responsibility is entailed on him in that situation when the men proposed to me to rob the Custom-house at Drogheda I told them there was nothing to rob—that is the reason I did not disclose that to my father—there was very little property in the Custom-house—the money does not remain there it is sent to London every week—that was the reason I did not disclose it to my father—I did feel disgusted at the proposal—I did not think any thing of the kind would take place—I do not know whether there was property in the Custom-house of Dublin—I was not acquainted with it—I do not know how long my father was collector of the Custom-house at Drogheda—I should think he has been so twenty-four or twenty-five years—I have been about eight years in the Custom-house—I entered at a salary of 200l a year and at the time of the robbery I had 250l —I had no perquisites except for seizures—they would not average 50l a year—that was the way I lived and the only way—I am no business Q Am I to understand you derived money from no other source A No I should say no profit from any other source—I have often gambled a good deal and have often won 100l and lost 100l —what I might win one day I might call mine but it was not profit—I never gave a different account of this transaction to the best of my knowledge to any body never to my recollection—I have known Jordan and Sullivan eighteen or nineteen months—in my examination before the surveyor-general Mr Manning I said that I did not know them—that was not true—it was not on oath it was before I was in custody—I was only examined once before Mr Manning—I was asked if I knew them and I said I did not—at that time I had known them longer than twelve months—Mr Worthington was present at the examination—they were both present when I said I did not know Jordan or Sullivan Q You have been talking about a torn leaf what name was on one of the torn leaves —what was the Christian name A It was either William or John I am not sure which—I have said it was William to the best of my recollection—I think I said William Leary—I swore to the best of my recollection COURT Q Do you know whether the name on the note was John or William A I do not know whether it was John or William positively MR PHILLIPS Q Did you see the note A I did and saw the name of Leary on it—I do not recollect which Christian name it was—there were some bank-notes concerning which I was questioned by Mr Manning which it was alleged I had received from Jordan—Mr Manning asked me to account from where I got these notes—I said to the best of my recollection I got them from a gaming-house—I have seen Mr Manning here to-day—I said I had won a sum of money at No 1 Leicester-square and perhaps I might have got them there—I said I thought I had got them there—I do not think I said positively that I had got them there Q Did you hesitate about having taken them there till Mr Manning showed you the house was not open at the time A I said I might have got them there—to the best of my recollection I did not say positively—I did not say that Captain Jones was with me that night—I said that Jones had been there with me—I mentioned No 1 Leicester-square without the slightest hesitation—I said I might have got them there—that was the word I used COURT Q What was it you said A I said at that time I had won a sum of money at No 1 Leicester-square an I might have got them there but it turned out the house was not open at the time but the party who kept that house kept one close to it MR PHILLIPS Q Is that house in the same street or square A Not one hundred yards off—it is in Leicester-place Leicester-square—they are Jews who keep it—I gave that house as No — Leicester-square—there is a gaming-house in Leicester-place—that is the house I spoke of—to the best of my recollection they kept the house at that time—I have been in a great many gamin-houses within the last twelve months—perhaps a dozen Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q I think you spoke of a conversation you had with Jordan on the 26th of November the day before the robbery—was it on the 26th of November to which the conversation referred about the £50 note —was it the 26th or not A The conversation about the £50 note and having given it to Mr Walsh was on the 26th of November—that was the note he wrote his name and address on MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q When were you taken up A I think about the 15th of January—I made the disclosure on the 21st of January—till then I had denied all knowledge of them—my father arrived in London on the first day that I was brought before the magistrates—I don t know the date—it was before the 21st of January—I first confessed in Coldbath-fields prison before my father and Mr Rowan—my father was very much distressed on account of my situation—it was after the 21st of January that I was first examined on oath—I then made a disclosure and stated in substance what I have stated to-day—I disclosed to Mr Rowan where the money was concealed—that was when I was at Coldbath-fields COURT Q Will you repeat to me what was told you—you any Jordan and Sullivan came to you in the afternoon of the 27th of November A Yes about a quarter before five o clock—they told me that about seven or eight minutes before four o clock they Sullivan Jordan and May watched the clerks out of the Receiver of fines and-forfeitures office and that they took an opportunity by standing together and putting up an umbrella for the purpose of covering the person of May from any persons that might be standing about so that he might go into the Receiver of fines and forfeitures office which they did and then went on the esplanade—they did not describe to me exactly what May did while the umbrella was flashed up MR PHILLIPS Q Did not one of them tell you while the umbrella was open May walked into the office and closed the door A They said he went into the office—they did not say how he got in—they said he walked into the Receiver of fines office and they came away—I don t trecollect that they said whether he or they closed the door or any thing about it GEORGE FRANCIS ROWAN I am a searcher and tide-waiter of the port of London I have been acquainted with Huey for six years and have known his father about two years—he is a collector of customs for the port of Drogheda in Ireland—since the young man has been in town I have acted as his friend—he sent to me and told me he was taken into custody and I made a communication to his father in Ireland by letter—I saw him at Lambeth-street in custody the first time and I was denied admission afterwards—I did not apply but I knew I could not see him—his father came on the Wednesday night I think—we applied to the Magistrate for an order and got admission to see him—his father appeared in a very dejected and miserable state—he did not make any disclosure the first man I saw him with his father as we were separated by two bars but afterwards by order of the Magistrate we were within the bars and then be made a disclosure to us—I afterwards went to the place of his abode in consequence of a communication he made and searched a cupboard—I saw Mrs Hucy—I made a very minute search before I saw her and found nothing whatever—when Mrs Hucy came in she went to the back part of the cupboard door on the lodge near the hinge—she called for a corkscrew and drew forth a cork—I had not been able to find that cork myself it was painted and puttied over so much that it escaped my observation altogether—when the cork was drawn there was a small paper parcel with something tied round it and notes in it—these are the notes produced —my signature is on them—I marked them at the time—they are No 7988 dated 4th October 1831 300l No 2309 dated 14th November 1831 300l and No 2310 dated 14th November 1834 300l I handed these notes to Mr Hobler and took a receipt for them Q Had you and the father before you went to see the young man in prison any interview with the Commissioners of the Customs A I think I saw one of the Commissioners on the Monday previous—I told them on the Tuesday that I had seen Hucy twice—I saw one of the Commissioners before the Wednesday on which I went and received the disclosure Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Had you any authority from the Commissioners to make any communication to him on the subject A I had no authority from them to make a communication—I told one of the Commissioners I had seen him and begged him to make a disclosure to me as closely as I could but I could not persuade him—I did not make him any promise for any disclosure he was to make—I do not know Andrew Morrison—I had a communication with a person—I do not know who he was—I think I saw him to-day about half-past eight o clock when I drove by here—I did not make him the offer of a free pardon to give evidence—I said I would try to get him one—I did not see any Commissioner of Customs till afterwards—I think was last Monday night—I have been intimate with Huey ever since 1830 Q Did you make an offer to a strange man of a free pardon and yet made no offer to your friend with whom you had been intimate so long A Decidedly I did not—I never made any offer to get Huey a situation in the colonies or the West lndies if he gave evidence—I had no authority to do so—I never said so to any person MR ADOLPHUS Q The person to whom you made the proposal you did not see till last Monday week A No that had nothing whatever to do with Huey s confession—his confession was on a Monday in January—the evidence of the person I made the offer to was to be given about May WILLIAM BILLINGS I am the King s warehouse-keeper at the Customs I know Mr Walsh the Receiver of the fines—I deposited four £100 notes with him about the 19th of November 1834 a few days before the robbery—I am not certain as to the day—I did not take the numbers myself but I have obtained them from the bankers—I received them from Lubbock and Co —I believe it was a day or two before I gave them to Mr Walsh—I deposited with him the same £100 notes as I received from Lubbock s—I remember the fifty-seventh sale at the Custom-house I was auctioneer on the occasion—I have a book of the sale here Lot 329 was twenty gallons of rum—it was bought in the name of T C Jones—it amounted to the 11l I believe it was sold by the gallon—I know Jones—he sometimes bought for himself and sometimes for other persons—he is a general merchant and buyer at the Custom-house I have given strict orders that no person in my employ should bid for any lot—Mott was one of my clerks and he was within that rule—I have been endeavouring to trace out this robbery almost ever since it was committed—on the 2nd of December I believe I went to the Red Lion in King-street—I was accompanied by Foster Lec and Stace the officers—I saw Jordan and Sullivan there—I saw Jordan first—I was left below with a couple of persons to wait while Lee and the other officers were up stairs securing Sullivan—I was left below to secure Jordan if he should arrive—I heard a disturbance up stairs—I sent the parties with me to assist and in the mean time Jordan came into the house—the landlady gave me an intimation that it was Jordan—he ordered his breakfast and went up stairs—I followed him and when he arrived on the first landing-place he heard the disturbance above stairs and was attempting to come down again—I put a pistol to his breast and told him he was my prisoner and begged he would not move—I called for assistance and somebody came from the party above stairs and secured him—I received the notes for a cheque of 498l odd shillings Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Does your duty take you into the King s warehouse into the room where the chest was kept A No very seldom—I have no duty there COURT Q Your warehouse is exactly on the other side of the lobby A Yes CHARLES HIGAM I am a clerk in the house of Messrs Lubbock the bankers I have my book of November 1834—on the 19th of November 1834 I gave cash for a cheque of 498l 5s —I gave four notes of 100l each Nos 8693 8694 8695 and 8698—another clerk will prove the dates—I only enter the numbers when I pay notes away—the numbers are taken when the notes come into the house ALGERNON BUTTERFIELD I am a clerk to Messrs Lubbock I have an entry of the notes 8694 and 8698—they were both dated October 28th 1834—these are the notes looking at some —they correspond with the entry COURT Q Do you speak to No 8693 A Yes that was dated also October the 28th and 8695 the same—all four were that date WILLIAM KEDGE I am a cabinet-maker In November 1834 I lived at No 3 East-lane Old Kent-road—a person named Leary lived next door to me—I had opportunities of seeing him—the prisoner Jordan is the man—he did not carry on any business to my knowledge—I have also seen Sullivan and Seale there frequently on Sundays—I have seen Huey there at the same time as the others—Leary left that house at the beginning of December 1834—I usually saw these persons there at a late hour in the afternoon—I might say from four to five o clock—I have seen them go out and walking down the garden Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Were you ever inside the house Leary lived in A Yes several times in my business—I was employed in the house by the landlady but not at the time the persons called there—I am quite sure Seale is one of the persons I have seen go there—I believe I have always said so—I can say I have seen him more than once Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What sized house is it A A four-roomed house and a room at the back—I have worked in it both below stairs and up stairs while Leary lived there—I never knew there to be any lodgers in the house—I will not swear there was not Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Can you fix on any day when you saw these persons there A No I have seen them there on a Sunday— Leary came the beginning of November and left early in December —it was not so dark when they came as not for me to see them—it was dusk about four or five o clock—it has never been so dark but I could discover them—they had their hats on when I saw them—I never saw them after the early part of December till I saw them before the Justice—I am a master tradesman—I keep no shop—what I do I do for myself—I was not an acquaintance of theirs at all MR CHAMBERS Q How long did Leary live next door to you before November A Not above two months—these persons came there very shortly after he came to the house—they continued coming till Leary went away COURT Go to the bar and touch the persons you mean The witness here pointed out Jordan and Sullivan Witness I have seen both the other two there more than once—I have seen them there on Sundays Q Often or seldom A Seldom— looking at his deposition this is my handwriting—it was read over to me before I signed it COURT Then you have not given the same account to-day—before you said I have seen Sullivan Mott and Huey there I cannot say I have seen Seale MARY ANN RUDD I am landlady of the house No 4 East-street Kent-road I let that in the Autumn of 1834—I think it was from the latter end of August to about the 1st of December—I let it to a Mr Leary—I have seen him since before the Magistrates—it was the prisoner Jordan—I do not know any of the other prisoners Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When had you seen Leary before to-day A When I was called on—when I was subpoened—I saw him in Wellclose-square JOHN CORDY RICHES I am in the coal and potato trade I lived in East-lane Kent-road—while I carried on business there a person named Leary lived opposite at No 4—that is the man pointing to Jordan —as far as I can recollect he lived there about three months while I was there—he came in 1834 two or three weeks before Michaelmas quarter—I have seen Sullivan and Mott go there and I have every reason to believe I have seen Seale—Sullivan lived at that time at the bottom of what I believe is called Stamford-place going out of East-lane directly opposite my house—I served Leary and Sullivan with coals and vegetables while they lived there—my house is called No 3—there are two or three Nos 3 Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Who are the men you have been speaking of as having seen at Leary s A The two middle prisoners I have been constantly visiting at No 4 Sullivan and Mott —I know nothing about Mott besides seeing him backwards and forwards there—I am positive of him—I have seen him continually visiting there—I also feel confident Seale is a man I have seen visiting at the house—I am under no mistake—Mr Hobler applied to me to become a witness here—I appeared at Wellclose-square a few weeks ago—I received 1s with the subpœna MR ADOLPHES Q Were you examined before the Justices there A Yes MARY GODEFREY I live at No 17 Trinity-Terrace Trinity-square Borough Huey lived in my house—he first came to lodge on the 22nd of September 1831 and occupied the two parlours—on the afternoon of the 27th of November Hucy came home from four to five o clock to the best of my knowledge—he came alone—a gentleman came and dined with him—I should know him again—that is the gentleman pointing to Seale —Huey had ordered dinner about a quarter past four o clock and Mr Seale came in while he was at dinner—I cannot say whether he came alone—two other gentlemen called on Huey at the time they were at dinner—I should know them—Jordan and Sullivan are the persons—they staid about a quarter or half an hour—Huey let them out—Seale remained with Huey an hour or two hours—to the best of my knowledge Huey went out with him—I cannot say at what time Huey came home that night—he left home pretty early next morning—I should suppose about eight o clock—it might be before or a little after—I cannot say exactly whether he went out before breakfast—I remember Huey s going into the country at the latter end of January or beginning of February 1835—he went away on Monday morning and returned on Tuesday night—after his return I noticed a small square box and some sealing-wax on it—I saw it in the fire-place in his bed-room—that was the back parlour Q Did you see either of the prisoners at his lodging about the time or before you noticed the box A I cannot say whether it was at the time or before—I saw Sullivan there—a great many called—I cannot say I did see them afterwards—they have all been to Huey s lodgings at different times—I opened the door to Sullivan one night—I have a daughter who attended on my lodgers—I do not keep a servant Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You were examined before the Magistrate A Yes—Huey was ill at my house—I will not swear it was at the latter end of November—he was confined—he came home on the Saturday and remained in about two or three days—he did not go out—that was about the latter end of November—he was confined to his bed two days and the other two or three days to the house—he might have been five or six days altogether ill—he was not all that time in the house—he went out on the Wednesday—he was confined from Saturday to Wednesday MR ADOLPHUS Q About your examination at Wellclose-square were you examined early in the day or late in the evening A Late in the evening—Huey had key of the street-door to himself—he could let himself in and out without my knowledge—I did not see him sometimes when he went out in the morning until next morning—when he was at home he generally went out about seven o clock in the evening and let himself in MARY GODFREY JUN I live with my mother and assist her in attending to the lodgers—Huey lodged at my mother s in November 1834—on the 27th of that month Mr Seale came to dine with him—while they were at dinner or after two gentlemen came—I did not let them in but I saw them—they are the two farthest prisoners Jordan and Sullivan —it was about half-past four o clock—I have seen the prisoner Mott there—I did not see him there that day—I have on other days before and after that—he came to see Huey—he staid with him when he came—he usually came about five or four o clock—I have seen him come a great many times—I remember seeing the small box—it was burnt JAMES JORDAN In 1834 I was a watchman at the Custom-house I know the persons of Jordan and Sullivan and had know them for some months before the robbery—I saw them at the Custom-house in the course of that year—I had seen them several times at the Custom-house before the time the robbery took place—I should say both in and outside the Custom-house—I cannot say I have seen them inside the King s warehouse—I have seen them about the King s warehouse—I saw them about there after the robbery once or twice—in December 1835 I recollect being in the East-cellar—I saw Huey there and in consequence of something he said I went to Mr Mott land Mott came to the East-cellar to him—Huey had desired me to tell Mott a gentleman wanted to see him in the King s warehouse not to say who it was nor let any person hear—I communicated the message to Mott privately not only in consequence of what Huey told me but I had heard something before—Mott came to him—I was quite close to them when they met—Mott asked Huey how he was—he said he was very bad and he said I am or we are done by God —they then left the cellar and I saw no more of them MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q It was Huey used that phrase A Yes FRANCIS CHARLES HILLERY I am a clerk in the Bank I have an entry of some notes paid to Mr Wood—one was No 7988 dated 4th October 1834 for 300l —it was in payment of a cheque—I paid it to him on the 22nd of October 1834 SAMUEL STERCK re-examined Q You stated that you put out the fires in the officer of the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures is there any fire in the outer office A There was only one fire that I know of—that was in the inner office next to the door as you go in—it is not where the clerk s place is—there is a partition—it is only room but the partition parts it—the fire is in the outer part at first entering the room—the does was fast after the clerks went out of the office—it shuts to with a spring lock—no one was left in the room when I left it not to my knowledge—I am not positive but I rather think the door will fall to on a person going out Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Does the door shut of itself —it has a spring has it not which shuts itself A I am not exactly positive whether it does—it has got a spring-lock MR WALSH re-examined Q Does the door from the outer office into the passage shut by a spring A It does now—believe it did not at that time that is the door leading from the clerk s office to the passage called the outer office CHARLES GEORGE THORPE I reside at Dower s hotel at Calais I have a book in which persons names are entered who come to the hotel producing it —on the 9th of September 1835 I have the name of William Herring entered—I believe the prisoner Jordan to be the person who entered in that name—there was another party with him—there were two together—they requested me to get their passports signed to go into Belgium and to take their places by the coach for Lisle which I did—the entry in the book was made by the parties themselves—here is Williamson John aged 10 merchant native of England usual place of residence England London arrived from Dover and went to Lisle on the 9th the next day —they arrived on the 8th—the other entry is William Herring aged 39 chemist by profession that is what was on his passport native of England usual place of residence London came from Dover —those two persons had their places to Lisle by the coach—they returned to Calais on the 13th and went back to Dover on the 14th by the post-office mail—I saw them on issued the vessel—I saw them write these entries when they came—when they left the entry was in my handwriting Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Which is the man you believe to be one of them A Jordan the farthest from me—I am what is called the commissioner —a great many men came to the hotel in the course of a day I have not a distinct recollection of all the persons that come they slept at the hotel going and coming I can tell by the book how many guests we had that day—only four arrived that day—very possibly we had a great many persons in our house at that time—I only believe Jordan to be one of them—I have been long at Calais and on the continent generally—it is not uncommon for persons of the highest respectability to travel under feigned names—they often give military names—I was not subbpœned to come here—they sent a messenger to bring me here—I was at Boulogne at the time being arrested for debt—I got released and came here COURT Q Have you any recollection at what time of day they came on the 8th A It was towards the middle of the day—they quitted for Lisle about one o clock on the 9th—they returned about eight o clock in the evening of the 13th from Lisle by the evening coach and sailed for England on the 14th and I think about nine or ten o clock in the morning NARCISSE VALLORS DUPONT through an interpreter I am a jeweller and goldsmith and live at Lisle and am a changer of money I changed this 100l note looking at one on the 10th of September 1835—I wrote my name on it three days afterwards—two Englishmen came to my house on the 10th of September from twelve to one o clock to buy a gold watch—after they had examined the watches which I presented to them they chose one and compared it with an English watch—I gave them a gold key to wind up the watch which I had sold them—they afterwards drew out of a pocket-book this Bank-note of 100l and I made one of them sign on the note—he signed his name William Herring —I gave back to Herring he difference of the price of the watch in gold money of France and a Bank bill of 500 francs—William Herring is the furthest prisoner from me Jordan Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Had you seen that person before who came to your shop A Never the next time I saw the same person was in England before a Magistrate—I cannot swear positively that Jordan is the man—he is very much like the person—he has a great deal of analogy with the man I saw at my house—I mean likeness resemblance COURT Q Do you or do you not believe be is the man A I believe he is the man SIGISMUND MESSEL I live at Brussels and am in the employ of my uncle who is a banker there I remember two persons coming to my house on the 11th of September last between one and two o clock in the day—they were Englishmen—they came to change a bank-note—this is the note—I changed it—it has my handwriting on it—it is for 100l No 8694 dated the 28th of October 1834 one of them wrote on it in my presence Mr W Herring Marine P— Dover —here is part of the writing on this note now Marine P— Dover —there is a Marine Parade at Dover—I think Jordan is one of the men who came to me on that occasion—he is the person who wrote on the note according to the best of my recollection Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How long was the person in your sight who wrote on the note A Nearly half an hour—I think it was ten days or a fortnight after the occurrence that I was first called on to recollect about this—I was shewn another person besides Jordan for the purpose of recognising which of the two came to my house—I do not see that the now—I saw that person at Guy s Hospital—his name was not told to me—that was the only person I saw—that was at the end of January—About ten days or a fortnight after I changed the note I sent to London and received a letter from the Custom-house to ask me to give a description of the person—I think to the best of my belief Jordan is the man but I will not swear it MR BODKIN Q When you saw the man at Guy s Hospital did you recognise him as having any part in the transaction A No I said so—my being written to from the Custom-house was the first communication I had about it after changing the note—inquiries were made of me and I gave a description of the person—I came over here in January NARCISSA VALLORS DUPONT re-examined by Mr Clarkson Looking at a gold watch I saw this watch before the Justice here and I had seen it before at Lisle MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you know that watch again or only that it is like the one you saw at Lisle A Herring showed me one like this at Lisle COURT Q I Had you the watch in your hand at Lisle A I do not recollect—I saw it very near but I do not recollect having it in my hands—I did not look at the maker s name or number GEORGE BENNETT I am a clerk in the Custom-house My seat is in the clerk s office in the warehouse keeper s office—Mr Mott sat next to me Q Is there a bar in that office to prevent accidental comers from seeing what is doing in your disk A They can see into the office but cannot get in to the desk—if they raise themselves up they might see what was in the desk but they could see me and the clerks without raising themselves up—Mott could see all I did without any difficulty—I had in my possession a duplicate key of the king s warehouse—it was a large key—I kept it in my desk or drawer—sometimes in my desk and sometimes in my drawer—I occasionally took it home with me—I kept it in my desk by day and took it home at night rolled up in paper—In 1834 I was absent from duty on account of sickness from the 22nd of November to the 2nd or 3rd of December and my key at that time to the best of my belief was in my desk—I had left it at the Custom-house—Seale used to come to my office to Mott just before four o clock as I supposed to walk home with him Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q What is the bar that separates your seat from where strangers would come A An iron bar—merely an iron rail about breast high—any one can look over it and by raising themselves up they could see into the desk—three clerks use the office—Mr Mott Mr Herman and myself and the messenger usually sits there—a stranger would come in but not within the bar—I know Huey by sight just to say good morning —I knew him as a custom-house landing waiter—I did not see him about the custom-house much—I have seen him in our office if he came in to ask any questions—I do not recollect having seen him in our office—I have seen him about the custom-house—he may or may not have been in our office—I have known Mott a good while I think he has been there ever since 1829 or 1830—it is a common for two clerks to walk home together—my leaving the key was accidental occasioned by my being ill—it would be visible to any clerk in the office who came there—when I came back from my sickness I found the key where I left it I had the key of my desk I found the key exactly as I left it but I cannot speak positively whether it was in my desk or drawer—I found it in no situation to excite my surprise MR ADOLPHUS Q Was it left in a desk or drawer where persons coming accidentally would not have across A Persons had no business at the drawer—it was my private drawer—no person could have occasion to see it in my desk—it was not given to any one to do my work while I was away—I left it—locked up or out of night and found it exactly as I supposed I had left it—it was wrapped up in paper COURT Q Did you leave the drawer or desk locked A The desk was locked I kept the key locked up and found it so—it could not have been removed out of that but by means of a false key FRANCES BRADY I am a boot and shoe maker and live in Cornbury-place Kent-road—I know all the prisoners—I worked for Sullivan and Jordan—I cannot say how long I have known them—I think it was the latter end of 1834—I recollect hearing of the robbery at the Custom-house—I think I knew them before that—I have seen the four prisoners in company in the parlour of the Castle in the old-Kent-road I think it was before the robbery not particularly in company but mixing together as other people—I have seen them frequently at different times—there was a free-and-easy about to take place and I was to take the cahir at Thomas Reynolds s and I invited some of them to go—I gave cards to Sullivan and I think to Seale—I will not be certain but I recollect Sullivan and Seale and two or three of them came there on that occasion—I think they came together but I cannot say positively—I was in the room at the time—I think they were not long after each other—it was at Tom Reynold s at the Lion and Lamb at Horseley-down Q Have you ever heard any of the prisoners converse on the subject of the Custom-house robbery A Yes I have at different times—I think I heard Sullivan converse on it—it was the topic of conversation with all persons mixed together—I never heard the prisoners converse by themselves on the question—I heard Sullivan converse on the subject—I do not recollect either of the other prisoners being present at the time but they might have been as it was frequently a matter of conversation—one night I heard Sullivan say there was a number of gold watches there—I said I wondered they did not take the gold watches—he said No diamonds were the things —that a man might put as many in his pocket and walk away unsuspected but he did not speak as if he was connected with it—I thought it was as if he might have read of it—I know Huey—I have seen him at this place at the same time as the prisoners frequently COURT Q You have pointed out Jordan by what name did you know him A I knew him as the brother of Thomas Sullivan—I cannot say that I heard him called by any name but I was given to understand he was the brother of Thomas Sullivan—I knew Sullivan by the name of Sullivan - - MYERS I am a constable belonging to the Sessions-house of Southwark I know Mott and Sullivan and I know Jordan by sight but not by name—I have known Mott many years—for some time before the robbery at the Custom-house I was frequently in the habit of visiting public-houses in the neighbourhood—I have seen Sullivan and Mott together at the Royal Mortar in the London-road dept by Mr Peck—I know Huey—I saw him once in company with Mott at the Royal Mortar I know the Castle in the Old Kent-road—I believe it is kept by Mr Smith I have seen Sullivan and Jordan there together frequently—I cannot call to mind how many times—I know the Lion and Lamb kept by Tom Reynolds—I have seen Mott and Sullivan there together—I know the King s Arms in Blackman—about two or there years ago I recollect seeing Sullivan there by himself Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q The Royal Mortar is near the Circus is it not A Yes in the London—road—it is a place persons may very likely go to after the entertainment at the Circus—Mr peek helps the house—it had a coffee—room used by respectable gentlemen—it may he twelve months ago that I saw Mott with Sullivan at the Lion and Lamb—I merely guess the time—I have known Molt for many year to he a respectable man MARY ANN DUGGINS I live at the Castle in Old Kent-road—I was there in September 1831 and staid till the middle of January 1835—I have seen Sullivan and Jordan there and Seale—I knew Jordan by the name of Leary he was frequently there—I have seen them there frequently together—I have seen Huey there with the three prisoners of an evening in the public room Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q When did you leave the Castle A Last January twelve months I waited in the room chiefly—there was a boy but he did not wait unless I was out of the way JOSEPH NATHANIEL BORGUIS My mother—in—law keeps the Duke of Sussex at Peckham I conduct the business for her—we entered the house on the 27th of September 1834—I know the prisoners Seale and Mott well but not the other two—I have seen Huey at our house likewise—I have seen them there together—they were in the habit of using that house before we took it—they occasionally used it down to the time of their being apprehended but Huey did not quite so long—Seale living close by used to come almost every evening—Mott usually came once a week—on Sunday mornings they would perhaps meet together with two or three other gentlemen belonging to the Custom—house when I opened the house after church time and take a glass together before taking a walk before dinner—they did not dine at our house—they walked home to dine—Mott has not been there much latterly nor Huey—at first he used to be more constant—they have come to our house separately and very often together—they left as often separately as together—both ways HOPPER BANKS I am a clerk to Messrs Prescot and Co of Thread-needle—street I know the prisoner Jordan—the first time I saw him was on the 3rd of April 1834—I have a memorandum of it—he came by himself and introduced himself by the name of John Leary—he said he had got some money that he had lately arrived from America and had got some money in his pocket Which he wished to leave with us for safety—I spoke to Mr Prescot and he reluctantly allowed me to take it in—we have a receipt account and a cash account at our house—the receipt account is one in which the party draws money out of the sum he deposits and gives back the receipt he has had and takes a fresh one—the cash account is where they deposit money and draw cheques—his was a receipt account at first—we do not take cash accounts unless somebody introduces the party—nobody introducing him I gave him a receipt account only—at the time of giving this receipt account he entered his name in a book which I have here produced He at first wrote his name John Leary —he told me he had no lodging at that time but he afterwards gave me his address St Great Suffolk-street Borough —he wrote that himself—I saw him write both—he afterwards drew out a portion of the money on the receipt account—on those occasions I took back his old receipts and gave him back fresh ones for the balance—I always did it myself except once—these are the cheques be drew on the receipt account looking at them —this is the first receipt I gave him—it is for 700l —he put his name on every one of them—here are five in all four of my own—after a time his receipt account was turned into a cash account—I did not do that myself—he afterwards drew cheques on our house—I cannot say whether he sent them ready drawn or filled them up in my presence—these are the cheques he drew on his cash account—there are six of them—they are paid—I only paid three of them myself Q Take this £50 note No 14803 dated the 30th of October 1834 in your hand and look at the name of John Leary on the front and back of it—by the Knowledge you have of Leary s handwriting do you or not believe that to be his handwriting A I do I believe the handwriting on this £20 note No 5439 dated the 4th of October 1834 to be Leary s—and I believe the name of John Leary East—street Kent—road on these two £5 notes Nos 10375 and 6 dated the 23rd of August 1834 to be his handwriting Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you form your judgment of Leary s handwriting from comparison of handwriting you see here or from the documents themselves A By seeing him write and seeing the cheques—I have seen him write several times—five or six times or oftener—I am sure I have seen him write as often as that—his first account was 700l —that was paid in April 1834—all the cheques but one bear date antecedent to the 27th of November 1834 and that bears data on that day—I do not know any thing of the £50 note—it was never in our hands to my knowledge—Leary s account was changed to a cash account by his coming back wards and forwards several an introduction—we do not take cash accounts in the first instance without an introduction—we changed it from the fact of his having paid money in and his apparent regularity in paying in and drawing out MR ADOLPHUS Q You say all the cheques but one were drawn before the 27th of November was that one drawn for the whole of the balance you had in your hands A I did not pay this cheque—it is dated the 27th of November—I belive we bad no money left in our hand after that cheque was paid but Mr Hornby will prove that—it is for £450 BENJAMIN HORNBY I am a clerk to Messrs Prescot s I paid this cheque dated the 27th of November—this was the balance of Leary s account—these are the notes in which I paid the balance loooking at four £160 notes and one of £50 which was No 14418 26th of July 1834 Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q This £60 in one of the notes you paid to the person who drew out this money on the 27th of November 183l A It is—I believe the prisoner Jordan to be the person I paid it on—I have not the least doubt of the day on which I paid it—it was on the 27th—I am quite sure I did not pay it before the 26th MR BODKIN Q Look at these two £5 notes—did you pay them from your banking-house to any cheque drawn by Leary A Yes I paid them both on the 10th of October—the cheque was dated the 10th of October and was for 20l —I did not pay this £20 note MR CLARKSON Q Do you know to whom you paid the two £5 notes A To the prisoner Jordan I believe—I have not the least doubt of it—I do not recollect the circumstance but I have no doubt I paid them to him ROBERT LAWSON I am a clerk to Messrs Prescot looking at a book I past this £20 note on the 21st of November 1834 in payment of this cheque drawn by Leary—I do not remember who I paid it to—this man the note No 5139 dated the 4th of October 1834 JOSIAH FIELD re-examined I am a clerk at the Bank I issued this £50 note from the Bank on the 21st of November—it is No 14803 dated the 30th of October 1834—the notes for which that was exchanged were passed to me looking at the £20 and two £5 notes Q Was the £50 note issued in exchange for these notes A We do not take the number and dates of the notes we receive in our office—they are passed on to another office—the cash-book office—on this £5 note I have written Leary six notes 50l —that indicates that I received six notes making together 50l —that the person gave that name and the note on which I wrote must have been one of the notes—the notes would go to Mr Bock at the cash-book office after that WILLIAM BOCK I am a clerk in the cash-book office This £20 and two £5 notes were paid into the bank on the 21st of November in exchange for the £50 note then issued CHARLES JAMES BEETSON I am a clerk in the Bank This p£50 note No 14418 26th July 1834 was brought into the Bank on the 17th of December 1834 in exchange for sovereigns—it is the custom to require the party presenting a note for payment to write their name on the top of the front and on that place is written John Leary East-street Kent-road —I do not know who I paid it to—fifty sovereigns were paid for it in the name of Leary THOMAS WHITE On the 22nd of November 1834 I paid a £10 note to a person named II all—to the best of my belief this is the note—I have got the number date and signature in this book—it is an entry made by myself No 1184 October 8 1834 signed G Ray - - HALL Mr White paid me a £10 note on the 22nd of November 1834 —I paid that note to the best of my knowledge to Mr Walsh at the custom-house on the 26th November WILLIAM LOCK I lived with Mr Tullet from the 14th if February 1834 to the 11th July 1835—I knew the prisoner Sullivan for a short time while I lived at Tullet s—I changed a note for him between Easter and Whitsuntide 1835—at my examination before the Magistrate I stated that it was in July but since I have seen the note and thought it over I found I was mistaken in the date—this £10 note looking at it is the one I changed—I know it by my writing on it which is Mrs Jones 10 North-street William Lock Q How came you to write Mrs Jones 10 North-street A I considered he was a lodger—I asked him what name I should put on the note and he desired me to put Mrs Jones 10 North-street —I considered he was a lodger in her house—I gave the note to Mrs Tullet Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You have referred to a mistake you have discovered—you say when you saw the note first You thought you had received it in July A Yes I said it was on the 5th of July—I looked at the note at the office but since that I have persued the note but I had no opportunity of observing it at the office—it was put into my hands—Mr Clarkson asked me what 5-35 meant and I said it meant 5th of July 1835—but since that I have seen on the face of the note written by Beasly Mr Tullett 15-5-35 —my own name is on the note—Mr Clarkson showed me the note in my hand—I saw my own name on it at the office—I only saw the back of the note—I did not see the face of it—it was laid before me and I perused the back of it but not the face—Mr Hobler s clerk has since shown me the note to peruse the face—he bought I had made a mistake—I intimated to him that I thought I had made a mistake—the 5-35 is Beasley s handwriting—I mistook the date when I said it meant the 5th of July 1835—I was under examination twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour—during that time I never discovered my mistake—I did not look at the face of the note or I should have been better aware—I have not heard since that Sullivan could account for every minute of the day on the 5th of July MR ADOLPHUS Q When you came to the office to be examined was the note shown to you before you got there or was it only put into your hand by me at the office A I was put into my hand by you at the office—it was not shown to me before not was my attention at all directed to it MR PHILLIPS Q When did you inform Mr Hobler s clerk you thought you had made a mistake A A short time after—it was before the prisoners final examination MR BODKIN Q Were you at the last examination A I was not FREDERICK BEASLEY I am a publican I received this note from Mr Tullet on the 15th of May 1835—I have no memorandum on it nothing more than there is here—I have written on it 15-5-38 and my initials B F and Mr Tullet —I always reverse my initials Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Do you know Lock A By sight—I have spoken to him—I never shewed him this note—he has spoken to me about there being 5-35 on the note—he was speaking of it this morning—he has not spoken of it to me before—I never before today gave him any intimation what 5-35 meant JULIANA WORTHINGTON I was formerly a widow by the name of Donaldson Seale s wife is my sister—in November 1834 I was at his house—Leicester was my proper home at that time—I left his house some time in December 1834 to go to Leicester—my sister gave me a parcel to take there and gave me directions what to do with it—pursuing those directions I took it to Leicester and kept it until Huey called for it—I was acquainted with him before—it was in pursuance of my sister s directions that I kept it till he called—he took it away with him—I cannot tell whether he went off to London with it immediately—it was a paper parcel—I could not feel what was under the paper—I took no particular notice of it—I cannot tell whether it was sealed—I returned it to Huey as I received it Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q you were visiting at Seale s A Yes—I cannot tell the day I received the parcel from my sister—Seal s house is not a large not—I took my meals and sat in the same room with them—I do not remember at any time in the month of November there being three or four men in the house with Seale—such a thing could not have happened without my knowledge Q Can you be certain such a thing never happened on a morning in November A I am here on my oath—I must have known if three or four men had been in Seale s house with him on any morning in November—my attention was not called to the contents of the parcel—it was a long time in my possession—it got out of my hands by accident—I sent it by mistake in a box to my dress-maker s—it did not come back to me from her—Huey called for it in the man time and I called for it to get it and delivered it to him MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you call for it before or after Huey came to you for it A I went him to the milliner s to get it—it was a short distance from my house—Huey had no other business with me except to get the parcel—I was not always at home when I was at my brother s house—I was out several days in November and of course could not tell what happened while I was out COURT Can you speak to the latter end of the month at all whether you were out A I was in town—I cannot say whether I was at home every morning for the last week or fortnight in November Jordan s Defence I am perfectly innocent—it is a fabrication of Huey s from beginning to end Sullivan s Defence I have very little to say—the evidence given at Lambeth-street against me was that on the 5th of July I changed the note—I have been at a great expense in finding out where I was that day—since Mr Hobler and his clerks have found that I had witnesses to prove where I was on the 5th of July they have altered it and have brought the men to trace the time further back Mr Clarkson knows that the witness swore that the 5-35 was July—I have been at a great expense finding out where I was that day and twenty or forty witnesses to prove every minute on the 5th of July—it is my opinion Lock was not serving in the bar on the 5th of July and he has found it out—because I sent a letter by a friend of mine to find out whether he was there on the 5th of July and the letter has fallen into Mr Hobler s hands—and that states if he was serving there on the 5th of July to find out what time it was—I sent two letters about it to my father s house—one letter has fallen into Mr Hobler s hands—only one letter has my father received—all Huey has said is false from the commencement to the end Mott s Defence My Lord and Gentlemen I hope and trust you will bear in your minds the evidence of Huey—as it regards myself every thing he has stated it false—I am innocent of the charge Seal s Defence I have nothing to say—I leave it in your hands and the gentlemen of the Jury—I can only say what Huey has stated is entirely false from beginning to end PETER M PHERNON In September last I lived at No 146 Rateliff-highway at Robinson s an undertaker I was at Barnet races that month—I think Tuesday was the last day of Barnet races—I do not know the day of the month—I was there the last day and I saw the prisoners Jordan and Sullivan there—I have no recollection of seeing such a bill as this looking at one —I was in my own cart Jordan and Sullivan were both on horseback—when I left the races they rode upon the horseback alongside of my cart—I was in my cart and one of them in each side—I stopped at a public-house at Holloway on my way home and they both stopped with me—I do not know the sign—I recollect a person being there who stated that he could jump of his knees on to his feet further than anybody else—I said he could not—they laid a wager for a glass of brandy and water and I jumped against him and beat him—on that night the ostler said something to me insulting but at the present moment I do not recollect the words and I struck him in some part of the face I do not exactly know where—and we were parted by these two persons riding their horses across us—my lad left the house with me and those two persons on horseback—the same two persons who had rode up with me from Barnet—I know the angel at Islington—I have no recollection after leaving the house which I consider was Young s at Holloway—I conceive I was inebriated and have no recollection of what passed MR ADOLPHUS Q What are you by trade or business A A cheesemonger—I do not keep a shop—I was not keeping one then—I have a very good connexion whom I supply—I sarve them privately and have done so for many years—I went to Barnet races for my own pleasure—I have known Sullivan three or four years and the other not so long—it might be two years—I knew one by the name of Thomas Sullivan and the other I always understood to be William Sullivan—I have known Jordan it may be year or perhaps two from this time—I should not like to swear I have known him more than a year—he was not introduced to me by the name of William Sullivan—I never had any introduction more than seeing him go through Whitechapel—I never had any introduction to him nor any direct method of speaking to him till the last Barnet races—which I think was about the middle of September last—it is the last Barnet races I am speaking of—a lad named William Bunney was in my cart with me—he is about fifteen or sixteen years old—I had some conversation with the two persons on the road relative to buying my horse of me—Thomas Sullivan proposed to buy it—we might have had a great deal of conversation—I have no recollection whether my boy joined in the conversation—they both spoke to me about the horse and about buying it—I rather think my boy went into the public-house with me at Holloway—I have no recollection of his going in but I rather think he did—the horse and the cart was outside and I don t think it was put up but I cannot tell—the only recollection I have afterwards is that I came out and got into the cart and went directly home as straight as I possibly could—my home was in Cannon-street-road at that time—Gentlemen I wish to make one observation I have lived in Ratcliff-highway for ten years but did not live there at that time on account of a slight difference between some persons and I lived in Cannon-street-road about eight or nine weeks—I now live at No 146 Ratcliff-highway at the undertaker s where I lived before—I had a quarrel with him and went to Cannon-street-road and now have came back—my boy was only with me there two or three days MR CLARKSON Q How long had you lived in Ratcliff-highway before you had the disagreement and went to cannon-street A Nearly ten years WILLIAM BUNNEY I was with M Pherson at Barnet races on a Tuesday in September last—I know the person of Sullivan and I think Jordan—I saw them at Barnet races—I went with M Pherson in his cart—those two gentlemen were on house-back—when we left fair they left with us—we stopped at the Mother Red Cap at Holloway kept by Young on our way home and Jordan and Sullivan also—while we were there M Pherson was jumping off his knees for brandy and water—the ostler said something to him and he up with his first and struck him and Jordan and Sullivan rode between them—when M Pherson left the house Jordan and Sullivan left also on horse-back and rode with us as far as the Angel at Islington and there separated—I cannot tell the day of the month on which this was MR BODKIN Q Whose employ are you in now A Camber and Grave in Philpot-lane—I had been about three months in M Pherson s service when I went to Barnet races—I was with Mr Bridgeman a tallow-chandler before that—M Pherson is a cheesmonger—I went from Mr Bridgeman to M Pherson—he has no shop—he lives at No 146 Ratcliff Highway he lived at Mr Drew s in Cannon-street-road about a week after I went into his service and continued there till we went to Barnet races—that was nearly three months—I staid in his service about a month after I had been to Barnet races—he continued in Cannon-street-road during that month—I first saw Jordan and Sullivan on the race-course while we were going on they camp up and spoke to my master about buying his horse—they appeared strangers to him—I went into the Red Cap and drank something the horse was put up—the blow was given to the ostler just as we were coming away GEORGE LYNN I am under-ostler to Joseph Young The last day of Barnet races was on a Tuesday—I cannot exactly say the day of the month—John Carter is the head-ostler—I have no knowledge of M Pherson—I was struck by a person Q Look at the four men at the bar—did you see either of them at your master s on the 8th of September last A Not on the 8th it was the last day of the races—there were two persons there but I cannot swear to either of the prisoners—I have no knowledge of them—a person came to our house that night in a cart with a boy and two persons came up on buy horses—they were there at the time—the ostler was leading the horse about and I was minding the cart—I should not know the man in the cart again—I had a quarrel with him—I asked him for something for the ostler and he was going to hit me with the whip—I let go of the horse picked up a stone and threw at him and he came up and hit me—the two gentlemen on horseback whenever they were rode up between us—one of them offered me some half-pence afterwards to get something to drink and I would not have it who they were I do not know MR ADOLPHUS Q Did the gentleman come back on foot to hit you or how A On foot—he was sober enough to hit me if he had not been prevented—the boy laid still in the cart—there was not much company in the house—there were several persons there besides the two gentleman on horseback—I was not in the house—the horse and cart was not put up—it stood in the road JOSEPH YOUNG I keep the Mother Red Cap at Holloway and have done so for ten years The last day of Barnet races last year was on Tuesday the 5th of September—I gave this bill of the races to Mr Humphreys the attorney for the prisoners—I was at home on the last day of Barnet races—Jordan and Sullivan were there that night—they called at my house on their way to the races—I had gone up to dress in the morning from ten to eleven o clock and they were taking refreshment in the kitchen when I cam down—I know Mr Alpha and his wife—they came there in a one-horse chaise while Jordan and Sullivan were taking refreshment—many persons called on their way to the races—Jordan and Sullivan went away on horseback—I went to the races myself in a one-horse chaise—my brother James went with me—I saw both of the prisoners at the races riding on horseback and I saw them in the booths—I saw M Pherson at the races—that was the first time I saw him—it was a very wet day indeed—I left directly the races were over to be at home before the company—I got home I should think about seven o clock—after I got home both Jordan and Sullivan came about eight o clock on horseback—M Pherson came in his cart with a boy there was a wager of a glass of brandy and water about jumping from his knees to his feet—M Pherson won—I know White of Kentish town I believe he was there—Jordan and Sullivan left as near eleven o clock as possible as we were shutting up at the time—Carter my principal walked their horses about the under ostler was minding the cart I was at the door when M Pherson went away—I was not near enough to see whether he paid the under-ostler but I observed him hit him with the whip and the under-ostler threw a stone at him—he then left the cart in the road with the boy and returned and struck the lad on the nose I think for he was bleeding and the two gentlemen on horseback rode in between them and parted them—I had seen Jordan and Sullivan perhaps once or twice before but not to know them—I saw them once afterwards I think at Croydon fair Q Are you perfectly sure or do you entertain a doubt that these are the men A I have not the least doubt in the world of it—this is a bill of the races MR CHAMBERS Q How often have you seen them since the Barnet races A About three times or hardly that—I don t know that I have ever seen hem since but at Croydon fair which was about the 3rd of October I think but I am not positive to the day if I have it is not more than once to know them—I saw them yesterday in court in the morning part when Mr Forrester gave me an order signed Mr Sheriff Lainson—it was about eleven or twelve o clock I believe—I was here perhaps half an hour—I was in and out several times in the course of the day—I did not hear the evidence for the prosecution—the reason I left was because I could not get beyond the bar—I did not know the names of the persons when they were at my house—I am not the Richard Young who is the clerk of the course—the names of the two persons were mentioned at my house in the evening but I think both went by the name of Sullivan—I understood them both to be called Mr Sullivan—I was at Barnet races the year before—I did not see them there then—nor M Pherson—I did not know him till that day—I have seen him once since that was yesterday—he was not pointed out to me—at least I knew him the moment I saw him from his conduct that night—I was in the room the principal part of the time the parties were there—I do not go to many races—sometimes to Epsom and Ascot and generally to our own races—I go to very few fairs I went to Croydon fair for pleasure—I was at Fairlop fair last year for pleasure and it was for pleasure that I went to Ascot and Epsom—my family look after the business when I am away FREDERICK ALMER My brother keeps the Coach and Horses in St John-street I was at his house on the last day of Barnet races in September last—I saw the two farthest prisoners Jordan and Sullivan at my brother s that night about half past eleven o clock—from eleven o clock to half-past—they took something—they were in company—they came on horse-back and remained about two hours and left on horse-back—I recollect that Jordan and his horse fell down together—I should day he had taken rather more than I should like to take myself generally—I helped him up again—I should think the horse had injured him—he complained of some part of his limbs being injured by the horse falling down on him—I went with them when they went away—I went on Jordan s horse—I rode in front of him—I think I had got on Jordan s horse before he fell off—the natural consequence of his coming down was my coming down too—I got up again and went to the Saloon in Piccadilly—Frederick Chandler is my brother s barman—I know Samuel Evans—he is called Dutch Sam the pugilist—I believe he was at the Saloon that morning—we remained there till about six o clock in the morning—Jordan and Sullivan remained there till I left—they then mounted their horses and left FREDERICK CHANDLER I was barman to Mr Almer who keeps the Coach and Horses in St John-street in September last I recollect Jordan and Sullivan coming there the last day of Barnet races—they went away about half-past one or two o clock—they had some brandly and water to drink—Frederick Almer was there at the time and went away with them—went on horse-back—I am not in Almer s service now WILLIAM LOWDEN I am a watchmaker and live in Great Surrey-street Blackfriars-road I have seen the further prisoner Jordan —I know this watch looking at one —I have had it through my hands to repair for the further prisoner—I do not know him by name—not by any name—the last time I had it I entered it in my book—the entry is my own—it is the maker s name—it came into my hands between the 8th and 14th of September—I should say about the 11th or 12th—I received it from the prisoner at the bar—the heading of the page of my book commences on the 8th of September and the heading on the next the 14th—it must have been done between the 8th and the 14th—this is the last item on the page—I have not taken down the number but the maker s name—I was paid 2s 6d for what I did to it—I can tell the day it was returned here is 1253 in the margin of the book and on turning to that No in another book I find entered Friday 18th of September it was returned then and 2s 6d paid I know that from the corresponding number and 2s 6d being the same No as is entered in the margin of the entry—the entry is my own writing—I know nothing of the man except being employed by him—I have not seen him since to my recollection—I have been a watchmaker and housekeeper above twenty years MR ADOLPHUS Q I see this watch is entered in this book very low in the page quite at the bottom A Yes it is the book does not denote the time I received the watch—this memorandum was made when it was repaired—it might be in my house three or four days before it was repaired—the entry does not indicate when it came in—I cannot say when it was brought to me—I do not know what was done to it it was some trifling job I believe—it is possible it might have been brought on the 14th and repaired the same day but more likely a few days previous JOHN CARTER In September last I was head ostler in Mr Young who keeps the Mother Red Cap at Holloway I remember Tuesday the last day of Barnet races attending two gentleman who came on horse-back—they left to go to the races and returned in the evening on the same two horses—I remember a man coming with a cart—George Lynn was the under ostler—he had the care of the cart—Lynn was struck by the whip instead of being paid by the man in the cart—he jumped out of the cart and came to him and struck him on his head—the two gentleman with the saddle-horses interfered to separate them—I cannot tell who they were—I cannot announce whether the prisoner were either of the gentlemen on horse-back MR ADOLPHUS Q Did the persons on horseback go away on their horses A Yes WILLIAM FAIRCLOTH I am a searcher of goods at the Custom-horse and docks and a landing-waiter When a man is employed as landing-waiter to a vessel there is a regular paper called an appearance-paper kept at the different stations for cach man on duty to write his name and the time at which he comes—it shows the time at which he leaves in the afternoon—the sheets are made up to consist of the six days of the week—they are certified by certain persons as to the regularity of the papers at the close of the week—I know Seale and know his handwriting Q Look at the appearance-sheet and tell me whether on Friday the 28th of November you find he is entered as coming there and at what time A I have it—from the sheet I should say he was there at nine o clock and left at four—the sheet is certified by the persons whose duty it is to certify the truth of it—Leach and Findley are the officers who certify—the person who is stated to be there at nine o clock must have been there punctually at that time or before MR BODKIN Q The paper shows he signed his name at nine o clock and at four—you cannot gather from that that he was there the whole of that time A Certainly not—I know that a person named Cater a landing-waiter did his duty for him that day—I have no knowledge of Seale s leaving after he signed the paper—I did not see him COURT Q All you know is he has signed his name there A Yes MR BODKIN Q When Seale was there would his duty bring him to the place where you were employed A I did not see him that day—if he was on duty that day he would have to perform his duty where I was—he was not at the ship that he was appointed to that day which was the Two Brothers—I superintended that day and he was not there—Cater was MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q What time did you go to the Two Brothers A I imagine about eleven or twelve o clock—I cannot be certain of the time but I should say in the forenoon—I did not remain there till four o clock I have the jurisdiction of the whole dock—I was not in the Two Brothers at all not on board—Seal s business would not be in the ship but on the quay in a box—I was superintending all the ships in the dock that day going round the dock—I left my duty at four o clock—Cater is here—I cannot tell whether it was before or after twelve that I went JOHN CATER examined by MR BODKIN I am in the employment of the Custom-house I remember the morning the robbery was discovered the 28th of November—I know Seale—he was at the Custom-house at nine o clock that morning—I did not see him again till two o clock in the afternoon—I did his duty for him that day MR PAYNE Q Do you mean to say you were appointed to do Seale s duty that day A I did it—he did no duty at the Two Brothers that day—I have always said so—I have never given a different account of the transaction—I never said that I did no part of the duty that was to be done by Seale—I did not see him at my station till two o clock in the afternoon or between one and two—there were two parts of business done that day the examination of toys and the landing of calf-skins—the toys would be examined in front of the box where the calf-skins were weighed on the quay—I will swear Seale did not examine toys that day—he came back to the station at two o clock but did nothing that day that I swear Q Have you never said you could not swear Seale was not there up to twelve o clock in the forenoon of that day A No I am speaking of my station that I was doing duty at—the Two Brothers—I said he was not there till past twelve o clock—I think I said after one o clock—I never said that I could not swear Seale was not there till twelve o clock—I say he was not there The witness s deposition being read agreed with his evidence

value 5s and 2 shawls value 7s his goods THOMAS SPIERS I live in Lark-hall-lane Prospect-place in the parish of St Mary Lambeth On the 12th of April I went out at rather between than half-past two o clock—there are two doors in front of my house and a back-door also—I left nobody at home—one of the front-doors was fastened by a spring-lock and the other was bolted inside chained and locked—I left the one which fastens by a spring shut—I returned at a few minutes after six o clock the same day—I unlocked the door which was on the spring-lock and found the house had been robbed—I found my desk broken open the lock of it was broken—it was in the back sitting-room down-stairs—I cannot say any thing was missing from the desk—the papers were strewed about—I missed my watch from the same room that had been on the mantel-piece—I went up-stairs and found the drawers all open and things taken out—they were all ransacked—four china ornaments were taken from the mantel-piece of the front bed-room and from one back-room sixteen disper napkins three silver coins out of a drawer—two goldseals a key a ring and one pair of drab trowsers from the same room—and a great-coat a dress-coat two pair of trowsers and a waistcoat out of the back-room—the lock of the cupboard down-stairs was broken open we missed nothing from that—I had left all these articles safe—I had my watch in my hand after half-past two o clock when I left the house JOHN PLUMMER I live about a hundred yards from Spiers On the day of the robbery I saw both the prisoners about a hundred yards from my house very near the prosecutor s house—it was about four o clock or a little after—they were holding the fence looking over into the field at the front-part of the house—I went into the garden afterwards and remained there about twenty minutes—I then saw them pass in a direction towards London from Mr Spiera s house—they each had a bbundle I believe I know West had one under his left arm which was next to me by the fence—I am not quite certain that Loscombe had a bundle neither of them had a bundle when I saw them before—I was about ten yards from them—I could see West s bundle better than the other Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Are you quite sure this was on the day of the robbery A Yes the prosecutor s house lays between the Clapham and Wandsworth roads—I remember hearing of a trotting-match in the neighbourhood—that was on the 11th and this was on the 12th—I had seen them on the 11th as well which made me notice them COURT Q Where did you see them on the 11th A In a public-house and they asked me for the newspaper which made me notice them—they were together then JOHN STEPHENSON I am a policeman I had heard of Spiers s robbey—I was on duty in Clapham-road on the 16th of April and saw the prisoners on Clapham-rise together and having the description of the two men from Plummer the moment I saw them I walked by them and watched their manceuvres for a considerable time—I then went home and put on my plain clothes and called Plummer who lived close by me and came to the spot near where I had seen them before—they had been there for an hour and a half—I sent Plummer on first and then I went up and took them into custody on suspicion of being the two men on the Rise and took them to Clapham station-house—I searched them and on West found pocket-book a silk handkerchief three half-pence and a penknife—on Loscombe I found a silk handkerchief a skeleton-key two latchkeys a snuff-box a tabacco-box and a chisel—he said the skeleton-key was the key belonging to his residence and the latch-keys belonged to his door at No 36 New-street Lambeth—I went to the house but could not open the door with the skeleton key—the latch-key I could open it with with difficulty but it was not made for that latch for the latch was a square one and this is not a square—one of them does not fit at all—I took Loscombe s hat off and felt round it thinking there might be something in the lining but there was nothing in it—I put it down close by the side of him and am sure there was nothing in it then—I took a black silk handkerchief off his neck and searched that and put that in his hat or close to it Cross-examined Q Is Clapham-rise far from where the robbery was effected A It is half-a-mile from it—the skeleton-key did not open the door at all—I found his residence correct WILLIAM GEORGE WORRALL I am a policeman I was at the station-house when Stephenson brought the prisoner in—I recollect his searching them perfectly well—I saw Loscombe ss hat taken off—it was placed on a box close by his side—a person in the room took up the hat—I immediately took charge to it and there were six skeleton keys in it—that might he minutes after it was first put down—they were tied up in a small piece of calico—I went to the prosecutor s house and tried the whole of the key and the smallest of the six undid his door very easily indeed Cross-examined Q Were they examined by you at the station-house A Stephenson searched them—there were no other prisoners in custody at the time—there was nobody present but the prisoners and the police GEORGE VICKERSS I am a policeman One Sunday morning some weeks previous to this I forget the date I saw West in the New Cut Lambeth—I saw him go into a house at the corner of Isabella-street and Gibson-street—it was before the 12th of April—I went to that house on the 16th after coming from Union-hall and having a list of the property lost with me I searched and in a small box I found this small seed on the first-floor front room—I shewed it to Mr Spiers—he described the seal he had lost to me before I showed it to him MR SPIERS re-examined This pocket-book do not know—this seal is one I lost—it was on a ring with another seal and a key—there is nothing else that I know Cross-examined Q Is not that rather a common kinds of seal A I bought it for gold—I know it is mine—I have seen seals wish the same motto but I never saw one with a green stone like this nor have I seen one worn like this is which is white at the top—I remarked that to my wife—I said when I described it that there were red spots on it similar to sealing-wax—I have no recollection of saying there were bits of red stealing-wax on it—the Magistrate said the red marks were not sealing-wax but blood stone—I have had it seven years next August—I told the Magistrate what the motto was and about the spots and its being worn Loscombe s Defence I went on this day to see my brother who lives in a gentleman s service in Clapham-road—there was a trotting match and we stopped to see it but it did not come on—we went to the Larkhall public-house and had some dinner—I did not go that way again till Wednesday or Thursday I am not sure which—I did not see my brother then and went again on Saturday—I have two lodgers and each have a key West s Defence I accompanied him in the way he had said to see him relative LOSCOME— GUILTY Aged 25 WEST-

Mellish has lived in my service for the last twenty months as carter—on Sunday the 26th of June I left my premises in care of Charles Lane at eleven o clock in the morning—he is about sixteen years old—the counting-house desks were locked at that time and I had the keys with me—I returned about a quarter before twelve o clock at night and found Lane there and two policemen—I went into the counting-house and found both my deskes broken open and missed the articles stated in the indictment which are worth about 9l —all the articles were safe in the counting-house when I left in the morning except the flute and snuff-box which were in the parlour adjoining—I lost 1l 10s in copper off the parlour-shelf—there were twelve pence I am certain and the rest in halfpence CHARLES LANE I am the prosecutor s servant On the 26th of June I was left in charge of the house—Mellish had been there about six o clock that morning to do the horses—I left the premises at five minutes after eleven o clock—I locked every thing up perfectly safe as I always did and went away—the counting-house door was locked—the parlour door was locked and the street-door and the window were down—I left the key of the gate at Mellish s house to enable him to feed the horses—that would only enable a person to open the gate not to get to the count ing-house or parlour—I came back about half-past ten o clock at night—I got a light and discovered the counting-house door was broken open—I applied to Bishop the policeman and on searching the counting-house found the desks all broken open and the iron chest had been attempted by the marks of a screw-driver which was found driven into the top of it bat it was not opened—I went into the stable and found a crow-bar there which was used to draw the linch-pins of Mellish s cart and was usually kept in the stable—that crow-bar was applied to the marks on the counting house door and matched exactly with it—Bishop applied it—there was a hatchet in the counting-house on one of the desks which matched exactly with the marks on all the desks Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Whose crow-bar was it A Mr Burt s—and the screw-driver is his Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q What time did the prosecutor go out A About twelve o clock—he told me to take care of the premises till I left—I left in five minutes—he knew I should leave then—nobody could get into the stable unless they had the key from Mellish—the crow-bar was in the stable of which he had the key—there are large wooden gates to the premises and Mellish had the key HUGH BISHOP police-constable C 72 On Sunday the 26th of June I was called by lane to Mr Burt s premises about half-past ten o clock—I found the desks broken open and a chopper lying on a small desk which was broken open—I searched round to see if any body was concealed there—I then compared the chopper with the marks on the desk and found they corresponded exactly with it—I compared the crow-bar with the marks on the door and they corresponded exactly in width—there was a quantity of grease on the counting-house door and the same on the crow-bar—I apprehended Mellish on the Monday morning about half-past three o clock in King-street Golden-square—I told him I wanted him for a robbery at Mr Burt s—he said I know nothing of the robbery —I asked him if any body had been down the yard with him—he said there had

Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Was the grease the sort of grease which is found on the linch-pins of wheels A Just so COUNT Q Was the same sort of grease on the counting-house door A It was—there was nothing to account for the grease on the counting-house-door except from the instrument being applied to it—it was the lock side of the door—the crow had been driven into the rabbet near the lock which would enable a person to burst it open—I did not search Mellish s lodgings ABIGAIL HOCKET I am a window in service at No 5 Vine-street On Sunday 26th of June I saw the prisoner Harris after eleven o clock—I cannot exactly say how much after—it was before twelve o clock—I saw him open the gate and go into Mr Burt s yard—he went up to the gate and appeared to open it with the key—whether any body was with in at that time I do not know—I saw the two prisoners together about twenty minutes afterwards—it was before one o clock—I saw them go down into Mr Burt s yard at the same gate

sitting-room which joins the gate—I looked through the window and could see them open the gate and go down—I could not see to the stable—I merely saw them go in at the gate—they appeared to go in with a key—it was the two prisoners—I knew them—I knew Mellish to be Mr Burt s servant—I have seen the other when I have been going on errands to the public-house Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Who did you first see go in A Harris—I am quite sure of that THOMAS HOBBS police constable C 85 In consequence of information on Monday the 27th about ten o clock I went to George-street St Giles s and

lie here they are giving me from his pocket the pistol and the case of instruments a rule and pocked-comopasses—I took him to the station-house and searched him further—he said he had nothing else about him that it was given him to make away with—that he was drawn into it and he knew nothing of the robbery—I had not mentioned the whole of the articles to him then—I think I named the double-barrelled pistol and some watches to him Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Did you find Harris at his lodging A No—I found him in George-street St Giles s—several things were mentioned—he said he

with them in a cart Cross-examined by MR JONES Q What part of your premises were broken open A The stable door had been unlocked—it forms the other side of my yard—there is no communication between

MOSES I am a gardener at Enfield Highway I live about a mile from the prosecutor on the road towards London On Saturday the 6th of August last I went towards the window about two o clock or a little after that morning and saw a dog in my front garden—I came down stairs opened my door and perceived it was a black and white dog—I made towards the cross part of the garden and in a small parcel of

Jasper we went on the road towards London and overtook a wagon near Tottenham High Cross—James Skipp was driving it—I saw in the tail of the wagon a large bag which I considered was harness—I got out of the cart to see what it was—I found it contained harness and Catling was lying on the top of it—I told him he was the person I was looking for—he said he knew nothing about that harness—I called the wagon boy he took up Catling with that bag of harness at Enfield Wash bridge and another man was with him at the time—I put Catling into the cart I had got and went on in pursuit of another—as we were going along Catling said we should overtake the other man at the White Hart Kingsland-road—as we were going along I asked different persons if they had seen a man on the road with a black and white dog—I still went on in pursuit of another man—I went to the White Hart Kingsland-road—I there asked Catling the man s name—he said he did not know his name but he knew him personally—Catling said Go up Old-street-road —I did—when I got up there he said Go into Smithfield —when there he said Go down Cock-lane and from there into Farringdon-street —I said I would not go any farther unless he told me who I was going after—when I got to Farringdon-street he told me to go Fleet-street and stop at Lombard-court—I went down there—he told me to knock at No 10—I knocked at the door twice and waited a few minutes and then knocked against but before I went down I asked Catling who I was to ask for—he said he did not know his name but he gave a description of his dress and told me to go and ask for a person that had brought in a black and white dog—I did so—a man poked his head out of the door—I had some conversation with him about a dog Catling was in Fleet-street in the cart —I went in

the hand-cuffs on him put him into the cart and took him before the Magistrate at Enfield—I found a crow-bar upon him also this knife this phosphorus box this watch and an empty box and on Catling I found nine skeleton keys a knife a cord and a string by which you might lead a dog—some salve on silk to tame dogs and four duplicates—there is a smell about the salve that is particular—the box I took from Cook has just the same smell—any of these keys will open Mr Stephens s stable door Cross-examined by MR JONES Q Will they open other doors A They will—I have tried them—I derived all my information from Catling—the first time I saw Cook was in Lombard-court—I left Catling with my brother when I went there Cross-examined by MR THOMAS Q What is on this bit of black silk A I do not know what it is—I have tried it and when I have showed it to a dog he would come towards me at about half a yard distance—Catling voluntarily told me he would tell me where I could find the other man—I thought there was something in the bag because that bag and that in Moses s garden were alike—I said nothing to Catling to induce him to tell me JAMES SKIPP I am a wagoner to Mr Lodge and was so on

transported—I told the Magistrate where it was and he sent the policeman with me and I took him to where the watch was Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When were you taken into custody A On the 31st the same day about a quarter of an hour after the watch was missed—the prisoner was taken first—I was little way before him—I was in Newgate once before about a year ago for three weeks for stealing a pair of shoes and some brushes—there was no bill found against me—I have been three or four times before a Magistrate—Mr Goring a butcher at Brentford charged me with stealing some beef about a month ago—I have been in person since this—I was taken for this as I could not get bail—I have come from prison now—the Magistrate told me he must keep me till next day COURT Q Did any body advise you to give the information A The Magistrate said I had better tell where it was as it would be the only way of saving myself—and I then told where it was and that the prisoner gave it me—I have not been charged with any thing since the beef at Brentford—I did not go before a Magistrate then—I have known the prisoner a good while WILLIAM ALLAWAY I am a policeman I took Pearce and the prisoner before the Magistrate on the 31st of October—they were both examined and remanded—I took them again on the 1st of November and then the prisoner was remanded and Pearce discharged—he had not said where the watch was before he was discharged to my knowledge—the Magistrate told him he was now liberated and if he knew any thing about the robbery he had better tell the truth—he hesitated some time—the Magistrate cautioned him to be careful what he did say to speak the truth as he would very likely be brought before a Magistrate on his oath—after hesitating he said Sir I will tell the truth —I am quite sure the Magistrate told him he was discharged before he said any thing on the subject and he told him he had better tell as he might still be under difficulties—he then gave information—he took me on the Hanworth-road and on Twickenham-common near a gate-post by the end of a road leading to the Mills he pointed and said It is there —I moved some bushes and found the watch which I now produce—there was no glass in it—I said The glass is broken —he said No the glass is there —I searched further and found it Property produed and sworn to ELIZA FORD re-examined Q Can you tell who it was that went to your house A The prisoner—I saw him coming from the door—he was within the gate—I did not see Pearce Cross-examined Q What sort of a gate is it A It opens nearly close to the door—I had a good view of—I never saw the prisoner before—he passed the house where I was with a basket of herrings in front of him—I am sure the door was shut when I went away—I could not see it from my neighbour s house JANE HARPER re-examined I am quite sure the prisoner is the boy that went to the prosecutor s door—it was not Pearce—I did not see any body near the gate Cross-examined Q If there had been one near the gate you must have seen him A I was listening to my neighbour s door—she was talking to me—I heard her gate open—I should have seen two it they had both left the gate—I only noticed the one inside the gate—there was nothing to prevent my seeing a person outside—I never saw the prisoner before CHARLES FORD re-examined When I stopped the prisoner he denied it and said there was another one ahead of him taking part in his herrings—I instantly gave him into custody and went and took Pearce who was about a hundred yards further on—the watch was found about a hundred yards from where I took the prisoner—Pearce had got beyond it—when my wife let me in I shut the gate and the door—I went out at the back door to feed my pigs—I never opened the front door—I am certain it was on the latch and shut—there is no court at the side of my house—it is in a row MR PAYNE Q How large was the basket could it be got in at the door of your house A He could have got in with the basket—it was a flat one—he would not be obliged to use both hands to hold it—he could put it up against his side GUILTY of stealing only Aged 17 — Transported for Seven Years Third Jury before Mr

pigeons value 30s his property and that Baker had been before convicted of felony JOHN COLLIER I am a weaver and live in King-street Brick-lane in the parish of Spitalfields In December I Kept some pigeons in the wash-house at the back of my house adjoining the house—You must go through the washhouse to get into the yard—the door of the house opens directly into the washhouse—you do not go into the open air at all—I saw the pigeons safe last Tuesday week—there were twenty—seven of them—I went again on Wednesday morning at ten o clock and missed eighteen of them—a board five or six feet long had been broken down at the side of the washhouse—it was the wall of the washhouse which is all boards—a person could not reach the pigeons through the hole it was too high—but the pigeons could fly out by the board being down—it was ten inches wide —and about eight feet form the ground—I should suppose the hole was large enough for a man to get though—the pigeons were loose in the washhouse—I saw them again next morning at Andrews s—I picked them out the instant I went into his shop—I am positive they are mine—they were alive—Walker lives next door to me and I have seen Baker come backwards and forwards to him CHARLES ANDREWS I live in Brick-lane Spitalfields On the 27th of December Baker came and offered me a bag of pigeons for sale—I asked him how many there were—he said Thirty —I looked at them and said There are not thirty here are they your own —he said Yes they are I have some more outside —he went out and returned in about a minute with another bag—I asked him again how many there were—he said Thirty —I said There are not thirty here —I counted them over three times—there were eighteen—I turned round and saw a man peeping in at the corner of my window—I said Who is that man fetch him in out of the cold—he brought him in and it was Walker—I asked Walker if the pigeons belonged to him he said they did—I had a few friends in my parlour and called them out as I did not think they had come honestly by them—Mr Edmondson asked them who they were and where they lived and took their addresses—I told them to go away and call again to-morrow and if nobody owned them they should have them again—next morning I showed the same pigeons to Mr Collier Walker When I was fetched in he said Are they your pigeons —I said Yes they are mine —he said Well I will give 7d a piece for them—but when I saw the pigeons which I had not done before I said I would not sell them Witness I did offer them 7d thinking that would induce them to come back as they had got to the door and I called them back—Baker was never off the steps of the door—for Mr Edmond son advised me not to let them go—they offered them at 8d a head Baker I went away to the next door and then returned with them Witness No he was never out of my sight—when Walker came back one pigeon was short and there were but seventeen—he said B—the other one and I said I shall not let you go and detained them WILLIAM EDMONDSON I was in Andrews s shop when the prisoners were there—I asked Walker his name and address—he gave me his name and his address No 22 Kent-street Borough —the pigeons were not taken out of the shop in my presence—I persuaded Andrews to detain the prisoner and give them in charge on suspicion of stealing them ANDREW DACEY I am a policeman I was called into the shop and took the prisoners—I asked Walker where he lived—he said No 22 Kent-street—I asked him if the birds were his—he said they were—I asked him why he did not sell his birds himself—he said he had such a feeling for his fancy he really did not like to dispose of them—I found a pencil a knife and a box of lucifer matches on Baker—the parish the prosecutor lives in is called Christ-church Spitalfields I believe Baker s Defence On the evening in question I called at Walker s house and remained some time and went home—I met a man with pigeons in a bag he asked me knowing me about the neighbourhood if I knew where I could sell them—I said I did not know any thing of them but I knew a man who understood such things—I returned to Walker and told him a man wanted to sell some pigeons—I took him there and the man said If you can sell them I will pay you for it —we then parted and I have not seen the man since Walkers Defence Baker brought the man to my house about a quarter past ten o clock as I was going to bed and said he had a man who had some pigeons would I come down and tell him what they were worth—I went down without a light—I felt the weight of them and said if they are any good they will fetch 8d a piece —he said Well if you will get 8d a piece you shall have 4s out of it and I will go and wait at the public-house and we went to sell them The certificate of Baker s former

house at the time she went out—she left me behind as the cart came to the door for her to go out—she said Will you lock the door Mary —I did so and came out of the room—I locked the door and went to see that Herbert s room was locked —I locked his door and put the key of his door on my mother s drawers and brought my mother s key over to my own place—my mother s drawers were safe then and the door locked—I did not lock the street door—it is always open—in about half an hour afterwards I received information from Mrs Roberts and went over to my mother s—I went up stairs and found the door open—I saw no marks of violence on it—the lock appeared to have been unlocked with a key—I went and tried the drawer which I knew my mother kept her money in and it was forced open—there was a piece of the drawer lying on the floor and the mark of a chisel on the drawers as if it had been used to prize it open—the box my mother s money was in was gone and her watch and tea spoons ELIZA LOUISA ROBERTS I am the wife of Joseph Roberts who keeps a hair-dresser s shop in the prosecutrix s house On Whit Monday rather before two o clock I was standing at the shop door—I did not know whether Mrs Harris was gone out then but I noticed the prisoner Blackson and another walking about—I do not know the other sufficiently to swear to him but he was exactly the same sort of person as the prisoner Walker— looking at the prisoners —yes they were the two men—they were walking very slowly backwards and forwards—they afterwards separated and Blackson went to the corner of Nightingale-street—the other was standing just beyond Nightingale-street waiting as if for Blackson to come up him—Blackson was looking at me as I stood at the door with my baby in my arms my arms—I afterwards went from the street-door into my shop pushed my shop door to and went into my parlour—I heard the footsteps of one person not more going up stairs—the street door was open at that time and the middle door of the passage was a-jar—I went and found it ajar after I heard the footsteps and closed it—I cannot say whether it had been ajar before—it was easy to open it—it opens with a string and was not fastened at all—I went up stairs to my bed-room on the first floor for a jug at that time—I came down again put the jug on the table went to the door instantly and met Blackson coming through the passage as if from up stairs—I asked him his business whether it was with Mrs Harris—he said it was—I asked him if I should tell her when she came home—he said no the business was with her herself—I said If you have any message I will tell her when she comes home —he said Then you can tell her I came from Mr Dalston or Dalton a tailor —I saw no more of him but I suspected something was wrong from his agitated appearance and I went over to Mrs Harris s daughter to tell her—she came over immediately after me—we went up and found her mother s door open and the drawer broken open—I am sure it was Blackson I saw—he had on a dark frock coat but I did not notice any other part of his dress—I did not see any body else go into the house Cross-examined Q You crossed the street very soon after to Mrs Fox A Yes Blackson was then gone—I saw nobody on crossing the street—I could see up and down a considerable distance—Walker was the person saw walking with him in the street but I did not see him after Blackson came out of the house—I have never sworn that the middle door was shut—Mrs Harris has left her key in my shop once or twice when she went out— looking at her deposition —here is my mark to this— the deposition being read contained the following sentence— There is a middle door in the passage but it was shut JOHN MATTHEWS I live at No 6 Caplin-street two doors from Mrs Harris On Whit Monday a little after two o clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoners Walker and Blackson walking backwards and forwards for a full half hour which made me take particular notice of them—they were exactly opposite my house at the corner of Nightingale-street—I saw Blackson leave Walker cross over the road and enter into Mrs Harris s passage door but I could not see him go up stairs—I had seen Mrs Harris go away with her cart before that—she was not gone when they were first walking about but after she was gone he crossed to the door—Walker walked a little farther off towards Church-street—I did not notice whether he turned the corner or not—Blackson was dressed in a dark frock coat—it appeared to me like a dark bottle-green Cross-examined Q As long as you saw Walker after Blackson parted from him was he not walking A He was walking gently on COURT Q How far did he go A I did not notice particularly as I went into my shop—he was about twenty yards from the house when I saw him last WILLIAM SEYMOUR I am a shoemaker and live in Caplin-street directly opposite Mrs Harris On Whit Monday I was at work in my shop and saw Blackson go into Mrs Harris s house—it was near upon three o clock when he came out—I cannot say the time exactly—I had seen Mrs Harris go away before he went in—I did not see anybody with Blackson—I saw him go in push the door open in the passage and turn round towards the stairs and the door shut afterwards—I saw him come down and open the door and he came and spoke to Mrs Roberts—he pulled out a piece of something white while he was speaking to her—he had a dark frock coat on—I saw Mrs Harris come home afterwards—I had seen nobody go into the house from the time Mrs Harris went away to the time Mrs Roberts went to tell Mrs Fox besides Blackson Cross-examined Q Did you see Blackson go up to Mrs Roberts at the street door about three o clock A He came up to the door and she was then at the door but he did not speak to her—he was walking about—he turned back and went towards Church-street after that but he came by my shop and went over into Mrs Harris s house—I saw him go in slyly—I was a short space of time observing him—I was not noticing the time—I had no suspicion of him—I do not know how long I had been observing him—it might be ten minutes LYDIA REEVES I am the wife of Thomas Reeves of Devonshire-street Lisson-grove I know the female prisoner—I have seen her frequently at the time she lived at Mrs Harris s and she afterwards lived for a fortnight at No 5 Charles-street—I understand she lived there with Blackson—she sent for me about half-past one o clock on Whit Monday to know if I would wash for her on the Tuesday—Walker lived in the front room first floor of of the same house—he is married—Chambers lived in the back room—I swept her room out that day and the front room and while I was sweeping she said she had some thoughts of going to Greenwich if she had any luck—while I was in the back room with Chambers Blackson and Walker came in—it was a little after three o clock—they ran up stairs together and went into the front room which is Walker s and Chambers went into the room to them—I heard them talking and laughing together but did not hear what they said—they did not stay there many minutes—I saw them go down again—I am sure it was them—a few minutes afterwards I was in Walker s room and Blackson came up again and changed a coat—he took off a large dark frock coat—Chambers went to her own room—Blackson followed her and staid there about five minutes and then went away—I did not look at the clock when he went—I looked at it when I left there and got home—it was then near four o clock—I went to Chambers next day to wash—I went into Walker s room for some soap and heard Walker s wife tell him he had no business to tell Rose how much money they had for she was a b——deceitful b—and there was no bottom to her—he said he could buy them at any time for a quartern of gin fourpence would buy them—I heard this at the door—I knocked at the door then and Walker s wife gave me the money to get the soap—after this Mrs Walker came down and asked me to go up to tea with her and her husband which I did—Rose and Blackson came in and sat down to tea with us—I saw some new trowsers and a new gown piece in Chambers s room—it was a pink plaid Cross-examined Q Have you always said you saw the trowsers A That was what I saw—they were not quite finished and they were unmade dresses—I told Rose that I should not have had tea there but she took my bonnet and shawl and locked them in—Walker s wife was trimming a bonnet—I did not mention that before the Magistrate as I was not asked about it—I looked at Rose s clock when the prisoners went away—I cannot exactly say the time—it was near four o clock—about half-past three o clock—I cannot say whether I ever said it was a little after three o clock The witness s deposition being read stated it to be a little after three o clock when Blackson left and contained nothing of having observed the trowsers THOMAS LEE I am an apprentice to Mr Walker a linen-draper in Oxford-street On Whit Monday between five and six o clock in the evening Blackson and Walker came to our shop and bought two cotton dresses—one was a pink plaid—they each changed a sovereign and received change WILLIAM CUMMING I am a policeman On the afternoon of Whit Monday I was called into Mrs Harris s house when the alarm was given—I saw the drawer and examined the door—there were no marks of violence on the door—I went on the Wednesday with Mrs Harris and Mrs Roberts to No 5 Charles-street Lisson-grove which is about a quarter of a mile from Mrs Harris s—in the first-floor front room I found the prisoners Blackson and Walker and two young women—I asked Mrs Roberts which was the young man she had seen in the house that day—she pointed Blakson out and I took him into custody and told him he was my prisoner—he asked what for—I said about stealing a £5 note seven sovereigns and other articles—he said he never heard tell of such a thing in his life—I saw a pair of quite new boots there and asked whose they were—Blackson said they were his—I found none of the stolen property—Walker was also taken—I afterwards took Chambers and found 1l 10s in gold and 16s 6d in silver in a small box in her room and 3d in a table drawer in the room where she was the first-floor back room —I also found a key which had been newly filed—I applied it to Mrs Harris s door and found it opened and locked it—on the Friday night following I went into the same room and found this gown piece in a box belonging to Chambers—I had searched the same box before and she then said it was her box—Davey was with me Cross-examined Q Had you not Chambers in custody at the time you found it A I had—I searched the box the day I took her but I was not looking for a gown then but a silver tea-spoon and watch—the gown-piece might have been there and I not notice it as there were sheets and different things in a lump together COURT Q Did you try the key of the door to Chamber s room A Yes—it unlocked her door—I found a black frock coat on the Saturday night in Chambers s bed WILLIAM DAVEY I am a policeman I went on the 17th to No 5 Charles-street with Cumming and took Walker into custody—I searched the room and found two chisels two files part of a centre-bit a hand-vice a screw-driver ten duplicates and a pick-lock key in a small box in Walker s room—I applied the chisels to the marks in the drawers which I found at

I left home at four o clock in the afternoon leaving my lodgers in the house but nobody in my own apartments—I occupy the two parlours and let out the rest—I locked them both up when I went out—the street door is always shut—it was on the latch and cannot be opened outside without a latch-key—I returned about ten o clock and went to bed without noticing any thing—about twelve o clock next morning I had occasion to go to my drawers in the back room and missed two boxes— one of which had jewellery in it and my watch which laid by the side of it—the other box contained an eye-glass a certificate of my marriage and memorandums—I had seen the boxes not five minutes before I went out the day before when I took two rings out of one—I also lost a silver tea-spoon off the mantel-piece

open—I slept in the back room and locked the door when I went to bed—1 should think nobody could have gone into that room while I was there that morning and take the things without my perceiving them—I did not go out before I discovered my loss—I did not know the prisoner before now but I have seen him pass before as his mother lodged in my house—he came his to his mother several times before the robbery—I knew he was her son COURT Q Before the Magistrate you stated that when you went to your drawers at twelve o clock you found them locked A I cannot say to be certain whether they were or not—I thought so at the time—I have said 5l was the amount of the property lost but it is much more to me—the watch is worth 2l —it is a gold watch capped but not jewelled—the earrings and other things are worth 35s together Prisoner Q Have you a spring bolt to your lock Witness No the door shuts with a catch and then I lock it—the catch can be turned outside by the handle—I have a door between the two parlours—they open from one into the other and each have a door into the passage—the front door also has a handle the same as the other lock—I cannot say whether I shut the door between the front and back rooms when I went out—in the afternoon I went to the top of the stairs and said to his mother Mrs Cotmore I am going out—will you be so good as to answer the door and put my front shutters to —I am certain I locked the door after me—the shutters were put to tight outside—they will stick together without any fastening—they cannot be fastened without going into the room—the window in the front parlour was secure as well as the back when I went out MARGARET COTMORE I am the prisoner s mother Mrs Crawley told me of the robbery next day—I remember her going out on the

together when she called out—I went out about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after leaving my son in the house—when I returned he was gone—I had told him to stop till I came back and he said he would—when I returned I found an old lady who lodged in the house named Madden—my son returned in a very few minutes and I asked what made him go out—he said a young man who knew he was there knocked at the railing and called him out and he went and spoke to him—he soon went away—he is a whitesmith by trade Prisoner Q Did you see me go outside the door when I was going away Witness Yes I saw him

whether they were gold—they were yellow and set with little white stones—she threw a marriage certificate into the fire—I took it off while it was burning—it was burnt but I was able to see that it was a certificate of marriage—the names on it were Margaret Pearson and John Crawley married at St George s Hanover-square—she placed the all things I mentioned on the table in the box and asked me to take care of them till next day—she took the basket away and left the box with me—it was four or five inches long and about three inches wide—on the Sunday morning during my absence she came and got it away Prisoner Q If the certificate was burnt how could you read it A I took it off and read the names while it was burning—the box was either cedar or mahogany JURY Q Was the certificate entirely

of the fire and read it in my presence—I left—I did not see the reading—I had no motive for putting it into the fire—I did not know what it was till I heard it at Bow-street—1 am sure I did not look into the box at Mrs Beacon s—I have been examined before Q Do not you recollect when you were examined before the Magistrate saying I cannot recollect whether I looked into the box or not at Mrs

got a bundle which belongs to my sister —he put it down and I gave him the 2l —I knew that he had a sister and that she had some money recently left her—I advanced him the 2l on this property—I opened the bundle—he said if he brought the 2l again he must have the bundle and if he did not I was to give him 10s more and keep it—I heard nothing more of him till the prosecutor came to my booth at

different gallery to mine—I cannot tell how many turnings there are between them—he went up the steps into the room—I do not walk very bad—I could pretty well run with him—I ran as fast as I could—I did not know the spectacles were in my chest—I do not know how long before I went to chapel I had seen them MR BALLANTINE Q Did you know you had such spectacles A Yes I had not parted with them to anybody—I had not given any one authority to part with them for me ALEXANDER NELSON City police-constable 86 About ten minutes before one o clock on Sunday I was sent for and the prosecutor gave Davis into my custody—I searched him in his presence and found on him two pairs of spectacles and two leather cases—I had asked him whether he had any property about him and he said nothing but what was his own—the prosecutor identified them directly I pulled them out of his pocket—I also found 1s in silver a twopenny-piece a halfpenny and three farthings a key and saw-set on him—I went to the prosecutor s room and took the saw-set with me—I applied it to two boxes in the room which had been broken open and the dents in the wood exactly corresponded in breadth and length with the saw-set—I was shown into the prisoner Fell s room and found the prisoner Majore sitting on the sofa there—I searched the room—I saw Waller my brother officer take two clocks from the coal-hole Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What do you mean by the marks corresponding A The marks in the wood—I have not brought the boxes here—it was about two hours after Davis was given into custody that I went to the room to examine the boxes—the marks appeared to me to be made with this end of the instrument producing it —I cannot tell whether a small chisel might have made the same mark SARAH REIG I was a prisoner in the Fleet when this happened—I was in the Fair on the Sunday morning about twenty-five minutes to twelve o clock and saw the prisoners Davis and Major walking up and down backwards and forwards in the passage close by Board s room—one stood reading a book on the steps—I remember Board going into the yard when there was an alarm—some time after that I saw Fell come down with a large bundle in his hand and take it into the coal-hole—I afterwards told the policeman what I had seen Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You saw them walking about together and one reading a book A Yes—I saw Major peeping through Board s keyhole Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Have you ever mentioned that circumstance before about the keyhole A Yes more than once—the Fair is the lower ward—there were not many people walking about there—I was backwards and forwards but there were not many about—I saw no body there but the prisoners at that time—it is not an unusual place for people to walk—I have been there a year and half—I knew both the prisoners by sight before HENRY BAILEY I am in the service of the prisoner Fell and was so on this Sunday—I had the key of the coal-hole that day—about two or three minutes before twelve o clock I was at the coal-hole door and saw a man with a light yellow handkerchief in his hand covering over something like a clock—I do not know the man—I said to him You cannot go out Sir —he said I know that —he turned up the Fair steps and went up the steps leading to the hall—Fell came down to me two or three minutes after that he got the key from me and took an empty coal-sack up with him in his hand out of the coal-cellar—he returned again with the coal sack—it was empty then—I was standing at the hole—when he went by me he had a tub with something in it and the coal-sack covered over the tub—I did not see any body with him but about half an hour afterwards I saw Major in Fell s room Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q What did you mean by his not being able to go out A You cannot go out at the gate till one o clock—Fell was a prisoner there but not Major WALTER WAKEMAN I am a prisoner in the Fleet—my room is on the opposite side to Board s but not immediately opposite About twelve o clock on the Sunday in question I saw a person come out of Board s room with a bundle wrapped up in a handkerchief of a light colour—it was the prisoner Major—I saw his face—I did not know him before—he passed me as I was going into my room—I did not notice where he went to—he passed me to go up the steps—that would lead to Fell s room—I know Fell s boy Bailey —I heard him say to Major Sir you cannot go out now —I then went into my own room and shortly after heard of this robbery Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What do you call the Fair A The lower story—it is a darkish place Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Do you swear positively that it was Major came out of the room with the bundle A Yes—I made an ex periment yesterday in the prison with two different people to see whether I could see a person in the place—that was not for the purpose of seeing whether I could identify them from my room—I went to show them how it was that my room being situated in a very dark place a person coming from the light and Board s room is next door to the entrance towards me directly he passes me comes into the light again as he is two doors from the steps—I do not know whether the persons doubted I could see him but the question was put to me by a friend of the prisoners and I made the experiment to show that I could see him—the bundle he had with him was of a lightish colour—the direction he took would take him out the prison—I heard Bailey tell him he could not go out Q What have you been A A gentleman—I am in no business—I have had a charge made against me but not for felony—at least I am not aware whether it constitutes a felony—I have been in gaol but I am not aware whether it was on a charge of felony—it was for giving a person a cheque—I was at Gloucester at the time and was put into Gloucester gaol—that was last September—I was kept there tell the sessions in October and then immediately acquitted—I have not been in gaol on any other occasion—I have been in the Fleet since January—I have been twice in prison now and at Gloucester Q On your oath yesterday after you made the experiment did you not state that you could not distinguish a person A I did not—nor words to that effect—not to any one—Dr Atto went down with me—I never said I could not distinguish a person in that place MR BODKIN Q Have you had any quarrel with the prisoners A Never—I never entertained a doubt of Major being the person who passed me with the bundle—it was Rowbottom who spoke to me about whether I could see the party but Mr Shepherd one of the turnkeys went with me yesterday down to my room and Mr Atto as well— Rowbottom did not go down to my room —I only went to satisfy them—the experiment did not at all weaken my belief that Major was the person—Mr Shepherd appeared to be of a different opinion to me—Mr Atto agreed with me that I could see him—on my oath I did see the man and knew him again when he was brought out of Fell s room—the light was not on his face it was behind him but as soon as he passed me the light came on his face as he turned—I saw him with his face first of all towards Board s door closing it—the light was then sideways—then he turned round and came straight past me—seeing a stranger at that time of day I was rather surprised and it drew my attention—I was opening my door as he turned round again—the light coming from the east threw a very strong light through my door on the prisoner s face—he passed very near to me JEREMIAH BOARD re-examined I have looked at the articles produced they are mine and are part of the property that was taken on the Sunday in question—the room is in my exclusive occupation—the warden of the Fleet is William Robert Henry Brown Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How much are your spectacles worth A Perhaps 5s or 6s a pair—they cost more than 1l —I pay 15d a week for my room—no one else has a right to go to it but myself unless I choose—I pay rent to Shepherd one of the turnkeys—he lets it quarterly for the warden WILLIAM JOHNSON I am clerk to William Robert Henry Brown the warden of the Fleet prison it is in the parish of St Bridget or St Bride— I know Board s room—he rents it from the warden at 1s 3d a week which is collected quarterly by the turnkey for Mr Brown—he cannot be turned out except for non-payment of rent—there is a month over the quarter always given to them and if they pay during that time they are at liberty to stop as long as they like—he is entitled to the exclusive occupation of the room Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Is the prison in no other parish besides St Bride s A No—the taxes are paid to the tax-collector of St Bride s—no taxes are paid to St Sepulchre s parish—no taxes are paid for the part of the prison in which the prisoners reside—Mr Brown s house is contiguous to the prison and the dwelling-house only consists of eight rooms—you must go into the prison under the dwelling-house—there is a private door to the dwelling-house out of Farringdon-street—it is her Majesty s prison—no part of it is in the parish of St Sepulchre—I have been there twelve years—I have never seen any collector except from St Bride s—the house is right in the centre of the prison wall—part of the prison wall comes against New Inn-yard Old Bailey MR BODKIN Q Is Board s room on the side nearer Ludgate-hill than Mr Brown s residence A Yes William Diamond boot and shoemaker of Ballantine-place Blackfriar s road gave Major a good character MAJOR— GUILTY DAVIS— GUILTY Transported for Fifteen Years Before Mr Justice Vaughan

eight guns and eleven pistols out of glass cases—there were no marks of violence about the place but I was not the first who entered the counting-house—I had left at five minutes to eight o clock the evening before and the guns and pistols were then safe in the counting-house which is in a yard enclosed with the dwelling-house—it joins the dwelling-house—there is a dining-room over the front shop—you pass through to the back shop without going into the open air—it is part of the house and joins the dwelling-house Q Are there rooms over it which are dwelt in A Yes there are and it communicates internally with the rooms of the house—I left at five minutes to eight o clock on Thursday the 25th and missed the gums and pistols next morning Q In consequence of directions from your master did you get an officer A In going for an officer I saw Hickling in company with one or two more—they parted and I followed him to Fleur-de-lis-court Spitalfields—I went then for an officer and Hickling s brother and himself and one or two more came out of the house in Fleur-de-lis-court—we went into the house and found eight guns there—I had seen Hickling go into that house and come out—I went for an officer after finding the guns and took the prisoner Hickling in Wheeler-street WILLIAM COLEMAN police-constable H 2 I was passing through Spitalfields-market on Friday morning the 26th of January—I went to Fleur-de-lis-court and saw the witness Till—I went to a house No 4 Reeve s place and searched it and in an up-stairs room I found a bed and mattrass covered over with packing-mat and tied very carefully with packing cord—I found in the mattrass eight guns which I now produce Q Did you see either of the prisoners charged as accessaries at that house A No JAMES LEA I am an officer of Lambeth-street-office I put some questions to the two Thatchers in consequence of what Hickling told me and they denied the charge—when I apprehended Lindwold the prisoner Sarah Thatcher came into the room—she passed as Lindwold s wife then—I asked her if she knew any thing about the pistols—she denied it—I afterwards went to the prisoner Sophia Thatcher and asked her if Sarah had left any pistols there—she denied that she had—I found no property in the possession of either of the Thatcher s nor of Reed THOMAS CUMMINS police-sergeant H 5 I went to No 8 Morgan-street on Sunday the 28th of January and saw the two female prisoners—I said I understood they had the pistols in their possession—they said they had not—I asked if they knew where they were—they said not—I asked if they knew where the prisoner Reed lived—they said they did not and were quite sure he knew nothing about the pistols—on Sunday night I went to Reed s lodging and asked him if he was aware of the robbery at Mr Baker s—he said he was—I asked if he had any pistols in his possession—he said he had not—I said Did not you take them away from Morgan-street —he said he did not—I searched his premises but did not find them there WILLIAM WRIGHT I live in Hennage-street Brick-lane I saw the prisoner Reed on Friday night the 26th of January—I never saw him before—I saw him then in Morgan-street—he came to No 8 and beckoned a little girl out—the girl came with a light and went into the next door—having beard something was missed I followed them into the next house out of curiosity—they went into No 8—I went up stairs into the room where they were and saw Reed take the pistols away with him Q Who gave them to him A Mrs Thatcher was in the room with him and she gave them to him—he came down stairs and went away and I did not see any more of him Q Was any thing said while you were there A There was nothing said at the time not till after Reed had gone away—Mrs Thatcher then said she wished Mr Baker to have the property back again—I went away then—I should know the pistols again if I saw them—there was one bigger than all the rest— looking at them —I believe this to be the one I saw—I am certain of it—here is a mark on it which I took notice of Q How came they to let you in to see what was about A I followed them in—they did not ask me to go in—I was not a stranger to them as I knew the sister who lived next door—in fact I did not intend to give information—they took no particular notice of my being there—I worked next door Q Did they talk of Mr Baker in your presence and never say What do you do here A No—they took no notice of me only when Reed went down he said Is there any body there is it all dear —the conversation was not till after Reed had gone away—I was a stranger to these three but was not strange to the sister of Thatcher—after Reed went away the women came in from next door and they talked about destroying the property—I said they had better send it back to Mr Baker or whoever it belonged to Q They knew you to be a respectable man A They did not know any thing against me—they had seen me before coming backwards and forwards but not till lately Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Who are you and what are you A I am a box-maker—I carry on my business at No 5 Hennage-street—I went to Morgan-street to teach a little girl to make light boxes—I was a stranger to Reed—I never saw him before not till the time I speak of—I took up this pistol looked at it and put it down again COURT Q Did they know you as a thief or what that you were so ranch at home there A They knew nothing against me—I was not acquainted with them but I knew the sister who lives next door—I took particular notice of this pistol and of the finishing of the mark here—I am not a particular judge of pistols MR PAYNE Q Are you a master box-maker A Yes—I do not keep any workmen as trade is so slack—I have been in a very good way of business and worked for a number of respectable gentlemen in the City—I do not keep a house—I lodge in Hennage-street COURT Q How long have you lost your business A It is not gone—I serve several respectable people in St Paul s Church-yard—Mr Jones Mr Hall and Mr Hoare the milliners—Mr Jones would come directly if you doubt my evidence WILLIAM ARGENT police-constable H 126 In consequence of information I went to a house in Vine-court Whitechapel and took the prisoner Sarah Thatcher into custody on the 28th of January—I asked her what she had done with a basket which she had on Friday morning—she said she carried it to a woman in the Commercial-road—I had not seen her with a basket—it was in consequence of information I put the question Q Did you give her any caution that you were putting questions and that her answers would be given in evidence against her A No not particularly that—I put the question to her from information I had received but nobody told me to put the question—I got the information from a person named Singleton in Whitechapel-road—I believe he is a colour-maker—my brother officer Arnold was with me at the time Q Well what did she say A She said she gave it to a woman is Commercial-road—I locked her up and went to No 7 Morgan-street Commercial-road—I saw her mother there but said nothing to her and without my saying a word to her she said that her daughter had brought the basket down to her house—I had not mentioned the basket—she said it entirely of her own accord without my having said any thing about a basket—she said she would go with my brother officer and me if I would take a walk down to Prince s-street Whitechapel which she did and said if we would stay a bit she would produce the pistols—we did and she brought the pistols to us and delivered them to me—this was in Haydon s-alley Prince s-street Whitechapel-road—she went there with us and got them for us—Arnold was with me Q Do you mean that the woman merely on seeing you volunteered to state that the basket was brought there and the pistols and that she would go and fetch them without you telling her what you had come about A I did not put any questions at all to her nor did I hear my brother officer do so—she had been down to the station-house and seen her daughter after she was locked up THOMAS ARNOLD police-constable H 127 I was with Argent when he took Sarah Thatcher into custody—she denied all knowledge of the pistols at first—she is deaf but I spoke loud enough for her to hear—she told me she knew nothing about them but on Argent taking her down to the station-house I heard her say that they were brought to her house and she took them to a woman in Commercial-road—I asked if she knew the woman—she said she did not—she was locked up—I afterwards met with the mother and told her it was a bad job for her daughter—she said it was and if I would stop a little while she would go and fetch the pistols Q Then it is not true that nothing was said to her A I said it was a bad job for her daughter—I do not know whether Argent heard that—he was behind me—she brought the pistols and delivered them to me and said that her daughter brought them to the house Q Did you say any thing to induce her to admit that she had them and then to fetch them A She did not admit that she had them till I received them—she said she would go and try and find them for me—she did not say she had them—neither the young woman nor her mother said that they knew what was in the basket that was brought but when the old woman brought the pistols forward she said the pistols were brought to her—she said they were brought in the basket and she burnt the basket—she did not say that she had opened the basket—the young woman said she did not know what was in it—the elder prisoner said that she took the pistols out and destroyed the basket—she mentioned this in the station-house in the presence of me and several others—I did not mention that before the Magistrate SARAH THATCHER— NOT GUILTY SOPHIA THATCHER— NOT

William Taylor—I went to a house which I was informed was his lodging but I do not know it myself—I am not aware whether any witness can prove it—I found a sheet in a chest of drawers among other things in a parlour at the back of the prisoner Morgan s shop which is an old clothes shop—I found Georgiana Stevens in bed in a room and found a box there—I asked the prisoner Georgiana Stevens whose box it was—she instantly answered My box —Frances Taylor was in another bed in the same room—she said nothing there but at the police-office she said that part of the property I found in Georgiana Stevens s bed was in her bed which was not the case—I found nothing in the bed where she was—in the box I found some pieces of ribbons and silk—it seemed the fag-ends of a roll of silk and on the bed where Georgiana Stevens lay I found an old patchwork quilt—I found nothing else referring to this robbery—this was on the 7th of February—on the night of the 6th between eleven and twelve o clock I went to Oliver s lodging—he was just going to bed—I did not mention this robbery to him as I was not aware of it at the time Q Did you find any thing belonging to Mr Pells in their possession or in the room A In the same cupboard where I found a portion of the property mentioned in the last indictment I found a small trunk with the lock broken off which I produce and by the side of the trunk laid a quantity of horse-hair—I also found two brass candlesticks on the mantelshelf over the fire-place and another on the table in the room JURY Q Was the sheet along with a stock of sheets in the drawer at Morgan s A Yes it was with other sheets and other linen in a chest of drawers in the back parlour at the back of his shop—it might be part of his stock for sale JAMES PELLS I am a horse-hair manufacturer and live at No 10 Waterloo-street—I use the house as a workshop and a kitchen—it is one house—the upper part is the workshop and the lower part the kitchen On Sunday the 14th of January I went out between eleven and twelve o clock in the day—I left nobody in the house—the door was locked but it was a very bad lock and out of repair—we left the window down but to that it could be opened—we came home between nine and ten o clock in the evening—my mother-in-law had gone into the house before me—I found the window fastened and the shutter also—I missed four candlesticks two blankets two sheets and a trunk with different articles in it 2nd I missed about llb of horse-hair and some ribbons which belong to my wife—I had seen them about a week before we moved—I had seen the box they were in but had not seen the ribbons in it on those premises—I had seen the candlesticks when I went out in the morning—I believe the trunk produced to be my wife s—I am certain it is the trunk which I saw in the place when I went out—I cannot swear to it but I am quite certain it is the trunk—I only know it by its being papered and by my father-in-law s putting this lock on Q Can you undertake to swear that is the trunk you left in the shop when you went out A Yes—I know some of these ribbons— looking at the property —and this gauze scarf I know particularly by seeing it years ago—my wife used to wear it and it was put by in the box—I do not recollect seeing it in the box—my wife used to wear it about five years ago—here is a band corresponding with a dress she has got—I have seen her wear that once some years ago—I do not know the counterpane myselfthese clasps I know—I have not seen them for some time but I gave them to my wife about six years ago before she was married—I know all the candlesticks—the flat one has got the knob off it—I have had them about twelve months and am certain of them MARY SMITH I am the prosecutor s wife s mother I have examined the scarf ribbon and counterpane—I think I can swear to all the ribbons being my daughter s and the clasp—I often saw her open the box and look at them—I dare say I have seen her do so within a month—the things were all in the trunk together rolled up—I saw them last about a month ago—that was before they moved into this house—they were in the trunk—I know the trunk by the paper and by the size of it—I saw that about month ago—I live in the same house with the prosecutor—I never saw the box in the place it was taken from—it was left in the small house which the prosecutor occupies as a workshop and kitchen—they had removed from that to another house but this trunk was not moved—we had moved about a fortnight before the robbery Q Then you had never been in the workshop from the time you moved A Yes I was frequently in the habit of going because the kitchen is in the same house—I saw the trunk there after we moved—it had not been brought over—I saw it on the Saturday when we were moving some of the goods over—I meant I had not seen it open for a month—I can swear to the counterpane—the bottom of it is made of umbrella stuff—I cannot exactly say when I saw it last but certainly within a month—when they were moving—it was tied up with a bed in it—I saw the ribbons about a month ago—when I last saw the box there were articles of this description in it—I am quite sure of the trunk being the prosecutor s MARY FAIRWEATHER The prisoner Oliver lodged in my house—I let the room to him on the 29th of December and he remained there till he was apprehended—I first saw Clarkson there on Monday the 5th of February in the afternoon—when he came down stairs I requested him to tell Oliver I wished to speak to him which he did and I desired Oliver to leave—I believe they remained together that night—I saw them there in the afternoon and again on the Tuesday at different times in the course of the afternoon and I saw him brought down stairs by the policeman with Oliver—I did not see Clarkson after the afternoon-part of the day till the policeman brought him down in custody—the prisoner James Stevens had assisted Oliver in bringing his goods into the house in December and I saw him there at different times till he was taken into custody and I firmly believe he slept there all the time but I do not know it THOMAS SEAL re-examined I went to Oliver s apartment—I found Oliver and Clarkson there—Stevens came in shortly afterwards and was taken into custody—when I entered the room Oliver and Clarkson were in the act of going to bed—I have not brought the box here which Georgiana Clarkson claimed—all the articles except the candlesticks and horse-hair were found in that box and the other sheet in some drawers at Morgan s—the counterpane was on the bed in which Georgiana Stevens slept Oliver s Defence The articles produced I bought with a bedstead a carpet the candlestick and two quilts—I gave 16s for the lot—Stevens said it would be easier for us to pay 1s a week than 2s and we were in the room together—we bought the articles we are charged with stealing—Stevens paid part and I paid part—he gave the ribbons to his sister and kept the box and Clarkson s mother being confined he asked me to let him come to my place for a night or two as it was not convenient for him to be at home and he came on Monday and Tuesday night James Stevens s Defence I have nothing further to say than Oliver the young man we bought the articles of I believe was going to ManChester—Oliver knew him Georgiana Stevens s Defence My brother brought the ribbons to me—the quilt

BRUTON I am the wife of James Bruton a labourer who lives at No 18 Durham-row Stepney church-yard On Friday the 11th of January between ten and eleven o clock in the morning I left my house leaving nobody in it—I double-locked the door and took the key with me—the doors and windows were fast—I returned between twelve and one o clock and found the door on the single lock—I missed my canary bird out of the cage—a small box had been broken open and two sovereigns and a guinea taken out a table spoon two tea-spoons seven yards of narrow edging and half a yard of net—I also missed a pair of boots two flannel petticoats some stockings and three shirts—I complained to the officer and found the prisoner at the station-house about two o clock that day—he had a very dirty face and a remarkably clean shirt on and on looking at it I found it was my husband s shirt which I had left in the drawer Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Is there a back as well as a front door to your house A Yes there are but two rooms in the house and a back shed—I had 21/2lbs of pork in that shed and some butter—the prisoner told me of that at the station-house but I did not know it was gone then—there is a window to that shed which had not been opened for two or three days for I did not usually use it—it looks into a small garden—there is a wall six or seven feet high—I had no occasion to look at the window before I went out or during the day—my husband had gone out at half-past seven o clock in the morning—he is not here—I found the window just as I had left it—I found the impression of a chisel on the window shutter in front of the house—I am quite sure that window was in a different state to what I had left it because there was an aperture in the form of a wedge about eight inches down—it is a sash window and was fastened with a bolt and a small hinge—there is a shutter to it—I did not open it myself one of my neighbours did—the shutter was closed when I left and the window fastened—I found the shutter open not the window—a person could have got in at the window—I suppose that was the way they entered—a pick-lock key was produced afterwards which exactly fitted my door—there is a shutter to the back window but that was up and fastened—I have not had it down since—I found the back door fastened with two bolts as I had left it MARY ANN ANDREWS I am the wife of Thomas Andrews a carpenter at Stepney On the day in question I was coming through Stepney church-yard and saw the prisoner and another man come out of Mrs Bruton s house and close the door after them—the prisoner had a chisel in his left hand—I knew him before and am positive of him—the other man had a bundle—I watched them as far as I could see them—I then went to No 18 and knocked at the door but found Mrs Bruton was not at home—I then informed her next-door neighbour and went to the station-house and told the policemen—I am certain of the prisoner Cross-examined Q How long had you known the prisoner A About a fortnight before when I went to his house on a little business—I cannot say whether he had whiskers on—I have not said he had—I did not take notice—my husband works for Mr Alsop a master-builder CHARLES HENRY MOCKETT police-sergeant K 5 In consequence of information I went to Bruton s house and found every thing in confusion—I went in pursuit of the thieves and on inquiring found two men had gone through the church-yard one carrying a bundle—I went into Limehouse-fields and made further inquiry—I knocked at several doors and one door was opened by the prisoner s wife—I asked her if two men had come in—she said No but I saw the prisoner through the glass in the house—I immediately went into the room and said Boxer it is all wrong —he said Mockett I don t understand you what do you mean —I said There is something wrong you know I am right two men have come in here —he said Well it is no use keeping any thing from you two young men have come and taken my room and have left a parcel there and if it is wrong you must take it away —that the man had just gone out and taken the key and one man s name was Stiles—he rose from his chair and said he would authorise me to break open the door of the room which Stiles had taken—I said No he being the landlord had better break it open—he said be would not—I called in a constable and gave him and his wife into custody—I then sent for a ladder and got into the room from the street and found all the property which had been stolen from the prosecutor—I examined the front-parlour shutter of the prosecutor s house and found impressions of a chisel on the outside shutter—it had been forced—I found a chisel corresponding with the impressions in the prisoner s shop—it if not a chisel used by cabinet-makers—Mrs Bruton claimed the shirt the prisoner had on his back at the station-house—I found on a bench in his shop a key which opened the room door where the property was concealed —he told me the young man had taken the key with him—I tried the key to the prosecutor s door but it would not open it—he could have got in at the window Cross-examined Q Who did you receive your information from A Mrs Andrews and another female—I should say I went to the prisoner s house about twenty-five minutes after I had seen her—I went to several houses before I went to his—Mrs Andrews did not say any thing to me about the prisoner—she did not mention any particular person—the prisoner is a cabinet-maker by business—I have known him eight years—I do not know of his keeping a broker s shop or having lodgers—when Mrs Andrews saw him at the station-house she said he was the man—that was between two and three o clock and after I had found the property at his house but she did not know the property was found JURY Q What induced you to go to the prisoner s house A Mrs Andrews said she saw two men go up the church-yard—I then received information and went on in that direction knocking at several doors and seeing the prisoner in his house and knowing him to have been in trouble before it made me suspect him Property produced and sworn to Benjamin Strutt pocket-book maker

—she went to snatch it from him saying it was filthy linen not fit for him to look at—he opened it and it contained nine linen shirts and other things wet—I left them in custody and went with the male prisoner—I took him into a chandler s shop and found in his coat pocket a bag containing eleven skeleton keys and some lucifer-matches—I have since been to the prosecutrix tried the keys to the outer door and two of them open it—when I returned to my brother officer the prisoners were down in the street and Jemima Dorsett said that was not the bundle she had taken to her sister Cecilia Lewis Q Did not I say I had opened one bundle that my sister brought and put a blanket on the bed A No you did not—there was no bundle in the room but this—she denied receiving any bundle at all Dorsett The bundle I took was tied up in a shawl Witness I found no shawl Lewis Q Did you hear me speak to Dorsett or see me in Cromer-street A No THOMAS POCOCK I am a policeman I saw Collier watching—I saw Jemima Dorsett standing at the door of No 31 Cromer-street a long time and I saw William Lewis go into that house—Collier was behind me and could not see him—it was about ten minutes after nine o clock—Jemima Dorsett was standing at the door at the time and a man named Dorsett who is not now in custody immediately followed with a basket on his shoulder—I afterwards saw the man Dorsett come out and go up Cromer-street—he crossed over towards us—Collier and I immediately ran down the court Collier was first—I called out There is no thoroughfare George —we returned in a few minutes and saw Dorsett at the door of 31 Cromer-street—soon afterwards we went up towards Battle-bridge—we crossed the fields the quickest way to Ashby-street and in a few minutes saw Jemima Dorsett pass us with a bundle under her cloak—we watched her to No 22—she came out in two or three minutes and Collier stopped her and asked what she had done with the bundle she took to that house—she said I left it at my sister s —just at that moment Lewis and the man Dorsett came down a court into the street—the man Dorsett ran away and Lewis made a stop—I went up to the room—Catherine Lewis was sitting in a chair with her shawl and bonnet off—I found a bundle of linen in a cupboard—she came there and caught hold of me and said I dare you to touch my dirty linen —Collier said Open it —it consisted of nine wet shirts two shifts and other property—we took Jemima Dorsett into the room and while Collier went out to search Lewis Dorsett said That is the bundle I brought here —I am sure she said so—she afterwards said it was not the bundle it was another but there was no other bundle in the room—there was One dirty shirt and a dirty gown in the room besides Catherine Lewis Did not I say it was not the bundle my sister brought —she had left it at the door I had opened it and taken a blanket out and pat it on my bed the shawl and dirty mattress and other things I put in the cupboard Witness It is quite false—she said nothing of the kind to Mr William Lewis I entered the house full ten minutes before Dorsett and inquired for him but he was not at home Witness It was not half a second before Dorsett went in WILLIAM WINSBURY police-constable E 138 I went into the house No 31 Cromer-street and found two sheets two petticoats a table-cloth a toilet-cover a shift four collars and a basket in

and part secreted among the dust—I know these are the things I found COURT Q Can you distinguish what was found at Dorsett s and what was found at Catherine Lewis s A Yes—they have been kept separate ANN HAZLE WOOD re-examined This basket is mine and all the articles in it—here is ray name on this—I know the pictures—they hung in my room over where the basket was—I am in no business at all—I hare only been in business since last March—I have been living with my son—I rent the rooms myself—I am a widow William Lewis s Defence About a quarter-past nine o clock I was going down Gray s Inn-road and met Dorsett—he said he was going to Mr James and asked me to accompany him there—I said Yes —going along before we got to Mr James I saw the two officers standing opposite—I crossed over to them and lost Dorsett all in a minute—I crossed and spoke to them had I been guilty it is not likely I should have done so Catherine Lewis s Defence I found these things in a court in Tottenham-court-road and asked my brother to carry them home as nobody owned them—I asked him to put them on his shoulder and take them home—he said he would—I meant to go in-doors—he said Dorsett and his sister should not know any thing about it—he put them in-doors and instantly told her to go out to take a bundle of linen to my sister in order to get her out—when she was gone out I went in with the pictures—I afterwards went home to my own place with the bundle and the pictures but the prisoner Dorsett knew nothing of it at all she did not see me with the bundle—it is very hard that she suffers Jemima Dorsett s Defence About half-past nine o clock my husband came in with a basket on his shoulder—I asked what he had there—he seemed very cross and I did not ask him more—I went with the bundle to my sister containing a blanket a pair of stockings a shawl and other things—when I got there she was not at home—I came down stairs and went out—I returned again and knocked the door and said Will you allow me to leave these dirty things at my sister s door —they said Certainly and I left them—I came down and as I was going towards home Collier called me and asked if my husband had been in company with Chapman King—I said I did not know—after some hesitation he said What have you done with that bundle —I said I have taken it to my sister s —he had me taken there and then I found my sister at home—the bundle I took was tied in a shawl—it had been opened and the bed made—I was anxious to get the bundle there as it is a furnished lodging and the blanket did not belong to her—she had lent it to me GEORGE COLLIER re-examined The bundle was as much as she could carry—she had got about twenty yards from the house when I went and found Catherine Lewis in the room—I think she could not have come in after Dorsett went there as Dorsett was about five minutes at the house—I believe there was an old gown lying on the bed and an old shawl in the corner but nothing like that I saw Dorsett carrying Witness for the Defence JOHN QUAINER I am a weaver and live at No 4 Red Lion-row Walworth I have known the prisoner Dorsett nine or ten years—I never knew a blemish in her character—I live a

Sophia was the laundress—they slept on the premises and had the charge of them when the gentlemen had left—the front room on the ground floor I occupy as my own private room—that communicates with the back room which is the office by means of double doors—one of them is covered with red cloth—there is a side door also from my room leading to the passage—that is within the hall doors—as you go in there are the hall doors then a side door on the left hand to go into my private room and then there are double doors from my room into the back room or office—it is usual to keep the hall door fast during the day because the street door is generally open during office hours—the hall doors are fastened by a spring lock which cannot be opened on the outside without a key—it is generally opened by means of a pulley in the office—my side door it secured by a spring lock that cannot be opened from without except by a key—no one can get to my office by the side door unless they have a key or it is opened from within—there are two keys of the spring lock which is on the side door—one of them I kept myself and the other was kept by Thomas Chapple with strict orders not to admit any one but himself and his wife to clean the room—I did not allow even the clerks in my business to go in there—on Saturday the 7th of September I went up-stairs to dinner between twenty minutes to five and five

my waist-coat pocket put it in the lock drew back the lock as usual and went in—immediately on entering my attention was called to the door of my iron safe which was standing wide open—I have a writing table in the middle of the room—I passed by that on one side and saw several keys some of which I have since understood to be skeleton keys lying on a bundle of papers on the writing table and a small piece of iron—I found the keys of that iron sale lying on the carpet opposite another iron safe which had not been opened—one of the drawers of ray iron safe was lying on the carpet empty—when I left the room the drawer of the iron safe contained three 100l and five 10l Bank of England notes twelve table-spoons two gravy spoons and a soup ladle and an old-fashioned gold watch with a double case—they were all gone—I had usually kept the keys of my iron safe in one of the drawers of my writing table which was locked up—when I saw the iron safe open I went round the writing table on the other side and saw the drawer where my keys were kept was open I missed from that drawer a canvass bag containing seven 10l notes and five sovereigns screwed up together and some loose sovereigns—I also missed a gold seal three or four mourning rings and a small watch chain which were all together in a piece of paper in the same drawer—I missed from another drawer in the same table an old pair of black trowsers an old coat which was lying loose in the room and a blue bag which I think was on one of the iron safes—I gave an alarm and the servant came up—I found that Thomas Chapple was not at home—he returned in about half-an-hour—I told him what had happened—he accompanied me to the station-house at Bow-street and the inspector returned with us—I had not at that time any suspicion of Thomas Chapple and on my speaking to him about the robbery he mentioned several names of persons whom he suspected—he mentioned my clerk Widdows and a young man named Roberts who had called at the office that morning—I mentioned to the officer what I had heard from the prisoner and in accordance with his advice the lodging of Widdows was searched but nothing found—in consequence of what Thomas Chapple said to me I gave him directions to watch Widdows at the suggestion of the officer and on the Monday evening about ten o clock he came to me and said he had been down to Widdows—f think he said he had followed him and watched him home—I at last entertained very strong suspicion against Thomas Chapple and on the 13th I gave him into custody—Pocock the officer had found 7l 10s in gold under a stone in the wash-house and also on Thomas Chappell a receipt for 2l 18s 11d and 1s 1d which made 3l —I think it was on the Thursday before the robbery that Thomas Chapple had said he had no money and I gave him a sovereign to pay for beating carpets and other things—when he was given into custody I told him to tell me what he knew about the robbery—he cried and said he could not say any thing without criminating others Cross-examined by MR LUCAS Q Can you undertake to swear positively that on the day of the robbery you fastened the doors A Most positively—it was my invariable custom and I went by the red door and fastened the bolt—it was then between twenty minutes to five and five o clock—Thomas Chapple waited at dinner till about half-past five o clock—it might be a few minutes later—he was to and fro waiting on me till that time—when I am up stairs no one who may call ever goes into my private room not the most intimate friend I have—when I go out at the side-door I draw the door to after me and it shuts itself—I found the doors fastened when I came down—I think I saw Thomas Chapple again that evening about seven o clock—I will not be certain to a few minutes—I had my crest on my spoons—none of this property has been discovered Q When Thomas Chapple cried did he not say he could not tell you any thing without criminating innocent persons A No it was others he said certainly—he was present when the money was discovered under the stone—in consequence of what was found on his person he was asked if he had any more money and said he had some down stairs—he had been in my service at different times from 1833—I have known him eleven or twelve years—his wife was my laundress in my former chambers COURT Q Did he take you to where the money was A He took the officer there I went with them and it was found MR CLARKSON Q From his having been so long with you and having the key of your room did he know where you kept your money and property A I should think he had ample opportunity to know where I kept the keys of my iron chest—he had seen me take them out of the drawer very often GEORGE MUSGROVE I am a police-inspector at the station-house at Bow-street On Saturday the 7th of September I accompanied Mr Porter to his chambers in Lincoln s Inn-fields—I first examined his hall-door the side-door and the door leading from the front room to the office to ascertain if I could by what means the robbery had been effected—there were marks of violence on the red door leading from the front room to the office but the door had not been opened—there had been an attempt which appeared to have been made with a small crow-bar—there was no mark on the outer door—MR Porter and Thomas Chapple accompanied me in my examination—I looked on the carpet in the private room to see if there was any thing lying about and my attention was directed to that part near the door leading to the office and there was no key lying on the carpet I believe—I observed in the presence of Thomas Chapple that I could not tell how they got in as the door had not been opened—I was then near the side-door leading to the passage and Thomas Chapple stooped down as though he would pick up something and he produced this skeleton key— producing one —he said Oh this is the key that opened the door —I am quite sure it was not on the ground where he appeared to pick it up from before he made that observation—the key has been filed and it is broken COURT Q What time did you get there on the Saturday A Between eight and nine o clock—my attention had been so directed to the carpet that I am sure there had been no key lying there—the door opens inwards but he produced this key from beyond the sweep of the door—I tried the key to the side door and so did Thomas Chapple—it was rather hampered at first but it did open it—Thomas Chapple took the lock off the door and then the lock worked easily Cross-examined by MR LUCAS Q What sort of a carpet was in the room A A dark one—I am certain I must have seen this key on the carpet—I looked round with a light in my hand and the key is bright—I had been looking for half-an-hour—when this key was applied to the lock it did not open it at first it did afterwards THOMAS POCOCK police-sergeant F 13 I went to the premises on the Monday and on the 13th I went and took Thomas Chapple into custody—he informed me he had money in the wash-house—I asked where—he said Let me go with you and I will show you —I allowed him to go and under a stone which he pointed out I found seven sovereigns and a half—it was on some wet damp soil but the sovereigns were quite bright and clean they could not have been there many days—I took from him this bill— read — Mr Chapple to Thomas Payne Repairing boots and shoes &c 2l 18s 11d Paid Thomas Payne September 13th —I found on him 1s 6 1/2 d —I had a crow-bar that was found there but I have mislaid it at the office—the prisoners were discharged and re-apprehended—I have got the bunch of skeleton-keys that were found on the writing-table—I am satisfied that the marks on the red door had been made by the crow-bar—I tried one of the keys on this bunch to the drawer of Mr Porter s writing-table in which the keys of the iron-chest had been—it opened that drawer and some others as well Cross-examined by MR LUCAS Q Thomas Chapple took you to where this money was A Yes—I asked him how he came to put it in such a curious place he said I am obliged to hide my money about because my wife is a drunkard —the sovereigns looked bright and fresh—the place was close by the drain—I cannot say how long the sovereigns had been there but in my opinion not long—the crow-bar was a small one and it was jagged—the marks on the door were nearly opposite the lock ELIZABETH GUPPY I was in the service of Thomas Chapple and his wife and assisted in the business of the house at Mr Porter s Thomas Chapple had two children—on the Thursday before the robbery I was in the kitchen down stairs with the children and saw one of the children at one of the dresser drawers which Thomas Chapple used for keeping his papers in—the child picked a key out of the drawer—it was like one of the keys produced—Thomas Chapple was in the kitchen at the time the child produced the key to him and he said Put down that key —the child put it back in the drawer—on the next day I went to the drawer myself to look for a bit of sealing wax and I saw the key then in the drawer—I took it in my hand and looked at it as it looked such a curious key I had never seen one like it before—Thomas Chapple was then in the kitchen—I asked him what key that was—he said it belonged to Mr Lee up-stairs a gentleman who had been a tenant of the chambers up-stairs but who had left more than two years —he said it was a little padlock key that had belonged to Mr Lee—on the afternoon the robbery took place I was looking in that drawer for something I forget what and the key was not there then—I took every thing out of the drawer—on that afternoon I was in the front kitchen—there are two kitchen windows and I could from thence see any body passing out of the doorway at Mr Porter s—I saw the prisoner Charles King whom I had seen once before about half-past five o clock as near as I can recollect coming down from the steps out of the passage—there are railings before the house and the window gave me a command of the railings—he had a blue bag under his left arm—he went away very quickly—I saw him come down the steps—I could not see whether he had been inside the house but while I was in the kitchen I heard footsteps in Mr Porter s private room before I saw him—I had seen him once before in Lincoln s Inn-fields—I do not know exactly the day nor how long before the robbery—I did not know his name at that time—I had been out walking with Thomas Chapple and was going in when I saw King and he whistled at which Thomas Chapple nodded his head—that was all that passed—after this robbery I was taken to the prison by Mr Collier the officer to see if I knew any person—I saw Charles King there and selected him from a good many others—on Saturday morning the day of the robbery Thomas Chapple said he bad no money but he should have some by and by and I thought he was going to take one of the gentleman s books for some money—he said could I lend him him half-a-crown—I said No and I did not think Mrs Chapple had any—he said Oh nonsense Mr Porter gave her a half-sovereign yesterday —MRS Chapple was present at the time—he put his band down her bosom and took half-a-crown from her—she was tipsy at the time she was in the habit of getting tipsy —Thomas Chapple then went out—I think it was about half-past twelve or one o clock—he staid out about three hours—when he came back I told him his face was very red—I do not know whether he had been drinking but his face was very red indeed—I remember Mr Porter s dinner time that day and the alarm of the robbery and I saw the state of the room—in the course of the same evening after the robbery the prisoner told me he was going to Dublin on the following Friday—on the Sunday evening as I was sitting in the kitchen with him he said he had some money under ground and he would show it me if I liked to see it—I said No because I was afraid—I did not want to see it because I knew it was not his own—at the time he told me he had a book in his band—he was not reading it aloud but muttering it to himself and I said his countenance looked very frightful—it quite frightened me—he said it was only my fancy—this was about ten o clock at night as near as I can think—his wife was in the kitchen asleep at that time—she was not drunk every day—on the Monday morning in consequence of what he had said to me I looked in the wash-house and saw one of the flag-stones bad been moved but I did not take it up—in the afternoon of that Monday I was cleaning some knives in the wash-house and Thomas Chapple was cleaning them with me—I told him I had had a dream—he said Oh do tell me what it was —I said I dreamed that he had hid the money under that stone—I was near to the stone at that time and put my foot upon it to show which stone I alluded to—he said Oh good God is it so — I bad not bad any such dream I only did it to hear what he would say —he asked me if I had looked under the stone—I said No —that was all that passed at that time about the stone—when we had done the knives be gave me a letter to put in the post—he said it was to his brother Charles—as I was going with it I looked at the direction—I saw it was to Charles Chapple and it was Thomas Chapple s writing—when I returned from the post-office I asked who he sent it to—he asked if I had read the direction—I said Yes —he said he had sent it to his brother to fetch away the money what he had been hiding as if the place was searched it would make him look suspicious—on the Tuesday afternoon I was in the wash-house by myself and lifted up the stone but Thomas Chapple was coming down the stairs and I let the stone fall—he came into the wash-house and said I was Very curious—I said You have sent away the money because you thought I should take some —he said God forbid that I should think so —on the Thursday following he said he was going to his brother Charles to fetch some money to pay his bills—he went out that evening—I do not know at what time but be came back about three o clock the next morning—I got out of bed to let him in—I said it was very late—he said it was not much more than one o clock—I went to the clock to see the time and found it to be three—I got him some cold tea—he was at that time in bed and sat up to take the tea—he took up his pillow and showed me a great many sovereigns I should think ten or eleven or there might be more—he said be bad been to his brother Charles to fetch them to pay his bills the next day and I could have half-a-sovereign if I liked—I never saw so much money as that in his possession before—he owed me money for wages—I had asked him for my wages a good many times before that and had not got it—he then told me I could have 10s of it—he and his wife had been in the habit of pledging things before that and I had pledged wearing apparel for them Q Do you remember Thomas Chapple being first taken into custody A Yes and he was discharged from Bow-street—I do not know in what month that was—after his discharge I met him accidentally in Tottenbam-court-road—he said You did not think I should be let out again —he told me he had been discharged that day—on the Saturday following that day I saw him again in Brook-street New-road down in the kitchen where he lived—my sister went there to see Mrs Chapple and I went after her—on that occasion Thomas Chapple said that they were going to have a grand dinner the next day—I have seen his brother Charles—I do not know when Charles was taken up but I understood it was on a Sunday evening—Thomas Chapple came to my sister s lodging in Whittleburgh-street on a Monday—I do not know whether it was the Monday after that Saturday that I had seen him—I saw him at my sister s—he said his brother Charles was taken to prison for stealing a coat and he Thomas Chapple was going into the country—he said he was going to meet Charles King in some fields which he mentioned the name of but I have forgotten it—he said he was to meet King to decide whether he was going into the country or not—he asked me to go with him to meet King but I did not go—Thomas Chapple called at my sister s again about eleven o clock that evening—I was gone to bed but I got up to see him—he said he had seen Charles King and King had told him he had better chance it—the prisoner Sophia is Thomas Chapple s sister—I asked him what Sophia had said—he told me that she said he had better stay—after this I accompanied him to a public-house in the Seven Dials—it might perhaps be a fortnight after—I did not go inside I staid outside as Thomas Chapple told me to do as he said he wanted to see his sister Sophia—while I was waiting Thomas Chapple came out and Charles King came out following him—I saw them speak together but I did not hear what they said—Charles King then went into the public-house again and Chapple came to me and said Do you know who that is I said No —he said Charles King —I did not know him by the name of Charles King at that time—Chapple walked home with me—we went through Regent-street—he said he had had a letter from Dublin from his sister—he said he had written to his sister to send him some money to pay for a solicitor for his brother Charles—he did not say whether the letter he had received was an answer to his or not—as we were going up Regent-street we met Sophia Cox with some other woman—Chapple called Cox aside he spoke to her and gave her the letter COURT Q When he talked of going to Dublin did he say whether he was going alone A On the Sunday he said Mr and Mrs Mackie were going with him—I never saw those persons Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q The house from the steps of which you saw King come one day is all let out in chambers A Yes there are a great many different persons living there Cross-examined by MR LUCAS Q For what purpose did you go before the Magistrate the first time A To hear Thomas Chapple examined—I was called as a witness—I do not know whether I was a witness for or against him—I think Mr Steele called me but I am not positive—Chapple s wife was given to drink and he was obliged to prevent her having money or any valuable articles even when he found she was possessed of some little silver he was obliged to take it from her I saw him do it on one occasion—MR Porter told them if they wanted any money to come to him and he would give it them and it was set down in the book—I had asked for my wages and on the Thursday he said I could have half a sovereign but he did not give it me—he had told me on the Sunday that he had hid money under ground and on the Monday morning I went to look and I saw a stone had been moved in the wash-house—I thought the money was under there but I had not looked—I swear that I had not seen the money under there before I told the dream—I swear I do not know who put it there—I did not state all that I have now on the first examination—I was sent away for a letter and I did not state all I knew then—I did on the second examination—I cannot tell how long I was at the first examination—I staid some time and was examined by Mr Clarkson as to all I knew touching the robbery—I lived servant about three years with Thomas Chapple backwards and forwards—when I saw the man go down the steps Thomas Chapple was not in the kitchen—I had seen him I think ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before—it was about half-past five o clock—I cannot exactly say how long Thomas Chapple had been away from the kitchen MR CLARKSON Q Are you sure that King was the man who was leaving the steps A I am quite sure of that—I saw a blue bag under his arm—I was in the habit of attending the persons who occupied chambers there—MR Turner who occupied chambers there was in town on the 7th of September as well as Mr Porter and I think Mr Burton was but I am not certain COURT Q Have you told us all that passed when Thomas Chapple told you that he had thoughts of going to Ireland A As near as I can recollect—he told me there was to be a grand dinner—I was not at any party of theirs—he never paid me my wages—he did not describe the coat his brother was taken for nor say whose coat it was—I saw two or three other keys in the prisoner s drawer besides the one I have described—I think one of them was the small key which is on this bunch but I would not swear it JOHN PORTER re-examined I did not allow Thomas Chapple any thing for taking care of the chambers—there were other persons in the house—he got about 25s a week in all CHARLES WIDDOWS I am clerk to Mr Porter On the Monday after the robbery the 9th of September I was at Mr Gable s the Red Cross Saloon Bethnal-green about half-past eight o clock in the evening—Thomas Chapple came there to me—it was not by any appointment that I had made with him—he told me he had been sent to watch me to observe whether I spoke to a person wearing a white hat—I told him I had no objection to being watched as I was not ashamed of any place I went to—he told me that it being an unpleasant thing he thought he had better tell me of it and also that he had had a disguise given him so that I should not know him—he then asked a description of the house and an account of the situation where I resided in case he should be asked questions that he might not be at a loss—I gave him a description of where I resided and after that he conversed with me further—he said he either had or was about to speak to Mr Sakey a person whom I know to form a company of comedians to go into the country—he said You know that I am rather uncomfortable at home from circumstances that you are aware of—I have saved some money and I should like to go into the country and I should not like to trust Sakey unless I knew him —he did not state any specific amount of money then—he asked if I had any objection to go with him—he did not mention what would be required for me—he said he should not mind putting down 20l 25l or 80l to the same amount of Sakey s and going to Liverpool—I said I did not care whether I went or not—a comedian was passing of the name of Hodges and he said Is it Liverpool you mean —Thomas Chapple said yes and asked him if he would go—Hodges said he was a married man and did not care to change his situation—when Thomas Chapple spoke to me about putting down the money I wondered how he became possessed of it as four or five days before he had come to ask me to lend him two pence to get him some beer for his dinner as he was stumped put—in consequence of what occurred on that day and what he had said to me four or five days before I considered it my duty to mention this to Mr Porter and did so on the Wednesday—a short period before the robbery I saw harles Chapple at Lincoln s-inn-fields—he came to see his brother and I went with Thomas and Charles Chapple to a public-house on the further side of the fields leading to Clare-market—before we got to there and after we left Mr Porter s we met with Charles King who was waiting about—we all went to the public-house together COURT Q What time did you leave Mr Porter s on the Saturday on which the robbery took place A As near as possible at twenty minutes past five o clock—MR Porter had no other clerk—my going out left the office adjoining Mr Porter s private room empty—there is another room on that floor at the back which was used as a bed-room by Thomas Chapple and his wife Cross-examined by MR LUCAS Q How long have you been clerk to Mr Porter A About two years—I have been in Mr Porter s private room when he was not there—I got in by Thomas Chapple s key—I never went in without Thomas Chapple or his wife opening the door and going in with me—I may have been in the room alone but I do not remember it—I usually left the office about six o clock but I left that day about twenty minutes past five o clock as I had a summons to serve on a person in Token-house-yard to attend on the Judge and they closed at six o clock—I wanted to be there before that time—I am still in Mr Porter s service—if I wanted any papers from the private room I knew where to find them—I did not know that Mr Porter had money in that room—I knew he had valuable property there because a box of papers and plate was brought out of that room by Thomas Chapple and put into my room at the latter end of August or the beginning of September when Mr Porter was out of town for a few days—I was given to understand that it contained plate and I gave a receipt fur it Q Will you undertake to swear that you did not know that there was money in that room A Upon my word I never gave it a thought—I know some solicitors keep a little tin box with cash in it but whether Mr Porter did I do not know—I have seen him take money from a little drawer by his side—I do not follow any other business—I have never been in any trouble—I swear I never stole a Macintosh—I saw Thomas Chapple every day at the office—I never sang at a concert I am no singer—I do not know how Chapple came to ask me to go to form a theatrical party—I have belonged to a private dramatic society and I have sometimes exhibited there GEORGE ROBERTS I live in Castle-street Long-acre On Thursday the 12th of September I was at the Archers public-house in Newton-street Holborn—Thomas Chapple came to me there from two to half-past two o clock and we remained there together till very near four o clock— I had not at that time been charged with this robbery —Thomas Chapple came up stairs to me as I was sitting smoking a cigar—he stated that he was very sorry to inform me but he wished to act towards me as a friend that I was suspected of the robbery and that the officers would come and take me into custody on that evening—I had previously stated in conversation that I was going down into the country—he then advised me by all means to get out of London as soon as I possibly could—he told me I was suspected on account of my calling at Mr Porter s office on the morning of that Saturday— I had called there to see Mr Widdows —he advised me to go into the country that if they came after me they would be compelled to pay my expenses back again—I had a raffle at that house that night for a pair of trowsers and he told me the officers would come there to take me while the raffle was going on because they suspected that the trowsers were the trowsers stolen from Mr Porter s—he described in what way the robbery was effected—he stated that they entered from the door in the passage that they had opened the door with a key which he described that they were obliged to lift the key a little up before they could open the lock with it and when they got in they went to a table in which was a drawer containing the keys of an iron safe where the money deposited was stolen from—he said there was a pair of trowsers and a coat stolen and that on the floor there were some skeleton keys found—he then wished me to go to Mr Porter s that Mr Porter might examine me on the subject—when we came down he mentioned this to the landlady— the land-lord was out —he advised her not to have the raffle that night on account of the officers coming after me as it might get the landlord into trouble—he then stated the same particulars to her about the robbery as I have stated and she advised me by all means to go with him to Mr Porter s which we started from that house to do—when we got to the corner of Parker-street Little Queen-street he said Stop a minute we will go in here into a public-house at the corner and he said Pay for a pint of half-and-half and I will pay you again by-and-by —while we were in there he begged of me if I knew any thing of the robbery to tell him which of course I denied and after that he stated that he wished to go into the country on a theatrical speculation and wished me Mr and Mrs Sakey Mr and Mrs Mackie Mr Widdows and himself to be of the company and I think a Miss Frazer but I am not positive—he stated that he had 25l or 30l by him but of course he should expect some of the others to put some down too—when I was paying for the half-and-half he said If you want ten shilling or a sovereign I can let you bare it to-morrow —I then said We bad better now go to Mr Porter s or he may be out —he said No we had better not go till to-morrow morning —we then returned to the Archera public-house in Newton-street Holborn—he then wished me to go with him at night to the Cock public-house somewhere in that neighbourhood but where I do not know where he said he thought he could point out one of the parties that bad stolen the property from Mr Porter s—he described him as being not a very tall man but middling size rather stout dark whiskers and wearing a white hat saying he was certain he would be there that evening—I appointed to go with him but not liking to go alone I made an appointment with a man named Farrel to go with me but we did not go Cross-examined by MR LUCAS Q What are you A An actor and a singer—I have known Widdows for four years—I have met him repeatedly and we have been out together—the first of my acquaintance with him was meeting him in the boxes of the Shoreditch theatre—I was not then in the profession—I never joined in theatricals with him—I do not know that he was ever engaged in such a thing—he might have performed at a private place but never engaged in a public place—I knew Thomas Chapple from going to the house to see Mr Widdows—when I went there I was in the back-office—I know a room adjoining the back office—I have been in it since the robbery but I never saw the inside of it before JAMES BLACK On Saturday the 7th of September last my parents were living in Drummond-street St Pancras and I was with them—I was then in the employ of William Wilks a beer-shop keeper in Harford-street Fitzroy Market—I know Charles Chapple the brother of Thomas Chappie and I know Charles King On the 7th of September about seven o clock in the evening or a little after Charles Chapple and Charles King came into Mr Wilks s—Chapple had a blue bag with him—they first came into the public parlour and then went with Mr Wilks into a private room where Chapple pulled out of the bag a pair of trowsers and an old coat—I was not in that room but the door was open—he asked Mr Wilks to purchase them—Wilks asked what he wanted for them—Chapple said What will you give —he said I will give half-a-crown for them and Chapple said You shall have them and as you bid so well I have someelse for you —Chapple then put his hand into his pocket and pulled out what appeared to be a paper parcel but what it contained I could not say—it was not very large—he could hold it in his hand and his hand was shut—it was such a parcel as might have contained notes and I heard the word notes mentioned but who by I cannot say—Wilks told them to go and sit down and he would see what he could do for them—he said he would go out and fetch some person but he did not say who nor what for—he then took off his apron and went out—he was gone three-quarters of an hour and came back with two persons—Charles Chapple and Charles King were a that time in the public parlour and they asked me to drink Chapple addressed himself to me and said Our long talked of job is come off at last —Charles King said Yes to the tune of two or three hundred —this was in the public parlour—Charles Chapple then said he should be a gentleman for a little while he had got enough to keep him for two or three winters Q Were either of the two persons who came back with Wilks known to you A They were not particularly known—I had seen one of them before once or twice—I know a person named Deaf Harry—he was in the parlour but he was not one that came with Wilks—the conversation that I have related took place while Wilks was gone—when Wilks came back he beckoned to Charles Chapple and Charles King—they went into the private parlour with Wilks and the two persons who returned with him Deaf Harry and another whom I do not know—the door was shut—they remained in the private parlour I should say about three-quarters of an hour then came into the public parlour again and Charles Chapple called for half-a-gallon of ale which he paid for—I heard Charles King say to Charles Chapple Well we have got two hundred and eighty but whether he meant money for the notes or what I do not know—Charles Chapple said it was Tom s job but Thomas Chapple was not there—Charles Chapple told me in Charles King s presence that he had been down to Mr Porter s in Lincoln s Inn-fields that afternoon with Charles King—that he had done the robbery and Charles King stood outside—during the evening Sophia Chapple or Cox came in with Henry Cox with whom she was living—she walked towards Charles Chapple who put his hand into his pocket pulled out some gold and gave it her—she then went away and left Henry Cox behind her—they then remained playing at cards till about twelve o clock—Henry Cox went away a very little while before the rest—I heard Charles Cox say he should like to go to Boulogne and Charles King said Yes I should like to have a little journey into the country —on Monday the 9th of September Charles Chapple Henry Cox and two or three other persons came into our beef shop about half-past two or three o clock—they said they were going to dinner and when they had been there about half-an-hour Sophia Cox came and called them to dinner—they all went

Tottenham-court-road about half-past eleven o clock—he had another person with him and Cox said to me I suppose you have heard of Charley s job —I said Yes —he said It is a good one —I did not make any answer—he said I suppose they will make it all right with you —I made no answer—he said Mind you don t split or if you do look out Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Now attend the words he made use of were It is a good one A Yes—I am positive those were the words Q Was not this what he said He hat done it up to some tune A No—he said what I have stated—there might be more said but I am swearing to the words I can answer for—he might use other words but I cannot recollect them—it is some time ago—I have been a waiter and potman but I am not in a situation at present—I left my last situation through letters sent out by the party s friends who are now here—I was informed so—I had been a fortnight or three weeks in Mr Wilks s employment when this took place—there were ten or a dozen persons present at this conversation when Charles Chapple and Charles King came there and the conversation was about Mr Porter s robbery—I had known Charles King at that time about four or five months—the last situation I had as potman was at Bagnigge Wells—that is two or three months ago—since then I have been carrying messages or parcels—I have not received money from any particular individual

living on the casual chance of what I have earned and been at home with my friends—my father has assisted me—I left him at home when I came here—I have been living with him since I was out of place Q Who commenced the conversation in the public-house about the robbery A Charles Chapple the prisoner who is not here—he asked Wilks if he would buy the trowsers and coat—Wilks asked what he wanted for them—Charles Chapple said What will you give and Wilks said he would give half-a-crown—I do not know where Wilks is now—I left his employ on the following week—I was before a Magistrate for an assault—I forgot that when I said I was only taken up once—I cannot tell how long it is since—it may be four or five months—I got fined 10s —it might be two months after I left Wilks that I went before the Magistrate—the conversation in the public-house was not loud enough for all the ten persons to hear—it was not confided to me it was said to them—I do not know whether deaf Harry heard it—I do not know whether he is deaf—I should say he is called so because he is deaf—the conversation was addressed to the party at that end of the room—there were four or five there—I do not know how many there were that I knew I did not take particular notice—none of them made any remark but Charles King—I do not know whether the party consisted of six persons—they were drinking together—I am sure Charles Chapple told me he committed the robbery and that Charles King stood outside Cross-examined by MR LUCAS Q How long have you known Thomas Chapple A Ten or twelve months—I first saw him at the Crown and Anchor public-house in Regent s-park THOMAS JAMES In September last I lived in Little Cumming-street Pentonville On Thursday or Friday morning the 13th or 14th of September Charles King came to my house between eight and nine o clock—I had a lodger named Lewis who was an acquaintance of Charles King—I was at that time confined to my house with a broken bone—I remained in the room while Charles King and Lewis were breakfasting—they entered into conversation and I heard Charles King say to Lewis There is a 50l chaunt for that job at Porter s in Lincoln s Inn-fields —I also heard from a question that Lewis put to King that they had sold some plate at Child s in Goswell-street-road—I did not hear any more particular conversation about that—King came again on the Saturday morning and said he did not know what he should do or where he should go to—Lewis advised him to go to Boulogne—King said he had to meet Chapple in the Dials to arrange where to go to—I will not be exact about the Christian name he used but it was Chapple—King left my house then—I saw him again on the following Tuesday at this end of London-bridge but on Monday the 16th of September a twopenny post letter came to Lewis by the last post in the evening—Lewis asked me to read it to him—it was from Charles Chapple to Lewis—I read it to Lewis and afterwards burned it—in consequence of what I observed in that letter I went for the purpose of apprehending Charles Chapple and Charles King on the Tuesday—on my arrival at London-bridge I saw Charles Chapple and Charles King— I did not know Chapple at that time —they were together—I do not know whether they came in a cab—they bad carpet bags and were both dressed in Macintoshes—my lodger Lewis was with them—I gave information to the policeman on duty but they escaped—there is no doubt but Lewis told them I was there Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What are you A A shoe-maker—I have not worked at it for about eight months and then I did not work in general at the business but for my friends or children—I have a small income derived from a relation—I do not keep a lodging-house—I never did no more than one or two lodgers—there may have been three at times—I may have had two lodgers besides my father—there may be two or three of a family in one room but there has been but one tenant—I have had a man and his wife and seven children Q Had you known Charles King before A Never in my life—I had seen him once at my house on the day before I beard this conversation but then only for a moment—he was a perfect stranger—he said this at once before me and Lewis—he might have said it from Lewis being my lodger—I thought it was a curious subject—such a thing never happened to me in my life before nor since—I was once secretary to a loan society—I was never charged with any thing—I have a little income by which I have supported myself and my wife since this prosecution with my wife s work—I have received money from many people—I have received my own money which I have coming in every month—I have not earned money by any calling or office—when I have lost a day s work in looking after the prisoner Charles King Mr Porter has though proper to pay me for it bat I do not consider that earning COURT Q Have you been paid regularly by Mr Porter A No—I could not tell how much I have received from him—I have not received 10l —I may have received 5l MR PHILLIPS Q And you are here as a witness with 5l of his money in your pocket A No I have not—I have spent more than Mr Porter gave me—I never made any charge upon him—I never received any thing for a day—it is a month ago and more than that since Mr porter paid me any—I cannot tell when I first appeared before the Magistrate—I think it was on the 21st of March—it was on the 17th of September that I first took any step with regard to this robbery—it was not by the day that Mr Porter paid me—he probably made me a present of a few shillings—I went with Mr Porter to Gravesend on the day we lost the prisoners—I cannot say when I first received any money—it might be the latter end of September or October—I have not been working at any trade since 1833—I will not swear that I may not have had 8l of Mr Porter—I do not know whether I put it down in a book—I put down no money in a book that I received from Mr Porter Q Why did you swear you did not know whether you put it down A What has that to do with this robbery —I never put them in a book and I do not believe I have received 8l from Mr Porter—it has been 5s or 6s at a time—it is impossible for me to say how much—it has been a great many days during the last eight months MR CLARKSON Q You were employed by Mr Porter to look after King A I was not employed but I gave him information and he thought proper to make me a remuneration—I was on and off for about six months looking after King—I went to Gravesend and other places—the largest sum I ever received was about three half-crowns but not for one day JOHN PORTER re-examined I did not know any thing whatever about Charles King till I received communication from Thomas James—I never paid him any money for evidence—he knew King and he went down to Gravesend which the officers knew—I gave him sometimes half-a-crown and sometimes other sums what I thought might be his outlay—perhaps in all about 7l Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you keep any book of it A I did at first—I am not aware that I have given money to any one else—I may have given Pocock the officer some silver to reimburse him—I gave him 5s on one occasion—the officer came to me and I took two half-crowns out of my pocket and gave him—he had incurred expenses—he went to search a house and there was a cab to pay for—I may have given the other witnesses money to pay their expenses—I gave Selina Kemp 3s or 4s —I think Black had half-a-crown for his expenses—I think I paid Collier as he had been put to expense—I do not recollect how much I gave him—I have not made up the account—I do not know that I put it on paper—I have not put the sums together—I could not tell how much I paid Collier—he went down to Reading I think and he wanted expenses COURT Q Have you given him 3l or 4l A Yes more than that should say 10l —it was for reimbursing the expenses—I could not state the amount—I have been put to considerable expense Cross-examined by MR LUCAS Q Will you state as a man of honour whether any of the witnesses and which if any have a prospect of receiving money after this trial A None whatever and what I have paid them has I believe been much less than they have actually laid out MR CLARKSON Q How long have you been in practice as a solicitor A Ten years—on my solemn oath I have not furnished money to any witness for any thing more than for their expenses on my account and their loss of time—I was very unwilling to let them have a farthing MARY JAMES On Saturday morning the 14th of September when Charles King came to my husband s house I opened the door to him—Charles King was in company with Lewis our lodger and my husband—I did not remain in the room all the time with them—they went out—I went out to look for a lodging and in the meantime they came back—it was between one and two o clock—I told Charles King I had seen a lodging—he went with me to look at it—we did not see the lodging—the person was not at home and Charles King declined seeing another lodging saying his time was short as he had to meet a friend of his in Seven Dials at five o clock—he said he was sorry he had not procured one before as he knew they were after him and another for a robbery in Lincoln s Innfields SELINA KEMP I am in the service of a clergyman at Paddington—I know Henry Cox—Sophia Cox was living with him—Sophia Cox is a sister of Charles Chapple On Monday the 9th of September Sophia Cox came to my lodging in Chapel-street Tottenham-court-road about three o clock in the afternoon—she had a brown paper parcel with her—I asked what was in it—she said Some shirts for Charles Chapple —we went out together to her lodging in Southampton-court—as we were going she said Charles King and Charles Chapple had done the robbery on Saturday night—I remained at Sophia s lodging to tea and then I left her—I saw her again a few days after and then she told me that on the night the robbery was done she was very badly off and when she came home she began to scold Charles Chapple and Henry Cox and Henry Cox said to her Hold your noise here is a sovereign for you —that Charles Chapple said Hold your noise see what I have done—I have done it at last and he held out his hand and had something in it but she did not see what it was—she said she told them while she was cross and scolding them that they were not half thieves enough—on the following Wednesday I called on her again and went to fetch something for her—I think that was on the 22nd of September—Thomas Chapple came in and be and Sophia Cox both looked very much confuted—she said to him Will you have any thing to drink —he said Yes —I went and got sixpenny-worth of gin—when I came in with it Sophia Cox told me to go over to her father s to fetch her brother George—I went and he came back with me—he went in and I met Sophia Cox at the door—the did not seem to wish for my company and I wished her good night—I saw that Henry Cox was in the room as I went away—from that time I did not hear any thing more about the robbery till Thomas Chapple was taken into custody which was on the Friday after—after that Sophia Cox told me she had 5l of the money—that Henry Cox had 5l and that Charles Chapple and Charles King were gone to Dublin because they were frightened for fear they should be taken up—I was taken up about three weeks or a month after when I was in Sophia Cox s apartment—Henry Cox was with me—I sent to my parents and expressed a desire to say what I knew about the matter—while in custody I was in the same place where Sophia Cox was—when we were remanded she told me not to say any thing and she would give me two sovereigns—the said she hoped her father would get off for Charles Chapple s money was hid on Mr Semple s wharf— I think he is a timber-merchant I am not certain —her father s name is Charles Chapple—he is the prisoner—the Charles Chapple I have been speaking of is the son who is not here—Sophia Cox said she wished they the policemen had not taken the coat as that was the coat that Charles Chapple had on when he did the robbery—she is not the wife of Henry Cox—she told me so—when I was in custody and was brought up Henry Cox used to tell me not to say any thing and I should be sure to get off—Henry Cox and Sophia Cox were in bed together one morning when I was there and a strange man came in—Henry Cox said to that man MRS King has got Charles King s money and I should like to go and take it from her for I dare say it is somewhere about the house COURT Q What have you been in the habit of calling Mrs Cox A I used to call her Sophy—I used to represent her to other people as Cox s wife when I spoke of her—she told me herself a good bit ago that she was not his wife and her sister told me so likewise—I am now in service myself Q How came you not to make any communication to your parents when you found the persons with whom you were intimate were a gang of thieves A Because my relations would not speak to me—they had turned their backs on me—I was not in service at that time Henry Cox Q Will you have the kindness to tell how it was you were first with us A Doing some needle-work that I never got paid for—I turned Sophia Cox s silk dress—I never walked the Quadrant in Regent-street till Sophia Cox s sister took me there—I was not ill when I first came to your place—I should not have been in trouble but for you Henry Cox When she left us she took several articles of wearing apparel away from my wife and she was afraid of being taken for them COURT Q You say Sophia Cox s sister took you into the street—what is her name A Eliza Chapple—she took me down the Quadrant first but now my friends have enabled me to get a service and I am living in service very comfortably—it was owing to my getting to those bad habits that my friends turned their backs on me Sophia Cox You stole a bundle of things of mine and you said you would do for me—you said you would not mind lying a month for me—I took you when you had robbed your lodging in Pitt-street Tottenham-court-road—I let you stay a few days till you could get the money—you said you would send me out of the country and owned you had got my things—you made the bonnet dirty and sent it to be cleaned COURT Q Did you ever take a bundle of her things A No—she gave me a bundle I did not steal it—I never lived in Pitt-street—I asked her one day to lend me a bonnet and I dirtied it and sent it to be cleaned and when she can pay for it she shall have it WILLIAM MAGRATH I live in Nelson-place New-road and am a plumber I knew Mr James of Little Cumming-street—I was there on the 12th or 13th of September about four o clock in the afternoon—I went into the front parlour to wait for James and after I had waited a little time Lewis who lodged there I do not know his Christian name I think it is William and Charles King came in—Charles King produced a watch and asked Lewis to wind it up for him—Lewis asked him what he had given for it—King said he had taken it out of pledge for 18s or a pound and he would have kept the gold watch but Chapple made him sell it with the plate—I was looking through the parlour window and thinking the conversation rather strange I paid more attention than I should have done—Lewis asked King what were the amounts of the notes—King said Tens and hundreds and that they had received between 200 and 300l for them—I then turned round and said Gentlemen you have got a good booty or prize where did they come from —Charles King said From the lawyer s in the fields —they did not stop above five or six minutes—James was at that time ill in bed—when the others were gone he came down and I told him the moment he came down—on the Tuesday following James came to me and in consequence of what he told me I went with him to London-bridge to apprehend Charles King—I know the hotel at the foot of the bridge—after waiting some time I saw a cab drive to the foot of London-bridge and just at the moment I saw King and another young man close to the cab but I cannot say that I saw them get out of it—there is a way out of the hotel which leads to the water-side and I lost sight of them—I afterwards went with Mr James to Mr Porter s to tell what I knew Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Had you known King before A I never saw him before—Lewis was in the room—I have been a plumber and glazier all my life—I lodged at James s about three years ago—I went there that day about some glass I had to repair for him—I had known Lewis before but not Charles King WILLIAM LEIGH WOOD City police-constable No 410 I was on duty at London-bridge on the 17th of September—James and Magrath applied to me to take some persons into custody but I searched and found nobody—I saw a number of persons about but none

Macintoshes on and were going towards the steamer GEORGE COLLIER police-sergeant E 38 On the 29th of September I went in company with Pocock to the lodging of Ann King in Frederick-street Portland-town—I believe she is the mother of Charles King—I found her in the front parlour—I told her she was suspected of being concerned in Mr Porter s robbery at No 22 Lincoln s Inn-fields—the said she knew nothing about it—I asked if she had got any money—she said no she had not got any—I asked when she had seen her son Charles last—she said About a fortnight ago —I asked if she knew where he was—she said No —I searched the room and while I was doing so she walked to the door several times and endeavoured to go out—I pulled her back and told her I could not allow her to go out—I found no money nor property relating to Mr Porter s robbery—I then asked if she had got any money about her—she said No not a farthing —I asked her to show me her pocket—she pulled out some papers—I said that would not do for me—I felt and there was something hard—I told her to take her pocket off and she gave it me—I found in it fifty-one sovereigns and 23s in silver—I asked whose that was and where she got it—she said From Eliza Plant and at that moment Pocock who had left the room brought Eliza Plant in in custody—I told her that Mrs King said she had received that money from her—Eliza Plant said Yes I brought it up and gave it her I received it from Charles King —I told Ann King I should take her on suspicion of the robbery—she said If right takes place others will suffer for it as well as me — Plant cohabits with Charles King—I afterward caught them in bed in Nottingham-place Seven-dials —I went to Southampton-court where I found Sophia Cox Henry Cox and Selina Kemp—I found a coat there and in a drawer in the wash-hand stand I found a life-protector—I asked Henry Cox whose coat that was hanging behind the door—he said it was his—I said I should take it—Sophia Cox looked at me was very much confused and asked what I wanted to take that coat for—I said I thought I knew a person who had worn it on a certain day and I should take it—I then took them to the station-house—on the 5th of October I went to Brook-street New-road where Charles Chapple lives—he was not at home but came in directly—I asked if he had got any money—he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a bag containing half-a-sovereign and 3s 6d in silver—I asked if that was all he had got he said it was—I then searched him and in his trowsers pocket I found five sovereigns wrapped in this piece of green baize—I asked him if they were his he said no it was his master s Mr Semple of Camden-town and he had received it for a bill for him yesterday— there is a Mr Semple keeps a timber yard and Charles Chapple worked there —I said he must go with me to Mr Semple s to know if he had received it for a bill for him—he then said Oh dear it is no use telling a lie about it I picked it up in the Park

and Sergeant Pocock had been watching the prisoner s house in Cromer-street from eight o clock— he had been a policeman —his wife came and looked continually at the street-door and a little after nine o clock I saw a man who I believe to be the prisoner go into the house with a basket—his wife was at the door and they went in together—in a minute or two he came out and crossed over from his lodging to the place where I and my brother officer were—seeing him coming we ran away and got down into a court to conceal ourselves—while I was going my brother officer said George come back there is no thoroughfare —we then watched the prisoner—he went to his own door and was talking to another man—he said Pocock and Collier are watching me for I heard Pocock say George come back there is no thoroughfare —the prisoner said They think I have got a swag to-night but they shan t have it — a swag means a quantity of stolen property —he turned round and went up Cromer-street away from his

on my shoulder and somebody I think he said Morris undid the door—I am not sure the name is Morris—there was a man with one ear in custody and he goes by that lick name—I mentioned what he told me to the gaoler and as I took him to the van he said I did not think you would have said what you did or I should not have told you —I handed the keys to the sergeant who applied them to the prosecutor s

linen cloth value 8s 11 yards of printed-cotton value 6s 1 gown value 5s 1 shirt value 5s and 4 pairs of stockings value 4s his goods GEORGE OLIVER My father Charles Oliver lives in Clare-hall Cottage Waterloo-place Stepney On the 7th of April I went to his house about ten minutes after eight o clock in the evening—I saw a light through the window—my father was in the country at that time—I found the front door ajar and an iron scraper placed against it inside—I entered the passage and two men came out of the room into the passage—they were both strangers—I asked them what was up—they said It is all right and Bob is backwards —I said I did not think it was all right nor should they go out till I had seen whether it was right or not—with that they struggled with me and one of them said D—his eyes knock him down —they forced their way out and got into the garden in front of the house—I attempted to take hold of them again and they got through the gate pulled the gate to and struck me in the breast with it—they got into the street—I followed them into the field—one of them the prisoner fell down and then I secured him—they had both been running—I was not out of sight of them at any time—it was nearly dark—it was twilight—I am sure I had them in sight the whole time from the time of their getting to the gate till the man fell—I was close to them when they got out of the gate—I hit against the gate with my breast which closed it—I had to open it again—I was about eight yards from them when I got out and they rather gained ground—when the man fell they were about as far from me as to the corner of this Court—they ran fifty or sixty yards before I caught them—I lost the other man entirely—the prisoner and I struggled in the field—I called Stop thief all the way I ran and when I secured him I called out for the police—a man named Bunn came up and helped me to hold him and then Sergeant Shaw came up—we took the prisoner back to the house—I found every thing out of place and in confusion drawers broken open and boxes too and the things all in an uproar all brought out into the middle of the room—the prisoner was taken to the station-house by a policeman who Shaw gave him to—I afterwards went with Sergeant Parker with a lantern which we got from the Maid and Magpie public-house to the place where we had seized the prisoner and found there four pairs of stockings and a crow-bar—I saw the prisoner in the passage from the light which was in the room and know him by his face Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did he not say he was not the person who had been in the house A He did—the garden-gate opens into Wellington-place—there are houses between the cottage and the Maid and Magpie field—it was about ten minutes after eight o clock—the road is very hilly which caused him to fall—he just had time to get on his legs as I came up—he made a blow at me and struck me in my breast as I was about to lay hold of him—it did not hurt me—the candle was on the corner of the drawers at the back part of the room opposite the passage door—the room is about ten feet square—I could not see in what direction Bunn came—he was before the Magistrate and was examined once I believe but was not bound over—I believe there was some little difference between his statement and mine ANN OLIVER I am the wife of Charles Oliver who is the son of Charles Oliver who occupied Clare-hall Cottage He was out of town at the time this happened—I and my husband had the care of the cottage while he was away and lived in it—we always lived there—he was only gone on a job in the country and was expected back again—on the evening in question I left the house about half-past six o clock with my husband and two cousins—I left the doors locked and the shutters shot outside—we came home between one and two o clock in the morning—we found my brother-in-law in the house and the door broken open—I saw marks on the door next morning as if it had been forced by a crow-bar—the drawers had been broken open and the things turned out Cross-examined Q Have you any recollection of locking the door yourself A Yes I did it myself—I am quite certain—I pushed against it alter taking the key out—we have lived in the house three years—it is my father s house—my husband is a church-bell hanger WILLIAM SHAW I am a police-sergeant About a quarter after eight o clock on the evening in question I heard a cry of Police —I went up and saw the prisoner struggling with Oliver—the prisoner fell—I went up and secured him—Bunn was up before me endeavouring to assist the prosecutor when I got up but when I first saw them there were only two of them—I saw Bunn go up and assist before I got up—I collared the prisoner and asked Oliver what was the matter—he said he had found this man and another in the house—the prisoner said I never was near the house you knocked me down and almost cut my finger off —I took him back to the house—I found the front-door had been forced—there were marks on it and the bolt of the lock was forced out of the box—the room was in confusion and the property turned out of the drawers—a candle was burning on the drawers in the bed-room—the house is all on the ground-floor—I found this handkerchief stretched out on the bed and this linen in it Cross-examined Q Did you observe whether his finger was bleeding A Yes it was HENRY JOHN PARKER I am a policeman On the night in question I went to the Maid and Magpie public-house with Oliver and got a light—we went to the field and found four pairs of stockings and a crow-bar—Oliver pointed out the place to me and the things wore found on the exact spot where he pointed out as having scuffled with the prisoner—I examined the bed-room door that night and found a pressure apparently done by some instrument just the width of this crow-bar—it was between the door and the jam—I put the crow-bar to it and afterwards measured it and consider decidedly that it corresponded—the drawers were inclosed with two folding-doors and there were similar marks on those doors—I saw some marks on the outer door but they appeared more forced by the body than an instrument—at the station-house 1 observed that three pairs of the stockings had blood on them and remembering at the time the prisoner was brought in that his finger was cut I asked him how that happened— he said That is all I have got for my trouble I heard the cry of Stop thief I ran after the man and had just laid hold of the tail of his coat when he turned round and cut my finger by some means I don t know how —I observed it was rather a haggled cut CHARLES OLIVER re-examined I had a knife in my pocket but did not take it out ANN OLIVER re-examined I know this linen—this shirt is my father-in-law s—it is marked—it was in the middle drawer when I went out—I left nothing on the bed when I went out—I know this dress to be my mother-in-law s—that was also in the middle drawer and this piece of print covered over it—I was in the room when she put them into the drawer—these stockings belong to her—they are new—there were six pairs tied in a piece of blue paper—they were all gone from the house on this night—my mother-in-law showed them to me just before she went away—they have no mark on them—I should not swear to them but this pair I can swear to which have been washed and they were tied up in the same parcel—I believe them to be the same Cross-examined Q How long ago did you see her put them into the paper A The week she left—we have only found four pairs out of the six Thomas Green weaver Bonner s-lane Bethnal-green

went out—Hardiman walked into the tap-room again in five minutes looked round and walked out again—I went to bed about one o clock—I locked the till and put the key into my pocket—there was a considerable quantity of copper money in it some of which I can positively swear to—about seven in the morning my boy alarmed me—I went down stairs and found the tap-room window open—it is a double window—when I went to bed the sashes of that window were down—I found the till wide open and a desk which had not been locked was ransacked and a particular shilling of the reign of George the Second taken out—our premises are next to Mr Keller s whose yard comes near our window—any person in his premises could get over the fence and open the window—we lost from 15s to 1l in copper money and not

down into the soil—MRS Ward had described some money she could swear to—she saw it at the station—these three penny-pieces were under Hardiman s head—I found a piece of candle in Dalton s bed-room and a small chisel Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Was not the money under the mattress A Yes Davis lifted up the mattress to find it RICHARD DAVIS I am a policeman I accompanied Thomas to the house and

the station when the prisoners were brought in and searched—the policeman s evidence is correct as to all I know Cross-examined Q I believe you took the boots or shoes belonging to both prisoners A I

to Dalton s boot Dalton My boots were as clean as possible there was nothing sticking to them MARIA WARD re-examined I can swear to this penny-piece by its being knocked four-square—I had observed it five minutes before I closed the till—we lost some cheroots and I believe these to be the same—I can swear to these two other penny-pieces—this one had been in the till above a week—a great deal of money has not been found Dalton Q Did not the policeman tell you the marks on the penny-pieces before you saw them A No I told him before I saw them and I said if they would give me a paper I would draw what was on it—I said I could not tell on which side of a penny-piece one letter was Dalton s Defence I know nothing at all about the robbery—the money belongs to me I received it for my work on

away from the window when we took the prisoners—I suppose they ran away—the boys did not go the window at all—there are two courts and one was placed at the end of each court—I saw the boys after the window was broken lower down than the shop—I do not know whether they walked or ran away—I did not see them afterwards—my brother constable saw them as well as me JAMES HERSEY police-constable S 144 I

window near Gray s Inn-passage—Elliott stood nearest to me I cannot say which was next—I was standing in a line with them—not all the time—I was standing on the opposite side when they took the handkerchiefs out—Elliott was nearest to me then they kept turning backwards and forwards from the window—I followed Elliott up Gray s Inn-passage along Red Lion-street down Princes-street into

value 10s his goods MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM MATTOCK At the time this took place I lived at No 59 High-street Lambeth—I do not know the parish—I occupied the shop parlour and back room first-floor—I held it of Mr Hancock the land-lord who did not live in the house—I occupied the room entirely myself in which the watch and spoon were—I afterwards let the room to the prisoner s cousin—the prisoner himself did not occupy that room at all—I let him the top-room—I remember his cousin going into Somersetshire—I saw the spoon and watch last on the 18th of July—I think it was about a month before the fire happened—the outside of the watch was metal and the in-side silver—the spoon was silver—I kept it in a box in the parlour where I slept—I kept the box locked—I went out on Sunday the 18th of July my box appeared in the state in which I had seen it before—I left it unlocked—when I went out I locked the door of my room and put the key in my pocket and took it with me—I am confident of that—I came home about ten o clock—I did not see the prisoner to my recollection till next evening—he then asked me how I came to go out and leave the door unlocked—I said I did not for I went and took the key from my room up stairs and locked it myself—the fire took place on the 9th of August—I did not ascertain my loss till about the 11th of August—on looking into my box I missed the watch and spoon—the box was locked then but I think I left it unlocked on 18th of July because I took the key out on the Monday morning and locked it—I have since seen the spoon in the possession of Mr Cole and the watch in possession of a person in Black-friars-road—I believe the name is Aldous—the spoon and watch were what I kept in my box—I never authorized the prisoner to pawn them or to go into my room or take them—these now produced are them Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Do you owe him any thing A No MARIA MARIAN SICKEL My mother occupied the attics in No 59 High-street Lambeth in July and August last—I remember Mr Cordwent going into the country—about three weeks before the fire on a Sunday afternoon between three and four o clock I was sitting at the back-door—I am sure it was on a Sunday—the prisoner came down stairs and unlocked the back-parlour door with a key—I saw the key in his hand before he went to the door—he went in shut the door and took the key inside—I went up stairs and saw no more of it—after the fire on being questioned I told Mr Mattock what I had seen Cross-examined Q When did you first tell any thing about seeing him go into Mr Mattock s room A On the Monday after he went in—I told Mr Mattock what I have said now and I told him the same after the fire had happened—that was after the prisoner had been taken up—I do not know how long he was in the room—I did not wait till he came out MR CLARKSON Q Do you mean you saw Mr Mattock on the Monday the next day after he went in A Yes and I told him what I had seen WILLIAM MATTOCK re-examined Q Do you recollect the circumstance the girl is speaking to A I believe she did say so—the prisoner told me I had left my door unlocked—I asked the little girl if she did not see the door open—she said she did not—I am confident it was not open—I was rather in doubt whether it was or not—she said she did not see the door opened—she saw the baker go to the door and she believed the baker went in—I believed I left my door closed and what she told me strengthened my belief EDWARD REECE BLACKMORE I am a baker—I worked with the prisoner about thirteen months ago at Walham-green—I received a letter from the prisoner from Union-hall the day he was committed for trial in consequence of which I went to him at Newgate—he there handed to me three pawnbroker s duplicates two of which were for a watch and a spoon—he said he had won the watch and spoon by playing at cards—he asked me if I could befriend him by lending him the money to procure a counsel—I said I could not as I had fitted my brother out to go to sea—he then said he had got three duplicates—I was to carry him a shirt and in the shirt he returned to me he was to give me the three duplicates—I gave the same tickets to the policeman Cross-examined Q What are you A Foreman to Mr Giles a baker—I was fellow-workman with the prisoner about fifteen months ago—he sent to me and asked me to visit him as a friend as he had got none in London—what he said to me was not in confidence—I was to make something to procure him a counsel MR CLARKSON Q You went to the pawnbroker to pay the interest on one of the articles A Yes on the watch and I then exchanged the ticket and had a renewed one instead—it was that renewed one which I gave to the policeman PHILIP FROUD police-sergeant L 6 I received three duplicates from Blackmore—two are for the property in question and one for a waistcoat—the duplicate for the watch appears to be a renewed one after the interest was paid WILLIAM TITUS ALDOUS I am a pawnbroker—I produce a watch pledged with me on the 20th of July last by the prisoner—this renewed duplicate for the watch is the one that was given at our house on the payment of interest Cross-examined Q How much interest was paid A Seven farthings COURT Q Are you sure the prisoner pawned it A I have not the least doubt of it—I never saw him before—he gave the name of Joseph Spiller SAMUEL HEZEKIAH COLE I produce the spoon which I took in pledge on the 20th of July in the name of Spratt—I have no recollection of the prisoner—one of the duplicates produced by the officer is the one I gave EDWARD REECE BLACKMORE re-examined I never visited the prisoner where he was lodging—I knew he was living in Lambeth—he gave me nothing besides the duplicates GUILTY Aged 21 — Transported

front of the house faces Neckinger-road—it is surrounded by a brick wall with iron palisades—Horney-lane runs up from Neckinger-road and the wall goes round that lane and surrounds the warehouse with the iron fence and from the iron fence it is all wall—there is a doorway which is kept locked—it is one continued fence inclosing the house and the shed within it—this plan produced is a correct description of it—at five in the evening I secured the warehouse where the horse-hair was and took the key home with me as usual—I came to the premises at eight next morning and found the house-hair-warehouse door broken open—the lock had been wrenched—I went in and found three bags of horse-hair gone—it had beep in bacon wrapper bags which contained about 3 1/2 cwt of foreign horse-hair worth 11d per lb —it was un manufactured and is never sold in that state—it was worth about 18l —it was safe when I left at night—I have since seen some horse-hair in the possession of Hornsby—I believe it to be masters —there were some buffalo tails among our hair and there are some among this produced Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q You do not know the value yourself A Not exactly Dudgeon Q Have not other people got buffalo tails among their hair A Yes but it is rare to find it—it is not always so Dudgeon I went there to ask for work it is usual to ask for the man before you speak to the master he said they must not be seen RICHARD RHODES I am a hair-sorter in the prosecutors employ—I sorted a quantity of hard foreign hair a short time before Christmas at my masters —there was hair and dirt and buffalo tails among it—it was these bagged up in five bags called bacon wrappers and put in a corner of the workshop of which the foreman keeps the keys—it was in an un manufactured state not saleable for the purposes of trade—it was in a raw state I saw the bag some time after Christmas master would not sell it in the state it was in—it had two or three processes to go through—I have seen some hair in the possession of Hornsby and really believe it is the hair taken from masters —it is the same in every description—it is foreign unmanufactured hair and has buffalo tails in it—there is about 3 1/2 cwt of it some black and some grey and sorted which was the case with what we lost—I think it is my masters hair Cross-examined Q You do not think it is the same hair do you A I really think it is—we sell hair when manufactured—it is not in the state in which it is imported—it is imported in bales and I had sorted it—we have a considerable quantity in the warehouse—some bales bare buffalo tails but sometimes you may sort a bale and not find a pound of them EDWARD ALLBURY I am in the prosecutors service On the Saturday morning I found the horse-hair shed broke open—I went round to the different marine-store shops in the neighbourhood to give information about it—about eleven o clock I went to the premises of the prisoner Platt in the Mint in the Borough and took a sample of the hair with me—I saw Platt and showed him a sample of the hair—he looked at it—I asked him if he had bought anything of that sort that morning—he said No —I told him we had lost upwards of 3cwt of hair from our manufactory that morning—he said he had not bought any—I asked him if anybody should call with any to stop them and give them into custody—he said he would—I said if he went to Mr Tosswell he would satisfy him for his trouble—he promised to do so—I said nothing about the bacon wrappers Cross-examined Q What quantity of hair did you take with you A A handful—the witness Collins was there when I went into the shop-l had no policeman with me—it might be a little earlier than eleven o clock—I did not make a memorandum of what passed MR CLARKSON Q Have you a full recollection of what he said to you at the time A Yes JOHN TURFREY I am a marine-store dealer and live in Suffolk-street Borough On Saturday morning the 22nd of January between nine and ten o clock I think I am sure it was before ten the prisoner platt came to my premises—he brought me a sample of horse-hair—I thought it was English horse-hair—he asked if I was a purchaser of hair—I asked him the price of it—he said 8d a lb was what he asked for it—I said I would give him 7 1/2 d if it was equal to the sample—I do not recollect his saying how much there was—he agreed to take 7 1/2 d —he wanted me to come down to his house to look at it—I said I could not I was busy—he asked if I would send for it—I said I could not I was busy and should not be able to take it in for an hour or two—we agreed on the price and he went away—he came back about eleven or half-past with a donkey and cart and a little boy—there was three bags of hair in the cart—it was brought out of the cart and weighed—it weighed 3cwt 2qrs 21bs —we tared the bags—I paid him 12l 6s 10 1/2 d —I sold it the same day at 8 1/2 d to Mr Gallivan—Platt took the bags away with him—they were bacon wrappers—I have my book in which the transaction is entered Cross-examined Q You are a dealer in marine-stores A Yes in the wholesale way—Platt is a marine-store dealer—I have been in business four or five years—I have known Platt five or six years—I never knew anything amiss of him—it might be half-past ten when he came—I considered I paid a fair price—I sold it again the same day at 1d a lb profit—Platt came by himself in the first instance and wished me to go to his house to see it—it might be half-past ten o clock when he came MR CLARKSON Q Before you purchased this hair of Platt had anybody called at your shop to give you notice of its being stolen A No—I have bought goods of Platt but never sold him anything—I have bought landrugs of him—I do not live so much as a quarter of a mile from him—I live in Suffolk-street—the Mint is nearly two miles or a mile and a half from the prosecutors JOHN COLLINS I have been in Platt s service and was so on Saturday morning the 22nd of January—between half-past eight and nine that morning I saw a sample of raw hair on the counter—it was before nine—Platt asked me if I could tell the value of it—I said I considered it was worth from 9d to 9 1/2 d a lb —he went out with the sample and was gone about ten minutes—after he returned and I think before nine o clock Dudgeon came—master and him had some conversation—Dudgeon then went away and came back about a quarter or half-past nine with a truck containing three bags in bacon wrappers—they were full—Poarch was at the door with the truck and the bags—he took away the truck and the bags were shot out on the pavement and taken into the shop and weighed—I saw Dudgeon receive 7l odd—he gave a bill and receipt for it in the name of Bailey—the last bag remained in the scale—it all remained in the shop until it was moved into a donkey cart and left master s premises in the donkey cart not later than ten o clock at the very outside—master went with it—Dudgeon came again about quarter of an hour after the donkey cart had gone away—the bags were weighed they weighed nearly 14lbs and then they were taken away into the back parlour—the hair was not shot at master s it went away in the bags in the donkey cart but master returned with the empty bags and then they were put in the bark parlour—they were weighed with the hair in the first instance—when Dudgeon came there was a dispute between him and Platt about the value of the bags and it was decided that they should be cut up—I and Platt cut them up—they were of less value after being cut up—they were afterwards taken away by platt and another who I do not know—I do not know where they went to—they were cut into five or six parts Cross-examined Q What became of the bags you do not know A No—I have been three or four days at work for Platt the last time but have done work for him on and off for five or six years—I worked for him in the shop—I never heard anything against his character or his dealings—the person who had the things called himself Bailey—Dudgeon signed the bill in the name of Bailey—I had never seen him before—I do not know whether he was a stranger to master—I stood in the shop about two yards distance—things might have passed which I did not see—I saw the money in Dudgeon s hands OWEN GALLIVAN My father is a marine-store dealer in Collier s-rents White-street Borough—on Saturday the 22nd of January I bought of Mr Turfrey 3cwt 2qrs 5lbs of horse hair—I did not know it was foreign hair when I purchased it—it was afterwards delivered to Hornsby the officer—it was in a raw state—we generally sell our hair to a hair merchant in Lant-street—I gave 8 1/2 d a lb for it—I should sell it at 10d Cross-examined Q You thought it was English A Yes—I bough it between two and three o clock in the afternoon—it was in bags—it was delivered to Hornsby in the same state JOHN HORRABIN I am in Turfrey s employ—I have examined two bags and a quantity of horse hair in the possession of the police it is the same as I packed and delivered to Gallivan on Saturday the 22nd of January—it is my own packing and delivering COURT Q Is it usual to buy the bag with the hair A No we generally buy the hair and take the weight of the bag off and return the bag—it was packed in master s bags GEORGE HORNSBY I am an inspector of the N division of police On Thursday the 27th of January I went to the premises of Turfrey and made inquiry of him about the horse hair—he gave me information and I went to Gallivan s premises and there found the hair in question which I have in my possession—I produce part of it there was 3cwt 2qrs 5lbs of it bags and all—after I got it the prisoner Platt was brought to the station—I told him the charge—he said he had bought a little horse hair—I asked him what he called a little—he said there might be 2cwt or 3cwt—Le did not know who he bought it of—he had given a fair price for it and sent for a paper Cross-examined Q Did not he tell you he had purchased 3cwt A No—he did not go with me to the station I sent a man for him—directly I told him the charge he said he had bought some and afterwards sent for the bill ROBERT TOSWILL I am in partnership with my brother John and have other partners—this is foreign hair—our premises are in the parish of Bermondsey—the hair was black and grey and had buffalo tails in it-we bought about 3 1/2 cwt —I had not seen the hair myself Dudgeon s Defence I went over to Fresh Wharf where I work about seven o clock on returning from breakfast I met a man and asked him what he had there and where he was going he said he was going to the Jev Cohen in the Dover-road at the corner of Union-street he said You know Cohen is shut up being Saturday and asked me if I knew where he could sell it I said no he asked me to show him a marine-store shop he stopped at Platt s and asked me to sell it Poarch was not with the man I met he said he wanted a porter the man showed a sample first and then required me to go and sell it for him JOHN COLLINS re-examined There were several more standing in the road but I only saw Dudgeon and Poarch with the truck Richard Taylor flock-maker 11 Redcross-street

came in it was when he went down at half-past nine that he called my attention to the clock—he stopped in my room and had supper—he called my attention to the clock at half-past six and I told him the time—I cannot say particularly how he called my attention to it nor say his reason—I told him it was just half-past six—the clock goes fourteen hours—I wind it up every night—it is a Dutch clock with brass wheels and a pendulum—my son had been at home till about one in the day then went out till half-past six—the evening had quite set in—I sat on the left-hand side of the fire and could see the clock where I sit—my wife sat on the right-hand—she could see the clock—he did not particularly call my attention to the clock at half-past nine because I told him the time myself when he was going

makes you recollect the time A Because my little girl who is ten years old was going to Shoreditch church that evening—the went at half-past six and came in about half-past eight—we supped about nine as near as I can guess—my husband son and two children the girl who had been to church and a son thirteen years old sat down to supper with me—the little boy was not at home all the evening—I think he came in about eight—he had gone out about half-past six or seven—the prisoner was there when he went out—we all five sat down to supper together—I cannot remember what meat we had for supper I think it was boiled beef fresh—we had a pot of beer with the supper which I fetched from below myself—I noticed it was half-past six because my little girl said Mother it is time to go to church —I looked at the clock and said Yes church has begun —the clock is almost by the door—the bed is in the back part of the room—the clock is right at the side of the bed against the doorway not over the bed—my husband winds it up—my son said it was half-past six and time for my daughter to go to church—no farther observation was made about the clock that evening that I recollect—I looked at the clock at

they came down again—the others joined them on the other side of the shop and crossed and came back again to the shop—I observed them all conversing together—Cooper crossed over after he took the

out—this was the night before the robbery—the pane bad been put in about two days having been starred only a few days before—the putty was fresh—I have seen the prisoners several times before at the

times before Cooper was brought in by the officer with piece✗ of handkerchiefs worth 17s —it has our mark on it—I bad put it in the window about a quarter to seven—I was with the officer when he took

Middlesex-street Wilcox lodges with me—I think I have a perfect knowledge of seeing the prisoner on the 24th of August—he inquired for Mr Wilcox between two and three o clock and Mr Wilcox went down outside to him—I have kept that house two years JOHN PAYNE I live in Whitecross-street St Luke s—I am a boot and shoemaker—I have lived there nearly seven yean and in the same street more than thirty years I knew the prisoner when he was ten years of age—I have not known him exactly from that time till now—I have bought goods of him in the lane—I remember the day he was taken—I bad seen him that day I think between two and three o clock in Petticoat-lane—I purchased two pairs of boots and two pairs of shoes of him—that is a very little way from the White Horse—after that I went with him to the Gun and Star—I had a penny-worth of rum and he had half-a-pint of beer—that is the mode of doing business there— You must give so much and stand a drop —when I came out of the Gun and Star I left the prisoner going towards Cutler-street—I afterwards heard he was in custody COURT Q How long have you dealt in Petticoat-lane A More than thirty years—I never bought any thing of the prisoner only in Petticoat-lane—I recollect him perfectly well that day—I cannot exactly tell how he wag dressed—he had some macintoshes on his arm—I cannot say what colour they were as they are not in my way of business—I was not to look at what coat he had on—he was alone when I purchased the boots and shoes of him—I did not see any other man with him—I am well aware it was near three o clock as I had an appointment—I immediately went home to Whitecross-street—I had to go to Paddington to meet a person at half-past four and I thought I should be too late to meet the other party CHARLES SMITH I live at No 206 Shoreditch opposite the Eastern Aunties Railway I have known the prisoner about two years—I remember the day on which he was taken into custody—I heard of it after I got home at night—I had seen him that day in Houndsditch about ten minutes before three o clock—we drank together—I got home before four and I dare say it was about three-quarters of an hour before I got home that I had seen him MART CORDWELL I am a widow and keep a pawnbroker s shop in Exmouth-street On the 24th of August some cloth was brought to me by a tall stout man—he was alone in the box and there were two persons outside—there was one piece of black cloth one of brown and one a mixture pepper-and-salt I believe—there was about ten yards of it the person who brought it wanted 3l 10s for it—I offered 3l on it—the prisoner was not one of the persons who came—I attended at Hatton-garden and said he was not the man—the person who brought the cloth was much like Nesbit the officer at Hat ton-garden JOSEPH LEWIS I am a police-inspector It would take a man from fifteen to twenty minutes to go from Red Lion-street to Petticoat-lane in a cab—the distance is better than a mile it may be a mile and a half PHILIP YARNOLD re-examined The person was dressed in black as the prisoner is now—I could not tell whether it was a frock coat or a lapelled coat because the cloth was under the arm—I have not the least doubt about it being the prisoner Alfred Smith a beer-seller in Turnmill-street James Philpot a hat manufacturer in Cutler-street William Lee a cooper in Goulston-street and Hart a fishmonger in

with the housekeeper—I received a communication from the housekeeper—I returned on Monday the 17th and found the prisoner in custody—I examined the dining-room and cupboard—they were broken open and

Sheridan s apartments—the window was open and one square of glass was broken—it was whole the day before—I found the parlour door had been broken open and the plate cupboard also—it appeared to have been opened by some instrument about a quarter of an inch wide—in the footmarks there were six nails in the ball of the man s foot—I counted the nails in the impression on the ground—I did not compare any shoe—all I did was to count the nails in the right shoe of Henry Grover—I saw the nails there on the first examination but at the second examination they were out—to the best of my belief it was the same shoe Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You did not take the shoe off and compare A No it was not my duty to do it—the robbery was supposed to take place on Friday evening the 14th and it was found out about nine o clock on the Saturday morning—the footmarks were not on a walk it was a kind of recess between the path and the windows JAMES GIMBERT police-constable A 64 I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Hampton-court on the 15th of October—I received information and went to the palace to examine Mrs Sheridan s apartments—I found the dining-room door broken open and some footmarks close under the casement window—I examined them very minutely—they were side ways—it was a very remarkable tread and there was the impression of six hob nails in the centre of the tread of the right foot—I think it would be impossible for anybody to enter that window without the assistance of another person—the window is about seven feet high—there appeared to be footmarks of a man and a woman—I saw Henry Grover at Mr Goatley s at Hampton-wick between six and seven o clock on Saturday evening the 15th—I requested him to hold up his feet—I saw the right foot and the shoe exactly corresponded with the marks under the window—I afterwards saw his shoe and the nails were then drawn—I went to Forster s residence in High-street Peckham between seven and eight o clock on Sunday evening—I saw Forster there in the custody of the sergeant—she immediately went to a child s cot took a bundle from under the pillow and handed it over to us—it contained a desert-spoon and several articles of wearing apparel On the Monday morning I went to Mr Hawgood a pawnbroker in the Old Kent-road and discovered this plate Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q How long have you been in the police A Six years—there were footmarks of only one woman—we measured several and they were all of one size—I saw the impression of both footmarks of one man—when I went to Forster s room Churchill had her in custody—I had gone along the road with Churchill and her some distance from what was said to her she must have known what he was going for and when she went home she produced this bundle tied up—it was a bundle anybody could carry in their hands and leave there—I opened it myself—I am sure of that—here is the desert—spoon and some stockings and wearing apparel which I found in it—I did not know what it contained before—I handed it over to Churchill after I had examined it LADY DUFFERIN These stockings are mine—they were left with Mrs Sheridan and were lost on that occasion SAMUEL HAWGOOD I am a pawnbroker and live in Surrey-place Old Kent-road On Saturday afternoon 15th of October Martha Grover and Goatley brought these articles of plate to my residence—this silver teapot was pawned by Martha Grover herself between ten and twelve o clock in the morning of the same day—I lent 5l on it COURT Q Are you in the habit of receiving a mass of propety of this kind from such persons A Grover represented herself as the confidential servant of a lady named Dufferin of Brixton-hill who was pushed for money to make up a bill—I lent 23l on it—it is worth about 25l —I lent 5s 3d an ounce—persons who have plate seldom come themselves—she said the lady would want some more money and she should not come till Monday but she came in the afternoon with Goatley and introduced her as the daughter of the lady Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Grover throughout put forwards Goatley did she not A Yes Grover took the leading part but referred to Goatley as Mrs Dufferin s daughter

out of the kitchen window—the dining-room door had been forced and a bedroom door—I perceived the footmarks of one man and more than one female—I apprehended Henry Grover—I took his shoes off at his lodgings and found one of them corresponded with the marks under the window—I saw the shoe again on the Monday—it was then in the same state—I examined it again on the Thursday and the nails were then drawn out—I asked where he had been on the morning I took him if he had been in Bushey-park—he denied it—I asked what time he got up he said about half-past seven o clock but he had not been out nor near Bushey-park—I asked him if he had been to Kingston—he said he had not been over the bridge that day—I found him at Hampton-wick on the Middlesex side of the river—I went to Forster s residence on Sunday evening—I found her at Peckham-rye and she showed me to her lodging—I went with her—she produced a bundle from under a child s cot tied up in a shawl—I found in it a desert-spoon five pieces of plated silver and several articles of wearing apparel—she said her daughter Martha Grover and Mary Ann Goatley were at the Red Cow public-house in High-street Peckham that she went there to her daughter and there Mary Ann Goatley gave a bundle to her and the property was what she had received from Goatley—she said there was a quantity of plate produced to her in the parlour of the Red Cow that Goatley had left her place her mistress owed her between 2l and 3l of her wages and she was determined to have something to make good the loss—Gimbert was riding in the cart at the time—I produce a box I found in Forster s lodgings Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Did you take Forster to one corner of the cart A She was riding between two of us—I do not know whether the other constable was paying attention to it or not—I told Forster I came for a bundle which her daughter had left—she said she had no bundle which her daughter had left she had one Goatley had left— I heard from Grover s own confession on Saturday night that she had been up to see her mother —the bundle was untied when Forster produced it—I mean to swear that one knot was untied—I will not swear it was quite untied—it was partially open to the best of my knowledge—it was not untied by the officer—it was not opened by him that I saw—we both went in together Henry Grover When my shoe was pulled off you all looked at it and none of you could swear to it—you brought a bit of straw down and my shoe was an inch and a half longer Witness There was not a quarter of an inch difference—it was late at night when we saw the

my husband lock the streetdoor after fastening up all inside—he took the key with him—we came home together at nine in the evening—I went to the corner house to fetch my baby while he went to get a light—when I got into the house I found that my drawers and two boxes were broken open—I missed my silk dress a coat of my husband s a pair of gloves 27s in money and other things worth altogether 6l odd—the street-door was I suppose opened with a skeletonkey—the other doors were as we had left them except the back-door—we had left that bolted and found it unbolted—it was not broken—we saw some of our things the same night at the station HENRY CHARLES SANDFORD DODD I went out with my wife and returned with her—I went first into the house—the street-door was only single-locked—I had left it double-locked—there was no appearance of violence about the house—my wife has given a correct account—I missed what she has stated—my house is in the parish of St Leonard Shoreditch WILLIAM EDWARD BALL police-constable N 386 On Thursday evening January 26th about seven o clock I and Kemp were passing down the Hackney-road 400 or 500 yards from the prosecutor s house and observed the three prisoners turning out of Thomas-street Hackney-road—we suspected them and went up and searched them—we laid hold of Murphy first—he had at that time a Taglioni coat on—I only searched the skirts of the coat and finding Beacon was going on a-head faster than the rest apparently with something in his pocket I left Murphy went after Beacon laid hold of him and felt in his pockets and in the tail of his coat I found nine skeletonkeys and one latch-key—I said What are these —he said Oh I don t know —at this time Kemp had Hall in custody and was shoving him into a hatter s shop—I did the same with Beacon—they both commenced a violent resistance—after a little time we secured Beacon and Hall—as we were taking them to the station in Wellington-street I perceived Beacon unbuttoning the flap of his trowsers and directly after a parcel fell out—I saw it picked up by a sergeant who was following us—about ten o clock the prosecutrix came to the station to give information of the robbery—the prisoners were brought out and she identified the property which I now produce likewise the coat which was on Beacon s back—I found a pair of gloves and a black lead pencil in the pocket of it—I went to the prosecutor s house next morning and tried the skeleton-keys—I found one key locked and unlocked the streetdoor—Murphy made his escape that evening—he ran across the road when I let him go to follow Beacon Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Was the street in which you saw them much frequented A Yes—they were all in conversation together—I heard them all three talking together—they were talking a sort of gibberish I supposed they suspected us Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q Did you not search the pockets of Murphy s Taglioni A Very slightly—there was nothing in them COURT Q What do you mean by gibberish A To imitate some foreign language—it was not English—I did not understand it GEORGE KEMP police-constable N 82 I was with Ball on Thursday night and saw the three prisoners together coming out of Thomas-street Hackney-road—they were all talking together some sort of French I should say—it was gabbering I could not understand what it was—I found a screwdriver on Hall and a tortoiseshell box with initials on it—the screw-driver corresponds with the marks on the drawer in the prosecutor s house which was broken open and likewise with the box which I produce which was broken open—it shows more so in the drawer than it does there—I found a quantity of lucifer matches on Hall—Murphy made his escape that night—he ran away—I saw him the next night in custody—I am positive he is the same man I saw with the other two prisoners the night before—he wore a brown Taglioni coat with a velvet collar—as Beacon was going to the station he unbuttoned his trowsers and dropped a parcel from it which was picked up by Sergeant Milhouse—I took Hall into custody and took him into a hatter s shop—he there knocked my head through a square of glass kicked me violently on the head knocked me down in the street and kicked me about my body tore two coats nearly from my body and my hat was totally destroyed Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q Who took Murphy into custody first A Ball—he merely went up and smoothed him down the front of his clothes—I knew what he did that for—he stood there while he did that—we then followed Beacon and Hall and Murphy ran away up the other side of the road SAMUEL MILHOUSE police-sergeant N 4 I saw Beacon being led to the station by the constables—I did not see him do any thing with his trowsers but I saw him drop a bundle—I was about a yard behind him—I saw that the bundle came from him—I picked it up directly—it was this silk dress wrapped up in this towel JAMES TIDMARSH police-constable M 51 I took Murphy into custody about seven o clock on the evening of the 27th—I found nothing on him—I know that he and the other two prisoners are acquainted—I have known them these three years—I took him at the Falcon in the

the morning of the robbery—I know this pencil these gloves and this ring—this other ring I know nothing of—I saw this little box the day before locked up in the work-box with the rest of the little trinkets HENRY HART police-constable M 80 On the evening of the robbery I was on duty in High-street Southwark and saw Murphy alone coming from the direction of London-bridge about half-past eight o clock—I suppose it is three or four miles from the prosecutor s house—he was coming from that direction to where he resides in the Borough—he was then dressed in a brown Taglioni coat with a black hat as he generally appear in—I was in company with Tidmarsh the following day when he took him into custody—he was then changed in dress and was among a number of others in a public-house—I have known him perfectly well for a year or two W E BALL re-examined The prisoners were just turning out of Thomas-street into the Hackney-road coming in a direction from the prosecutor s house and going towards

the van Cross-examined Q What time was it A Past seven o clock it was dark—Donoghue did nothing at all—I did not speak to him he was very tipsy COURT Q Whose van was it A My father s—there was no

things in the van—I sent my wife to tell Penn—he came to the van—I tied the things up and carried them home for him into a place behind the bar THOMAS CHURCH I am a policeman At ten minutes after nine o clock from information I received I went to Penn s house—I saw the prisoner Taylor with two women standing near the back-door which leads into the yard—Taylor immediately went into the yard leaving the women—I followed him and found him in the water-closet—I could not see him he being a sweep and it being dark—I called out I want you —he came out and I took him to the station—I returned immediately afterwards to Penn s house searched the water-closet which I took him from and found this knife thrown down the water-closet and on the blade of it are several pieces of putty—I can almost swear it was putty from the state it was then in—I afterwards went up stairs into the room and fitted the knife to some marks in the middle pane of a window and the point of the knife corresponded exactly with the marks where the pane had been broken by which means the robbery had been effected—the putty had been scraped out on one side and at the bottom there was two marks on the edge of the frame—I saw marks of soot on the bed-curtains and on the mattress—I do not know any of the prisoners—Taylor was black like a sweep—I saw marks of white on his knees shoulders and arms at the station

twelve feet high—there is a urinal in the yard a water-closet door and a wall above then the leads so that it is like a pair of stairs—he could get on the leads very easily and on that lead the window opens Cross-examined Q Whose feet would you swear made the marks A I cannot swear—they appeared to be marks of toes—I do not swear they were—I almost swear the marks on the knife were marks of putty—it is a common sort of a knife—I fitted it in the wood where the putty was scraped away and it corresponded—no doubt any common knife would produce the same mark AMBROSE MUGFORD I am a policeman

the door with it myself at a quarter to twelve by putting the wood in the handle of the key—my wife had gone up two or three times to listen if the children were asleep but did not have the key—if they had cried she would have heard them and asked me for the key Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q I believe you had not seen Hatton except on the two occasions A No—they had been on two or three other occasions but I did not much notice them before the Saturday—I took up one Harrison—he was let out on bail for a week—there was not sufficient evidence to prove he was there on the Saturday before—he was not there on Sunday—he proved he was dining somewhere—Mr Goodyear was not taken up—he walked to the station with the policeman but he was not detained Q How came he to go there A The policeman took Harrison and Hatton—I said Where is the tall person as I did not know where Hatton was—Goodyear bounced out of the room and said Do you mean me —I said Yes that is one —he was about Hatton s size and I took him for Hatton in the dark—when he got to the station I said he was not the man—he was not charged—it was his own fault going—Hatton had gone on before but I did not know it—it was half-past eleven at night Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q When did you first notice the men at your house to identify them A On the Saturday night before the robbery—three of them were then sitting together—Knight was behind the door on the night before the robbery—the bed-room is on the second floor—there is a small yard to the house which joins a timber-yard which has a very high will—none of the men at that yard use my house but I do not know as I never give credit—the eldest child goes to bed at eight o clock and we do not hear anything of it till twelve—I do not know what Knight and I talked about—he spoke to me first and said it was a bad evening—I was busy at the bar serving out-door customers who brought their jugs—my wife was with me taking the money while I drew the beer Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q You have had an action brought against you by Goodyear A No by Harrison for false imprisonment—he was in my house on Saturday evening not on Sunday—I gave him into custody on suspicion of being concerned—I am quite certain he was not there on Sunday and that I did not lose my money on Saturday—I am quite certain I never said Hatton came down stairs first—the box was about four inches wide and six inches long—I am quite certain only four persons passed up that night—nobody went even to the yard—I was very slack of customers Cross-examined by MR WILDE Q Do you carry on business wholly on your own account A Yes nobody has any interest in it—I will swear the prisoners were all there on the Saturday from nine o clock to twelve—I was very busy then—the room was full—it was after Knight came in and was talking to us on Sunday that my wife was receiving money for the jug trade—I saw them all up stairs in the room on Saturday week night when I gave change for a 10l note and on Saturday the 13th Hill said to me Keep the door open for air —I do not know that I ever gave credit to the prisoners but I have seen them on two or three occasions—they and nobody else passed my bar on the night of the robbery MR E PLATT Q Harrison was one of the six in the room A Yet on the Saturday—it was on Saturday night that Thompson was behind the door—I did not see him mixing with the others that night—he was there about an hour and a half conversing with Bacon FREDERICK BACON I am a chocolate maker and live in Isabella-street Lambeth I was at the prosecutor s house on Saturday night the 13th of May from a few minutes before ten o clock till a few minutes to eleven—I had some ale up stairs—I saw all the prisoners up stairs—Williams and Hill were talking together—Thompson was sitting behind the door and Hatton at the corner nearest the window—you could not see a person behind the door as you came in when the door was open—I was talking with Thompson and Williams—I left a few minutes to eleven—Thompson went first and I followed him leaving the others in the room with four or five more—I have known Thompson between ten and eleven years and am certain of him Cross-examined by MR PATHS Q Had you seen Hatton before A Not to my knowledge Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q It was the first time you had seen Williams A Yes or Hill JOHN MARKS I am warehouseman to Mr Green of Princes-street Lambeth—I know Knight—on Saturday night the 13th I saw him standing at Vitty s bar about half-past nine o clock and on Wednesday the 24th at two o clock I saw him pass in Princes-street where I am employed he Williams and Hill passed together—they crossed over towards our gate—I am quite confident of them Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Did you know them before A Only Thompson—I was going to work on Wednesday or I should have followed them JOHN COYTE I am a shoemaker and live in Brad-street Cornwall-road Lambeth—I was at Vitty s house on Sunday the 14th from a quarter to ten o clock till a quarter to eleven—I stood in front of the bar and saw four men come from behind the bar it was about the middle of the time I was there a little after half-past ten—they followed each other quickly about hall a minute elapsed between each—I am perfectly satisfied Hatton and Hill are two of the men—while there I did not see anybody besides those four go in or come out—I must have seen if they had Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What was you about A Standing there drinking ale the whole hour and talking—I do not think I sat down at all Cross-examined by MR WILDE Q Had you been drinking before you went there A No I never saw either of the prisoners before—I stood directly facing the wicket which they came through at the end of the bar—it is not a large room—it was light enough to read small print where I stood JOSEPH ALSTON I am a chairmaker and live in James-street I was at Vitty s house on Sunday evening the 14th from half-past eight o clock till about a quarter to ten and saw Knight standing at the bar smoking a cigar—I am certain of him JAMES BURGESS I am barman at the Black Horse Tottenham-court-road—I have seen Hill and Hatton together in company at our house—the last time may be three or four months ago—I am certain of it JOHN CARPENTER police-constable R 84 I know Hill Williams and Thompson—I have seen them together at various public houses on several occasions talking together—I knew Thompson as Joe knight and Williams as Bob Stone Cross-examined by MR HOBBY Q Who called Williams Stone in your hearing A Thompson did and I knew him by that name HENRY LUPTON police-constable L 7 On the 27th of May I apprehended Hill Williams and Thompson in company with each other—I first saw them in Blackfriars-road—they turned into Wellington-street—I took hold of Williams and said I want you —he said What for —I said On suspicion of robbing Mr Vitty s beer-shop in the New Cut —he said You know I do not do any thing in that way —I searched him at the station and found 9s 8d two common keys and a knife on him—I found at his lodging a skeleton key and picklock key between his bed and mattress—I also found about thirty duplicates Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Where are his lodgings A In John-street Holland-street—he did not give me that address WILLIAM GUEST police-constable L 62 I apprehended Thompson on the 27th of May—I was with Lupton—on the way to the station I observed him put his hand into his pocket several times—he was very uneasy and in a minute or two I saw him take from his pocket a small parcel tied up in a rag and drop it down by his side—I took it up and found it contained this portable crow-bar which is in two parts—it screws together—I have compared the end of the crow-bar with four marks on the drawers in Mr Vitty s bedroom—they exactly corresponded with it and fitted exactly I am quite certain Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Was Brook with you at the time Yes—there was no difference of opinion between us as to the impressions JAMES BROOK police-constable L 118 I took Hatton at the John o Groat Grey-street Webber-street Blackfriars on Monday the 15th of May—I found on him four sovereigns and 11s 6d —Vitty charged him with robbing him in my presence—he said he knew nothing of it—I assisted in taking the other prisoners—I found two picklock keys on Thompsons besides what Lupton has produced and four other keys—I fitted one of the keys to Vitty s drawer—it opened it Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was not Hatton allowed by the Magistrate to go away on his own recognizance A Yes for a week I think—he appeared and was bailed again—I think he attended six times before he was committed Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Have you been to Thompson s lodgings A No he refused to give his address—I saw the crow-bar fitted to the drawers—my impression was always that it was done with that instrument—I never expressed a doubt of it—I have been in the police above thirteen years—I never said the marks on the drawer were very slight and not made by this— looking at his deposition —I did not state before the Magistrate about the crow-bar fitting the drawer—this statement was read over to me and I signed it as correct Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Were not two boys brought to the station when Thompson and Hill were there A Yes—I did not ask them if they were the men who were at the prosecutor s nor hear them asked—the boys walked on in company with Guest—I did not hear anything said to them Witnesses for the Defence ELIZA GOODWIN I am servant to Mr Benton who keeps the John o Groat Grey-street Blackfriars-road Last Sunday evening five weeks 14th May I saw Hatton at the house—he came to the best of my recollection about half-past six o clock—I remember seeing him from that time up to just before ten MR BALLANTINE Q Are you the only servant A Except the man servant—I wait in the tap-room and on Sundays in the parlour—the man was out—I had seen Hatton before—not very often—I never aaw any of the other prisoners—I was summoned to Union Hall about this about three weeks ago but was not wanted—I did not know what I was wanted about till I was told at Union Hall—Hatton came when he was out on bail and asked if I remembered his being there on the Sunday of the robbery—I was called down to him at the bar—I knew nothing of the robbery till I saw him taken out of our parlour—I knew the Sunday the robbery was done from the people in the tap-room—mistress said it was for the robbery that was done and he was taken up for it and I could say I saw him that night—no one told me what night it was—he came to ask me this a week after the Sunday—I believe he was taken the next night and came to me the Saturday following—mistress was present when he asked me—I said I recollected it—he said That is all I want —he did not say a word about the time—he asked if I recollected seeing him on the Sunday—he did not say at what time—I first learned the time at Union Hall—I never heard the time was between eight and ten o clock—I did not know what time I was to come to speak to—I have said before now that I saw him from half-past six till a little before ten o clock—Hatton did not tell me the times I was to speak to nor did anybody —I never heard the time at which I was to account for his presence till to-day—I will swear that—I noticed him from half-past six till ten—I was not in the room all the time but every time the bell rung—I do not know how many times I was in and out—there were a good many people there—I should say more than twenty persons went into the room between half-past six and ten o clock—they were drinking and smoking—I observed Hatton on every occasino that I went in—I never spoke to him—he called forporter when he first went in—not directly it might have been a quarter of an hour after—I took it him in and he paid for it—he did not pay for anything else that evening—I noticed the regular customers in the room besides him—I know some of their names—those that use the house regularly—I do not know whether they knew Hatton—I believe one or two of them are here—there was one young man there named King—I am not aware that he is a friend of Hatton s—he was in the tap-room before six o clock—I do not know what time he left because I was not in the room after just before ten o clock—I saw him in the room then—a young man named Reeves was also there—I cannot tell at what time he came—I saw him till I left off waiting in the tap-room which was just before ten—I do not know where the prosecutor s house is MR PAYNE Q Could he have been away from your house two hours without your knowing it A No—I knew before I came here at what time I saw him and came to tell if I was asked what time he came and went away HENRY REEVES I am a carpenter and live at No 35 Broadwall near Blackfriars-road On Sunday the 14th of May I was at the John o Groat public-house from a few minutes before half-past six o clock till half-past eleven—I know Hatton—I saw him there that night—he sat right facing me in the same box—I am no friend or acquaintance of his—I knew him by sight—he came in a very few minutes after me and went away about half-past ten—he could not have been absent during that time for five minutes without my knowing it MR BALLANTINE Q When did you know you were to give evidence A I was subpœnaed—the lawyer or solicitor came to me last Wednesday—that was not the first I knew about it—I was there at the time the prisoner was taken—I was at Union Hall—I did not know I had to give evidence on the trial till I was subpœnaed—I have seen Hatton twenty times and Conversed with him—I do not know any of the other prisoners—I never saw any of them in company with Hatton—I have been in the habit of seeing Hatton at the John o Groat—not mostly on a Sunday any day of the week the same as most working people—I have seen him two or three times on a Sunday—I have seen him twice since while he has been out on his own bail the week after I attended at Union Hall—he came to the John o Groat—my work sometimes lays there—I was there accidentally I did not expect to see him—I had very little conversation with him then—nothing at all about this matter—I knew at that time that he had been charged with committing this offence at this particular time—it did not occur to me to tell him that I could quite clear him of it—I never told him so—he never told me any thing about it—his wife spoke to me the morning after he was taken—I did not talk to him about it when I saw him afterwards and he never said a word to me about it—I know Goodwin—I never talked to her about it—that I swear—she was in and out the room all that evening as the general waiter was out—she probably served the prisoner with something once or twice or perhaps more—once I will swear to—I will not swear to twice—it was once or twice—once that was before nine o clock—he left my box at nine and sat in the next box till half-past ten—a gentleman there asked him to drink and I asked him to drink—he was reading the newspaper—it might have been for half an hour—that was perhaps about eight o clock—he had a pint of porter to drink about eight—I saw him drink out of a quart pot a person sitting in the next box handed it over—I am not a friend of Hatton s—I have never been in any trouble—I was once charged with drunkenness and for an assault five years ago—I will swear I have not been charged with any offence within these six weeks—nor ever under examination for anything—that I swear JOHN KING I am in the

of May I went to the John o Groat about half-past five or six o clock and staid there till nearly twelve—Hatton came in between six and seven and went away between ten and eleven—he could not have been away for an hour or two without my knowing it MR BALLANTINE Q You saw him all the time A Not all the time because I went out once myself for about two minutes with that exception I saw him all the time—I do not know who he was drinking with—he was sitting in company—he sat in the same box as Reeve—I was sitting on the opposite side of the room—I saw him served with beer—I cannot say whether it was once or twice—the servant came in and served him in the course of the evening—she was in and out of the room occasionally during the evening as often as the bell rang—I do not remember her coming in except when the bell rang—I was served with a subpoena last Tuesday week—I think by Mrs Hatton—I did not know her before they came and asked me the question—I only knew her by seeing her at the public-house with Mr Hatton—she was called Mrs Hatton—she was the first person that mentioned that I should be wanted—I saw Hatton on the Monday after the robbery as he was going down on his bail in Windmill-street New-cut—Reeves brother was with me—he is now working for Mr Seal I believe—I have known him for some time—I know the witness Reeve well—we met Hatton accidentally—he was alone—he

out of possession in fact I use the house generally every Sunday—I have not been talking to Goodwin about this matter—I have not spoken to her on the subject since it occurred nor with Reeve—I might

business—I have not talked it over with Mrs Hatton—I have never told any one what I could prove—I told the attorney for the defence what I knew last Tuesday week when he served me with a subpoena—I told him what I knew with respect to seeing Hatton—I do not know how he came to come to me—I did not go to Union Hall—I did not know the time the robbery was supposed to have been committed—I know it was supposed to have been committed last Sunday five weeks—I know that by my being away in possession once or twice and knowing the time I was away—when I was at the John o Groat on the following Monday night Hatton was taken into custody there—Mr Benton the landlord told me next day that the robbery was committed on the Sunday previous—he did not say a word about the time of day at which it was committed MR PAYNE Q Was what Mr Benton told you that the robbery had been committed on the Sunday before the Monday that Hatton was taken into custody A Yes that caused me to remember that upon that Sunday evening I was with him ELLEN ANDERSON The prisoner Knight lodged with me—I know this key—I gave it to him to let himself in WILLIAM GOULSTON I am foreman to Mr Priest of Water-street

conversation with him about it—he subpœnaed me—I did not tell him what I could prove—he did not ask me but merely served me with a subpoena and went away Q When had you first any notion of what you were to speak to A I think it was one day last week—I did not hear when the robbery was committed nor do I know now—I never inquired Q How do you know it was this particular Sunday A I asked Mr Williams at least he went by the name of Young at my house and the other lodgers down to have a pipe—I never knew him by any other name—that was not the only Sunday that I asked him down to have a pipe-Harvey who rents my second floor and his wife were there—Harvey is still lodging with me—he is not here—he is a printer—I supposed Young to be a copper-plate engraver—he was seldom home later than ten at night—here is Young s account-book in which is entered Cash 14th May 2s 6d which I lent him—I put that down on the 14th on the evening when we were having the pipe—here is 6d entered to him on the 26th of May—that was lent his wife when they were in distress through this MR HORRY Q The first intimation you received of this was from Mrs Young A It was—I never knew him by the name of

shoemaker s shop in Great Portland-street Mary-le-bone—Ann Maria Jordan is the housekeeper—my shop-door has a lock and a latch-key which I keep—on the night of the 16th of Aug I went to bed about half-past twelve my shop-door was fastened and secure and my boots and shoes safe in the shop—I have a boy named Holmes in my service he came next morning about seven o clock and I gave him the key in consequence of some information he gave me I came down and found the shop nearly stripped—I missed about 28 pairs of boots and 2 pairs of shoes to the value of about 40l ALFRED HOLMES I am in the prosecutor s service it is my duty to open the shop in the morning about half-past seven o clock—on the morning of the 17th of Aug I went there about half-past seven my master threw me out the key of the shop-door but I found it wide open and missed things—I told my master who came down—I had opened the street-door with a latch-key before I got in to see the shop Cross-examined by MR WILDE Q Is

speak to Mr Davis—he then took the bag off his shoulder put it down took out some boots and laid them on the table—several people came to look at them—Mr Davis called me and said George you look at these boots and see if they will suit —I looked at them and offered 6l 9s for them—the prisoner would not take it at first but put them into his bag and was going away—he returned and let me have them at 6l 9s —Mr Davis and I bought them—there were nine pairs of Wellington boots two pairs of low boots and one pair of shoes—Mr Davis I believe asked him how he came by them—he said he had taken them of a gentleman for a bad debt—he had three or four other pairs which he took away with him—those were old boots newly fronted—he wanted too much money for them—I had never seen him before—these are the boots I purchased I sold them again that same afternoon to Mr Streather for 7l COURT Q Is this a common trade purchasing things at coffee-shops A This is a coffee-shop where most Jew clothes-men

not know a person named Flight or Williams—the prisoner did not say that he had the boots from another person who said he got them from a gentleman for a debt—I am sure of that—I understood him that he had taken them himself of a gentleman for a bad debt—he was not addressing himself particularly to me—6l 9s was a fair price for them to sell again—the best of them would not sell for above 16s or 18s a pair—we sold them altogether to Mr Streather—I was taken up for selling them—I was not charged with the house-breaking MR PAYNE Q When you were taken did you say at once who the person was that sold them to you A Yes and where I got them and in consequence of that the prisoner was taken—I could not find him at first GEORGE DAVIS I keep this coffee-shop in Castle-street Leicester-square On Thursday the 17th of August about three o clock the prisoner came into my shop with a bag over his shoulder—he produced these boots which were purchased and afterwards sold to Mr Streather Cross-examined Q Did you know the prisoner A I have seen him in my shop occasionally—clothesmen come there every day all day long—there were eight or nine persons there at this time JOSEPH STREATHER I keep a new and second-hand boot and shoe ware-house in Broad-street Bloomsbury On the 17th of August about six o clock in the evening I bought eleven pairs of boots and one pair of shoes of Harris and Davis for 7l —I gave the same to Allen the policeman JOHN JAMES ALLEN police-constable E 159 I received these eleven pairs of boots and one pair of shoes of Mr Streather on the 18th of August—I was not present at the prisoner s examination before the Magistrate—I know Mr Greenwood s handwriting— looking at the deposition —these signatures are his Cross-examined Q When have you seen him write A Frequently in the police-court as I have been in the body of the court and Mr Greenwood on the bench and I have received certificates and notice papers with his writing MR PAYNE Q Have you had papers put before Mr Greenwood for his signature A Frequently—I have seen him writing on those papers which have been handed to me immediately with his signature to them JOHN TALBOT policeman I took the prisoner in charge in the coffeeshop in Castle-street Leicester-square—I was present when he was examined before the Magistrate—I did not hear him make a statement—these are the depositions relating to the case—there were three examinations—the prisoner is the person who was then charged—the depositions were signed in court—I signed mine before the Magistrate—this is my signature—it was all done before the Magistrate in open courr—after I gave my evidence on the 24th of August the prisoner said something but I did not hear it—what he said was taken down by the clerk—I heard it read over to him—I did not hear him asked to sign it—he did not object to it— read — On first examination the prisoner says If it is left for a day or two I have no doubt I could produce the man I have bought them of I bought them publicly and sold them publicly I sold the boots there were thirteen pairs they were chiefly old boots whether they were the boots that are missing I cannot say On the 24th of August the prisoner says I can bring proof that I was in bed long before the hour this gentleman Mr Tate names and was not up till half-past eight o clock the next morning Taken before me J B Greenwood On the last occasion the prisoner says nothing MR WILDE called GEORGE HUNT I am a tailor On Thursday the 17th of August between two and three o clock I was at Mr Ferguson s public-house—the prisoner and two or three others were there—I do not know persons named Hubbard or Flight by name—I know one Williams—on the 17th of August between two and three o clock I saw Williams who has a hare-lip and another person come into Mr Ferguson s with a dark canvass bag with some boots—Williams addressed the prisoner and said How do you do I have got some goods here that will just suit you you can get a crown by them —the prisoner said Let me look at them —they were in conversation about five minutes—I did not hear what they said—the prisoner then took the bag out of the room in which we were sitting—he returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes COURT Q Did he buy it or what A He produced some money I suppose between five and six sovereigns and some silver I do not know to what amount and gave it to Williams and the other—they put out of the bag about ten or a dozen pairs of boots and a couple of pairs of shoes or so I do not know exactly—I did not take particular notice—there was a great deal of wangling between them about the price I suppose—I cannot exactly remember what was said—they must have come to some agreement before the prisoner took them out but it was in so low a tone I could not comprehend what was said-—they could not agree at first—it was a wrangling set-out altogether apparently about the price—I did not hear any price named—the prisoner examined the boots and the wrangling began after that—I did not listen to it as I was not an interested party—they were at high words—I do not mean exactly high words but shaking their heads and differing apparently about the price—they whispered to themselves and wrangled between them selves—I might have heard what they said at the moment but do not recollect it now—I looked at the boots but did not take them into my hand—they were black boots the Wellingtons were—the others were Oxonians as far as I could see with lace-up fronts—I cannot say whether the fronts and legs were the same leather—I did not notice them—I only noticed that they were boots—I have never seen Williams since—I do not know his companice—I am a tailor and live at No 4 Mercer-streer Long-acre MR PAYNE Q When did they first find you out A On the Monday following—I was in the public-house and heard that this man was in custody—I heard the parties who frequent the public-house in Cranbourne-court talking about it—I did not go before the Magistrate—knowing Mr Small wood the prisoner s attorney and being in the habit of going to bis office I went to him—I told him what I had seen respecting those boots—this was on the Monday following the Thursday—I did not know when the prisoner went before the Magistrate—I heard that the prisoner had been taken up on suspicion of this burglary—Mr Small wood did not ask me to go and speak for him MR WILDE Q Do you know Davis s eoffee-house A I do net I know there is a coffee-house near Mr Ferguson s—the prisoner is no friend of mine—I have made two pairs of trowsers and a waistcoat for him and he has paid me honourably—I have known him about six months—I became acquainted with him through visiting that public-house—I do not know that the police are looking for Williams COURT Q Is Ferguson here A No—there were two or three persons in the house that afternoon but they were perfect strangers to me except Williams the other person I had seen in the house at times there is a servant who sometimes serves in the bar and Mr and Mrs Ferguson—none of them are here—I believe the prisoner resides there—I generally go there from half-past eight till ten to smoke my pipe—I generally see him there—I cannot say whether the landlord or landlady were there on the afternoon is question the servant was there—they had no refreshment while they were bargaining about the boots not any of them except the prisoner who had a glass of ale this occurred in the parlour which is at the back of the bar—the landlord and landlady could not see who was there they would know the prisoner was there of course—they did not come into the room—you have to pass the bar to get to the parlour—I do not know whether Williams was a common customer there—he has come in there occasionally—I have seen him there several times GEORGE DAVIS re-examined My coffee-house is nearly opposite Ferguson s public-house GUILTY Aged 31 — Transported for Ten Years

ELIZABETH LEGGATT I am the wife of James Leggatt of No 12 Lamb s-buildings Bunhill-row in the parish of St Luke—we use the front parlour as a bed-room On Tuesday evening the 13th of Feb between five and six o clock I went into the parlour and observed the window was down and fastened—every thing in the room was safe—I had seen my little girl close the window-shutters about half-past six—she did not fasten them—I and my family then went into the back parlour—at half-past seven I heard a knock at the street-door—my family had gone to bed—the door between the back and front parlours was shut—I went to the door and a neighbour made a communication to me—I went into the front parlour and missed the articles stated In the indictment worth about 8l —the bed was taken—the bedstead was close to the window Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q What was the neighbour s name A Small but not the witness of that name JOHN SMALL I live next door to the prosecutor—I have known the prisoners eighteen months or two years On the 13th of Feb about twenty minutes after seven o clock from that to half-past I was returning home and saw them coming down Lamb s-buildings together towards Leggatt s house—I had occasion to stop for a minute and after that went towards my own house and thought I saw one of their legs in the prosecutor s front parlour window but was not certain—I stopped and watched for a short time and then saw the window-shutters come open and one of their heads put out—in a short time the prisoner Law came from down Lamb s-passage towards Leggatt s house—I had not seen him come from the house—he was coming up to the door—I made a shuffling noise with my feet and he went away again—he was about ten yards from the house—I did not see that he had anything with him—I lost sight of him for about a minute—he went down to the bottom of Lamb s-passage—I heard Jack or something called from Leggatt s house—Law then came back and went towards the house—I made a shuffle with my feet—he was then two or three yards from the door and he walked off in a direction from Mr Leggatt s house towards me—he passed me—I am certain it was Law— I had not seen him in the house—when I first saw them walking together they were five or six yards from the house and in conversation with one another—I then went in doors and sent my sister for a policeman —I went to my own door and after being there four or five minutes I saw Dunn come out of the prosecutor s door with a looking-glass on his shoulder—I followed him—he did not see me following him—he walked some way and then ran—I tried to catch hold of his arm and he threw the glass on me—it fell on the ground and was broken—I took the frame back to Leggatt s and gave a description of the prisoners Cross-examined Q How long do you think all this occupied A Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—in that time I saw both the prisoners twice—I saw Dunn go in and come out—I thought he went in—I saw Dunn come out about five minutes after I saw them coming down the buildings together—I went to my sister about a minute after I thought I saw Dunn go into the house—my sister had not come back when I followed Dunn—it was rather a foggy night I believe—I saw Law come from the house not out of it—I was about four yards off—he passed me—the court is three or four yards wide—I shuffled with my feet that the other should not come out as I wanted the policeman to come first—I had been watching the prisoners for six or seven minutes then as I thought all was not right—I did not make an alarm as it might be Mr Leggatt pulling his shutters to—I saw them closed and soon after open again and a head came out—the house is six or seven yards from the top of the buildings—it is not a thoroughfare—when Dunn passed me with the glass his head was inside the wall—the glass being on his shoulder I could not see his face—he got into Bunhill-row—I walked behind him—he began to run after I tried to stop him—I did not try to stop him before because I did not see his face—I will swear he threw the looking-glass down on me—it was not thirteen yards from me nor a yard—one Noon was taken on this charge and dismissed—I never said I thought he was one of them—I did not see Law after Dunn came out—I saw him go away before ANN GROVE I am single and live at No 3 Lamb s-buildings On Saturday evening the 10th of Feb about five o clock I was cleaning Mrs Leggatt s front parlour—the windowwas open—I saw the prisoner Dunn and Mike Noon come and stand opposite to the window they seemed to look all over the room to see if there was anybody in it—they did not see me till I came up to the window—they then made some remark and ran away Cross-examined Q This occupied a very short time A Yes ROBERT COLE police-constable G 19 I produce the looking-glass frame—I apprehended Law at a public-house at twelve o clock on the night of the robbery—he gave his address at Chequer-alley—I there found Dunn and he gave his address there—they were living together there JOHN SMALL re-examined This is the frame Cross-examined Q On your oath did you not say at the station if it was not Dunn it was one very like him for he had a dark coat on A I said nothing of the sort MR HORRY called the following witnesses ROBERT PAGE I live in Greville-street Hatton-garden I recollect a glass being broken at Lamb s-buildings—I do not know what night it was nor whether it was thrown down—it might have come from the housetop—I am subpoenaed here but do not know what for WILLIAM STOKES I am a shoemaker and live at No 4 Chequer-alley On Tuesday evening the 13th of Feb I was up stairs at work and saw Dunn up in my room about tea time five o clock and in about half an hour he said he would go down to his work—he came up to my room again about Half-past nine and stopped till half-past ten—he had been in the house all the time from five o clock for I heard him at work—he was singing all the evening—he generally sings when at work and 1 heard him hammering—I do not say he kept up the singing the whole four hours MR BALLANTINE Q Can you give us one of the songs A I did not notice particularly—he is a shoemaker—I did not notice whether it was all one tune—I do not say he sung for four hours—I have not stated my evidence to anybody before this nor stated to anybody what I could prove—the father asked me to come here—I told him what I could prove—I made no statement to an attorney—I do not know a man named Spicer who sits in Court—I have had no communication with him—Dunn generally sung when at work—I cannot speak to Friday or Saturday—I made the observation about seven o clock Dunn has not finished his work yet —he had said he should go down and finish his two pairs—I do not know that he was singing then—I heard

and singing in the evening but particularly between six and seven o clock—I am certain from a quarter to seven to a quarter to eight MR BALLANTINE Q I dare say you know the time the looking-glass was dropped A No—about seven o clock a young man sitting in the room with me said What a particular voice that young man has got he roars like a bull —I remember his singing The Ivy Green between six and seven—the prisoner s wife came to me next day and told me of this circumstance—she lives there with him—she did not tell me at what time he was charged with committing the robbery—I do not know when I

till half-past ten—I do not know the name of the place—it is about three minutes walk from Lamb s-buildings—he was in my company all that time MR BALLANTINE Q DO you mean to swear that A I was up there at work and he went away with me at half-past ten Q Was he in your company from half-past fire till half-past ten A He was down stairs I was up stairs—I went down three or four times and saw him

ill - - DUNN I am the prisoner s father On Tuesday night the 13th of Feb he was at work at No 4 Chequer-alley—he does not live with me—I know he was at work there because he brought three pairs of

they were brought to me about eight o clock by his wife MR BALLANTINE Have you been in Court while all the witnesses have been examined A Not all—I did not pay attention to Brooks s evidence—there was

t18440408-1267  1267 GEORGE RITTMAN was indicted for breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Elizabeth Todd on the 1st of March at Willesden and stealing therein 3 candlesticks value 3s 3 spoons 12s 1 clock 5s and 1 comb 2d her goods and that he had been before convicted of felony MR DOANE conducted the Prosecution ELIZABETH TODD I am a widow and live at Kensall-green—the prisoner is my grandson—he lost his mother when he was about three years old—I and my late husband brought him up—he married about two years ago and ceased to live with me—he was brought up as a carpenter and I allowed him to occupy an outhouse of mine as a workshop—before this matter happened he used sometimes to come pretty often and sometimes stay away a long while—a young man and his sister lodged in my front parlour and my servant occupied the kitchen—on the night of 29th of Feb I retired to bed with Snell about nine o clock or a little before—I locked the kitchendoor and took the key up stairs—I had used a comb before I went to bed and put it into a table-drawer in the kitchen—there were three silver teaspoons three brass candlesticks a Dutch clock and a comb safe when I went to bed—next morning Snell came up stairs—I went down stairs and found the place had been broken open and these things gone—there is a shutter to the kitchen window—it was made for a room up stairs and the prisoner had altered it for the kitchen window four or five years back—he would know the shutter very well—I informed the police—two or three days after the prisoner came about eight in the evening—I was very much alarmed and told him I felt very ill—I asked him to go for a doctor—I said that for the purpose of sending for a policeman—after he was gone I sent for a policeman who came directly—the prisoner returned—he was searched and this comb found—I have had it five or six years—it is the one I had safe on the night of 29th of Feb —I said The man who took this comb most have robbed me now I know who it was robbed me —I also saw a chisel taken out of the prisoner s pocket Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q How old are you A Seventy-two—the prisoner married before my husband s death—I did not very much ap-prove of his marriage—when I first gave him in charge I said it was for annoy-ing me but they said that was not sufficient and after the comb was produced I said it was for robbery—my servant locked the kitchen door about nine o clock and the window was fastened—there were no drawers in the kitchen—there were tables there and chairs and a sofa—there were some knives and forks no table spoons—I had seven silver tea spoons in all but the others were up stairs in the bed-room—I only kept three down stairs—we always count the tea spoons—we counted them after tea that night—we had three then—only I and the servant took tea—the brass candlesticks and the clock were on the mantel-piece—I wished the prisoner to go for a doctor with the intention of his going away—he asked me if I would let him stop there all night—I said no I could not I was too much frightened—I said nothing about the robbery to any one before the comb was produced—Mrs Henry is my niece—she has come down lately for a day or two and staid a night—I have no other relative besides her and the prisoner that see me often—I am sure I used this comb about nine o clock that night—Snell mostly combed my hair MR DOANE Q Is the prisoner an illegitimate relation of yours A Yes—Mrs Henry appeared before the Magistrate on another concern—I gave information to the police about this robbery the third day after it occurred—I had not said a word about it to the prisoner till the comb was found—I did not mention it to the police before the prisoner came to stop that night SARAH SNELL I am Mrs Todd s servant I have lived with her three months—on the night of the 29th of Feb I was with her in the kitchen—we went to bed between eight and nine o clock—I locked the door and gave the key to Mrs Todd—it was my usual custom—I slept with Mrs Todd that night and got the key from her—when I came down to the kitchen about seven o clock I unlocked the door—there was some resistance from something placed against it inside—I found the shutter down and the window open—when I went to bed it was fastened as it usually was—the window was down the shutter shut and bolted with two little brass bolts—I did not observe any marks of violence except that the two pieces of wood that supported the upper sash were taken out from outside—we had three tea spoons in use down stairs—we had used two of them the night before and the third was in the mustard-pot in the cupboard—a Dutch clock was gone in the morning before I had combed Mrs Todd s hair not the night before—I saw it safe in the morning and put it into the table drawer with the brush—I found the comb was gone—the prisoner had not been there that day—there had been no one there that day that I know of that would have taken the comb—we had no visitors Cross-examined Q You had a lodger A Yes—I believe Mrs Todd used the comb that evening—I cannot say whether I saw her or not—I was in the kitchen with her some time before getting coals and things but she might do many things that I did not see—the window looks into the front garden—I saw the two pieces of wood standing outside the window—I only saw that two nails had been drawn—I cannot pretend to say this is the comb—it was like it—I cannot say that I know it but my eyes are bad THOMAS HICKMAN police-constable G 204 On the evening of the 7th of March I was sent for to Mrs Todd s—it is in the parish of Willesden—I found the prisoner there—I asked Mrs Todd what she charged him with—she said coming to her house annoying her and putting her in bodily fear—I searched the prisoner—I saw him put his hands behind him—I proceeded with the search and found this comb and chisel and two or three other things on him—the comb was placed on the table—Mrs Todd said It is my comb and now I know who robbed me —that was all she said—she gave him into custody—the chisel I found on him was bent—I afterwards examined the window and the shutter—I had these two pieces of wood that supported the sash given to me by Mrs Snell—I found they fitted into the frame of the window to support the upper sash—I think Mrs Snell gave me the pieces of wood on the Saturday afternoon and then I observed some marks on them—I had kept the chisel in my possession from the time I found it—upon comparing the chisel with the marks on the wood I found they corresponded—I also found some marks on the window sash which corresponds with this chisel—I should think it would require some force to press these supporters out and such as would bend this chisel—it is bent as if it had been used for something of the kind—I noticed that when the shutter was up the bolt was a little above the lower sash—if a person was endeavouring to effect an entrance from outside I should think the lower sash must be lowered in order to get at the bolts—they being above the lower sash it would not be necessary to open the lower sash to do it—I should not think that the bolts are visible from the outside—shortly after the comb and chisel were found the prisoner asked me to give him the comb—Mrs Todd had made the remark that it was hers before that—I said to the prisoner You hear what Mrs Todd charges you with —he said I merely came to ask her —Mrs Todd interrupted him by saying he used her cruelly—I asked where he lived—he said somewhere in Long-acre—I asked where—he said he should not tell me Cross-examined Q Did you get this piece of wood after you had the chisel A Yes—I showed these marks on the piece of wood to Snell when she gave it me—these shutters fitted very close—there might have been a space of a sixteenth of an inch but very trifling COURT Q When was your attention first called to the marks on the pieces of wood A I think on the Saturday morning I discovered the marks—I did not apply the chisel till the afternoon—the chisel was then at the station—I made one fresh mark at the police office—this is it SARAH SNELL re-examined From the time I found these pieces of wood till I gave them

before convicted of felony MESSRS WILKINS and ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution JAMES DEARLOVE I am sixty-two years old—I am not in business and live in Bartholomew-terrace Essex-street Bethnalgreen—the prisoner is my nephew On Sunday the 21st of April I had in a cupboard in my bed-room up stairs a tin cash-box about fourteen inches long about eight wide and about six deep—I saw it last about eleven o clock on Sunday morning before I went to church—the prisoner knew I kept it there for when I was ill he has been to see me several times when I have taken it out and put it in that place—when I went to church I left my wife at home to cook the dinner—I returned about five or ten minutes after one o clock—after dinner I sat reading the Bible for an hour or an hour and a half—I remained in the house till about a quarter to five—the cash-box contained two 100l Bank of England notes one 50l three 10l two 5l eight sovereigns 10s in silver some bonds and shares a 100l bill of exchange another for 50l another for 47l and another for 25l of which the prisoner was the acceptor also some leases and deeds—we keep no servant and no one lives in the house but myself and wife—the prisoner and his wife came to visit us that afternoon about five o clock I believe—I was out at the time and found them there when I I came in—I did not exactly expect him—after tea my wife and the prisoner s wife went to chapel about half-past six o clock—there are two keys to my front door one kept by my wife and one by myself—hers hung on the screw of the knocker and mine on the bolt of the door—after our wives had gone to chapel we sat and talked a little and he pressed me very much to go out—I wished not to go but by his wish I went—it was about twenty minutes to seven o clock—we went across by Robinson s house up Coventry-street up Pitt-street into Bethnal-green-road and to the Sun brewery beer-shop—we stayed there about half an hour and then left together—I turned to go the same way down Pitt-street and be wished not because it was a drearisome road and he wished to go round the Cambridge road—I directly consented—we went along Bethnalgreen-road and a little way down the Kingsland-road—I walk very slow—I was very lame that day—just after we got round the Salmon and Ball by the trees he said he wanted to go into Cleveland-street—I said Well you go if you wish and he put his hands to his coat and set off at full run-away from me—I continued my way home very gently because the crowd was very great in the Cambridge-road—when I got home I did not find any one in—the front door was locked—I unlocked it with my key and went in—it took me from ten to twelve minutes to walk from the trees where I parted with the prisoner to my house—I did not make any discovery at first when I got in—when I had been in a short time the prisoner came to the window stood before it and looked in at me—I went and let him in—he said What are they not come from chapel —I said No they will not come from chapel till half-past eight o clock —he then sat down—but previous to that almost immediately on coming in I had been out in the yard and saw that the back door was open which I had left fastened by two bolts inside—I was in the yard when he came and looked in at the window—opposite the back door there is a little sort of wicket-gate that was fastened with a bolt and a string—I found that string broken and the bolt was open—when he came in he seemed very trembling and very queer but I did not take any notice—we sat for ten minutes or so and he said he wished they would come home from chapel—I said They will not come home just yet you will take some supper before you go —he said No I should wish to go home as soon as they come in —I said Well take this pot and go to the corner and get some ale or porter you will take some refreshment before you go —he went and I was out in the yard putting the shutters to when he came back—he knocked I said I am coming directly —he gave a very loud knock as if he was going to knock the door down—I was very cross with him and said What did you knock so very loud for —he seemed very much agitated and said he wished they would come home—he constantly repeated that—my wife and his came home I think about twenty-five minutes after eight—as soon as they came in he jumped up and said We will be off home —my wife said Do take something before you go home you have got far to go —he said O no we don t want anything at all —my wife said his wife should have something if he did not and she said she would take a little—she took a glass of half-and-half or something and a crust of bread and cheese and he took some himself but he got up twice during the time he was so agitated and wishing to go—my wife pressed him and said Do have it comfortably —they went soon afterwards I think from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour after they returned from chapel—I went up to bed about a quarter to ten—directly I got up into my bed-room I noticed that the cupboard was burst open and my cash-box gone—I had been into my bed-room about six that afternoon and the cupboard door was then shut and safe—in the course of the evening I saw the prisoner with his hand on two spoons a silver one and a plated salt-spoon on the mantelpiece—I looked at him and he said Here are two spoons here —I said How came they there my mistress never put them on the mantel-piece I am sure and he took his hand off them—previous to our going out he said he had taken some goods home to Osborne-street to the amount of 12l 12s and the gentleman was gone into the country that was to have written the check and had forgotten it and he was very short of 5l —I said If you are very short of 5l I will lend you 5l for to-morrow if it is sure —he said No no don t go up stairs for it if I want it I will come for it to-morrow —he never came Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q That was before you went out for a walk together and whilst your property was all safe A It was just before we went out—he was apprehended next evening at his own house MARTHA DEARLOVE I am the prosecutor s wife—the prisoner and his wife came at five o clock on the Sunday afternoon while my husband was out—I invited them to stay tea and asked his wife to go to chapel—I do not know where my key was when I came back—I never looked for it—it was there when I went out—I perfectly recollect that—I found it in its proper place after the robbery was discovered—if it had been taken it had been put back again—the prisoner and his wife remained about half an hour after we came from chapel—I pressed them to stay—he said no he could eat no supper it was time to go—he appeared in a great hurry to go—by pressing them hard to stay he remained—I said his wife should stay and take supper—I noticed that he appeared very different in his manner from what he did when I left home—he looked very pale and never looked at me at the time he was addressing me and his wife remarked to him What are you staring at me so for what are you looking so pale for —I said Yes he does look very pale she said I suppose it is for what he said to me when he was coming here —he was then present—I did not notice that manner about him previous to going to chapel—when he shook hands with me his hand appeared like ice and it dropped from me in the most extraordinary way—after he was gone I sat down and read to my husband for some time—and when he was preparing to go up stairs I went into the kitchen and missed my silver tea-spoons that I had used for tea—my husband kept the key of the cash-box and the key of the cupboard—the prisoner was married from our house about June or July last—I asked his wife in his presence to go to chapel—she rather refused saying it would be rather late to go home and he jumped up and said Oh no go to chapel by all means go to chapel —after my husband had gone up to bed he called out to me that he was robbed—I immediately ran up and saw that the cupboard door had been burst open and the cash-box taken—I had one key to the street door and my husband another—I had a difficulty in making use of my key to open the door—I never can open it without two or three attempts—I have never used my husband s key Cross-examined Q What is the matter with your key A I believe it is rather short and the lock is very harsh—I cannot tell exactly what is the matter with the key but I know I have always had a difficulty in unlocking the door—I do not know whether it is in the key or the lock—I have been generally obliged to put the key in twice before I could unlock it—it requires force to get the key into its place to turn the lock—there is a difficulty—it is a common door key—it requires pressure to get it into the lock JAMES DEARLOVE re-examined I took my key out with me when I went out with the prisoner—I did not take the other—mine is a key which I had made afterwards—there is rather a difficulty in opening the door with it and also with my wife s—the lock of the door is rather thick and the key-hole is not exactly straight—the key is rather short and there is a difficulty in turning it—my key is the most difficult of the two to use—they are not altogether troublesome but there is a little difficulty in getting the key in to turn—it is very trifling—I can open the door momentarily with either of the keys—I dare say I have seen my wife open the door with her key HENRY ROBINSON I live at No 1 Newport-street Bethnal-green very near the prosecutor s house—it is double the length of this Court from it—my window commands a view of the prosecutor s house—I can see it very plainly and distinctly—I know the prisoner well—I never saw him but three times once when there was a wedding and we had a look at him then and on Sunday the 21st of April when he came past our house along with his uncle—they made a little stop and my wife called my attention to him—I had such a knowledge of him as to be able to recognize him wherever I saw him—he came out with Mr Dearlove about half-past six o clock on the Sunday—I was sitting at my window with my wife—I saw the prisoner come back by himself in about an hour—he went past our window—he looked up at me as he passed—I saw him go up to the prosecutor s door—he made two attempts with a key or something that we thought was a key and he went in and shut the door after him—I never saw him again—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I am quite certain it was the same man I had seen with Mr Dearlove an hour before—we thought that he had come back for a prayer-book—I was with the policemen when he was taken into custody and I pointed him out to them—they were coming away from the prisoner s house and I pointed and said That is the man COURT Q You went there to see the prisoner in his own house did you not A Yes and on seeing him I made that assertion MR ROBINSON Q Do you recollect any one near the premises when you were looking on the Sunday A Yes a female just about five minutes before the prisoner came back—I saw her sitting down right opposite the prosecutor s door and about forty yards from it as near as I can tell—she was sitting on a part of an unfinished building—when the prisoner came by he went right direct to the door and I never saw any more of the woman—I never saw her go away—her face was turned towards the prosecutor s house—I had noticed her there for about an hour and a half—I thought she was waiting for a young man and I said so to my wife—she seemed to be about thirty years of age Cross-examined Q She went away you do not know when or where A No or what she came for I cannot tell—I saw her there about five minutes before the prisoner came by—I am a splint-cutter—I cut wood for lucifermatches—I work for Mr Sutton of Pollard s-row Bethnal-green—I am not in regular work at all times—sometimes we are obliged to lose a day in a week—I work by piecework and have three halfpence for every gross—I did not cut any last week—I was attending here four days and was ill on Sunday Monday and Tuesday—I had plenty of work to go to—last Saturday week I cut about 4s worth—I worked all that week and earned 24s —I receive my money by the week—I know Mr Dearlove very well by sight—I never knew his name before this robbery—Mr Dearlove s back premises lead right away through into Cambridge-road—you go through a little bit of a garden and a yard—I do not know whether there is a gate with a string to it—I have never been to his back premises and do not know how they are secured—I do not know whether there are any locks and bolts to them—I never took the trouble to look—we thought the prisoner returned for the Prayer Book—it was about half-past seven o clock—I have never been in a Court of Justice before nor ever called upon to identify anybody before—I cannot read—I have got good eyesight—I never spoke to the prisoner—I cannot tell how he was dressed—I can tell him by his face—he had boots on—they seemed to me to be boots—I do not know whether they were or not because the trowsers were down so low—he had on much such a coloured coat as he has now—it was the same make a frock coat—I cannot tell what coloured trowsers he had on—I did not notice his dress only his face because we wanted to see whether he favoured the old gentleman to see whether he was his son or not—I said to my wife Now we will have a good look —I have not been examined by that gentleman the attorney —I have never had any questions put to me about what I knew of this matter—I have not been to that gentleman s office—I do not know where he lives—he never called me as a witness—I do not know whether he examined me at the police-office—I and my wife went and gave information to Mr Dearlove on the Monday the 22nd having heard about the robbery—I have been past his house since—I have been in once not with my wife but alone—I think it was one day last week—I cannot tell which day—it was after we had come away from this place—I did not take anything to drink—I did not go to the public-house with any policeman—I have gone into a public-house and seen the two policemen in this case there—I do not know the sign of it—it is a beer-shop close by Mr Dearlove s where his back entrance comes out—I do not know when it was—I have seen them in there several times—I do not know how often I have been there since this transaction—I generally go there for my half-pint of beer—I never met the policemen there or went there with them—I have seen them there it may be six or seven times or it may be three or four I cannot tell—I have seen them come in and talk to the landlord—I have not talked to them only said How do you do and they have said so to me—they took nothing from me in writing—there was no drink between us—I once asked them to drink and they both drank out of my pot—it was part of a pint of fourpenny half-and-half—their names are Waters and Townsend—they drank nothing else never but that once—I do not know when that was—it was at my expense—I had a pint when they came in and asked them to drink—we had a pot of beer at the public-house opposite last week while attending here as witnesses—I swear I have had no drink with them anywhere else—I believe there were one or two persons in the public-house when they drank out of my pot—there was no one in their company that I know of—they stood against the bar and I sat down—I fell in with them quite by accident—I have seen them in there a good many times but they only drank with me once to my recollection—I do not recollect drinking with them after that—I would not like to swear it because I might be mistaken—I never knew them before this transaction—I was alone when I went and found them at the public-house—it was in the evening when I came home from my work about seven or eight o clock—I do not know what day—I do not think they had drink there when I have seen them talking to the landlord—I was not an hour in a public-house with the policemen on the day they went to take the prisoner—we went in and had a little drain of gin and a drop of half-and-half that day—I do not know at what public-house it was—it was going along towards the prisoner s house—the policemen paid for it—it was not at the beer-shop which I am in the habit of going to—the prisoner was not in the public-house which we went into—I did not see him there—if he was there it was not to my knowledge—I did not recognise him MR WILKINS Q Has the attorney ever examined yon A No I never saw him till I came to the police-office—I speak positively to the prisoner because I know him so well by looking at him to see whether he favoured Mr Dearlove—we thought he was his son and we said we would have a look to see whether he favoured him—it was since the prisoner has been taken that I drank with the policemen at the beer-shop—I went there by chance and they came in soon after—it is Crompton s beer-shop—I have never expressed the least doubt about the prisoner being the man ELIZA ROBINSON I am the wife of Henry Robinson On Sunday afternoon the 21st of April I was at the window of our room on the first floor—I know the prisoner by sight—the first time I saw him was about ten or or eleven months since at the time of his wedding which took place from Mr Dearlove s house—I have seen him three or four times since then four I believe—I saw him about half-past six o clock on the Sunday evening come out with Mr Dearlove and go by as I supposed to chapel—about three quarters of an hour or it might be an hour after I saw the prisoner return alone—he came past our window and went to Mr Dearlove s door—he made two attempts to open it with a key I suppose and with the third attempt he got in and shut the door after him—I am quite certain he is the man—I had noticed a woman that afternoon walking to and fro and round the church directly opposite our house—when the prisoner went into the house I lost sight of the woman and saw no more of her Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was the wedding talked about at the time A No I had no conversation with any one about it we afterwards inquired about it and heard that it was a wedding from Mr Dearlove s house—we did not inquire who it was that was married—we supposed it was Mr Dearlove s son—I did not ascertain that it was his nephew—I do not remember seeing him more than once between the wedding and this Sunday and then we saw him go to Mr Dearlove s—my children and my husband were at home this day—one is twelve months old and the other three years—we thought he came back for the prayer-book—he appeared in a great bustle—he passed us quickly at a hurried pace and went in a great hurry up to the door—he turned his head and looked us full in the face—we were sitting with the window wide open—our house is not directly opposite Mr Dearlove s but in a slanting direction—it is a little distance from it—I saw no more of him after he went in my attention was taken from the window to the children—I did not go away—I had seen Mrs Dearlove and another lady go out—I did not see them come back—I did not see the old gentleman return—we saw no more of any of them—I did not see the old gentleman come back just before the prisoner hurried past—I will not swear he did not come before—I did not see him just after—I did not see him come back at all—I was sitting at the window all the time—my children were playing in the room and they drew off my attention from the window from time to time MR WILKINS Q How soon after you had seen the prisoner go into the house was your attention drawn away to the children A I suppose in about five or ten minutes—there is a large open space of ground between our window and Mr Dearlove s house—there was nothing to interrupt my view only some hillocks of dirt where some rubbish has been shot—curiosity induced me to notice the prisoner that afternoon—we wished to know whether he faback voured Mr Dearlove whether he was his son and we said when he came again we would have a look at him SELINA ETRIDGE I live with my father James Etridge a coachman at No 3 Bartholomew-terrace next door to Mr Dearlove s—I have seen the prisoner at his uncle s two or three times—I saw the prisoner and Mr Dearlove go out on Sunday evening the night his house was robbed—it was about a quarter or twenty minutes to seven—at about half-past seven I was in the front parlour of our house and heard some one go into Mr Dearlove s house with a key—I heard the key in the lock—I can hear from our house very distinctly what is going forward in the next house—not a minute after I heard the door opened I heard a person walk about in the front room up stairs—it a ppeared to me to be a man s step—I heard the creaking of a pair of boots—I was alone—the footsteps were in Mr Dearlove s front room—I did not hear the person go out at the front door again—I should have done so if he had JOSEPH CROMPTON I keep the Rose and Crown beer-shop at the corner of King s-row—I know the prisoner and his uncle—they have frequented my house for the last nine months—I remember the prisoner coming to my house on the Sunday evening the prosecutor s house was robbed—it was somewhere between seven and eight—I cannot exactly say the time—he came to the door and asked if the old gentleman or his uncle Mr Dearlove was there—Mr Dearlove had never come to my house on a Sunday night that I recollect—I said No you will find him at home for I believe he very seldom or ever goes to a public-house on a Sunday evening —he then left—Yarminski was in my bar at that time—the window faces the street and there is a seat under it—a person sitting on that seat could not see a person come across from Cleveland-street but he could see a person come from Henman s-gate JOSEPH YARMINSKI I am a constable belonging to the Eastern Counties Railway On Sunday night the 21st of April I was sitting in front of Mr Crompton s bar—I saw the prisoner on that evening about thirteen minutes to eight—he came from Cambridge-road straight to my face in a direction as from the builder s yard just beyond the beer-shop—he could not possibly have come from Cleveland-street—that would have been at my back—he came into Crompton s and said Is the old gentleman here —Crompton said You know the old gentleman never comes on Sunday to my house —he came and looked in the window turned back and went out to the left Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Where was he when you first saw him A At the corner of Henman s yard and past the street going to the left of the new church MR WILKINS Q Where you were sitting could you see beyond Henman s yard A Yes—I cannot see the gate—I first saw him by this gate describing the situation on a plan produced and he came straight to the beer-shop ELIZA HENMAN I am the wife of Richard Henman a carpenter and builder No 1 Bartholomew-terrace—the gate of our timber-yard opens into Cambridge-road the opposite corner to Crompton s beer-shop—the gate of Mr Dearlove s garden opens into our timber-yard—I know the prisoner perfectly well—we have a dog that generally barks at strangers—he knows the prisoner—he has passed several times through our garden with Mr Dearlove and he did not bark at him—if a stranger approaches the yard when the dog is there he makes a great noise—I was at home that evening by myself and the dog did not bark or make any noise at all that I heard—I have seen the prisoner pass with Mr Dearlove once or twice without the dog barking at him EDWARD WANDERER TOWNSEND police-constable K 8 On Sunday evening the 21st of April about half-past ten I was called to Mr Dearlove s house and examined it—I found the cupboard door in the bed-room broken open—nothing else in that bed-room had been interfered with to appearance—on the following day I went and apprehended the prisoner—I told him he was charged with robbing his uncle—he said Me rob my uncle —I said Yes —he appeared rather excited—I said Dearlove you had better go in-doors or go up stairs —he went in with me and when he went in he threw his keys down on the carpet and said Search the house —I did search part of the house—Mr Dearlove said he had nothing to say against him more than what Robinson had to say—he would not charge him—I said Whether or not I shall take you to the station —I went for a cab and conveyed him to the station—on the road to the station he repeatedly said Is it likely I would rob my uncle and wished me to give him an answer—he wished to know what property his uncle had lost—I said That you will hear by-andbye —on our road to the station we passed the Sun brewery-shop and he said That is the house I was in with my uncle and passing Crompton s beer-shop hesaid I went to Mr Wood s and rang the bell twice and as I came from Mr Wood s I went in there and asked if ray uncle was there —Mr Wood lives in Cleveland-street—in conveying him next morning from the station to Lambeth-street police-court he said I was to have gone to my uncle s as yesterday to have borrowed 5l but I did not go having had a little drop to drink —I said You appeared when I took you to have had something to drink —Robinson pointed him out to me Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How long were you with Robinson in the public-house when he pointed him out to you A He did not point him out in the public-house—I think I had been in one public-house with Robinson that day a house near where the prisoner lived—I cannot tell the name of it—I was not there myself above ten minutes—I did not meet Robinson there—we went there for the purpose of watching to see whether the prisoner came home—I Robinson and Waters were all together—I took Robinson from his house—we agreed to go and see if he could identify this man as the man he said was the son of Mr Dearlove—we found he was not at home and went to the public-house to watch—I was not there all the time Robinson was—Waters was left behind—Robinson was outside watching the prisoner s house—I believe we had a pint of half-and-half to drink nothing else—after taking him into custody went down to communicate with Mr Dearlove—Robinson was near the prisoner when I came up—I have seen Robinson repeatedly since then at various places standing outside his own door not at public-houses—I was never in any other public-house with him from that day—we never met together at the bar of a public-house—I never had share of a pint of half-and-half of his—I never was in any other public-house with him COURT Q You were never at Crompton s A That is a beer-shop MR CLARKSON Q Then do you distinguish between a beer-shop and a A Yes I have met him at Crompton s half-a-dozen public-house times—I have occasionally seen him come there for his dinner beer between twelve and one o clock—I think I have seen him there on one or two evenings—I might have drank with him once or twice—I have not on several occasions—I think on one occasion or it might be twice he has offered his pint of beer to me and said Will you drink —and I think on one occasion I did drink—we never had any gin together on any occasion—we had none at the public-house near the prisoner s nor did he have any there in my presence MR WILKINS Q Do you remember whether he drank gin on any one of the occasions A Never that I saw—he always appeared to me very steady and very sober—there was no gin had on any one of the occasions—I was not more than ten minutes in the public-house near the prisoner—Robinson was chiefly outside because we bad not got an exact command of the prisoner s house—Waters was in the parlour of the public-house—the prisoner was within four or five yards of his own door when Robinson pointed him out to me—I should say the prisoner was not at any time in a room with me and Robinson without Robinson s knowledge RICHARD WATERS police-constable K 343 I went with Sergeant Townsend to take the prisoner into custody—he was living in White Conduit-street Islington—after going to his house and finding he was not at home I went to a public-house immediately in the vicinity of his residence—when I went in I saw one person sitting in the room—who he was I do not know—after waiting there some little time a second person came in and joined the other—they sat in conversation together some little time—I was not taking particular notice of the conversation my attention was drawn to the window till I heard dropped I might as well have had 500l as 100l —it was the prisoner said that—I did not know it was him at the time—but within twenty minutes after I apprehended him in company with Townsend—I was not paying attention to the conversation not thinking he was the person but he made some allusion to Fatguts—this was at the Spanish Patriots—Robinson was in the neighbourhood—I do not think he was with me when I overheard this conversation—he came in during the time that I was in the room but whether he was there at the time the conversation took place I cannot tell—I think at one period of the time he was in the public-house at the time the prisoner was there—there were three persons in the room—Robinson did not point out the prisoner in the public-house and did not appear to recognise him in the least—it is a square room there are no divisions in it—it is an open room—Robinson pointed him out as he was coming from his residence in company with the prosecutor—he made a point and said That is the man and we immediately apprehended him Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was not the prisoner coming out of the house that you had been informed was his house A I did not see him come out—he was not more than four or five yards from it and his uncle was with him when Robinson pointed him out—I cannot tell what the other part of the conversation in the public-house was about—there was something said about the income-tax on his wife s property but that was not relative to the other observation—the prosecutor did not at that time decline to give him into custody—I believe Robinson was smoking a pipe in the public-house and in the same room with the prisoner—he was certainly not there for nearly an hour nor scarcely for a quarter of an hour COURT Q Was the prisoner there all that time A I think not—no he was not—I and Townsend went in first—Townsend left me there and then Robinson must have joined afterwards—I should scarcely believe he was there a quarter of an hour—I do not think I was there a quarter of an hour altogether MR WILKINS Q How long do you think Robinson was in the room when the prisoner was there A But a very short space of time—it might have been five minutes—the expression I might as well have had 500l as 100l was not at all in reference to the income-tax—he was relating to the man who was in company with him about where he had been to that day—he produced his pocket-book and produced this paper from it—I saw it across the table and he said I have been to get the tax off my wife s income —the other conversation was some few minutes preceding—I got this paper referring to the income-tax from his pocket-book on his being searched among other documents—I took possession of it half or three-quarters of an hour after—I found a pawn ticket on him as well which I produce—it is for a snuff-box pawned for 6s on the 26th of March in the name of John Murphy No 54 Rawstorne-street RICHARD DUST I am brother-in-law to Mr Henman the prosecutor s next door neighbour I was on Mr Henman s premises on the Sunday afternoon in question as late as ten minutes past seven o clock—at that time Mr Dearlove s door was closed—I am quite sure of that—our dog was on the premises when I came in but whether he was there exactly when I went away I cannot say ANTHONY RUTT police-inspector K I have gone the distance from the trees in the Cam bridge-road past Robinson s house to Mr Dearlove s—I walked it as quick as I possibly could and it took me rather more than three minutes—I have also walked it with Mr Dearlove and it took him from eleven to twelve minutes The distance from Robinson s house to Mr Dearlove s door was admitted by MR CLARKSON to be sixty yards Evidence for the Defence ROBERT WAY I keep the Sun brewery beer-house in Bethnal-green-road On Sunday evening the 21st of April I remember Mr Dearlove coming to my house with some one—I do not remember the prisoner—I think it was between six and seven o clock—I think they staid about half an hour but I am not positive as to the time—it might have been half-past six or it might have been a quarter to seven o clock—they had a pint or two of ale I think but I am not positive—they did not have more than two PETER DUFF I am in the silk trade and live at No 2 Pearl-street Spitalfields I know the prisoner—he has been to my place several times—I saw him on Sunday evening the 21st of April in the Dog-row which is now I think called the Cambridge-road—it is the road with the Salmon and Ball at the corner between that and the Bethnal-green-road—he was speaking to an old gentleman about a hundred yards from the railway road nearer to Whitechapel—I should suppose it was between seven and eight o clock but I cannot say for I had no particular reason why I should take that notice— looking at the prosecutor —that is about the size of the old gentleman he was speaking to but I cannot say—I did not take any particular notice—he left the old gentleman and came and tapped me on the shoulder on the other side of the way as I was looking over the gardens—he commenced asking me about my son who was a companion of his at one time but is now gone to sea—Ryan was with me—I was going towards Red Cow-lane and he walked with me—he had left the old gentleman just by the four or five trees—I was going towards the Mile-end-road not towards the Salmon and Ball—I had come out with my friend and was taking a walk—I know Cleveland-street—that is what I call Red Cow-lane—I was going towards that and Ryan with me—the prisoner walked with me that way—he did not run from the old gentleman—I did not see him till he tapped me on the shoulder after I saw him on the other side—I cannot say whether he ran across—I saw him go to a house on the left hand side in Cleveland-street near the end of it going into Mile-end-road—he was about to bid me good bye—he rang a bell and said he was going in there—he rang it a second time and I bid him good evening—Ryan was with me the whole time—I did not observe what became of the prisoner after he had rung the bell twice—I went on taking my walk with my friend and left him at the door MR WILKINS Q The prisoner knew where you lived A Yes—he did not take me as a witness before the Magistrate—I have been subpoenaed here or I should not have come—Ryan is a harness manufacturer to the silk trade—he has done work for me—I never knew him to be in prison and I have known him from his birth—I was first asked to give evidence I think about a week back—I know this was the 21st of April because it was my birth-day and I was sixty years old—I had not been keeping it only so far that I asked my friend to go out with me to take a bit of a walk—he had not dined with me—we met together at half-past six o clock in the afternoon—I went to his house as I generally do—I should say I did not remain there more than a quarter of an hour and we then took a walk down Bethnalgreen-road—we went into a public-house and had a pint of ale—it is kept by a Mr Turner and is in the centre of Bethnal-green-road—I paid for it—some—we then took a walk round the Dog-row as I call it—I should say it was not above Ryan had twenty or thirty yards from the trees that the prisoner came up to me—it was on the other side of the way in a line—I can-not positively say whether he had white trowsers on—I do not think he had—I had no reason to take particular notice of him—he did not talk about anything besides my son—I said I thought he would be at home—Ryan took no part in the conversation—he walked behind me—I do not think the prisoner knew Ryan at all—he only knew me from being at my house three or four times DANIEL RYAN I live at No 5 Cross-street Church-street Shoreditch and am a weaver s harness-maker I remember being with Mr Duff on Sunday evening the 21st of April in the Dog-row—I do not know that it is called the Cambridge-road—the railway crosses it—it leads to Mile-end-gate one way and to Hackney the other—I saw a young man and an old gentleman talking but I did not take any particular notice of them—they were strangers to me—the old gentleman was much such a person as the prosecutor but he was not dressed as he is now nor had the young man the same sort of dress on the prisoner has now—the young man crossed over and spoke to Duff—I did not hear their conversation—I walked on—I was about five or six yards from them—we went up Red-cow-lane which is now called Cleveland-street—the young man went up Cleveland-street with us—I walked behind him and Mr Duff—they walked together I should say between fifty and sixty yards up Cleveland-street and the young man stopped at a house there and made an attempt to pull the bell but I kept walking on to look at some new houses—I saw him stretch out his hand to pull the bell—that was on the left hand side of the street and towards the middle of it I should say but I was busy looking at the new houses—it was no business of mine and I took no notice as he was a stranger to me—that was all I saw—I walked on about my business COURT Q What time in the evening was this A I should say between seven and eight o clock for when I came round Whitechapel and looked at the London Hospital clock it wanted a minute or two to eight MR WILKINS Q Who that young man was you cannot say A No—I should be sorry to swear it was the prisoner—he is very like him—I was never before the Magistrate—I should not have come up now unless I had been subpoenaed—it is no business of mine—I know it was the 21st of April by its being Mr Duff s birth-day—I had not been keeping it with him—he told me it was his birth-day—I met him at my house where he generally comes every Sunday for me to take a walk with him—I drank a pint of ale with him at the Cornwallis in the Bethnal-green-road—that was all—I had not seen the young man before—I saw him standing and talking to the old gentleman—I should say he was then twenty or thirty yards from me—he was on the left hand side of the road and I on the right—he crossed over—I did not hear any part of the conversations—he went about one third of the way down Cleveland-street—I did not hear the bell ring—I kept walking on and looking at the new houses—he had on something of a velvet coat at I thought COURT Q Was the Cambridge-road crowded A No—there were several people walking but not the least obstruction—I should say this place is half a mile from the London Hospital where I noticed it wanted a minute or two to eight—we came right up Cleveland-street and down Mile-end-road direct to the London Hospital—we were not many minutes walking that half mile because I was in a hurry to get home—I generally go to Mr Burkett s in Church-street where the newspaper is read and I said I must make haste my time will be up and I shall not hear the paper read —it might have been about a quarter to eight when I was in Cleveland-street—I cannot say exactly the time MARTIN WOOD I live at No 5 Cleveland-street Mile-end-road My house is only five doors up from the Mile-end-road and I should think about 250 yards from the Queen s Head opposite Crompton s beer-shop—I was not at home on Sunday evening the 21st of April—I am single—I left the house without any person in it—I know the prisoner MR WILKINS Q As far as you know had he any business with you that day A Not to my knowledge—I am not aware of any business he could have COURT Q He had made no appointment with you A None whatever—I had not required to see him—I had not seen him for three or four weeks—he had left me about five or six weeks as near as I can tell telling me he was going into his old business as a grocer MR DEARLOVE re-examined On that Sunday night I had a black coat on instead of this—I took very little notice as to how the prisoner was dressed—he had no velvet coat—I never saw him in a velvet coat—I will not be sure whether he had on a black or dark brown coat I believe it was a frock coat—I believe that was the only coat he had on—I do not know whether he had two coats—I will not be sure whether it had a velvet collar I think it had Q How long had you got home after parting with the prisoner before he came to the window A I should think about two three or four minutes I cannot say I took very little notice—there were a great many people passing and repassing in the Cambridge-road so as rather to impede a person s walking—I should not think I could have seen thirty yards through the people from where I stood by the trees nor half the distance—I do not think a person standing thirty yards off could have observed me and my nephew at the trees from the concourse of people—we did not talk at all—we made no stop—he started from me at full run out into the middle of the road—I should judge the pace he went from me was about six miles an hour—I never saw him cross the road—I lost sight of him almost immediately CHARLES WALLER City police-inspector I produce a certificate of the prisoner s former conviction from Mr Clark s office—I was a witness at the trial to which it relates and know the prisoner to be the person mentioned Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q He pleaded guilty did he not A He did—the charge was receiving a portion of property that some relative of his had stolen— certificate read — GUILTY Aged 35 — Transported for Fifteen Years 
t18440610-1744  1744 JEREMIAH MARGESON and GEORGE AYLETT were indicted for breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Harriet Pile at St Anne s Limehouse and stealing therein 1 bottle value 1s 1 pocket-took 1s 4 half-crowns 5 shillings 4 sixpences 192 pence 96 halfpence and 140 farthings her property MR DOANE conducted the Prosecution HARRIET PILE I keep the Lord Nelson public-house in the parish of St Anne Limehouse it is my dwelling-house On the 16th of May about half-past nine Margeson came in and the rest of the company went away—he stayed and went out a quarter before twelve—soon after I shut up and retired—I had about 1l in copper and 3s in farthings safely locked in the till in the bar—there was 1l in silver in a bag in a private drawer at the other end of the counter—I am certain it was safe when I went to bed and the keys were in my pocket—I cannot speak as to the yard door being fastened—about seven in the morning in consequence of what the pot-boy said I came down and found the yard door open and the side door and the liquor set flowing—on the counter just above the private drawer I found this knife it does not belong to me—the money did not belong to me but was in my care—I found the inner lining of a shoe THOMAS BASS I am the prosecutrix s pot-boy On the night of the 16th of May I went to bed—the yard and the side doors were safe—I came down about seven o clock and found the side door open and the property gone—the liquor was flowing about—I found the sock of a shoe lying down against the side door—I gave it to the policeman—the tiles were moved in the skittle-ground—Margeson was the last that went out HENRY WOOD police-constable K 44 I heard something and examined these premises—I found they had been broken by taking the tiles off skittle-ground—the shutters had been attempted—I examined the bar and found the bottom of the drawer had been cut away so as to allow the till to drop out and then any one could get at the contents—I received this sock of a shoe—the shutters appeared to have been tried by a jemmy or blunt chisel—the knife that was left was such an one as would cut away the bottom of the till—I took Margeson into custody about nine the same morning at a beershop in the West India-road—I asked where he had been over-night—he said I have not been in bed all night he had been with a person up the Highway came back to Phillips s coffee-shop and then went down to Millwall—I searched him and found 16s 3d on him—he said he had taken it from his customers for milk—I asked him who they were—he said he could not tell me any one that bought milk of him that he had saved it up in a box and kept it with Mrs Boik in New-alley and taken it out the day before to buy some wood—I told him to take his boots off—he took off his left boot and I compared the sock—there is a cut in the inner sole of the boot and the sock fits into that cut and it fits exactly Margeson Q Had I any sock in the other boot A You had not—the knife is broken at the point SARAH BOIK I live in New-alley Limehouse Margeson lived in my house nine weeks—he lodged somewhere else—he had a small box at my house—I frequently saw it open the last time was about six weeks ago—there were letters and a razor in it—I never saw any money in it—he was not with me on the 15th of May except serving me with milk—he did not take any money out of the box that day and did not go to it at all—I have seen this knife in his possession more than once—I know it and believe it to be his but the point was not broken with that exception it corresponds THOMAS WATKINS police-constable K 310 I apprehended Aylett on the 17th of May in Gun-lane—I said I wanted him on suspicion of breaking and entering Mrs Pile s public-house—he said I know nothing about it I went to bed at ten o clock and Margeson called me up about a quarter-past eleven —I produce this knife Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Did he not say a little after eleven A No—if any one has said so they have told an untruth—I did not tell the Magistrate that he said so to my knowledge HENRY VERNON PARKES police-constable K 5 On the 14th of May I saw the prisoners together between twelve and one in the night—I saw this knife found on Margeson it was not broken at the time—as I had no charge I returned it to him and they were allowed to go Margeson Q Can you swear to my knife A Yes there is a mark on it—I took particular notice of it Cross-examined Q Where was it you saw them A At the station—I was on duty when they were brought there by Young the constable with another prisoner JONAS PHILLIPS I keep a coffee-shop in Emmett s-street Poplar On the morning of the 17th of May about half-past three the prisoners came to my shop together—they had some coffee bacon and eggs—they were rather in a hurry to have their meat cooked—about four they left my place—it is about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor s—they took the direction of Millwall Cross-examined Q Do not you know that Aylett was in the habit of working at the Docks A I never saw him to my knowledge till the time he was with Margeson—I have no doubt that it was him—my place is near to the Docks and some hundreds of persons who work there come—I have seen Margeson before JOSEPH LADYMAN police-constable K 334 I was on the Ferry-road that morning about five and saw the prisoners together—I asked where

rings value 10l his property JOHN ROBERT DAVIS I am shopman to Frederick Folkard a pawnbroker at No 160 Blackfriars-road On the 13th of Feb about half-past six o clock in the evening I was in the shop and heard something move ill the window—I cast my eye towards it and saw two fingers inside the window lifting up a card of mourning rings—the window was not open and the wires were up outside to protect it—a piece of glass had been starred out—eight mourning rings were on the card worth 10l —I lifted up the flap of the counter ran round and as soon as I opened the door I saw the prisoner drawing them through the wires—I went to lay hold of him but fell down—I got up and pursued—we have two reflectors inside the window which show a light outside and I saw his face distinctly—I was close to him before I fell—there was another one with him—I pursued him across the road—he ran down Wellington-street and turned up Angel-place—I shouted out Stop thief all the way along as I went—I saw no one down the street—I did not see the prisoner go down Angel-place the street is not straight one house projects out a little next door but one from this court and the moment I turned into the court the prisoner came back put of the court—it was no thoroughfare—I was I dare say three or four yards behind him when he ran up this place—I caught hold of him and his hand was bleeding inside in the middle—I said Where is the card of rings you have taken out of the window —he said I have not got a card of lings what card of rings —he kicked me and tried to get away—he threw off his hat and scarf up Angel-place among the snow—when I caught him he had no hat with him—I brought him back to the shop and gave him into custody—the card was produced—it then had four rings on it and one was picked up on the ground and was produced by Mr Coleman a gentleman who was passing by at the time—this is the card and the rings— looking at it —they belong to my master Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q I think you say you fell down directly A I did—I had never seen the features of the person till that moment—I did not fall down directly—as I went to seize hold of him I fell down—I had just made one step out of the doorway—he was only two panes of glass from me—I distinctly saw his face for a moment and saw him with the card drawing it through the wires—I did not ask a woman any questions when I got into Wellington-street—there was a woman standing at a door—I did not ask her any questions—I did not ask her which way the person had run—I spoke to no woman—I was calling out Stop thief as she stood at the door and she said He is gone up there —as I came back with the prisoner she was standing at the door I did not say to her Is this the man —I went back after he was gone to the station and asked her if she could swear to him and she said she could not—I had gone back to see if I could find any of the rings—I pulled the prisoner about and searched his pockets to see if I could find the rings—I did not find anything—it was then that we had the scuflle—he tried to get away—I was not aware then that he had thrown the card of rings away—the top of the window had been cracked about a month before but it was perfectly secure—I am quite positive no part of the glass was gone that night—when I examined it afterwards a piece about half the size of this card was ent out—it was starred in two places as though donebya brad-awl—the boy put up the wires outside about four o clock in the afternoon and I saw the window quite safe about half-past four o clock COURT Q That part of the glass where you saw the fingers A Yes—it was the top of the bottom pane that was cracked—a fresh pane had been put in about three months ago and the glazier broke it at the top corner at the time but this cut was at the bottom of the pane where the rings were taken from—we examined but found no pieces of glass either inside or outside—I examined it when I came back—there were two holes in it where it had been starred across one part and another across that and a piece of glass taken away just sufficient to get the fingers through—I searched for that piece of glass but could not find it—I saw the prisoner s hand distinctly drawn through the wires as I came out of the shop WILLIAM COLEMAN I am a stock-manufacturer and reside in Hemming s-row Charing-cross I was passing along

road—they both passed me—I stopped nearly opposite a street—the first one that was running threw something from his right hand directly he passed me and within about six or eight yards of me—thinking it was only a piece of paper I let it lie for nearly a minute—a little boy who was passing said He threw something down —I turned it over and saw it contained rings—a lad named Hackett was taking it from him and I took it from Hackett—it was a card containing four gold rings—this looks like it but I could not swear to it—I took it over to the pawnbroker s and laid it on the counter—it lay there till the policeman came in—I did not see anybody take it from the counter—there were four rings on it when I took it from Hackett—I felt in the snow and found another one—I am quite sure that what I took from Hackett was what the man threw away—I saw the man s face when he threw it away—there was light enough for me to see his face—there was a lamp close by—he passed close under the lamp—it was the prisoner—I did not see what became of him after he threw it away—they both ran on—no one was following them at that time—it was on the opposite side of the way to Jr Folkard s that he threw the rings away about fifty or sixty yards off it was not near Wellington-street—I think it was nearer the bridge but I cannot say—I did not know the prisoner before—I saw the policeman take the rings off the counter—I am sure he took what I got from Hackett Cross-examined Q The person went past you quickly A Very quick—I never saw a man of his size who could run so fast—he had no hat on—when I first saw him again he had his hat on and I said I did not know him—I said Take his hat off and I shall know him in a minute —his hat was taken off—I stood back and said I could swear to him—I do not recollect saying to Hackett as we went along to Mr Folkard s shop Are you sure that is the person for I cannot swear to him —I cannot swear I did not say so—Hackett did not say he could not swear to him—I do not recollect it—I would not swear it—it was a dark night—the Blackfriars-road is very broad—I am not well acquainted with it—I was nearest the bridge on the right hand side going to Caraberwell—Mr Folkard s shop is on the left hand side perhaps a quarter of a mile from the bridge I cannot say—I do not know where Wellington-street is—I know Wellington-street Waterloo-road but not Wellington-street Blackfriars-road GEORGE WILLIAM HACKETT I was going along Blackfriars-road on the evening of the 13th of Feb and heard the cry of Stop thief —I saw two persons running across the road—the last one was calling out Stop thief —I walked across the road to the top of the street—I forget the name of it—I spoke to Mr Coleman—I saw a little boy with a card of rings in his hand and heard him say Here is a card —I did not see him pick it up from the ground it was so dark—I took it from him and gave itiato Mr Coleman s hand—there were four rings on it—I could not see the face of either of the men they went so quick Cross-examined Q Where did you see the persons running A Across the Blackfriars-road—I saw two persons go down Wellington-street—I believe Mr Coleman asked me coming along whether I was sure the prisoner was the person for that he could not speak to him—I said I could not swear to him and I do not THOMAS JAY police-constable L 140 I was sent for to Mr Folkard s on the 30th of Feb and took the prisoner into custody there—I also took the card of rings from the counter—the witnesses were there—these are the rings—I searched the prisoner but found

s miniature Payne s Defence written However suspicious appearances may be against me I solemnly declare that I am entirely innocent of any participation in the robbery with which I am charged nor did I know the property found at my lodgings belonged to Mrs Brown The desk I only received on Sunday morning the 2nd of March I had never opened it while it was in my possession I received it from a person named Harrington with whom I have been acquainted about six years she told me it belonged to her brother who was at Yarmouth and asked me if I would take charge of it for a few days till her brother s return which I contented to do not knowing it was stolen the articles produced by the pawnbroker Alton were pledged by me for the same person had I known they were stolen property I should not have taken them to a place where I have been in the habit of going for at least twelve months past and given my own name and address at the time I pledged them the two 5l notes sworn to by Mrs Brown were brought to me by Louisa Harrington she told me they were her own property and that she lived at Lambeth she asked me to change them for her on the 6th of Feb which not being convenient for me at the time I told her I could give her eight pounds in money which I had by me at that time of my own she accepted that and I gave her the other two pounds after I changed the notes the twenty pound notes were my own property most part of which was left me by a relation some time since the remainder was my own savings I took it out of a savings bank at Chelmsford in Essex about nine months ago the five pound notes also the money which I gave up at the station-house I received in change of one of my own notes the head of the diamond ring was given to me by the person Louisa Harrington I had no knowledge of the value of it or that it had been stolen or I should not have had it in my possession upwards of a month after the stated time of the robbery taking place I wish to state that I only lived in Mrs Brown s service six weeks and that is nearly four years since and during that time I never saw any of the things I pledged for Louisa Harrington I hope you will take in consideration the extreme improbability of my keeping stolen property in my possession upwards of a month and continuing in the same lodgings and going about the neighbourhood at all times of the day bad I been aware the same was the proceeds of a robbery committed at a house where I had formerly lived and was so well known I never told roy fellow-prisoner or any other person that I found 60l or any such sum

felony MR PARRTY conducted the Prosecution GEORGE SOUTH I am a licensed victualler and keep the Duchess of Kent public-house in Deverell-street Dover-road in the parish of St Mary Newington On Saturday the 1st of Nov about seven or eight o clock in the evening I went out into the back yard and found my back gate open which was a very unusual thing as it was not an entrance for customers but merely a private back gate—I went back to the bar got the key and double-locked the gate to secure it—that was as near twenty-five minutes or half-past seven as possible—I went up stairs to get an apron unlocked my bed-room door and found the window wide open and the dwarf-blinds also—I looked out the window and found the large looking-glass gone from the dressing-table and put outside on the leads—I searched the bed-room further and missed five or seven scarfs two satin neck-handkerchiefs two waistcoats one crimson-velvet and the other a drab-plush and a watch key was in one of the pockets—I also missed a cloth-cap—Gibbs has been in my employ occasionally for the last eighteen months and knew the nature of my premises well—he has been up in my bed-room—I met him about eleven on the following Monday morning—I had a policeman in plain clothes with me—we met Gibbs and he had a pin in his stock very much resembling one which I had lost and a little gold chain attached to it which I was positive was mine—I gave him into custody and Went to the station-house with him and the policeman who searched him and found on him this crimson-velvet waistcoat and cap now produced—I can swear to the waistcoat—it was concealed under the waistband of his trowsers and the cap was in his bosom—that ii also mine—I had seen Phillips once or twice in the week previous to the robbery—I did not employ him on the night of the 1st of Nov to carry anything from my premises Cross-examined by MR BALDWIN Q You knew phillips by sight A Yes seeing him there once or twice the week previous to the robbery—not with Gibbs—the back gate leads into Bland-street by the side of the house—there is no lamp nearer the gate than the corner of the house—there is no lump at the gate—the nearest parish lamp is opposite my house but I have three lamps round my house—the back gate is in the same street as the tide of my house—the gas lamps are all in front of the house in Deverell-street—the gate is some distance from the corner the length of the house and kitchen which is about twice the length of this Court MR PARRY Q Does either of the gas lamps in front of your house cast any light on the side of it A Not so far as the back gate—there it no gas light near the back gate—I do not think I had been in my bed-room after ten in the morning THOMAS TURVEY police-constable M 196 I took Gibbs into custody by Mr South s direction—I was with him—I searched him at the station and found this cap and waistcoat on him—when I was searching him he said Now I am done I will give it up —I produce the pin which was in hit stock MR SOUTH re-examined This pin I believe is Gibbs s—I have seen him wear it—it is not mine—this other pin exactly resembles the pin I lost but the stones have been token out and turned upside down—the chain on it is mine—I can swear to it by a little crack at the end of the link which I have found come undone in my scarf several times—this chain was in my room at the time of a previous robbery not at the time in question NAOMI JARMAN I live with my father and mother at No 142 Great Suffolk-st Borough—I shall be 13 years old next June—I work at the shirt business On Saturday evening the 1st of Nov I was coming from my work and passed Mr South s house about a quarter after seven o clock—I left my work about ten minutes after seven—as I passed Mr South s house I saw the prisoner Phillips come out of Mr South s back gate in Bland-street carrying a bundle in both his hands—he went up Bland-street—I was on the same side of the way as he was on the board near to him—I was going the same way as he was—he ran and turned the corner of Great Bland-street—I saw him by the gaslight when he came to the corner—I saw him stand at the corner of the street and then he ran and passed along the Dover-road as fast as be could—I saw him again on the Tuesday following at Mr South s in the tap-room—no one was with me—there were two or three others in the tap-room bedsides Phillips—I recognised him immediately—I told the policeman I recognised him—I have no doubt of his being the man I saw that night Cross-examined Q Which way were you coining at the time the man came out of the premises I was coming into Bland-street from Deverell-street—I am sure I saw him come out of the gate—he ran towards me—I was quite near to him when I saw him come out of the gate—I was standing on the board skipping—I had got a very little way down Bland-street when he came out—it was rather dark—there was no lamp near—I did not go back—he followed me down Bland-street to the corner of the street and there was a gaslight and I saw him plainly—it was a shop light—this was about a quarter past seven o clock—I had left work rather sooner than usual and I looked at Mr South s clock as I went past—it could not have been as early as six or as late as half-past eight or nine—it was a quarter past seven I am certain—was quite sure of him when I first saw him in the tap-room—I said I was quite sure at first—I did not say I could not swear to him but I thought it was like him—I never said that—I am quite sure he is the man—there was no time at which I doubted it—I have all along been quite sure he was the man and always said so—I looked in his countenance and he had rather a long nose—the other persons I saw in the tap-room were men—I did not I know any of them—they were sitting down—there was one man standing up and Phillips sitting down and two or three others sitting down—some were labouring people and the others like gentlemen—I am satisfied he is the man and that he actually came out of the gate—he did not merely pass the gate—I saw him come out—he left the gate open—he did not stop to shut it COURT Q You did not know Phillips before A No HENRY BARRY police-constable M 171 From information I received I apprehended Phillips—I asked him if he knew of the robbery at Mr south s the Duchess of Kent in Deverell-street—he said no he did not know where it was—I said You had better go round with me to Mr South s I have orders to take you into custody wherever you are found —he said he would go with me—I said in going along You don t know where the Duchess of Kent is —he said Yes I do know it —I said Why not say so when I asked you —he said I said so because I did not want the man that was with me to know I was there on Saturday night Cross-examined Q Are you sure he said on Saturday night A Yes I had asked him if he had heard of the robbery at the house on Saturday night and he said no he was not there—I said we could bring very good proof that he was and in going along he said he was there on Saturday night but denied it in presence of the man because he did not wish him to know he was there Gibbs s Defence I went home about ten o clock that day to see my brother I stopped with him all day and came home about six o clock I crossed over towards the prosecutor s house to see the time and under the wall there was this waistcoat I put it under my waistcoat and went home on the Monday I was coming home from my own house Mr South came up to me and said I will swear to the pin he has got in his breast I said No you cannot swear to that and at the station-house he could only swear to the chain I said I know nothing of the robbery they began to search me and found the waistcoat I said I will give it up which I did MR BALDWIN called the following witnesses ELIZABETH DARKE I live at No 13 Bennett s-buildings Kennington-road—my husband is the mate of a ship at present—I know the prisoner Phillips—he has no wife that I am aware of—he has a sister—his eldest sister makes dresses for me—he lives in the London-road—he has lived there some time and is a fishmonger—I have a particular reason for remembering being at his house on the 1st of Nov —my husband and myself were there about half-past six o clock in the evening—we are certain it was that hour— my husband went abroad on the Monduy following —I was there three quarters of an hour—I saw the prisoner there sitting in a chair at the further end of the shop talking to a young woman with an infant in her arms—I staid there more than half an hour or it might be three quarters—the prisoner his mother and sister Mary were there and a young person whom I have since understood to be named Goldsmith—she was standing there talking to him with a child in her arms—he never left her but once and that was to serve me with some fish—I left the house as near as I can judge at a quarter past seven o clock for at the time I got home which is no great distance the man was passing down there with beer—I do not know Deverell-street MR PARRY Q Is Goldsmith here to-day A I believe she is and hit sister Mary—I have known Phillips s family five or six years and I have known the prisoner by dealing with him—his sister is a dress-maker—the younger sister was not in the shop—it is not a very large shop—it is a sort of fish-stall rather than a shop but it is a shop DANIEL PARTLOE I am a tailor by trade and live at No 1 Queen s-street Walworth I have known Phillips and know his house—I was there on Saturday night the 1st of Nov —I have reason particularly to remember the circumstance—I distinctly remember that I was there that night—as I was returning from the London-road Phillips nodded to me and I crossed over to his shop—there was a lady and gentleman in the shop who I did not know—I walked into the shop and sat down and the lady and gentleman went away—it was Mrs Darke but I did not know her—I went into the shop about seven—Phillips was there at that time—I stopped there until half-past nine—he did not go out during that time I am quite positive—he was there all that time—I have known him for the last eleven years—I know nothing of him but being an upright honest man attentive to his business MR PARRY Q You are a tailor A A tailor by trade—I keep a shop at No 1 Queen-street Walworth Q As you are a tailor

Bermondsey-street—the last job I did for him is two months ago—I did not live in Bermondsey-street then—I do not exactly live by tailoring—I live by selling clothes and letting out carts and trucks and I take my bag across my back and cry clothes—I buy clothes Q Can you mention the name of any other customer you have done business for lately A I have done business for—what do ye call him there what was Lord Mayor some time ago—I am quite confused and cannot exactly recollect the name—I forget his name upon my life and soul—I do not know the Duchess of Kent public-house—I was never in it in my life nor hardly any other public-house—I got to Phillips house at seven o clock and was there till half-past nine—I then left Phillips in his shop—I cannot say how far his shop is from the Duchess of Kent—I know Deverell-street that is about three quarters of a mile from Phillips house—it would take about six minutes to walk there at a sharp pace—I was there from seven o clock till half-past nine—we were talking about business—I asked Phillips how be found business and he asked how I found it and I said very bad—I had nothing to drink there—I am not in the habit of drinking—I had nothing to eat—I do not know whether any meal was taken by the family—the family do not live there—there was nobody there besides Phillips and me after Mrs Darke left ELIZA PHILLIPS I am the prisoner s

during that time—I remember the day particularly—I remember Mrs Darke coming—I was standing at the back part of the shop some part of the time while Partloe was there and part of the time I was at the door—I am sure my brother was there from six till nine MR PARRY Q Do you live there A No—my brother did not I leave at nine—I remained in the shop it might be a few minutes more than I nine—Partloe was not there all the time—we had no tea or supper while he was there—we had tea before he came—I cannot say how long Partloe was there altogether—I did not remark what time he left—I spoke to Partloe I while he was there and asked how his wife was—there was no drinking I between my brother and Partloe—I do not know what business he had tbere—he visits my brother sometimes—I believe Partloe left some time before me—I cannot say whether he left at eight o clock—perhaps it was half-anhour before me—my brother is of the Jewish persuasion—we open shop on Saturday night as soon as it is dark

there till half-past ten o clock HENRY BARRY re-examined He denied being at the house that night or that he knew the house at all—he afterwards admitted that he had been there—he did not state what

clock I was coming down the stairs of Mr Savory s house and heard apparently a key opening the front door which induced me to stop—the door opened and two men rushed in quickly—it was light enough for me to see them—the prisoner was one of them I am quite positive—he was in the passage and the other one went up stairs—I have since been to the Penitentiary seen the other man and identified him—that

were too near for me not to see them J—there was a fan-light over the door and a passage-window—the man who I went up saw me and still went up—I did not see him come down again—I j went in to the landlady to deliver a message and the prisoner was in the passage when I went up stairs to my room again—I saw him next at the station-house several months after not more than three weeks ago—I had never I seen him before that night—I always said I should know him if I met him in the street—when the door opened I was at the foot of the stairs and they came to the middle of the passage—there was a gas-lamp directly opposite the door in the street—I do not know whether it was lighted but I saw their faces very plain—there was no light but from the outside MR PLATT Q Look at him again—is he the man or not A He is—they shut the door after them—there was quite enough light through the fan-light for me to see them COURT Q How do you know it was ten minutes past seven A I know it was after

window fell on his face—I delivered a message and went up to my room—I did not hear anything going on overhead—my two nephews were playing in my room—I noticed the men because they were strangers—I thought it odd that they should enter a house in that sort of way—I did not give an alarm because I did not like to interfere—I thought they had come to see Mr Hansford or somebody in the house—I did

was on the 16th by taking the fare there and in coming back I got another fare at Somerset-street and took a gentleman to the Great Western to the mail-train—that could have happened on another night—I heard of the robbery on the Tuesday in the next week—I then knew it was the 16th—it was a large bag of clothes as much as they could poke into the cab—it was something like a tailor s or Jew s bag that they carry old clothes in—it was a very large bag it filled the door up as it went into the cab—they had great difficulty to get it in—one of them carried it before him—the other carried the

more than three weeks ago—I remember it was the 16th of March by a chair being left in the parlour for the person in the attic and I heard the prisoner scrambling up stairs and thinking it was my husband I looked through the keyhole but instead of a chair it was the bundle—a person in the house looked at her rent-book about three weeks ago and I know it was the 16th of March by that and by the chair—if I had not seen the book I should not have known it was the 16th of March—I remember the bundle coming that day—it appeared large—he asked his wife to show a light as if she did not show light enough and when I saw it was not the chair I took no more notice—it was a very large bundle—I could see through my key-hole—it is a wide staircase—the candle showed a light on his face not on the

money—I found that out by selling them—there were five or six pairs of trowsers—there were not ten—there were four coats I think and six or seven waistcoats—they were second-hand—it was a air price for them—there were one or two pair of gloves—the prisoner was present during the sale—he sat on a chair and he saw them sold—he did not interfere with the sale—these articles produced are some of the things I bought—I have worn two waistcoats Cross-examined Q Did you know Molloy between the time you served with him at Hodgson s and the time you bought the clothes A Yes—he told me he was getting his living by jobbing—I have bought things of him before—I considered he had them as valet and bought them to sell again—I knew that he did it to turn a little money and I did the sam£—I bought them to sell part of them again—I did not know the prisoner before—I know he is the same man very well—he partook of some ale we had and left with Molloy—I see no difference in him now—I paid Molloy the money—he was there about an hour and a half or two hours COURT Q You were Molloy s fellow-servant at one time A Yes—he used to buy and sell clothes then of various servants and I have done the same—my

shirt but I have a shirt of the same make off the same piece—it is made by the same maker in High-street—I bought the cloth myself and had the shirts made—I do not believe there is plenty of cloth of

night as I was just moving—there was half a dozen of this kind of shirts—I have from eighteen to twenty shirts altogether but only half a dozen of these—I had counted them the day before—they were put

the old Kent-road near Mr Linsdell s shop—I followed them and saw them go to the window—the other man was walking by the door—he then left went to the window and looked in at the window—they all left the window—I went by and saw that it was cracked—I went away to the same place where I had watched them previously and saw them go three or four times more to the window with the other man—I went to the window and saw part of the pane had been taken away—I went back again to where I had been watching them and saw them go there again once or twice—they left—Lennox left first and it seemed as if there was something bulky under his coat—shortly afterwards Jones left the shop with the other man and joined Lennox a short distance before he got to the cab-rank—they stopped at the cab-rank and got into a cab and the door was closed—I went to the off-side and opened the door—as soon as I did so Jones jumped out and struggled to get away—he was sitting at the bottom of the cab—I pushed him into the cab again—I saw him in the act of putting his left hand into his pocket—I took his hand away and felt a bundle of cigars—Lennox was handcuffed and taken through the cab to the other prisoner—I

Old Kent-road 200 or 300 yards past the Bricklayers Arms—the cab-stand is at the Bricklayers Arms in the middle of the road—I did not hear the noise of the glass breaking—I was 50 yards off—the hole was sufficiently large to take the cigars out—I pushed Jones into the cab—he was on one side and Lennox on the other—both doors wre open—I took him through the cab—if I had brought him round the cigars might have gone—the cab man might have taken them JOHAN WHITLAMB police-constable M 89 On 22nd Jan I was with West in plain clothes and saw the prisoners—there was a taller man with them who

one went and sometime the other—on the last occasion their arms were very busy at the window Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Were you up a court A No—I was at the end of a public turning—it was not a dark turning—a public thoroughfare—there is a baker s shop near—I did not stand up the turning and look round the corner—West and I were not together—he came to me once or twice and left me again—I

police dress A Yes THOMAS LINSDELL I live at Yeoel-place Old Kent-road in the parish of St George the Martyr Southwark—I missed some of my property from my shop on this day—I had furnished the window about ten minutes before—there was then a good supply of cigars and no glass was broken then—about eight o clock the police came to me—I examined the window—the glass was broken and a great quantity of cigars gone—I have examined the cigars produced—they are similar to mine—I had sold none from the window—have no doubt of their having been moved away from my window—there was nobody in the shop to have removed them Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q What time the bundles put in the window A One bundle at ten minutes before six o clock the others were there before—a female served in the shop not my wife—she is not here—I was out that evening from six to half-past eight o clock Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you call your name Lindsell A No Linsdell—it is written up so over the shop MR WILD Q Have you any doubt of the cigars being your property A Not of this bundle which has Silvas written on the band MR O BRIEN Q Why do you speak so positively to the bundle A Because they were sent to me that evening and they are peculiar cigars COURT Q What quantity did you lose A About 10lbs —I am not in the habit of selling 10lbs at a time THOMAS WEST re-examined I am sure the men I saw getting into the cab are the same men I had seen at the window—I caught Jones coming out of the cab—I am sure I pushed the same man in again MR PAYNE Q Did not a person get out and you seised Jones by mistake

the rings were inside—the window was not broken then ANN KING I am the wife of Thomas King and live in St George s-street opposite Mr Wood s On the 2nd of Sept I saw Barnett and Thomas Rush close by Mr Wood s window—Barnett appeared to me to be writing on a pane of glass—they both turned round and looked both ways in the street—Barnett turned round after that he bent himself down and appeared to put his hand into the window—he took out something in his hand from the wisdown and gave it to Thomas Rush who crossed the road and I lost sight of him—Barnett passed on towards Francis-street and as he was coming back Mr Reed caught him and took him into the shop—I saw two or three little things drops from Barnett s hand on the pavement as he took his hand from the window—I could not see what they were Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Where were you A Sitting at my window opposite Mr Wood s nursing my baby—it was between one and two o clock—when I saw them take something and go away I went to run down to tell Mr Wood but before I could get the baby out of my arms Mr Reed had taken Barnett into the shop—the street may be twenty or thirty yards wide—it was as I looked out accidentally that I saw the prisoners—I did not expect to see them—I saw their backs in the first instance—when they turned round I saw their faces—they went away as fast as they could and then I gave an alarm—my husband is a policeman and has been so twelve months—he was not at home—I do my work in the house and nurse my baby—I never was a witness before—I saw Barnett and Thomas Rush for nearly an hour—the baby was lying in my lap—I am not mistaken in the prisoner s person MR ROBINSON Q Do you know John Rush A When I first saw them they were all three together coming up the Highway—when Barnett and Thomas Rush went to Mr Wood s window they left John Rush close to Mr Playfair s shop which is three doors from Mr Wood s and when he was standing there he looked round—when Barnett was writing John

up together Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What time did you see the three come up together A About one o clock I cannot tell exactly I have no clock—I dine at different times—I did not dine at all

into custody—I have no doubt about them—I can swear to them all—I watched their manœuvres for some time—they were walking to and from the prosecutor s shop sometimes one way and sometimes the other—I noticed a man with a watch and chain and Barnett and Thomas Rush went up and closed round him—there was a crowd collected and they went into the crowd with him and pushed against him very much—John Rush went about four doors off and hid himself in the doorway of the Bull s Head—the others came up to him—I did not see them do anything more till I saw Thomas Rush running towards Shadwell church tucking something under his waistcoat Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Were you before the Magistrate A Yes on the apprehension of John Rush—Thomas Rush and Barnett were not there then—I was not present on the first examination I was at Graves-end—I knew Barnett s face before—I dare say I might have seen him once or twice—I cannot say where but his countenance was familiar to me—the way I came to be a witness was I was speaking to Mr Wood within two minutes after the robbery—I had never seen Thomas Rush before that day—I have not seen him again till now—I can speak to him with certainty because I stood watching them JOHNSON DOBELL re-examined I took Thomas Rush in Arbour-square—his brother John Rush was with him in conversation—my brother officer and I afterwards went to

at twelve o clock to dine—he does not generally leave at one—he is not compelled to leave—I do not recollect any one else who was there—there must have been a dozen—the greater part of them might be persons I do not see every day perhaps they only come to do a job—Turner and Williams are regular visitors—I had one other regular visitor but he left soon after Rush came in—I was not cooking the

that he was not the man I saw—I went to the police-station on the Monday night following saw Anderson there and recognized him to be the man Anderson Q In what way did the person pass you A I can hardly say I rather think on the banister side—they are narrow stairs—you rushed past me and I rather think you pushed me against the wall—I think I observed you for fully two seconds because you seemed to be puzzled how to pass me—I think I saw you for three seconds for I saw your dress and remarked all that you had on—you had on an open dark frock-coat a black satin stock or handkerchief and I think a dark waistcoat—I told the policeman that the young man I saw had black eyes dark hair small features and was between twenty-three and twenty-four years of age—I cannot tell how many persons in private clothes there were at the Police-court when I saw you—I saw a good many there—some were in a separate place—you were inside there—when I came in I turned to the left right opposite that place—I came with the policeman and some of my own familythe policeman told me that the person who was taken would be shown to me—he did not say upon what evidence he had taken you—I believe it was from my description—he said he thought he knew who you were—the inspector asked me if you were the man and I said Yes to the best of my belief —I looked at you afterwards you were very differently dressed—I paused for some time because General Fleming had told me to be sure to look well before I said anything and I then said Yes that is the man —I did not contradict myself afterwards—it was just about eight o clock that I saw you in the house—I cannot say to a few minutes—it was not five minutes difference either way MARTHA GARDINER re-examined Anderson looks something like the last man I saw—I had not the same opportunity of seeing his face as I had the other s—I saw the boxes on the table about a quarter to seven o clock one at each side—that was the usual position in which they were kept Anderson Q Which man passed you first A Phillipson and you were close behind him—I saw your back as you were going out at the door—you both pushed me against the wall—I could not have held you JOSEPH WARD policeman E 128 I received information of this robbery—I know Anderson by the name of Alfred Fair—I heard he was wanting and went to a coffee-shop in Porter-street Leicester-square on Monday 20th Dec about eight o clock—it is about a mile and a half from Baker-street—I saw him there and asked him to come with me—he said yes he would go to any place with me—when we got outside the door he asked what it was for—I said for a robbery in Baker-street—he said If that is the case I am all right —I searched him and found on him two handkerchiefs three keys some lucifer-matches two knives and a bad halfpenny—they were the same ✗ort of luciser-matches as those in the box found on the rug—part of them are silent matches and part noisy—I tried one of the keys to the area-gate of No 11 Baker-street and found it would unlock it Anderson Q How long have you known me A About two years—I knew you by the name of Alfred Fair when you lived under the Star coffeeshop in Oxford-market—your mother told me that was your name—the superintendent asked me at the station who gave me information about you and I said a brother constable—I had not seen you since the day before we wanted you for horse-stealing at St Alban s—that is eighteen months ago last June—I knew you working in your own trade then—I have heard otherwise since from various police-constables one of whom is in Court now—I have heard that you have been in custody and convicted and resorted with thieves ELIZABETH MIDDLETON I am employed at a Berling wool-warehouse at 12 Baker-street On the night of the robbery about ten minutes to eight o clock I went from No 12 to No 10 and met two men—I passed them—I remained at No 10 about two minutes and as I was going back again I saw the same two men standing in the doorway of No 11—to the best of my belief the prisoners are the two men—one was taller than the other Anderson Q In what position were they standing A With their backs to the door—it was raining a little EDWARD FLEMING I am a Major-general in the army I know the contents of these boxes—one is my wife s and the other mine—they were kept one by the side of the other—I never saw them one on the other till my maid called my attention to them that night—I picked up the red handkerchief that has been spoken of in the bed-room—I gave it to the policeman Anderson Q Is there more than one family living in this house A Only my own that I know of—Mr Bright is a dressmaker and there are dressmakers that come to the bottom of the house—my bed-room door was unlocked—no one went into the room after we had washed our hands for dinner except the maid SARAH BRIGHT I am the wife of William Oliver Bright who keeps the house 11 Baker-street About eight o clock on the evening in question I heard a violent screaming and saw two men come quickly down the stairs—I did not see their faces—I have seen the boxes side by side on the table—I never saw them one on the other—I picked up some lucifers in the room—a young lady lives with us—she had not anything to do with the General s part of the house—no one uses these stairs but the General s family and mine the young lady does not only in the morning and evening—there are three other young persons who sleep in the house but they were all in another room at the time—they go up these stairs to go to their bed-room—the young persons were all in a back room at the time of the screaming and came forward at the time COURT Q If anybody went into your area could they go down some steps and get into the basement part on the house A Yes but there were two servants at the time in the kitchen and they must have seen any one if they came in at the area-door Anderson Q Can you prove that none of your young people had been up those stairs that evening A I can for I particularly inquired of them—they never go up of an evening—no one enters General Flemings bed-room not ever myself Phillipson s Defence On the night question I had been to Paddington being a tailor to a gentleman I worked for an army clothier and as I was coming down George-street in my way home I heard a cry of Sop thief I joined in the cry there were thirty or forty persons running a tall man crossed the road I stopped a female was running behind him and the policeman came up and laid hold of me I said It is not me it is the other man across the road he looked across and saw another man running they took me back to the house the lady says there were only three females there there were about twenty in the passage I am sure ten came out of the back parlour they searched me and found this bag on me I said I was a tailor and how I gor my living no keys or anything were found on me only a latch-key belonging to the house where I lodge there was a patent Bramah lock to the prosecutor s door which was taken off and brought to the policeoffice it is a lodging-house and dress-makers live in the house and they seemed to be there that evening the bed-room door was open and anybody was free to go up and down stairs no property was tied up or carried away only these things shifted a few inches it seems that that the servant had been in the room from six to eight dusting or preparing for the General to go to bed she might in her mistake have placed one box on the other to dust the table Anderson s Defence No one can prove how the persons got in no locks were broken on the night of the robbery from about five in the evening till nearly eleven I was in Mr Rowbotham s coffee-shop sitting reading the paper and talking to the landlord I went home at eleven and went to my work again in the morning and was backwards and forwards there till the Monday evening when I was apprehended WILLIAM ILLSLEY I am waiter to Mr Rowbotham who keeps a coffeeshop at 13 Porter-street Newport-market On 17th Dec the prisoner Anderson came there about a quarter-past six o clock—he remained there some considerable time—I went out on business about half-past six and came back at a quarter-past seven—he was there then and remained there about an hour and a half after Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Is this the Mr Rowbotham who kept the Finish A Yes—it is a night house—Mr Rowbotham was in bed at the time—he goes to bed in the day time and gets up at night—Mr Rowbotham was up—Anderson uses our house occasionally—he was taken into custody there—I am confident this was on Friday 17th Dec —he was there every night—there were two or three customers in the room besides—I do not know their names—I cannot say what time any of them came in or went away—I have not said that I went out at six and did not see him again that night—I did not swear so at the Marylebone police-court—I do not recollect it—it some time ago—I do not know whether the other customers were thieves—I am not aware that out house is frequented by thieves—it is a night house—I am the waiter—I do not wait night and day—I go to bed when it is most convenient—I did not go to bed at all that night—I cannot say what the other persons were having JOHN BURROWS policeman D 119 I produce a certificate of Anderson s former conviction— read—Convicted April 1847 and confined six months I was

his property MR PARRY conducted the Prosecution ELIZA BUTLER I am the wife of Charles Butler of 75 Brandon-street Lock s-fields in the parish of Newington—we keep an ale and beer-shop On Saturday evening 16th Dec about a quarter or ten minutes past seven o clock I went into my bed-room which is the front room on the first-floor to make the bed—there are two chests of drawers in that room rn one of which my husband always keeps his money—it is a small drawer and is always kept loeked—it was to all appearance safe as usual at that time and the window quite shut—it had not been opened that day—it is a small sash-window with a catch at the side—I did not notice whether that catch was up or down at the time—I came down stairs and in about twenty or twenty-five minutes a little girl named Sarah Ann Sharp came and told me something—I immediately took a light and ran up to my bed-room—I could not get in—I called same men to vay assistance and afterwards got in—I found a chaif had been placed between the clothes-stool and the drawers to prevent my getting in—the window-sash was thrown np to the top the drawers broken open and the money gone—I do not know what amount there was in the drawer—I was never accustomed to go to it—I saw nothing of the prisoner that evening—I had seen him between ten and eleven o clock in the morning—there is a ledge over the bar-window and under the bed-room window upon which a person could stand and so get into the bed-room CHARLES BUTLER I keep this beer-shop and deal in second-hand carriages About nine o clock on the morning of 16th Dec I went to the drawer in the bed-room where I kept my money—I found it correct as far as I knew the same as I had left it overnight—there were nine sovereigns and a half loose and a bag containing fifty sovereigns—I did not open that that morning and had not counted the money for a fortnight or three weeks—I had not counted ray notes for a goodish bit but when my man brought me notes home 1 put them into my pocket-book along with the rest—I believe the money I then had was 255l in notes fifty sovereigns in the bag nine sovereigns and a half four half-crowns and a crown-piece—I went oat at ten o clock that morning and returned about eight or nine in the evening a little tipsy and found the room in the state Mrs Butler has described the drawer broken open and the money gone FANNY WHITE I am the wife of William White of 22 Brandon-street nearly opposite Mr Butler s and am a milliner On Saturday evening 16th Dec about half-past seven o clock I was going from the Kent-road to my own house and had occasion to pass Mr Butler s on the opposite side of the way—I saw a man looking out of the bed-room window which was wide open—I was then eight or ten yards off—I looked at him and I believe he saw me for he drew back into the room—I saw another man on the pavement under the window with an umbrella—it was raining—I had an umbrella up leaning over my right shoulder—I heard the man under the window say Damme be quick —the man then came forward to the window again and jumped out into the street—whether he jumped from the window or first stepped on the ledge I cannot tell—I had not an opportunity of seeing his face fully the first time the second time I saw it perfectly—the prisoner is the man—I had very frequently seen him before at Mr Butler s where I was in the habit of going twice a day for my beer—I never spoke to him and did not know his name—in the summer-time he was generally sitting on a form outside the bar-window—there is a gaslight in the bar-window that threw a light up towards the first-floor quite sufficient for me to see the man and when he jumped down the man with the umbrella first ran the prisoner followed him round the corner—I immediately went in and described the man to Mrs Butler—when the prisoner alighted on the ground I was not more than two yards from him—I was crossing the road and I stood still when he jumped by the side of a chaise-cart—I have not the slightest doubt the prisoner is the person Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You are not in the habit of doubting much about anything are you A I have not had anything to doubt about if I had any I would say so—my husband is a milkman—the umbrella I had was a cotton one and rather large and I had two loaves under my arm—I cannot exactly say when I had seen the prisoner last—I had been ill for nearly eight weeks after my confinement and my doctor ordered me not to take beer so I have not been to the house for some time—I was taken ill on 1st Nov —it could not have been many days before that that I saw him because I was in the habit of seeing him daily—I am sure I have seen him since the summer but I did not know where he lived—he used to be in company with a stout man—I knew that stout man by sight for I had to take home some dresses to a person at 25 Charles-street Lock s-fields and this stout man opened the door to roe which made me notice him particularly afterwards—I have seen him sitting with the prisoner before that and afterwards also—I did not know his name either—the prisoner used to wear a hat on this night he had a black shiny cap on like oilskin I cannot say whether it had a front to it—it was not over his face—it seemed on the crown of hit head—it was a darkish night—there was no light except from the bar-parlour—I am certain that the shutters of the bar-parlour were down—I saw a little girl in advance of me I do not know her name the was nearer to Mr Butler s house than I was—she gave the first alarm—the next time I saw the prisoner was on the Wednesday morning following the 19th at the station—the sergeant came after me and told me he had got the man—he did not point him out to me—I was sent into the room—there were several men there—I was sent in to recognise the man that I had been in the habit of seeing at Mr Butler s and I knew him in a minute—I cannot tell how he was dressed no more than the cap—I saw his features very clearly—the light was thrown upon his face from the barwindow which is a bowwindow—the gaslamp outside was not alight but the gas inside the window was and I saw the prisoner s features from that—it is a large window all glass—it is flat to the house not a bow—I did not notice the man s face the first time but the second time when he got out I saw it perfectly as he was getting out and at the window—those were the only opportunities I bad of seeing him—he had nothing on his face—his cap was on his head—I could see his face plainly—I did not notice whether he had whiskers—I had always seen him with whiskers—I did not run alter him—I am timid and I immediately went in and told Mrs Butler COURT Q When have you seen him with whiskers A When he was sitting on the bench in the summer—I never saw him without whiskers till I saw him at the station—I always noticed bim particularly—he bad not very large whiskers—he generally had a stick in his hand—I did not observe whether he had whiskers when I saw him at the station but 1 felt perfectly sure he was the man WILLIAM SMITH policeman P 82 I was called to Butler s house on Saturday 16th Dec —I saw some marks on the leaden ledge outside the first-floor window apparently from shoe-nails—the ledge extends about eight inches from the wall over the bar-window—it is put to carry the wet off—it is level so that a person could stand on it and get from it in at the front window—a person could easily get from the ground to that ledge it is only six or seven feet high—it is a very low house you go down a step to get into it—if one man assisted another to get up of course it would be easier—I received from Mrs Butler a description of a person—I also received other information in consequence of which I sought for the prisoner—I bad seen him before but did not know his name—I went to 72 St Andrew s-road Kent-road and with other constables watched that house from two o clock on Sunday until Tuesday night 19th about nine when I saw the prisoner come into St Andrew s-road come along on the opposite side to where he lived and pass his house 72—after he had passed it four or five houses he crossed the road in a slanting direction went into an a venue or court leading into St George s-road about a dozen or eighteen steps then returned and went on the same side of the way as his house and just as he got to the door he coughed—he did not knock—the door was opened almost immediately and he went in—he remained there that night—I watched the whole of the night with two other constables—he was taken into custody next morning at half-past ten by Davis Cross-examined Q When did you first get information of the robbery A About eight o clock on the night it occurred—there were four or five policemen watching the prisoner s house at different times detectives and others—we kept a constant watch on the house—I saw some persons go in—I knew some of them they were followed when they came out—the premises were searched after he was taken and nothing found—he seemed to be living in a very humble way and to be poor—he has a wife and child and only occupied one room—other persons were living in the house MR PARRY Q Were you able to ascertain in any way how he got his living A Not at all—I made inquiries—I did not observe the light at Butler s on the Saturday night—from the light in the window you could discern a person above—a light is cast up the front of the house from the gas so that you can see the first-floor window very well—the bar-window is very large and the burner very strong COURT to CHARLES BUTLER Q How came you to keep so much money in your house A Because I do a little discounting—I sometimes have 400l or 500l in the bouse and sometimes not 50l —I have no banker—I never lost anything before—I am a coach-broker—I purchase carriages and coaches of all descriptions and lay out some hundreds of pounds in a twelvemonth MR BALLANTINE Q Have you ever said that from inquiries you had made you were quite satisfied the prisoner was not the man who committed the robbery A I am sure I do not know what I said—I was a little unsettled at the time I lost the money—I do not know that I had said anything to that effect—I do not remember whether I did or not—the gas lamp is close against the window it does not show a great light unless my wife turns it on strong—the prisoner has used my house six or seven months off and on—I did not know his name or address I am seldom at home—I go out of a morning and come home in the evening—I leave the beer business to my wife and attend Robinson s Dixon s and Tattersall s sales ELIZA BUTLER re-examined I cannot say how I turned on the gas this night—it does not show a great light except 1 turn it on to its extent which 1 rarely do SARAH ANN SHARP I live at 6 Rodney-place New Kent-road On Saturday evening 16th Sept I went to Mr Butler s for some beer for my mistress and as I was going out of the house with it I saw a roan jump from the window—there was a man underneath the window and I heard him say All right make haste or something of that sort—I directly ran in and said Mrs Butler there is a man jumped from your window —she went up stairs and 1 went away—I do not know who the man was—I took no notice of him Cross-examined Q Why A I do not know—it was a dark night—I had just come out of the door—I did not notice whether the tap-room shutters were shut but I am almost sure they were—I do not think there was any light shining out—the roan s face was not towards me—I did not see Mrs White—there was no light shining on the person as he jumped from the window—it was not possible for anybody to see his face—I know nothing of the prisoner—I have often seen him before at Mr Butler s—I did not notice what the man had on his head—he jumped out very quickly and went away as hard as he could JURY Q You do not remember whether any light shone out or not A There was a light from the bar-window—that did not reflect on the man—there was light enough for me to see there was a man—I did not know the prisoner s name or where he lived—I have been living in my present fifteen months and was in service before—I ate getting on for sixteen years old RICHARD DAVIS policeman P 55 I apprehended the prisoner—I found on him 1l 7s 6d told him what he was charged with—he asked whether Mr Boiler authorised me to take him or not—I said I staid not answer that question he must go to the station—I had authority to take him—the prosecutor s house is its the parish of St Mary Newinton CHARLES BUTLER re-examined I have seen the prisoner with whiskers—I saw him without them for a little while two or three months ago—on the night before ike robbery I saw him at my house aboout seven or eight—I was not tipsy—I had bad a little drop to drink—the prisoner called for two pints of beer and I drank part of it—he had no whiskers then—I do net know the numbers of any of my notes my man knew where he took some of them but he made inquiry and they did not know the numbers ELIZA BUTLER re-examined The prisoner used to have whiskers—the last time I saw them was two months ago—I never saw him without till I saw him at the statton—I had not seen him since the robbery—he was in the house on Friday night between eight and nine and on Saturday morning—I did not observe anything about whiskers then sometimes twice a day and sometimes twice a week GUILTY ** Aged 42— Transported for Ten Years Before Edward Bullock Esq

the rindows were shut and fastened and I left the front-door on the latch—no one could get in without a key—I was away about an hour—when I came back before I got to my house I noticed a light in my bed-room—I knew I had left no one in the house and I directly thought there were thieves in the house—I left my wife and tried to get in at the front-door with my key but could not succeed—I then went round to the back where there is a wall dividing my house from the sewer and I then saw a man who I believe was Strudwick attempting to get over the wall—I was within ten yards of him—he was getting from my premises—I called Police and for assistance from my neighbours and no one came—the man did not get over but went back again—I should say he could hear and see me—I next saw him in the custody of the police—I came round to the front again and found the door open—I went into my house and found the drawers open—the kitchen-door had been burst open and the cupboards and drawers all open—it appeared to me that the house bad been entered from the area-window—they had got down the area cut the glass and turned the sash-fastening—there was glass cut out large enough to admit two or three fingers and sufficient to turn the catch—I missed a watch a pair of sugar-tongs six spoons and a ring—I found some lucifer-matches Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINI Q The wall is at the back of the premises A Yes—I saw the front of the man—I believe Strudwick is the man—I am satisfied of it in my own mind—I saw him perhaps a minute or two—I saw his face—I was somewhat confused and excited—I had been running I stood still when I saw him—there was a gas-lamp just across the sewer by which I could see his face and it was a light evening MR ROBINSON Q How far off was the gas-light A Perhaps twenty yards or a little more—he could have got over the wall without any difficulty but seeing me he went back again EMMA WOLLEN I am the prosecutor s wife I came home with my husband on the evening

rushed out—I have no doubt whatever that be is the man—I touched him on the arm as he passed and said to some of the neighbours That is the thief pray hold him —he tried to escape over a fence in front of the house across the street—he was taken in endeavouring to get over—it is a fence enclosing ground for building upon and runs in front of about sixteen houses—I did not lose sight of the-man till he was taken Cross-examined Q Are you quite positive that you never lost sight of him A Quite—I am certain of him—I have not the least doubt in the world—I cannot tell whether he saw me as well as I saw him I should lay he was looking away from me trying to escape—his head was turned away from me—I am positive of him because I did not lose sight of him till he was taken—I am sure the same person who came out of the house was taken into custody—I am not sure of him by noticing his features—there were about a dozen people collected—the prisoner did not make his way through them—they were standing near the door the man did not pass among them—when he came out there were very few people they were not near enough to him when he came out for him to go among them before be got to the fence—when he came out he did not seem to know which way to go he first turned to the right then the other way and afterwards went to the fence and was taken there MR ROBINSON Q Did you see him taken

Strudwick—he ran and tried to jump over the railing Mr Farrington caught him—I had not lost sight of him at all—there was no one on the house-side of the paling but me Mrs Wollen and Mr Farrington—it is an iron railing that goes round the area—there is a row of houses of which this forms one-the railings run in front of all the houses—the fence where he was caught is another place—to get from Mr Wollen s to that fence you must cross over the road—Strudwick had crossed the road when he was taken Cross-examined Q Did you see him taken A Yes at the palings—they are not so far off the house as the width of this Court—there were no other people assembled opposite the door only us three I am quite sure of that—I do not know whether any others were standing looking on—I only noticed Dangerfield who caught Jackson—I was not at all agitated—I had an uninterrupted view of Strudwick he did not pass through any people whatever—he never went near anybody at all till he passed Mr Farrington—he went straight ahead when he came out of the door he did not stop at all he ran direct to the paling JAMES FARRINGTON I am a smith and lodge at Mrs Bickerton s On this night I went out with her and Mrs Wollen to the front door of Wollen s house and saw Strudwick come out—I was standing on the pave-ment about six yards from the house—he came towards me and then turned short and ran to the paling—I caught hold of him and held him—he had not been out of my sight from the time he came out of the house—there might have been three or four persons there—the paling is immediately opposite Wollen s house Cross-examined Q Then when he came out of the house be turned towards you A Yes I was standing at the right of the door—when he came close to me he turned back and went to the railing—he did not have to go through any people—there were not many people collected there were further on but not where he was running MR ROBINSON Q What did you do when he came towards you A I caught hold of him on the paling and threw him down—I was close after him JAUES ROGERS policeman A 288 I received charge of Strudwick in Besborough-place from a policeman of the B division—I took him to the station MR BALLANTINE called EDWARD STAINES I reside at I Dorset-street Vaux hall-bridge-road and am a button-maker in the employ of Mr Nutting of Regent-street West minster and have been so eleven years On the night of this burglary I was at the Besborough Arms—I heard a cry ran out and met the prisoner Strudwick in the middle of the road near the Besborough Arms which is in a turning on the right called Besborough-place opposite side to where Mr Wollen lives—Strudwick was going towards the prosecutor s house—I joined him and we both ran towards the house the cries proceeded from—when we got there there were between forty and fifty persons there running backwards and forwards—I cannot say whether there wore any persons near Wollen s door—the persons running appeared to be in pursuit of some one—I lost sight of Strudwick leaving him against some palings—I saw Jackson running and went in pursuit of him and received a blow on my arm from him with a life-preserver—I helped to take him with a gentleman whose name I do not know—I informed the police in which direction he ran aid the spoons were there found—I went before the Magistrate next day for the parpose of stating what I have now said and I was ordered to stand down by the Magistrate s clerk Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Do you know Strudwick A No I know him by sight not personally—I never spoke to him I swear that—I may have known him by sight these twelve months—I did speak to him when we were running together towards the prosecutor s house but not before—I was in the tap-room of the public-house drinking—I have seen Strudwick rowing on the water when I have been on the land and the people have said There goes Strudwick that is how I came to know him—directly he came up to me he said There are thieves —I said Yes and he raid Come and help me to pursue them and we went to the home—the Besborough Arms is between twenty and thirty yards from there it may he more I never measured it—it is in the same street—there are no houses opposite the prosecutor s but there are further down—that is the person that Jackson struck pointing to a Mr Miachell —Jackson was nearly opposite the public-house running towards the place I had left—he was three or four houses from the place—I did not meet him till after I left Strudwick—when I was coming from the paling he was in the road—I met him face to face—I was running to and fro about a minute or two in front of Wollen s house to see if I could see any of the thieves—I did not see anybody come out of the house—I heard the Cry of Stop thief in the Besborough Anns that was three or four minutes before I saw Jackson—I should think there were forty or fifty people there there might be more or less—I swear to the best of my belief there were thirty—they were right along the road from the Besborough Arms running all manner of ways up and down—me and Mr Dangerfield took Jackson into custody—I did not see Strudwick after that till he was at the station—I met him in the hands of the police before he arrived at the station—I did not then say to Mr Mitchell that I knew Strud-wick and that he was one of the biggest thieves in Westminster—I said nothing about him not a word—I only told him to come down to the station when I saw his head was bleeding—I swear I never mentioned Strudwickjs name to him—we walked together—we did not have much talk we only said it was a shame that they should use those things and cut people s heads open like that—I did not tell Mr Mitchell when I saw Strudwick in custody that he had been with me a short time before and it was very singular he should be taken into custody—I have never been in any trouble myself MR PARRY Q Was Mitchell s head bleeding A Yes he seemed to be suffering—I told him he had better go to the station—that was all I said to him COURT Q You only saw Jackson running A No I thought he was the thief because he had his coat and waistcoat open—he was three or four doors from Wollen s house—I left Strudwick at the paling—he said There are thieves I shall get over here and see if I can see them and I left him in the act of getting over—he had not got quite over he had his two hands up to lift himself up to look over—I directly ran among the crowd and did not see any more of him till he was in the hands of the police and then Jackson was in custody as well GEORGE SNEE I live at 4 Goodman s-green Westminster and am a carpenter On this night I was near the Besborough-gardens about 250 yards from Wollen s house and heard a cry of Thieves and Murder —I ran towards Besborough-place where the sound proceeded from—when I got to the Besborough Arms I saw Staines come out from there—I saw Strudwick standing in the road and saw Staines join him they proceeded in the direction of the prosecutor s house and I followed close behind—I saw Strudwick a minute or two and left him standing by the pales—a man ran out from the crowd and struck Staines on the arm—I was about twenty yards from Wollen s door at the time—Staines said What did you hit me for and then ran after him and took up a stone or brick to heave at him MR ROBINSON Q Did not you see Strudwick again A No—I have been at work for myself four years—I have seen Strudwick before and knew him so as to speak to him—I have known him about four years—I never went to a public-house with him nor with

am the daughter of James Mettam of the China Ship Hermitage-street in the parish of St George-in-the-East The prisoners had been several times to my father s house prior to 12th Dec —On 12th Dec they came accompanied by another person—Budd and the other person who has escaped came in first—it was about twelve o clock in the day—I was in the bar—they said Good morning Miss how is your father —I said Not very well he is not about —they said it was very cold and walked in and stood at the entrance of the bar-parlour which turns round to go up to the club-room on the first floor—they went up and I asked if they would like a fire—they said no they were not going to stop but they stopped and I ordered the servant to light a fire—the bedroom is on the same floor facing the club-room—the prisoners and the other man were all together when the conversation took place about lighting the fire—they went up-stairs together—my father was not about he was in the bedroom—they came down about a quarter before three—my father was still up-stairs—they had several pints of ale which I took up as the servant was engaged—when they came down they called for another pint of ale and while they were standing at the bar it was proposed to meet there that day week—they left about three o clock—after that having answered the parlour-bell I went in there and saw Hughes sitting there whom I had not seen come in but there is a back-way to our house the front-way is in one street and the back-way in another and going in once or twice I also saw the man who has escaped sitting opposite Hughes—Budd came in in about half an hour the front-way—he walked quickly by the bar and said Good afternoon Miss —he went into the parlour and called for a pint of porter which I supplied—as I had taken in the porter and got the money my father was coming down-stairs—the parlour-door was open—the persons in the parlour could see him come down—the parlour-door opens in the passage opposite the bar—some time after I went up-stairs to see whether the club-room fire was alight and as I came down I saw Budd and the one who has escaped walk up the passage as if they had come from the parlour-door—Hughes came out of the parlour and they all three went up-stairs saying We may as well go up and have another game — they had been playing from twelve till three at the bagatelle-board —immediately after they had gone up Hughes came down and asked for a glass of brandy-and-water—I said I would bring it up—he said Oh no I will take it up —I let him take it up—that was just before five o clock—my father keeps a desk in his bedroom—I had been there that morning about half-past eleven for a check—the desk was locked my father gave me the key to open it—I opened it locked it again and gave the key to my father—I did not take out any sovereigns—my attention was not called to the cash ELIZA BARBER I am servant to Mr Mettam On 12th Dec about five o clock I heard a noise which I thought was my master s bedroom-door opening or shutting—I went up and saw Hughes standing at the club-room door with a glass in his hand looking towards the bedroom-door—I came down and told my mistress Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q You did not see the bed-room door A No Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Did you see the club-room door A I could see it was wide open—it is opposite the stairs—the bed-room door turns to the left—I was about half-way on the stairs standing so as to see the club-room door not the bed-room I could not see that without going further up—the club-room door was behind Hughes s back SOPHIA METTAM I am the wife of James Mettam On receiving a communication from Barber I proceeded up-stairs about five o clock and saw Hughes on the landing—he handed me a glass and wished me to get it filled—I went down two or three steps out of sight and not hearing the footsteps of Hughes going into the club-room I went back and saw Budd in my bedroom and Hughes in the act of going in—he was not where he was when I took the glass from him he was nearer the bed-room door his face was towards the bed-room he was close to it and the bed-room door was open—I was terrified and went down-stairs—both the prisoners rushed after me down-stairs—there was another one but I did not see him when I went up he was in the bagatelle-room—he rushed down with the others and escaped—when they rushed down I seized Budd till assistance came—Hughes was standing very near Budd they were both in the passage—Budd gave a snatch or two to get out of my grasp—I said This man has been in my bed-room —Budd said Oh dear Madam you are mistaken —my husband then came up Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q It was dusk A Yes we have no gas-light on the stairs but there is gas at the bottom—I was about three steps from the upper landing when I saw Budd in the bed-room—he had the bed-room door in his hand—he was in the room—he immediately came down and Hughes too—Hughes did not ask me why I did not get him his brandy and water—the third man was playing bagatelle in the club-room—Budd and Hughes came down first and the third man must have come out of the room and followed them—I heard the balls goings when I was on the stairs—there was nobody in the club-room except the third man the balls must have been set going by him—he then rushed past me and mysteriously escaped—he did not at once escape I saw him afterwards up-stairs—I cannot say whether he rushed up again while I had hold of Budd—I was alarmed Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q At the time you took hold of Budd Hughes stood by A They both came down together—when I got to the bottom of the stairs I gave the alarm about a man being in my bed-room—the prisoners both rushed past me on the stairs—Hughes stood by a minute or two before any of the company came to my assistance—some persons in the passage came to my assistance—Hughes did not go away when I had hold of Budd—the doors were fastened in consequence of the alarm JAMES METTAM I am landlord of the China Ship On 12th Dec I was in bed till about four o clock—I had in my bed-room a desk—the key was in my pocket—I had eight sovereigns in it—I saw them safe about twelve o clock the day before—in the mean time I had only parted with the key to my daughter—after she had been to the desk she gave me the key again—when I got up I went to the desk and took a small box containing cash and notes down in my hand—there was no money in the desk but eight sovereigns which were together in a small hole in the desk—I left my room door shut but not locked—I went into my cellar in about twenty minutes and I heard my wife and daughter call—I came up as soon as I could—I found my wife contending with Budd—my pot-man had hold of Hughes—my wife was charging Budd with being in the bed-room—I said Gentlemen what have you been in my bed-room for walk into the parlour and let me go and see if I have lost anything —they said Let us go —I said Shut the doors lock and bolt them and don t let them go —I went to my bed-room found my desk unlocked and missed five sovereigns out of the eight from the pigeon-hole—when I returned and said I had lost some money and should detain them and send for a policeman they said We will fetch a policeman ourselves —I said Gentlemen I have done that already —there was very great scuffling and fighting with them with Budd in particular—there were many blows struck and a great deal of fighting—I heard the noise of glass breaking—Budd caught the action of our eyes and ran up-stairs—we ran after him to the club-room and he was jumping out of the window—he got out and was brought in again by the policeman—when we came down the third man was gone—Hughes was there—they could not get out of the parlour door Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Budd was brought back immediately A Yes—when I got up at four o clock I went to get my cash-box—I did not see my sovereigns then—I had not given change for any check or note the day before—I gave a 5l note for some silver—five sovereigns were brought down first and I took them up again—the sovereigns had been in the desk very likely a fortnight—my daughter is not in the habit of going and getting change for me without my knowledge—sometimes they send a check in and I send her to get money not my wife—I mean to swear that on the day before when my daughter brought down five sovereigns and I took them up again I counted the whole eight sovereigns I took them in my hand—my daughter did not ask me for the key she took it out of my trowsers pocket—I recollect locking the desk when I went down that day JOHN WARREN I was pot-boy to Mr Mettam I was there on 12th Dec I heard Mrs Mettam call out—I ran up to the bar and she had got hold of Budd by the collar—Hughes said It is all right let us go —Mr Mettam came up and said Go into the parlour —the doors were bolted directly—Budd unbolted the top bolt of one door but not the other—he laid hold of me and lifted me up and I picked up a skeleton-key—I was then down and Budd on the top of me—there is a door in the passage with panes of glass in it—I heard a noise which I thought was the glass breaking and found under me this bunch of skeleton-keys in the spot where Budd and I had been and I picked up this piece of candle THOMAS KELLY police-sergeant H 2 I was at the station on 12th Dec when the prisoners were brought there—I told Budd he was charged with stealing money from the desk in Mr Mettam s bed-room—he said it was false he was an honest hardworking man—I asked where he lived—he said I shan t tell you —I asked Hughes he said his wife was in the family-way and he was afraid his telling me would frighten her—I received these keys—these two locked and unlocked the desk in the bed-room BUDD— GUILTY Aged 32 — HUGHES—

having been before convicted MESSRS BODKIN and ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution THOMAS FRANCIS I am in the employment of Messrs Chapman of Brentford-end Isleworth market-gardeners I had charge of their fruit-room which is a building a little way from the house and is part of the premises I was there on the morning of 25th Dec about eight or nine o clock—there were some pears there—I went again next morning about eight or nine and missed four or five bushels of pears—the door appeared to have been opened by an iron instrument it was forced open—it was safe the day before—the pears were of

produce a sample which I brought from home CHARLES CHAPMAN I am in partnership with my brother as marketgardeners in the parish of Isleworth On 26th Dec I received information about my pears being lost—on 15th Jan I accompanied inspector Brown to Mr Pullen s in Farringdon-market where some pears where shown me—to the best of my belief they were part of the pears I had lost—the value of those I lost was at least 15l they were of three different kinds and those I saw at Mr Pullen s were of the same three kinds—my fruit-room a shed erected in the yard against the garden wall it is enclosed within the premises Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Do you know of these pears having been on your premises or were you only told it A I know it from having seen them for some months—I had last seen them about a fortnight before—I have ascertained that they are missing—the price of these pears is well known to dealers—the price I put on them is not a high price—a person not acquainted with them might not suppose they were so valuable—a fruiterer would know they were worth that money if they came to market in their proper condition but if they were in a worse condition they would be reduced in value WILLIAM ROBERT PULLEN I am a fruiterer in Covent-garden and Farringdon-markets On 26th Dec between eight and nine o clock in the morning a person who I believe to be the prisoner came to my place and after looking at some apples outside asked me to purchase some pears—not thinking from his appearance that be had any worth purchasing I said No —he said You had better come out and look at them —I did so and they appeared in very bad condition on account of their being badly packed and the frost had taken them they were in fish baskets—I should say there was between three and four bushels—I said I would have nothing at all to do with them they were in so bad a state—be followed me into the shop and said Will you not bid me anything for them —he asked 4l —I said it was a sin to see such good things so badly packed for they were quite destroyed from the way in which they had been brought to London—after a time I said I would give him 30s if only a small portion of them came good—he said he would not take that—I said Well I will not give you more and if you leave the place for one moment I will not even give you that —he asked if I would give him 5s more—I said I cared so little about them that I did not care whether I had them or no—he said Well you shall have them —I paid him the 30s he brought the baskets in—when I was about to unpack them he said he would call another day for the baskets he did not call—Morgan my servant was present at the purchase—I sent him to take the man s name—these produced are some of the pears Cross-examined Q How many did you deliver up A I have all of them by me now I only sold about half-a-peck—I did not notice how the man was dressed—I was talking to him perhaps five or ten minutes—I could not swear whether he had a hat or cap on JOHN MORGAN I am assistant to Mr Pullen On 26th Dec I recollect a person coming it was the prisoner I have no doubt whatever about him—I was present at the purchase—in consequence of what my master said to me I went and looked at the name on the cart which the prisoner had with him and I put it down in a book—I have not got it here but it was James Clements general dealer Isleworth

the same ARCHIBALD REED I am a gun-maker and live at 13 Peerless-place and 19 Fountain-place City-road—this happened at 13 Peerless-place in the parish of Shoreditch—my man and a servant slept there—it was a new speculation On Monday 28th Jan I left that shop about three or four minutes before eleven in the evening—the guns and other things were then safe—I left my servant Charlotte Rhodes in charge of the shop—the door was shut when I went out and I heard it bolted and locked and I tried it afterwards—next morning in consequence of information I went there again a little after seven—I

to identify them all Prisoner Q How is the room situated where the servant sleeps A The servant sleeps in the top room—it is very nearly thirty yards from the shop door to the staircase leading up-stairs—the window was plate-glass and a panel of plate-glass in the door—one of the shutters was wrenched off and they had got through the plate-glass into the shop—there are two rooms in the house besides the shop—the shopman sleeps on the first floor which is very likely thirty-five yards from the shop and the girl above—the guns were standing not more than two feet from the window CHARLOTTE RHODES I am servant to Mr Reed I slept at 13 Peerless-place on the night of the robbery—John Stevens the man also slept on the premises—my master left the shop about eleven o clock—I closed the door after him—it was bolted and the shop shutters secured—I heard the man go to his room after I had gone to mine—I came down stairs in the morning about seven o clock saw the door of the shop wide open and the glass of the door on the floor—I went and called the man and then went and gave information to my master—the glass was taken out room enough I think for a boy to get through—I missed some guns and pistols from the window Prisoner Q How far do you suppose is the distance from the shop to the staircase that leads up to your bed-room A I think about twenty yards—I sleep at the top of the house JAMES HAWKINS policeman G 191 On 29th Jan between eight and half-past eight o clock in the morning I went in company with William Curzon to 8 Charlotte-court Charlotte-street Shoreditch which is near half a mile from the prosecutor s house—I knocked at the door—it was answered by the prisoner—there are two rooms to the house one up-stairs and one down—I told him he must consider himself in custody on suspicion of stealing four pictures of Mr Royal of Old-street—I searched the house—nobody was in the house but the prisoner—in a cupboard under the stairs I found these ten guns and nine pistols—when I took the guns out the prisoner said You may as well have them all there are some pistols there and I then found the pistols—I asked him what account he gave of these—he said Ask me no questions for I shall not answer any —I then took him into custody—on our way to the station he said they were brought there by some other parties and had not been in his place above an hour Prisoner Q That you swear A I do—I believe the pictures that I called about had been stolen several days previous to my calling—I am not able to speak to the time—I cannot swear it was not three weeks WILLIAM CURZON policeman G 126 I went with Hawkins to the prisoner s house and saw him take the guns out of the cupboard—he turned round to the prisoner as he sat on a chair and the prisoner said You had not got a case before but you have got one now —Hawkins asked him how the guns came there—he said Don t ask me any questions for I shall not answer them Prisoner Q How were the guns taken to the station A I put them in an old quilt which came off the bed—I said We had better put them into something and you said There is an old quilt you can put them in —I went up and fetched it—you gate me permission to take it GEORGE MARSH policeman G 179 Mr Reed s shop is on my beat—about half-past six o clock in the morning of 20th Jan I tried the shop door and saw that it was fast and the window was correct at that time—shortly after seven I saw that the shutter was taken away and the pane of glass forced into the shop—I was not informed then what had happened not till I came round again at a quarter to eight when Mrs Reed told me Prisoner Q Where is the policeman that gave evidence previous to you at the police-office you swore that the premises were safe at half-past eight o clock Witness I did not I did not discover what had happened until a quarter to eight JAMES HAWKINS re-examined There were three other parties taken into custody for being concerned with the prisoner—two were remanded for a week and there was a constable who gave evidence of having seen two of these men standing by Mr Reed s door that morning—they were discharged—the prosecutor s house is in the parish of St Leonard Shoreditch Prisoner s Defence The evidence of the policeman is very different to what it was at the police-court it appears to me to be impossible for the property to have been obtained by violence and therefore they must have been assisted in obtaining it by the parties in possession the policeman s evidence is that the premises were safe at quarter-past six o clock in the morning an hour when we may presume servants are on the alert the sound of footsteps would be heard and it is certainly monstrous to suppose that such a daring act could have been committed the breaking of the shutter and

inmates the policeman who is not here passed the premises from half-past six to half-past seven and the premises were perfectly safe Curzon at first said he called at my house at half-past seven and found the property Now to account for the property in my lower room I let my room to two young men about twenty years of age on this morning one a carpenter and the other a cooper I had seen them before in the neighbourhood but did not know them The court in which I lived was principally occupied by persons making use of one room as a workshop The two parties I let my room to I presume must have been in this affair and by whom I have been made a dupe whether they took my room with a guilty knowledge of this robbery being about to be committed and with the intention of removing the property to their room I cannot say but about half an hour before the policeman came I heard the door below opened and shut quickly consequently I now conclude that the two parties had the property and being hotly pursued by the police to save themselves rushed in left the property and immediately decamped I was in bed when the policeman called GUILTY on 2nd Count Aged 46 — Transported for

1st June—I asked Wilmot whose the duplicates were—he said they were his—I said Whose watch is this the duplicate of —he said it was his—I found this other watch and chain on Smith—he claimed them Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Where was Smith A He was in the room—I think he was in the act of putting his coat on—he had just got up apparently—he offered me the eighteen sovereigns at the station-house—the inspector was there the prosecutor was not—I dare say the gaoler was there—he said You may keep them —I do not think he said it loud enough for other persons to hear—the marks that I fitted this chisel to were on the drawers—any chisel of this size would make the same sized mark but this chisel has notches in it—you may get 500 chisels not exactly notched like this COURT Q Have you any doubt on comparing the marks on the drawers with this chisel that they were made by this instrument A Not the least JAMES BROWN policeman 142 F I went with Thompson to the prisoner s lodging—I searched between the mattress and the bed on which Wilmot was lying—I found thirteen sovereigns seven shillings in silver and this watch and chain which were claimed by Wilmot—I found in Wilmot s fob-pocket this banker s deposit receipt for 30l in the London and Westminster Bank on the 11th June Cross-examined by MR COCKLE Q Did you see any woman at the prisoner s place A Yes a female who represented herself as the wife of Wilmot THOMAS DAVIDSON I am clerk in the London and Westminster Bank in Holborn—I know this receipt it is my writing—the prisoners came on the 11th June and deposited 30l in sovereigns they were together—I believe it was Wilmot deposited the sovereigns—he gave the name of George Greenwood Chambers No 7 Sackville-street WALTER HOLMES policeman F 50 I

O BRIEN conducted the Prosecution ELIZABETH BRIND I am servant to Mr William Henry Carey of Tyron s-place Hackney On Monday evening 7th Oct about half-past six o clock I met the prisoner about a yard from the carriage-house door in the street—I met one man first and then the prisoner and another man—I passed close by the side of them and had a good opportunity of observing them—they were walking very slowly—I went in-doors and about half-past seven I was putting my master s children to bed on the second-floor and my attention was attracted by the opening of our bed-room window which is the adjoining room—it is in front of the house and the window looks into the street over the stable—I did not think anything further of it till I left the room at a quarter to eight when I found the window and door wide open and a chair placed against the door—I shut the window and door and went down to my mistress s room on the first-floor—the door of that room was shut—I did not know whether it was fastened and I listened—I heard a rusting of paper and concluded it was my mistress and did not attempt to open the door—as I left the room I was met by one of the young ladies who requested me to get something from the room I said some one was there—she said Mamma is not there and we rushed down-stairs got the cook and she burst the room open and I saw the prisoner there with a lighted candle in the room—I had a full opportunity of seeing him—I have no doubt he is the man—I never saw him before—we then rushed down-stairs and alarmed my mistress—I did not return for three-quarters of an hour and then found a crow-bar and several matches on the bed and some in the room—on examining the premises I should say the entry had been effected over the stable and at the attic window—the prisoner was about three yards from the stable when I met him at a quarter-past six—I gave a description of the prisoner to Clark the policeman—on the following Friday morning I went with my master into Pearson-steet and saw the prisoner there and recognised him—Clark was walking behind in case I should give information as to the man I saw—if I saw the man I was to give a signal Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Where had you and the constable met A In Pearson-street nearly two hours before—I was not walking at my master s side two hours—we went to a baker s shop and waited there—Clark was in plain clothes he told us we might see somebody who he suspected—he did not tell me what the person was like I was to find out that—I told him what the person was like and he said he thought he had got the man and if we waited we should see him and if I saw the man in walking down the street I was to put my parasol over my right shoulder and I did so it was down when I did that—I was not looking at him ten minutes I did it directly I saw him but I had some distance to walk—I saw his face and had a regular look at him a good stare—I had been in Pearson-street two mornings with the parasol my master and Clarke—I had not placed my parasol over my shoulder before—Clark had not showed me any one else—I did not know the name of the man I was to be shown or hear any account of him from Clark—when I saw him on the Monday he wore a hat and rather a light handkerchief—I have not seen either of the others since—I think I should know the one that was by the prisoner s side—they looked very hard at me and I looked at them too because I thought it was somebody who had been to the house—they were coming in a direction from the house—it was about ten minutes to eight o clock when I saw the prisoner in my mistress s bedroom—he then had no hat on and was standing at the left side of the bed—I do not know whether he had came from under the bed I have not said so—I did not wait very long to look at him—the cook saw a man but she was in the act of looking round to see what she had done to the door she might have seen him if she looked but she did not look enough—I went into the room—she did not take any walks with the parasol and the policeman—she is not here she has not been shown the prisoner because she did not see his face she did not see any part of him that I am aware of MR O BRIEN Q What else did you see A I saw the plate-chest on the bed—my master delivered the crowbar to the policeman—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man I saw in the bedroom COURT Q Had you seen the attic window shut before A Yes I shut it myself at half-past six WILLIAM HENRY CAREY I live at Tyron s-place in the parish of St John Hackney On 7th Oct I returned home about half-past nine o clock and in consequence of information I immediately examined the plate-chest which was kept at the entrance of the bedroom—my wife kept the key of it —I found it lying on the bed wrenched open and missed a dozen silver dessert-spoons some forks knives tea-spoons a milk-pot three boxes of children s silver spoons a punch-ladle and a fish-slice and from the dressing table drawer I missed a lady s gold chain two brooches a steel bracelet a gold purse and another purse altogether worth about 60l —I had seen the chest safe in the morning—it is my dwelling-house RICHARD CLARK policeman N 223 On 7th Oct I received information of this robbery and received a description from Brind in consequence of which on Friday morning the 11th I met Mr Carey in Pearson-street at half-past seven o clock— I had also met him on the Thursday —we remained there until about a quarter to ten—I saw the prisoner coming up Pearson-street—I called Mr Carey and the servant from up-stairs at the baker s shop into the street—I told Mr Carey there was a man going down the street of the description and on a signal from the servant I went up and she pointed out the man to me—I took him into custody told him the charge and he said he knew nothing of it—I afterwards went to his lodging No 70 Pearson-street searched them and found nothing Cross-examined Q You found nothing A Not relating to the robbery—I took from his person 5s and some Berlin wool in a little box—it turned out to be the work of his wife—I called out to the servant Here is a man coming up the street answering the description you gave me —she then came down stairs with her master—that was about sixty yards from the man—she had a full opportunity of seeing him after she came out of the shop—I remained at the shop door and she and Mr Carey went on—I remained where I was till the signal which was Mr Carey laying his cane on his right shoulder—that was the only signal agreed on—I then went and the prisoner was given into custody—Brind was in the room when I arranged the signal with Mr Carey—I think she must have heard it MR O BRIEN Q Where was he when he was given into custody A In a chandler s shop—I think he was there when the signal was gives—I could not see him—I had seen him going towards the shop DANIEL STROUD I am potman at the Dolphin public-house at Hackney On the evening of 7th Oct I was in Wells-street which is 150 yards from Mr Carey s and saw a person getting away from Mr Carey s over the wall from the back premises—I asked him if he was coming over that way—he said Yes —he turned his face from me I could not catch his features—he ran away and was quickly out of sight—I believe the prisoner is the man—he had on a frock coat and dark trousers and a hat Cross-examined Q Was it not a dark night A Yes—when I find saw him he was in a stooping position—I never had a full view of his face and have very slender grounds for my belief GEORGE PULLFORD policeman N 289 I produce a crowbar which I received from Mr Carey s house The prisoner s statement before the Magistrate was here read I am quite innocent the witnesses must be mistaken I can call witnesses at my trial to state where I was from five o clock till a few minutes after eight on that night MR BALLANTINE called the following Witnesses WILLIAM CHESTER I keep a beer-shop at 9 Ayre-street Bethnal-green and know the prisoner as a customer On 7th Oct he was at my house from four o clock to half-past eight—I was in the same room with him the best part of the time—he had on a sort of greenish coat and a pair of trowsers striped down—my mother who is here supplied him with some tea—I was in the habit of seeing him twice a week or so Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Do you know where Mr Carey lives A No I live about a mile and a half or two miles from the beginning of Hackney parish—I heard last Thursday that the prisoner was taken—I do not recollect the day of the month but am sure it was this day week—I and my wife serve at my house and my mother occasionally—I have no servant—I cannot say when the prisoner was at my shop last before that—he calls in once or twice a week—he was sitting in the parlour all the time with Thomas Buckmaster who is here—I was not in the room all the time—I went into the bar to have my tea—I served the prisoner with four or five pints of ale—I looked at the clock when he came in—there was no one in the house at the time and the clock is right before my eyes—I do not look at the clock when every customer comes in—I looked at the clock when he went out—I did not write down the time—I never saw Buckmaster with him before I believe he is an entire stranger to the prisoner he is a customer of mine and I know he was never a friend of the prisoner s—Buckmaster had a pint of beer about three in the afternoon and my wife may have served him with something else—he and the prisoner were not drinking together or sitting together—the glass might have been handed round—they were not talking together—Buckmaster was there from three till eleven I did not look at the clock when he came in or when he went out—another young man of the name of William Fipos who lives nearly opposite me came in while they were there he is here—he was not long in the house—he is in and out a dozen or twenty times a day—he was there twice while the prisoner was there somewhere about five and somewhere about seven I cannot gay to a minute—he is an entire stranger to the prisoner—he did not remain any time in the parlour—he was in and out just a minute to say Mr Chester will you oblige me with change —he came at five for change for a shilling—he had no beer at seven—I cannot say whether it was for change for a shilling or a half-crown—he is a loom broker for weavers—the prisoner had tea at six—I know the time because I take my meals at one regular time and be had tea at the same time as us—he came out of the parlour stood at the bar and my mother handed it over the bar to him—there was no one there but my mother my wife and myself—Buckmaster was in the parlour—I should say it took him five minutes and he then went into the parlour again and had more ale—I was not out at all that evening MR BALLANTINE Q Did he drink the whole of the ale A He just handed Buckmaster a glass—he paid me for it JANE CHESTER I am the mother of William Chester and live with him at his beer-shop I was at home on 7th Oct that was Monday—I know the prisoner and saw him come to the house that day between four o clock and half after I am not quite certain as to a minute—I was in the bar at the time and he went in and had a pint of ale—he had some tea—we generally have tea at six and he had some—I gave it him and a slice of bread and butter—I was inside the bar and he outside—he went away from eight to half-past—I am sixty-eight years old Cross-examined Q Did you go into the parlour A Yes and carried ale in to the prisoner and when he left he was rather the worse for liquor—Mr Buckmaster and Fipos were there also—Fipos had a little ale and left about seven o clock—he had some between five and six I believe—I saw him come in—he was in the parlour while there sitting down and Buckmaster also—I think Buckmaster came between five and six or it might be more—he did not stop long because he had business to attend to—oh Buckmaster stopped till about eight or nine o clock he stopped rather lateish—I cannot say how long he remained—he was in the habit of stopping lateish—he did not come with Fipos—I saw him go out I cannot exactly say whether it was before or after the prisoner it might have been about the same time I cannot say exactly so many go in and out of our house—the prisoner was the first who came to the house and they came afterwards as they usually do of an evening—they came separately—Buck master I rather think came first—I cannot exactly say whether I went into the parlour while those three were sitting there—several strange people came in—we have no other room—between four o clock when Webb came and the time he left there might have been a dozen people besides Buck master and Fipos—the prisoner had his back towards the bar in the parlour—it is a small parlour—to the best of my belief Buckmaster and Fipos were on the other side—I did not hear any conversation between them—there were only the customers there that came to have a pint I cannot call to mind who they were—I heard about last Wednesday that the prisoner was taken up—he was taken on the 7th—some one came and said on the Wednesday that he was taken on the Monday—I suppose it is three Wednesdays ago I cannot exactly tell you the day—he was in the habit of coming to the shop now and then—he was not a regular customer but my son knew him—I have known him four or five months—he was there a day or two before he was taken and he has not been since the 10th—I last saw him on the 10th—that was the day that he and Buckmaster and Fipos were in the parlour MR BALLANTINE Q I think yon say it was the 10th you saw Buckmaster and Fipos and this man A Yes they were all there on the 10th—I am quite sure it was Monday THOMAS BUCKMASTER I am a knitting-needle manufacturer and know the house kept by Chester On Monday 7th Oct I was there before the prisoner came in—I am sure it was the 7th not the 10th—the prisoner came about four o clock—I remained till nigh twelve—I went up to a sing-song up-stairs—the prisoner left about half-past eight—the singing had then begun—he did not go up to it—I left the parlour about a quarter to nine—I saw the prisoner have tea about six—I first heard he had been taken last Monday week—I was applied to appear at the police-court and did so—I had not been acquainted with the prisoner—I had seen him there once or twice before Cross-examined Q Had yon ever spoken to him at all A Not to make any acquaintance I have said Good morning or Good afternoon —I never drank with him before—we did not have anything particular together that day—he had four or five pints of the best ale and I drank such a thing as two glasses of it—I was there when he came in—Fipos came in with him—he did not remain above a minute just looked into the door or so—he did not have anything to drink that I saw—he could have taken it without my seeing him at the bar but I do not expect that he could in the parlour—he did not sit down to my knowledge—I was there on the Wednesday—I cannot answer whether I saw Fipos there that day—I can t answer about Wednesday—I am there every evening after I have done work—I cannot exactly say what time I went on the Wednesday—it was three o clock that I went on the Monday—I noticed the time then because I was not at work that day—on the Wednesday I remained there till ten—I went that day in the evening it was dark but what time I cannot say—I work it 7 King-street for myself at making ivory and bone knitting-needles—I sell them to the Berlin-wool shops—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me barring seeing him once or twice there—I did not see him there on the Wednesday—there were several people there—on the Monday there was no one else besides Mr Fipos and Mr Chester—persons might have come in at the door without my seeing them but they did not sit down and have ale—Mr Chester was not there all the time he went out to serve his customers—when he was not serving them he was sitting with us and conversing with the prisoner part of the time—the prisoner did not leave the parlour at all above five minutes at the outside when he went to take tea and while he was there I went out and got a pint of porter—I had three pints and paid 2d for each pint as I had it—a great number of persons were up-stairs in the evening—I know the prisoner went at half-past eight because I went to the bar a short time after and saw the clock and went up-stairs and Mr Cheater told me he must go up and get the room ready—I saw the clock after the prisoner was gone WILLIAM FIPOS I live at 101 Ayre-street and am a weaver s loom broker On Monday 7th Oct I went to Mr Chester about a quarter to five to get change for a shilling and saw the prisoner there—I went in several times that evening up to seven o clock and aaw him there every time Croos-examined Q How long did you remain A Three minutes perhaps two minutes—I did not sit down—I think I had some drink the second time I went in—I might have sat down there but I cannot exactly say because I did not expect to be summoned up on such an occasion—I swear I did not remain there from five to seven talking to the prisoner—I think I spoke to him—I only knew him by seeing him in and out of the place—I did not know his name—I saw Buckmaster there I think he was sitting down and the landlord was there—I dare say there were four or five more but I do not know who they were except those persons—I will not swear there were not four or five there the second time—I go there daily and sometimes have a drop of ale—I do not know Tyron s-place Hackney—I heard of this robbery on the Thursday ISABELLA VANDERPANT I work with my sister and live at 70 Pearson-street where the prisoner lives I remember the night of Monday 7th Oct —I got home that night as the clock was striking nine—the prisoner let me in—he had a dark green coat on which he has now and a dark handkerchief—I do not know Tyron s-place Cross-examined Q Is your sister living with the prisoner A She lived at the same house she is not his wife—my sister was at home on this evening she is not here—besides us and the prisoner there is an old lady lives up-stairs and Mrs Sheene the landlady she is not here—I and my sister live in the back-parlour and the prisoner in the front—on this night I had been on a visit to 24 Feller-street which is five minutes walk from our house and left there at five minutes to nine—I know I was there about an hour because I looked at the clock when I went and when I came away—when I went it was five minutes to eight and I was not to be any longer than an hour COURT Q What is your sister A She works at crotchet work and is a single woman—no man lives with her—she is no connection of the prisoner s—Mrs Sheene has just been confined ELIZABETH BRIND examined by MR O BRIEN Pearson-street is half an hour s walk from my master s—I think the witness Fipos is the man I saw with the prisoner outside the gate on the evening of the robbery WILLIAM FIFOS re-examined by MR BALLANTINE I have heard what Brind says—I do not know where Tyron s place is—I was never out with the prisoner in my life and

Fox struggling with my son on the staircase—he was taken—some of my property was found on him and other at his feet which had been in my bed-room some in a box and some in a drawer—the box was locked and the door of my bed-room—those locks had been picked—the lock of the door was not injured the lock of the box was—the value of the property taken was 10l or 12l —I have a bagatelle-room up-stairs and my bed-room is up-stairs—the staircase divides them—the doors are opposite to each other—the rooms are on the same floor but not on the same level GEORGE BLONDELL I am the son of Thomas Blondell I remember the evening on which our house was robbed—on the morning of that day Fox and a female came to our house about twelve o clock—the female want up-stairs—Fox was on the stairs—they afterwards went into the parlour and had refreshment—I sent my sister up after the female—she was up-stairs a few minutes—on the evening of the same day I saw Holland about a quarter post seven at the bottom of the stairs—my mother told me to take him a biscuit which I did—I took the money back to the till and was attempting to go up-stairs when he stopped me and desired me to bring him a cigar—I declined that and told him to go to the bar and fetch it—I then went up-stairs to my father s bed-room and saw my sister waiting there for the key—I came down for the key and Holland was then gone—I went up-stairs with the key and I saw Fox coming out of my father s bedroom door—he tried to fall on me and to rush down stairs past me—I stopped him and we had a struggle—my father came out and Fox was secured—I have always been sure that Holland was the man I saw at the bottom of the stairs—it was dark but the passage was lighted with gas—I saw enough of his features to be sure of him—I saw him brought back two days afterwards and I recognised him instantly Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q You had never seen Holland before you saw him at the bottom of the stairs A No when I saw him next he was in custody brought by the officers—I had not been in the bagatelle-room that evening—I did not take notice whether there were many persons at the bar at the time this occurred—Holland did not go and get the cigar JAMES BIGG policeman A 435 I was sent for to the prosecutor s to take Fox—I found on him this chisel one skeleton key and a pair of bracelets which the prosecutor claimed JAMES SHIPLEY policeman G 73 I assisted in taking Fox—I saw this purse and miniature picked up near him—I picked up these eight skeleton keys near where he was standing GEORGE CABLE I am potboy at the Duke of Wellington public-house I saw Holland on the evening of the 8th of Oct playing at bagatelle in the club-room up-stairs opposite my master s bed-room—he came about seven o clock and staid till about half-past—there was a stout gentleman with him—about twenty minutes after seven Fox came and joined them—while they were all three there I took them two cigars—the stout man and Holland each took one—one of them asked Fox if he would take one and he said No —I had before served them with sixpenny-worth of brandy and water and sixpenny-worth of gin and water—Holland and the stout man had them—after I had served them with the cigars I went out and did not see then again—I saw Holland again on the Thursday following when Brannan brought him to the house—the room in which I had seen him was lighted—I saw enough of him to be sure he was one of the men—I knew him again directly he came in Cross-examined Q Had you seen him before A Yes once before playing at bagatelle—I did not know his name then—I heard him say his name at Worship-street—I was there when Holland and the stout man came in—they had the gin and water and brandy and water before Fox came—there was no one else there MARY ANN BLONDELL I am the prosecutor s wife—I was at home on the Tuesday evening of this robbery—I saw the prisoner Holland that evening on the stairs—he was coining down—it was about half-past seven o clock—when he got to the bottom he asked me to give him a biscuit—I told him to go to the bar to get it—he took some coppers out of his pocket and gave me a penny and told me to go—I told my son to give him a biscuit which he did—Holland then went up-stairs and I noticed a peculiar walk as he was going—he came down again and he asked both my son and my daughter for a cigar—they did not give him one—my daughter and son then went up-stairs and they met Fox—Holland was then gone I did not see him altogether above five minutes—I had such an opportunity of seeing him as to mark his features from the peculiar way he behaved—I saw him two days afterwards when the officer brought him I knew him but I did not recognise him immediately JAMES BRANNAN police-inspector In consequence of information I went on the 10th of Oct to the House of Detention at Clerkenwell—I found Holland in the turnkey s lodge—the turnkey was there also and he told me that Holland had come to see a man who was in custody of the name of Fox—Holland did not say anything to that—I told him he must consider himself in my custody for being concerned with another man in a robbery at the Duke of Wellington in Shoreditch the night before last—he said he knew nothing about it he knew Shoreditch very well but he did not know the Duke of Wellington—I asked him whether he would go to the station or to the prosecutor s—he chose to go to the prosecutor s and when he got there he was identified by three persons Cross-examined Q What time was it you went to Clerkenwell A Between twelve and one o clock—Holland gave me his address at the House of Detention at No 22 Vincent-street Bethnal-green—I said If you are not identified it will be in your way home to go to Shoreditch PETER FAIBBURN CLEPHAM I live at 257 Shoreditch five doors from the Duke of Wellington on the same side—according to my recollection I saw Holland on the night of the robbery from twenty minutes to half past seven o clock—he was coming out of the Duke of Wellington—a stout man had come out a few minutes before and when Holland came out they went by the side of the cabs and had a few minutes conversation—a day or two afterwards I was under the impression that I saw Holland passing by my door between the last witness and another officer—I believe he was the man—I had never seen him before Cross-examined Q You saw the stout man come out of the public-house A Yes prior to Holland coming out—I was standing at my door—the lamps were lighted—it was not a gloomy evening—I saw him next in company with the police—I did not know he was taken up I had heard it—when I saw him next he was at Worship-street—I believe he is the man HOLLAND— GUILTY Aged 45 — Transported for Seven Years

necklace and other articles value 5l 18s her property —2nd COUNT charging COOKE with receiving she having been before convicted MR RIBTONM conducted the Prosecution ESTHER FIGG I reside with my sister Mrs Getliffe at the British Queen George-street Hammersmith On Christmas-eve we went to bed about half-past twelve and before doing so we bolted and locked the doors and windows—on Christmas morning I was down about half-past seven—before getting up at about a quarter to seven I had heard footsteps in the prisoner Standen s room—there are four rooms on the floor—I sleep with my sister and the three children in the front room and Standen slept in the back—I can hear a tread in his room and the joists spring when they get out of bed in that room—there is a brick wall between the rooms—Standen was a lodger in the house and carries crockeryware for sale—his usual hour for getting up was about eight—when I got down-stairs I took hold of the strap of the front door that straps it back and the door opened—there is no lock it fastens by a bolt in the middle and another at the top they were drawn—I found the bar-door forced open and one leading to the bar-parlour the top part of which was locked on the previous evening and the key taken up-stairs—the bottom was bolted and the other door also—I found the bottom part broken open and the top still locked—I found the bar-parlour in confusion the cupboard forced open and from it I missed two silver table-spoons four silver labels four brooches three rings a shawl-pin two breast-pins a coral necklace three seals six shirt studs 1l 9s in silver and 11s in copper—I know Cooke and Lee—I had seen them at the house on Christmas-eve—I last saw them about eleven o clock together—Standen was in the room at the time but not with them—in the morning I found the passage-door leading from the bar out into the back yard still bolted in the inside and an outer ne also as I had left them—I found the kitchen and coal-cellar doors open and the kitchen window also which is a sliding window that is at the back of the house there is a grating to it and it seemed lifted up a little—supposing any one to have got in at that window they could have got to the bar but they must have forced the kitchen door which was bolted overnight on the inside of the passage outside the kitehen—my father who is 78 years old and unable to attend here also slept in the house a Mr Little a lodger the prisoner Standen and his son—Standen came down that morning about eight o clock—the kitchen door was open but I did not observe whether it had been forced Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Have you a particular recollection of having fastened the place on that night A Yes we were not particularly busy that evening—I cannot say how many people there were in the house between nine and twelve o clock—we have a pretty good business—there might have been thirty in the course of the evening in and out—Lee has used our house about a month MARIA GETLIFFE I am a widow and am the owner of the British Queen public-house On Christmas eve I went to bed a little after twelve o clock before doing so I examined the premises—I and my sister went up together—I fastened the front door and ray sister held the candle—it is secured by bolts—the prisoner had been drinking at the house that night but had left—I examined the other doors and they were all secure—on coming down in the morning and going to the bar-parlour I found everything in confusion and a number of articles taken away which I had seen safe the evening before—the only inmates of the house are my father my three children my sister myself Mr Little the prisoner Standen and his boy who I should think is ten or eleven years old Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Do you rent the house yourself A Yes it is my business not my father s—I was before the Magistrate but was not examined COURT Q How long has Standen been lodging with you A About seven months—he pays me 2s 6d a week for himself and boy—his boy used to work with him—he kept his stock of crockery in my scullery—he would not go through the kitchen to go there—I saw my sister fasten the kitchen door on this night I did not see it again till three o clock next day—my sister left the key in it and it was there next day—I did not see any signs of its having been broken open JOHN LITTLE I lodge with Mrs Getliffe—there are four doors open on to the landing and mine is a side room opposite Standen s it is a corner house—there is only one floor—on the morning of Christinas day before I got up I heard footsteps come up-stairs and there was a sort of slight stumble nearly at the top of the stairs as I imagined—it was not daylight—I cannot say which way they went—about half an hour after I heard Mrs Getliffe s room unlocked and heard her sister as I supposed go down-stairs—I know Standen and Cooke but not much of Lee—I saw Cooke and Standen in the tap-room on Christmas-eve together drinking and Lee was at the further corner behind the door—the last I saw of Lee was about eleven when I went to bed—I saw Cooke take a pot or part of a pot of porter over to Lee and ask him to drink Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Were there twenty people there A No there might be a dozen Cross-examined by MR ADDISON Q How long were you in the tap-room A Two or three hours—people were coming in and going out all the time—there was drinking going on Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Did it not strike you as a suspicious thing when you heard the footsteps A It did after I heard Mrs Getliffe s door unlocked—I think the person had no shoes on—I thought the potman Axtell who slept with Standen might have been down-stairs and was coming up again—I did not know that he was out that night—I drank with a Mr Appleford that night I do not recollect drinking with any one else—I have not been charged with letting any one into the house JAMES AXTELL I am potman at the British Queen On Christmas-eve I shut up the house and about ten minutes past twelve o clock went out with Mr Appleford—all the parties who had been drinking there had left except Standen who slept in the house—Mrs Getliffe and her sister saw me out and Standen came to the door and said if I knocked at his window he would come and let me in and if not he would light my fires in the morning—Cooke came out at the same time but I did not notice which way he went—Lee had left a quarter of an hour before—I generally sleep with Standen—I left Mr Appleford at hull-past two came home found the front-door fastened and I went round to the skittle-ground and knocked at Standen s window with a clothes prop—I did not get any answer—I went into the skittle-ground fastened the door opened a truss of straw and lay on it and covered myself with a meal sack—I saw the kitchen window but I did not examine it—I must have seen it if it had been slided back—when I got up in the morning at a quarter-past seven the iron grating was raised up a little—I must have seen that if it had been so at night—I then tapped at the window as I had done before and Standen looked out and said he was getting up—Mrs Getliffe unbolted the back-door and let me in—on the evening before Cooke went across the tap-room to Lee who was sitting behind the door and asked him to drink—they talked and sat down together Cross-examined by MR ADDISON Q You went out at midnight to spend an hour or two with Mr Appleford A Yes I do not usually commence my visits at that time—it is the only time I have been out for two years—Appleford is independent—he has had some property lately left him by his father—his wife is a laundress—before he got the property he had been away from home some time—I do not know what that was for I never inquired—I visited no one but him that night—I remained with him having toast and ale till half-past two o clock—I know the time by seeing the clock in his house—he lives within five doors of the British Queen Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q How long were you having toast and ale A From ten minutes past twelve o clock till half-past two—I stopped till the ale was out but I did not keep on drinking—we had two pots of ale between me Appleford his wife and mother-in-law—I had been sitting all the evening at the British Queen drinking with Appleford and attending to my business—I was not the worse for liquor at all—I never slept in the skittle-ground before—I lived at the house seven years before Mrs Getliffe came there and I never saw this grating moved up before—I had to climb over a stone coping to get into the skittle-ground—I did not try the back-door or the windows I had shut them myself before I went out—Mr Appleford is not here—Standen s window is ten or twelve feet from the ground MR RIBTON Q Were you drunk or sober that evening A Sober I had my mistress s leave to go out—I have been out once before when the house was shut up I stayed with a Mr Smith that night and came home in the morning—when I came home on this morning I saw that the back-door was closed—I was about a yard from it and standing alongside the grating COURT Q When did you ask leave to go out A Ten minutes before I went—I was not aware I was going till Appleford asked me—he said to me in the tap-room You may as well go home with me and spend the evening and we will take some toast and ale home —Standen and Cooke were then present but Lee was gone—when I tapped at Standen s window I called out Jack but I received no answer—I only called once and knocked one single knock with the clothes -prop against the sash—I thought it was no use taking more pains to wake him I had knocked loud enough JOHN JENNINGS I live at 9 George-street Hammersmith I know the prisoners Standen and Cooke—about ten days before Christmas or it might be a day or two before that I went to the British Queen for my supper beer between eight and nine o clock and saw Standen and Cooke outside the door in the street and heard Standen say to Cooke She takes the cash-box up-stairs every night Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Did you not tell anybody about it A Not till after the robbery—I do not know Lee—I know Axtell—I have not had any talk with him about the robbery no one has been to me about it—when I heard Mrs Getliffe had been robbed I just mentioned what I had heard and one of the police afterwards came to me—it was a darkish night that I heard this said Cross-examined by MR ADDISON Q When was it you first gave any evidence of this kind A Last Saturday evening—I am a shoemaker and have lived twenty years in the same house—I swear I heard the word cash-box it was not box simply—I did not know what it meant—I heard the house had been robbed on the day after but I did not mention it till the Tuesday after—I went to the house on Christmas-day about one o clock and saw the policeman there—I did not mention it then but I did on the Thursday—when I said Tuesday I thought Christmasday was Sunday—I was subpoenaed to the police-court on Saturday JOHN AYRE police-sergeant T 2 On Christmas-day about ten minutes past eight o clock I went to the British Queen and received information that there had been a robbery—I examined the premises—I found the front door had not been forced but the bar doors had—one sash of the kitchen window was slided back and an iron grating outside very slightly removed—the inside of it next the house was fixed between bricks and remained in its former position—that might have been moved from the inside—it is a little window area—it had not been moved half far enough for a man to get in—there were some ashes and cinders and a piece of wood projecting over the grating and they must have been moved to admit any one—I apprehended Cooke in George-street about a quarter-past nine took him to his house and searched it but found nothing relating to the robbery—I searched it again on the 27th and in the yard under some ashes and rubbish I found two silver table-spoons four silver spirit-labels two brooches three shirt-studs three rings one shawl-pin and five skeleton-keys produced —I apprehended Lee on Christmas-day at his house 2 Plantation-place and in his room found this chisel produced which corresponds with marks I had found on the bar doors at Mrs Getliffe s and the chisel is bent—Mrs Getliffe s house is in Hammersmith parish Cross-examined by MR ADDISON Q Did you go into Cooke s yard on Christmas-day A Yes but I did not search it—the yard is directly at the back of the house and there are many houses round about it is in a row—there are no houses at the back—there are two females also live in the house—I should think it is 200 or 300 yards from the British Queen—I do not think I went to the house on the Thursday—there is a partition between the yards—you can get from one to the other by getting over the walls COURT Q How many houses are there A About twelve—the walls are four or five feet high—I have been upwards of seven years in the police and two years a sergeant—I laid the chisel into the impression in the wood—that mark was in the door in front of the bar—it did not correspond with those in the bar-door—the first thing I did was to put it into the mark and it exactly fitted—I laid it in the mark was not very deep—I am quite sure I did not make it fit the mark I mean the breadth fitted—I believe the only persons in Lee s house are his father mother and himself—none of the keys I found opened the bar-doors—there is no key to the front door MARIA GETLIFFE re-examined These articles produced are all mine—the spoons are marked R G which are the initials of my late husband—I had them before I went to the British Queen and am certain they are mine—my father slept over the bar—there is a box in Standen s room but it is not his own—I am in the habit of carrying my cash-box up-stairs EDWARD SCOTNEY policeman T 21 I produce a certificate— read—Central Criminal Court January 1848 David Cooke convicted of burglary having been before

t18510407-945  945 ALEXANDER WARDROBE and BENJAMIN LEWITT feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Adam Uriah Bryant Meakin and stealing 12 saucepans and 225 tin plates value 5l 8s his property —2nd COUNT for receiving the same both having been before convicted of felony MR MEW conducted the Prosecution FREDERICK DIBON I am an apprentice to Mr Meakin a tin-worker he lives at 27 Tun bridge-place New-road hit shop is in Lemon-tree-yard Bedford bury On Thursday night 6th March I locked up the shop—I was the last there—I came out with the men about eight or nine o clock—I cannot fix the time nearer than that—seven is the usual time for shut ting the shop—it was later that evening—I returned to the shop between seven and half-past next morning and found it had been broken open—the side window was broken open and the counting-house door also—I sent for an officer—I know the prisoners—they have both been workmen of my masters—Lewitt was at this time but Wardrobe had left ADAM URIAH BRYANT MEAKIN On Friday morning about a quarter to eight o clock Dibon fetched me from my private residence to the shop—I found the shop had been broken into and the counting-house window broken open—I searched and missed a doieu saucepans from the manuquantity factory and a quantity of tin plates from the warehouse besides a great of tea-kettles and other articles— looking at some saucepans produced these are my property—my figures are inside this one—I put them on myself—it is impossible to tell how much I have lost—I have missed as much as 5l -worth—Lewitt was working with me at the time—I had taken Wardrobe into my employ about six weeks or two months previous to the robbery—he worked with me about a week and was then discharged Cross-examined by MR W J PAYNE Q How long had Lewitt been in your employ about twelve months A Longer than that—I had a partner named Joseph Boyle—he is not so now—he is interested in the business but is not a partner—he has 300l in the business and is paid a salary of 150l a year—he has no per centage upon the amount of goods sold—I have lived in Bedfordbury about six months—before that I lived at 30 Francis-street Tottenham-court-road for about nine months—before that I lived for about eighteen months close to the same premises—Lewitt was paid every Saturday—he was paid by piece work—I have never told him or the other men to take some of the goods instead of paying them money—I swear that—I had not on this day told Lewitt that he might take some of these saucepans away in order to pay himself nothing of the sort—I do not know a person named Winter—I had no person of that name in my service to my knowledge—I have always gone by the name of Meakin that is my proper name—I never went by the name of Bryant as my surname—Meakin was my father s name—I succeeded an uncle named Bryant in the business Wardrobe Q Did not I work the whole of last summer for you A Yes but you were discharged—I took you on again for a week—it is not true that I only paid you money twice while you were with me—I did not tell you if you would come back you should have your money twice a week Wednesday and Saturday as I had a partner named Moody who had plenty of money—I have brought the wages book with me so that it may be seen that you received your money regularly as well as the other men EDMOND SMITH I am a broker and live at 21 Lumley-court St Martin s-lane On Thursday evening 6th March about eight o clock the two prisoners came to my shop to sell eight saucepans—these produced are part of them—I paid Lewitt for them WILLIAM SIMMONS I am a marin—store dealer and live at 7 Bedford bury within four or five doors of Mr Meakin s shop On Thursday evening 6th March between eight and nine I was at a public-house opposite and saw Wardrobe offering two saucepans for sale—I bought this one of him JOHN MACKNESS TUCK policeman F 101 I took the prisoners into custody on Friday evening 7tb March about half-past nine in Upper St Martin s-lane—they were together—I told Lewitt he was suspected of breaking into Mr Meakin s shop in Bedfordbury—he said he knew nothing about it DOMINIC CORR police-sergeant F 15 I was with Smith and took Wardrobe into custody—I said it was proper I should tell him on what charge I had taken him he immediately replied I don t want to hear it I don t want to know anything about it you know your duty and I know mine you don t want me or expect me to say any thing to criminate myself —I said that I should tell him and he interrupted me and did not want to hear it—in going along the other constable had Lewitt a short distance in advance and Wardrobe cried out to him Have nothing to say to that fellow mind what you are about —he had been drinking but was sober—since the prisoners were committed from information I received I have subpoenaed another witness a cabman THOMAS RUMBOLD I am a caiman On Friday 7th March about one o clock in the night I was on the rank in Bedford-street Covent-garden about 150 yards from Bedfordbury—the prisoners hired me and ordeied me to the corner of George-street New-road and from there to 46 Crescent-street Euston-square—I left them there—they had with them from fifteen to twenty tea kettles and a quantity of plate tin which they took into the house in Crescent-street—I did not know the prisoners before—I am positive they are the men Wardrob Q Are you positive it was me A Yes I am sure of both of you Wardrobe s Defence On 6th March I was at work for a person named Field a tin-worker Lewitt called on me and said If you are not comfortably situated you can come and work for Mr Meakin and now we have money on Saturday night and goods in the week but if you have goods in the week you must pay master for them on Saturday night because be does not let his partner know it I went and met him at dinner-time and had a pint of porter with him I stood two or three pints he said he would go over and see Mr Meakin he did not suppose be should get any money but he should get some goods he had some on Tuesday but in an unfinished state and was obliged to take less he went several times and Mr Meakin said he should not have them till the evening in the evening he brought them I was sitting there having tone porter one of the witnesses Simmonds caught hold of one saucepan sod looked at it and I being in a muddled state said I will sell you that one cheap and he bought it Lewitt said he wished I had sold the lot he sold the other eight I got the worse for liquor and went home and was in bed by eleven o clock as far as regards anything else I am totally innocent GEORGE WINTER I am a tin-plate worker—I have been in the employ of Mr Meakin three weeks—I am not in his employ now I left about five weeks ago after the robbery About twelve o clock on the previous night to Mr Meakin s place being broken open Lewitt came up into the shop to me and said Mr Meakin had no money but he was to have the eight tin quart-saucepans that were in the shop and about a quarter to five Lewitt took them out of the shop—I believe that to be the time—it is the general practice in the shop for the men to have goods instead of their wages—I have had them myself—I know nothing about the shop being broken open between eight and nine—I only know that the saucepans were taken out about a quarter to five—I saw Lewitt take them out while all the men in the shop were at work—the witness Dibon was not there—the other apprentice was—Dibon was down-stairs I was up in the workshop when I saw Lewitt take the saucepans—they were underneath one of the benches—I do not know who put them there—they were pot there I suppose because they were unfinished—they were unfinished when they were taken away—I saw Lewitt take them away out of the workshop—pretty well all the men were at work at the time—there was a young man named Charley Rayner and a young man they eall St Andrew—I do not know his other name—I had only been there a short time three weeks —I scarcely knew their names—those are the only names I can tell you—I did not see Wardrobe at all on the occasion Cross-examined by MR MEW Q How long had you been living with Mr Meakin A I had been there rather more than a fortnight then—I was with him three weeks altogether—there were eleven men at work in the shop—there is nobody else on the premises—the goods are generally kept down-stairs in the warehouse but these saucepans being unfinished were up in the shop—I call these saucepans those produced unfinished—they look like the saucepans that Lewitt took—they have every appearance of it COURT Q Are those unfinished saucepans A Yes they want the handles in front of them—they were all of one size that were taken out of the shop— Dominic Corr the police-sergeant here stated We have produced nine eight of one size and one of another MR MEW Q How many saucepans were left in the shop after these went out A None at all these were all that were in the shop—I am quite sure there were no saucepans left—Lewitt took the saucepans out of the shop while all the eleven men were there—they must all have seen him—I took away nothing at that time—but the day before I and the others in the shop had two tea-kettles each all the men in the shop—I cannot say how many tea-kettles were then left—they were kept down-stairs in the warehouse—they wanted money the same as I did and Mr Meakin said he could not let us have any money—I went and sold my two kettles for 8d a piece and they were charged 1s each to us—I cannot say who I sold them to it was over Blackfriars-bridge—I cannot tell the name—it was the first turning on the right over Blackfriars-bridge—the other men took theirs with mine—I cannot tell the name of the street it was a few doors up on the right-hand side Q In coming down from the workshop above must you go through the warehouse to go out at the door A No you are not obliged to go out at the warehouse COURT Q Then you got these two tea-kettles for 2s wages did you A Yes it is the general practice for the men to have them if they want anything in the week MR MEW Q And there are eleven other men who are all paid in the same way are there A Yes they take the 1s 4d for their 2s —they are obliged to put up with it—Mr Meakin did not give good wages—it is one of the worst shops I ever was in for price—he does not give as good wages as other persons—he pays 1s 4d instead of 2s even after reducing the wages to the lowest price—a person in going from the workshop would not necessarily pass through the warehouse to go out—he would come down one of the fly-stairs into the yard—the workmen generally went out through the yard—there are two ladders to go up to enter the workshop—we all went out together with a kettle in each hand one after the other all in a row—it was pouring with rain and we got wet through in the afternoon while we were going about trying to sell them—I cannot tell how many kettles a man can make in a day—there was only one man in the shop that made tea-kettles that was Lewitt—he could make two dozen in a day—it was about a quarter to five o clock when the men went away in this way—Mr Boyle and Mr Meakin were generally there in the day time—there was nobody in the yard—it was at a tin-plate shop that I sold the tea-kettles—they did not know me—I did not go in myself—I did not sell them—they were all sold together in one lot—it would not look well for us all to go in together all the twenty-two were in one lot—a young man they call Young Jack took them in—he left Mr Meakin before I left—he was called Jack in the shop—I do not know his other name—I stood out in the street while they were sold—Jack was dressed as a mechanic in a frock-coat—he was in a working dress—he did not tell us before be sold them that the shop-keeper had offared 8d a piece—we had told him to get 10d —we were so tired with walking about we were glad to take anything—we told him if he could to get 10d and if not to take as much as he could get—we came to that resolution in the street—we talked it over in the street before Jack went in at the foot of Blackfriars-bridge as we were going along—I was only with Mr Meakin three weeks and I have only had goods once myself but I have heard the men in the shop say it is a general practice they are often obliged to do it—the first week I was there I saw Charley Rayner go out with a footpan which he said be had bad for money—so he told me—I do not know where he sold it—the shop the kettles were sold at is in a street the first turning on the right over Black friars-bridge and I should say about twelve houses down—I do not recollect the name of the street—it is a tin-plate shop—I do not know that they make up their own goods—they sell tin piste goods—I was never there for myself—not at all—I believe the other men have been there—I left Mr Meakia about five weeks since just after this robbery—it might have been three days after—I heard of this robbery the next day—I left on the Saturday—I beard of the prisoners being taken into custody before I left the same day—Mr Meakin told me towards the evening—none of the other men left—yes I made a mistake young Jack left and did not come back any more I have not seen him since that I have been working for a person named Tipping a tin-plate worked at St Mary-at-hill—it is not a general practice in our trade to give a week s notice before we leave—the master generally sacks the men as he likes and it is at the men s option when they leave—I do not know the Dimes of any of the other men except Jack COURT Q Does Mr Meakin manage his own business A No Mr Boyle I believe—Mr Meakin gives out the work and takes it in and Mr Boyle pays the men their wages—I am not aware that Mr Meakin give out any work the day before the robbery but be generally gives the work out and Mr Boyle pays the wages on Saturday night—the work was given out just as the men wanted it there was no set time for it—I was making saucepans at the time the eight saucepans were taken—I did not make the ten-quart saucepans they had been at the shop before I was there—when men have goods for their money in the week it is generally entered in the book as money and Mr Boyle stops it as money it is not put down as goods—I received 6s 6d as wages when I left on the Saturday—I am quite sure I did not receive more MR MEW re-called FREDERICK DIBON There were some saucepans up-stairs when I shut up the shop on the Thursday evening I do not know how many I did not notice—I saw them there the last thing I am sure of that—I saw Lewitt go out that evening when I shut up with the other men he had no saucepans with him—my duty was all about the place—I cannot say whether Lewitt could have gone out with eight saucepans without my seeing him—there was no other way for him to go but through where I was—I was up in the shop with Lewitt—I cannot say whether I was seat out or not I was there in the evening—I know George Winter as a workman of my master s—I do not recollect his being there that day I cannot say be was not—the saucepans that I saw in the workshop were ten-quart MR MEAKIN re-examined I left the shop on Thursday evening about five o clock—I had not told Lewitt prior to that that he might take some of the saucepans—there is not a way out of the warehouse into the back-yard there are not two ways out—they cannot go out without being seen because the manufactory is above the warehouse and there is a ladder which goes from the floor of the warehouse and counting-house into the manufactory and they are obliged to descend this ladder to go out and pass the window of the counting-house—it was impossible for any person to have gone by at a quarter to five with these saucepans without my seeing them—I was in the counting-house at that time—the counting-house and warehouse are as one—Lewitt came to me that day for some money he did not have any—I told him if 6d would save his life I would not give it him for his conduct during the week—he had been drinking all the week—I did not authorize him to take anything—I left at five the evening before—I did not return after that—at the time I left the saucepans in question were up-stairs in the warehouse—there were a dozen—I am sure they were there when I left at five—I did not see Lewitt there—when I returned in the morning the dozen saucepans were all gone COURT Q Do you ever pay your men in tea-kettles A Never I never knew of their taking away twenty-two tea-kettles I had not the slightest idea of such a thing Lewitt I have got a bill here that will show that I was in the habit of having goods to a large amount handing in a paper Witness It was all money lent COURT Q Did you owe Lewitt any money at the time he asked you for it A Not any—this is not a bill of goods sold by me to the prisoner he may have had some few goods at times but that was for himself and charged to him which he has never paid me for—I went into the workshop before I left and am sure these dozen ten-quart saucepans were there—the prisoners did not come to work on the Saturday morning—there were about twenty-five kettles missing JAMES POSSEE policeman L 60 The first turning over Blackfrian-bridge on the right-hand side is Upper Ground-street—it is on my beat—I have been on that beat four and a half years—I know the street well—there is no

half-crowns 10 shillings 20 sixpences and 15 groats 892 yards of satinette and other goods value 590l his property MR COOPER conducted the Prosecution JOHN EDMUNDS I reside at 5 Fort-street in the Liberty of the Old Artillery-ground and am a silk-manufacturer On the night of 7th Feb I retired to bed about eleven o clock—the doors and windows were all fastened—the window on the staircase on the first-floor was shut but not fastened—I rose the next morning between seven and eight—the staircase window was open and the warehouse the drawers and other packet in great confusion—I missed a great quantity of goods eight pieces of black satinette worth about I 1l a piece and one piece of blue value about 1 1l —after a careful examination of this black satinette dress produced and comparing it with my usual goods I am deliberately of opinion that it is cut off from one of the pieces I had lost—I examined the shute the warp and the leasure and from that I firmly believe it was a piece taken from mine—I have no doubt of it in my own mind Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q IS this the dress A Yes I took it to pieces myself—I was about an hour looking at it—of course when it was first shown to me I had doubts—I said I most have it at home and carefully examine it —my son examined it with me—at the end of the hour my doubts entirely vanished—I manufacture these goods and sell them to wholesale warehouses four or five pieces of these in a week—those ware-houses sell them to other persons—my connections are rather extensive—I make 200 or 300 pieces in a year about 80 yards in one piece—all these pieces are as they come from the country and if anything is amiss in them I make a remark in my book and against one piece I find entered A great number of tight shoots and on examining this dress I find it corresponds with that and there is another mark which makes me almost quite sure it is it—the weaver who made this has been shooting three ends instead of two—this has the tight shoots and is shot with three ends instead of two ANN COOK I am servant to Mr Edmunds On the afternoon before this robbery I was standing near the staircase-window at a little after four o clock—I saw Arno on the other side of the way looking up at the window—I was very near the window I did not go quite close to the glass—I am quite sure he is the man—he then turned himself to the door of a public-house and appeared to me as if he called a person out—I could not hear what he said—a person who I believe was Langford came out and joined him—they entered into conversation for a few minutes both looking up at the window—I left them there when I went down—next morning about seven o clock I observed that window open—I afterwards went to Stepney station—I saw the officer—I was shown several men and picked out Langford Cross-examined by MR HUDDLEBTON Q Where was it you saw Arno afterwards was it before the Magistrate A Yes on another charge—I did not know he was going on the other charge—I did not expect to see the man but I had told Mr Edmunds he was a pale-looking young man—he told me the man whom be suspected was up at Guildhall on another charge—I saw the man brought up the stairs into the dock and as soon as he came up I said that was the man—the street is rather narrow and to look at the window he had to hold his face up—it was daylight—I was looking at him while he was opposite for about ten minutes and I went into the parlour and looked over the blind and saw him still standing there—I returned to the staircase and there he was standing looking again—I looked at him because I could not think what he wanted—I did not see him look at any other part of the house but this window—I have no doubt about him HARRIETT BULL I am single I now reside at 25 Orshard-row Stepney with my father I lived with the prisoner for or five years as his wife—his right name is Arno—I recollect his saying they were going to a silk drum I do not know who he meant—he came home and said the old man was not in the country yet—I do not know what day this was it was eleven or twelve weeks ago—about a fortnight or three weeks after that he asked me to come to Langford 8—on going there we found him in bed with his wife it was between seven and eight o clock in the morning—Arno said to Langford Arthur give Harriet sixteen yards of black satinette —Langford brought two sixteen yards from a table in the end of the room put them on a table in the middle of the room and tore them in two—Arno gave them to me and I carried them home—while we were there Langford s wife said she should like a dress of some blue silk but they said it was too well known she must not have it—when I took the two sixteen yards of black satinette home Arno offered one to a young girl that used to come there for 30s and she would not buy it—I had the other made up into a dress this is it—I afterwards gave it to Smith the policeman—I had to pay Arno 30s for it at four times—a young woman who is outside saw me pay him the money Cross-examined by MR PARRT Q Have you been advised to change your dress before you came as a witness here A No I have the same bonnet and shawl and the same dress that I had when I was at the Police-court—no one has said to me How could you get a silk dress or a satin dress by shirt-making —I had not a satin dress on when I was before the Grand Jury or at the Police-court—I had not a satin dress and a satin polka on—I had this bonnet and this boa on—the Grand Jury asked me how I came to get a silk dress out of shirt-making—this is the only silk dress I had—I never had but three charges against me in any part of the country—I have been in a public-house with the police and drank with them because the prisoner s sister and his companions have threatened my life wherever I have been—that is why I have drank with sergeant Smith—he has offered me a drop of ale once or twice he has paid for it—he has called on me once or twice at my father s—I have not drank with him at my father s—I hare not received any money—Arno s friends have offered me money to go out of the way and I would not do it—I have not received any for payment of expenses Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q Have you heard of any reward in this case A No I heard Arno read one once but I did not know what it was—he was passing a house and read the bill and said he would like to go and have the money—I cannot read I have forgotten it—the young woman that Arno offered one of the pieces of satinette for sale to used to come backwards and forwards—I do not know her name only Esther Q Was it not Esther Phillips A She has gone by that name that is not her right name I do not know her right name she is called other names—she did not live close by me—I lived at Bethnal-green and she lived at 9 White Horse-lane Stepney—she is the person that I gave the name of Esther Phillips to in the last case—she is the person I was with when I was fined 10s —I have seen her here to-day and been in her company—she was the person the prisoner offered the dress to—she saw me pay the first 10s it was all in shillings there were no sixpences—I paid it in my own room where I lived at Mrs Turner s between five and six o clock—no one else was present—Arno said he would get me a satin dress—I said nothing—I worked at shirts for the money I paid—I was to pay 30s and I paid 10s —I never worked at anything else but shirts—I worked for Mrs Glasscott at Bromley for years off and on—I have earned many 10s of her Q Did you earn that 10s from her A No I did not earn it from any one—I worked for Mrs Glasscott and had money from her several times COURT Q You said you earned that 10s by work A I worked at shirts several times—I did not work foe that 10s —I did not say I got that by working for her—if I have a right to tell I got it by thieving he made me do it—he has ill-used and beat me to go out thieving and bring him the money home he cannot deny it JAMES TONQUAT I am a weaver and live in Oakey-street I let downstairs room in my house to Langford—one morning I was coming out and I saw the prisoner Arno knocking at the door—I never knew him before—I did not see him go in—one day I was going up to my own place and saw Arno coming out of the street-door—I did not see him come out of the room—I never saw him and Langford go out together WILLIAM SMITH police-sergeant K 28 I received this gown from Harriet Bull Cross-examined Q Have you treated Bull to anything at any time A Yes she may have had a glass or two of ale to keep her out of the way of the prisoner s friends—I do not know Esther Phillips by that name—there is a girl outside whose name is Ann Smith I believe JURY to JOHN EDMUNDS Q Had you ever sold any satinette shot with three threads to any houses A Not that I am aware of not within the last year—my orders to the weavers are to shoot two ends—I dare say I may have sold pieces with tight shoots and three ends LANGFORD—

two bolts on each door—I let myself out at the front door which has a spring lock I am sure I shut it I pushed it with my hand—I took the key with me and left no one in the house—I returned in about twenty minutes and saw a light in my bedroom—I went to Mr M Crae next door and asked him to come with me—I do not know whether he went in I stopped in the garden and he went to the house—I went in about twenty minutes afterwards and found my clothes lying on the floor of my bedroom and a drawer broken open in which I kept the articles I have lost—I had seen them there that day they belonged to my son in law ANDREW M CRAE I am a draper and live at Stoneleigh-cottages next door to Mrs Lamb She came to my parlour window that evening about twenty minutes to 7 o clock—I went out and saw a light in her bedroom—I sent my wife for assistance to one place and my servant to another—I stayed there some time till assistance came—a noise was made outside and the light was put out—I went round to secure the two back doors and the back part of the house I stopped there some time and the door was tried to be opened from the inside and after that the light appeared at the window over the door and the curtain was pulled on one side and then there was a second attempt to open the door—my wife came round and told me something—I left two of the neighbours one at each door and went round in front and heard some one say Fire —I saw a poker between the doorpost and the door to force it open as it was being held—several stood outside the door but they heard Fire called inside gave way and a man came out and passed me then a second man came out who I seized it was the prisoner—he struck me with a poker over the right hand before I got hold of him—that was because I tried to get hold of the poker and then he struck me across the jaw—I retained him he had a crowbar or jemmy in his hand—next morning I found a skeleton key in the next door garden the police sergeant tried it to Mrs Lamb s door in my presence and it fitted—I found this jemmy produced just outside the front door Cross-examined by MR BALLAANTINE Q Am I to understand you never let go of the prisoner at all A Yes but he did not get away Green and other parties there had him as well—I seized him before anybody else I am quite sure of that—he was coming out of the house—Green was close handy—I am sure the prisoner is the person who came out—it was a dark night—I lost sight of the prisoner before he was given into custody because I went inside the house after he was secured by those I knew but I remember him perfectly well by his appearance—there were plenty of lights—I found no one in the house but there had been some one close by—the back part of the house was open and at the time the prisoner came out I saw a third party behind JAMESH GREEN I am private watchman to the Dowager Duchess of Northumberland and live at Isleworth On Sunday evening 17th Oct about 20 minutes to 7 o clock I was called by Mr Tutton of the Anchor Brewery—I followed him to Mrs Lamb s house—I was told there was some one there and I put my foot against the front door post and laid hold of the knocker—some young men laid hold of the door—I heard some one inside unlock the door and try to get out—I held on but some person got this poker produced between the door and the door post—I tried to get it back again—the man that had the poker in his hand said twice D—n your eyes shoot and as he said that the two young men who had hold of the door ran away—they were stronger inside than I was—they wrenched the door open and pulled the door towards them and two men rushed out—as they came out this poker which was in one of their hands poked me in the chest—I got one by his coat and the other by his collar—the first one got away—I held the second one by the collar till several persons sang out that he was a young man well respected and a neighbour and I let him go and assisted in taking another who was in the yard—the one I had by the coat and who got from me did not get away from the premises—somebody else stopped him and I helped to take him—the prisoner is the man—I am positive of it Cross-examined Q Did you catch hold of the person who had the poker A Yes I was the first person who caught hold of him—M Crae caught hold of him but not till I had let him go—we might hare both caught hold of him at one time—I was not at the back of the house at all—I kept hold of the prisoner s collar and the police came and took him from me—there were more laid hold of him than me one was a mason—the prisoner is the person whose coat tail I caught hold of—he wriggled himself away—a woman had hold of him when I went to her assistance—I may have lost sight of him while I had hold of the other by the collar I cannot say whether I did—when I caught hold of him again a woman had hold of him and soma men as well MR COOPER Q M Crae stood close to you when the men came out of the house A Yes I laid hold of the knocker with both hands and cannot say who was behind me but I suppose there were a score of people there—I believe the prisoner got six feet from me at the furthest MARY DART I live at the Mulberry Tree which is near Mrs Lamb s On Sunday evening 2nd Oct I heard a report and went to Mrs Lamb s it is a cottage with a small garden in front which is entered by a gate—as soon as I entered the gate I saw a man open the door from within with a candle in his hand he had a very long sharp nose—he closed the door—my husband called to two young men who were passing to hold the door so that they could not get out while he went round to the back—a short time afterwards I saw that the light was out and in a short time afterwards I saw it again—the door was then opened and the first person I saw was the prisoner and then another man and I fancied a woman—that was at the time the people were pulling as the door—the prisoner came out first that was the first time I had seen him—Mr M Crae and a roan named Green took him—directly the door opened they called out Shoot fire —the police came and the prisoner was given into custody—I entered Mrs Lamb s house and picked up a gold pin the house appeared a little disordered and I saw a large writing desk that had been broken open Cross-examined Q I understand the person you saw with the light was not the prisoner A No in the confusion I cannot exactly say who the other man who came out was but I saw them both together and I lost sight of the other but Mrs Hogg seized him and I took hold of him behind he said Let me go I am well known now is time for the police or I will see for the police and he got away—I was able to see the prisoner so as to say he is the man JAMESH CHANDLER policeman N 322 I received information went to Mrs Lamb s and found the

house which is a private house opposite they appeared to be in deep consultation and then two separated from the rest and rung the bell at Mr Moscrop s area gate they stood a little while there were no persons in the house they had gone to the Duke of Wellington s funeral I believe nobody answered the bell and the shortest of the men I believe unlocked the gate they both entered and went into the area they very soon returned and locked the gate after them—they then went to the front door which they forcibly opened they appeared to use some instrument and wrench it open and then went in and closed the door—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards I saw one man in dark clothes on the roof of the house he came and looked over—there were hundreds of persons at that time in pursuit of the thieves but they could not get in at the door—to the best of my belief the prisoners are the men I could not distinguish their features but I believe them to be them by their figures Baker Q You are not positive whether we are the men who descended into the area A I have no doubt in my own mind I saw your figures and that is quite sufficient I think—I saw men on the roof—I was at a bedroom window on the second story overlooking Mr Moscrop s premises—Mr Moscrop s house is four stories high the same height as the house I was in—there is a parapet on the roof of Mr Moscrop s

morning of the Duke of Wellington s funeral I left my house with no one in it but quite safe—there is a patent Chubb latch which fastens on being pulled and has a latch key-hole outside a person could open the door with a latchkey—there was no bolt shot—when I came borne I found the door had been forcibly opened by an instrument apparently forced into the door from the outside and prized open—these

master plasterer I was working for Mr Cox on some unfinished houses in St George s-square and saw Masters with a ladder coming along Lucas-street towards Mr Moscrop s which is at the corner of Lucas-street and St George s-square—I heard a trap door on the roof suddenly and saw Britton come out first and Baker followed him—Britton went across to the back to a chimney and Baker went round to the front I went to prevent them from getting down through the empty houses—I am sure of Baker I saw his face—I received this ring produced from William Little one of my work boys WILLIAM LITTLE I am a plasterer s boy under Mr Fulham I went on to the roof of an empty house about half-past 8 or 9 o clock and saw the prisoners both running away from No 22 on the roofs they both had their waistcoats

a bit of board and threw it into the street to attract attention—I returned and as I was getting over the wall I saw Britton by the trap door in the gutter and saw all the property lying in the gutter and on the roof I said Halloo my lad what are you about he said We have got them we have got them they have gone along this way —Baker was near him—they went along the roofs of nine houses saying We will watch them we will watch them —there was a blank wall and I said You cannot get down you must return back —about the third house from No 22 I picked up these skeleton keys produced and a thing like a shoemaker s awl—Britton said These are the keys —I said You are the men he said My good man don t say it was me do I look like a thief consider you have got sons of your own how would you like them to be transported and then he was taken GEORGE BAKER policeman A 251 I received charge of Britton from Masters—Baker was taken to the station by Mr Cox—I produce this property which I received

Aug I had occasion to send my servant into the cellar—up to that time the cellar was safe—I am not aware that there was any hole in the cellar—I had not been in the cellar for a month before—on 21st Aug I left London for the Isle of Wight—I returned on the 28th and was informed of the robbery—I went into my cellar and saw a hole and the whole of the wine was gone Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Do you live in the house A Yes—I have two servants and my wife—I left my cook in the house when I went into the country—I did not go in the cellar on the night of 17th Aug —the last time I went in the

is six feet but there is a projection in the house in Back-court—at the commencement of the hole in the cellar in Back-court I found an old Gothic arch—it had been partly filled with earth but there was a fourteen inch wall on Mr Burgh s side which had been broken through—the rest was filled up with soil—six or eight barrowsfull of earth would fill up the hole again COURT Q On the side of No 2 was there any excavation A The crown of the arch was a little above the ground I had to descend to go to it MR METCALFE Q Was there sufficient space for a fullgrown man to pass through the hole A Very nearly—some things had been thrown in Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Did you pass through the hole A I did—I went in at No 2 Back-court and came through to Mr Burgh s cellar—there are persons living

do not know the day I should say it was the 16th or 17th—I do not think it was on a Sunday—there was a hole dug in the brick wall down in the coal cellar of No 2 Back-court—I first observed it at 7 o clock in the morning—the fire wanted some coke on and I asked Hughes to let me down in the cellar for it—he said there was somebody down there tossing and he would not let me down for a long time—I did go down afterwards and saw Weeks and Hurley digging a hole in a part of the cellar which was as if there had been a fire-place—an arch place—they were digging with a poker and a shovel it looked as if it was but I did not stop I went to fetch some coke—I did not go down in the cellar again for two or three days afterwards—I did not look at it then—they were not digging then—no one was down there—I had seen them in the cellar two or three times before—they were down there they were doing nothing then—after I saw them digging I saw Hurley Weeks and Hughes bring some wine up under their coats from the cellar where the hole was dug—I do not know on what day it was—it was after I saw them digging—it was on the following night about 10 o clock—I saw Hurley Weeks and Hughes coming up the kitchen stairs and there was another one named Baker who took up wine as well as they but he is not here—he was over deputy—there was no wine kept by me or anybody living in the house in the cellar of No 2—I do not remember any wine being kept there all the time I was there—there were two or three empty bottles in the house—I saw them lying in the cupboard—I do not remember any broken bottles—I did not see any thrown out of the window—the rubbish that came out of the hole was chucked down in the cellar of the house No 1—you could get from one house to the other—I do not think there is any hole through the cellars from No 1 to No 2—the rubbish was rushes and mould Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Baker was the over deputy and you were the under deputy A Yes—I saw Weeks Hurley and Hughes in the cellar—I believe Weeks had the poker and the other a shovel or a spade—I believe what Weeks had was a poker as far as I could see—I went down in the cellar myself three or four days afterwards—I did not see a hole there then—the dirt was chucked over it—I saw the remains of a hole—I knew there was a hole I saw them digging it—I only remained there while I got the coke which was about five minutes—that was all I saw till I went again and saw it covered over—I saw the hole there still—I only went in twice from the time I saw the man with the poker digging till I left—there were a great many persons in No 1 and No 2—I had been acting deputy three weeks or a month before I left—a man named Boss appointed me to the office—my lather lives in Mile End-road—I left him because my mother-in-law was unkind—I left eighteen months ago—since then I have been bone picking and begging to get my living—I was lodging in Field-lane—I was sleeping in the school—the rest of my time I was

did not take me into custody—I did not drink any of the wine MR PULLEIN Q Were you allowed to go up and down in the cellar when you thought proper A Yes when coke was wanted Weeks He accuses me of being in the cellar with Hurley—at Guildhall he stated it was about half past 11 o clock and here he says 7 o clock in the morning Witness No I said 7 o clock—I did not say I saw you and Hurley come up without wine—I said I saw four Baker was one—I did not give any information some of them would nearly have killed me if I had MR PULLEIN Q How late did you sit up on the night you saw the wine brought up A I was up almost all nights and went to bed in the day—I remember Sailor Jem that is Hughes being shut up in the cellar for half or three quarters of an hour and they all said if he did not come up they would crab it—I mean by all these prisoners and some more men Baker as well COURT Q How long was Hughes stay in the cellar A Half an hour and Weeks and Hurley said if he did not come up they would crab it—it was for fear they should not get any more wine—I suppose they meant spoil it by telling somebody that they should not get away any more wine—it means to spoil it by telling somebody Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Where were they when that was said A In the kitchen—the kitchen was full of lodgers—there were twenty or thirty there—deputy Baker was there—the father was not there—he used so come for the money—Boss was there—I should know a great many that were there if I were to see them—I know some of their nicknames—the meaning of crab is that they would tell

Commodore Montagu-street Whitechapel—I have known the prisoner Young for some years by sight—I do not know anything of Ward—on Thursday 16th Dec I closed my house about 12 o clock or it might be a little after—the windows and doors were all safe—between 6 and 7 o clock next morning I was awoke by an unusual noise in the street and heard my son calling Father father —I looked out at my bedroom window and saw some of my neighbours somewhat excited looking down a passage which leads at the side of my house—I then went into the bedroom next mine from the window of which there is a view of the passage—I looked out and saw the prisoners struggling with Browning who lives next door to me he had hold of both of them—I saw Ward I believe but I cannot say which strike Browning at the back part of his neck—I saw Browning struggling with him and he tore his coat and shirt—I then proceeded downstairs and found the lock which fastens the bar-door had been taken off which was perfectly safe before—I found the till in the bar had been broken open and 2s or 3s taken out—I went into the parlour and found the two coats I have on now had been removed from off the pegs where I usually hang them and were lying on the sofa under where I had hung them—the parlour window which looks into the passage was open and my son and Browning were struggling with the prisoners outside—I jumped out and found Browning with Young he had on what they call a wide awake and I pulled it up and looked into his face Browning kept possession of him till the policeman came and he was given into custody—after the other prisoner s clothes were torn he ran away down the passage leading into Whitechapel and my son afterwards came back with him in the custody of an officer—I missed some rum and some spoons had been removed from their usual place and tied up in some paper—I cannot say I had seen them the night before but my servant says she did—I found the piece of the parlour shutter which laps over had been broken off and the shutters wrenched open with a jemmy—in running to the window I kicked against a hat which was in my way it was given to the policeman—the rum tap was left running but I cannot say whether any one had been to it and I had left a bottle of rum on the counter the night before that was partly emptied and when the prisoners were brought back they smelt of rum Cross-examined by MR THOMPSON Q I suppose if the tap had been out of repair it would leak A Yes but I take care they are not—when I pull my coats off I generally place them on the pegs I did that night and I have every reason to believe they were there but the servant might have pulled them down—I will not swear the coats were on the pegs—the spoons are not silver—the second window I looked at was right over where the prisoners were and in the struggle I had a full view of their faces for I should think half a minute—I can swear to Young being one of them because I pulled his hat off about the other there may be a doubt but I have no doubt in the world JOHN BROWNING I live in King s Head-court at the side of Mr Stainforth s—on the morning of 17th Dec about half-past 7 o clock I went outside my door with only my trowsers and boots on to see what time it was I looked towards Mr Stainforth s because if his house had been open I should have known it was near 8 o clock and saw the parlour shutters fly open and saw Ward jump out of the window—I opened my arms saying Holloa holloa and he ran into my arms before he got up to me Young jumped out at the same window—I am quite sure Ward is the man—I had him in my hands five minutes before I let him go—I struggled with them both and was hit in the back of my neck but I do not know who by—I thought I had better make sure of one than lose both and Ward tore his coat and got away—I held the other one till the officer came and I gave him to him—almost as soon as Young jumped out of the window Mr Stainforth s son jumped out also and I told him to follow Ward up and said he would be sure to know him as his shirt and waistcoat were all torn—shortly after I had given Young in custody Ward was brought back by the son and a policeman Cross-examined Q Did you see them both come out of the window A Yes I stated that before the Magistrate I said I saw Ward jump out followed by Young—Mr Stainforth has not rewarded me for this I have had nothing but porter from there and that I have paid for—the prisoners bad both been drinking but were not drunk—Ward had no coat when I first saw him and I or he tore his shirt right out of his trowsers—I did not notice Mr Stainforth at the window I could not look up—while we were struggling a blacksmith who lives in the court came up but he did not hold either of them—I do not know why he did not—it was twenty minutes before Ward was brought back—the prisoners smelt of liquor I should say it was rum it was not beer—it was not dark when I took the prisoners it was half past seven and there is a lamp just over where we were—I did not know the prisoners but I knew they did not belong to the house EDMOND JOHN STAINFORTH I am the prosecutor s son and live with him On the morning of 17th Dec I came downstairs about twenty minutes past 7 o clock as I was coming downstairs I heard a scuffle I ran into the parlour and saw Young getting out at the window which goes into King s Arms-court at the side of the house—I went out after him and found Browning struggling with him—I did not see Ward Browning told me where to go—I went after him and saw him turn up Greenfield-street I followed him and told a constable and he ran after him and I with him—the prisoner was running—I saw the policeman catch him and he was brought back to my father s—his shirt was all torn and he had no waistcoat on BENJAMIN FELCHEDER I live in Buxton-street Spitalfields About half-past 5 o clock on this morning I was passing the Old Commodore and saw the prisoners about ten yards from the door walking backwards and forwards—I am sure the prisoners are the same men—one of them but I cannot say which said it is most time now we should have open them b—shutters and that caused me to turn round and look—that was all I heard Cross-examined Q What were you doing A Going to work to Mr Gurder s close against Mr Stainforth s half a minute s walk off—it was about half past 5 or a quarter to 6 o clock I cannot say exactly—I generally get to work at half past 5 or a quarter to 6 o clock—Ward had a hat on but I did not notice whether he had a coat—I was examined before the Magistrate the next morning—I did not see anything of the struggle or the chase—I only come to speak to the conversation—I did not do anything I thought they wanted to get somebody up and when I saw Ward brought up the court I told my master that was one of the men I had seen that morning about ten yards from Mr Stainforth s door—our shop lies facing Mr Stainforth s—one part of the Old Commodore is close against our shop JOHN JACKSON policeman H 59 About half past 7 o clock on this morning I was on duty in Whitechapel and from information I received I went to King s Arms-court and found Young in the hands of Browning—I took him into custody—as I was going down the court towards the station he said It is all right old man let me go —I said I should not—I searched him but found nothing on him he was in liquor WILLIAM SAVAGE policeman H 212 Between 7 and 8 o clock on this morning I saw Mr Stainforth s son running and also the prisoner Ward—I ran after Ward and caught him—he said he had been fighting with half a dozen men and he had licked them and I had better not put my hands on him or he would lick me—his shirt was torn—I searched him and found nothing on him his pockets were inside out YOUNG— GUILTY †

t18560303-352  352 JOHN JONES JOHN WILLIAMS and RICHARD WILSON feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling house of John Faulkner and stealing 1 iron box 7 spoons and other articles value 20l his goods MR METCALFE conducted the Prosecution JOHN FAULKNER I live at No 3 Eden-grove Holloway On the morning of Christmas Day about a quarter past 10 o clock I left my house—I had locked the doors myself and the outer gate and the windows were all fast—I returned at half past 10 o clock at night—I came to the outer gate—I found it had been unlocked and was open—I went up the steps and put my key into the house door to unlock it—I found it had been unlocked and was left unlocked—I went in and found the back parlour and front parlour in confusion—the drawers had been broken open—I missed an iron safe from my bedroom—it had been safe in the morning and had deeds and papers in it—I missed seven silver spoons and some other articles—I found the house had been broken into by the front kitchen window and the window shutters had been forced back—my house is in the parish of St Mary Islington COURT Q Have you a garden in front A Yes twelve or thirteen feet deep—the window of the kitchen it level with the pavement—there is a sort of dip before it WILLIAM PITTMAN I live at No 1 Burnard-terrace Edengrove about 100 yards from Mr Faulkner On the morning of Christmas Day I saw a dog cart—a person was driving it backwards and forwards by my window—it was about half past 10 o clock—I think Wilson was the driver but I am not prepared to swear it—soon after the people had gone to Church I saw the cart coming back facing me and I saw three men Jones and two others—the cart was then coming back in the direction of the prosecutor s house and the three men were coming from the house to meet the cart—they were coming from the direction of the house—they were all dressed very respectably in black—there is a shut up house with two entrances and Jones placed his back against that door which was facing me—he was talking to the others—they all stopped facing my window as they seemed to come in a direction from Mr Faulkner s—I was shaving myself at my window opposite—the dog cart came to them and they had further conversation for ten minutes—there were then four men—the width of the street from my window is about twenty-five yards—the three men went towards the prosecutor s house—the dog cart waited a little time and then it went in the same direction and I saw no more—I went to the Thames police station to recognise Jones—I think that was on the Monday five or six days after Cross-examined by MR W J PAYNE Q How far is your house from Mr Faulkner s A I should think about 100 yards—I was at my window and a person came and stood with his back to the railings opposite me—he might see me if he looked—I do not know that he did—I laid my razor down when I saw the four men—there was only a half blind between us—I had never seen that person before—I saw him at the police court some days afterwards—he was in the cell with five or six or seven others—I was asked if I knew either of those prisoners—I said Yes that is one —the prosecutor took me there to see if I knew either of the men—it might be more than four or five days aftewards that I went—it was not so late as 20th Jan —it was a mouse coloured horse that was in the dog cart Cross-examined by MR DALEY Q Would you say it was a black hone that had been clipped A No I do not think it had—I have seen a mouse coloured horse that had not been clipped—I had one that turned mouse coloured—I had it six or seven years—it was born black and turned mouse coloured—I can undertake to say that the horse in the dog cart was not a bay horse MARY WITTINGHAM I live at Claremont-cottage exactly opposite Mr Faulkner On the morning of Christmas Day I saw a dog cart opposite Mr Faulkner s house—it was drawn up close to the kerb stone—it was about half past 11 o clock when I first saw it—there was one man sitting in it holding the reins and whip—I cannot tell who it was I did not see him face—I have no belief as to who it was—I saw Jones standing by the shaft of the cart with his face towards the horse—I had an opportunity of seeing him for the half hour they were there—I saw one man in the garden just by the side of the gate—when I first saw him he was going towards the kitchen window—I did not see anything particular after that till they opened the street door and came out bringing a chest—two men did that one had got one handle and the other the other—it appeared to be an iron chest—they placed it in the dog cart—one of them then returned up the steps and pulled the door just to—they then all four stood by the cart with their faces towards the cart—the man that had been in the cart had got out when they brought the chest outside the gate—they put the chest into the cart and then put themselves to rights and got into the cart—the man who had been in the cart holding the reins and whip got up behind and to the best of my belief it was Jones drove the cart away towards the Holloway road—I have since seen a cart at Hoxton and I should say that was decidedly the same cart that I saw on Christmas Day and I have every reason to believe the horse I saw was the same but he was in a different condition—he was very dark I should say nearly black—I do not recognise either of the other prisoners except that the back and shoulders of Wilson look like the man that sat in the cart—I said so at the police court Cross-examined by MR W J PAYNE Q Were you at the first floor window A Yes—I had never seen the persons who were by the dog cart before—I can see the four top panes of the prosecutor s kitchen window from my house—there is a box tree which prevents my seeing the lower part—I was watching them the whole time—I saw some one in the garden and I saw some men come out of the door—I expected there was something wrong but I was not aware that I could give them into custody on suspicion—I named it to my landlord but he had no faith in such a thing—he said it was impossible—I was examined before the Magistrate on 9th Feb and after that I saw these men at the police office—I should say the horse in the cart was dark brown or nearly black COURT Q Were you examined more tnan once A Yes—I only signed one deposition—I believe that was on 9th Feb —it was a long time after Christmas that I went to the police office—I was there the day that Mr Pitman went but he was there before me COURT to MR PITTMAN Q How soon afterwards did you see Jones again A I think the latter end of Jan —I think four or five days before I went before the Magistrate HARRIET GUTTERIDGE I am the wife of James Gutteridge and live at No 10 Burnard-terrace Eden-grove On the morning of Christmas Day between 11 and 12 o clock I passed Mr Faulkner s—I saw a dog cart standing at his door and Wilson was in it—I noticed him because he resembles a person I know very well I at first thought it was him—I saw a stout man at the head of the horse—I could not swear to the face of that man but I can to his figure—I had to wait at the corner of Cornwall-place for an omnibus—while I was standing there the dog cart passed me and there were then four men in it—I have seen the same dog cart since and the horse Cross-examined by MR DALEY Q You only saw Wilson once A I saw him twice—he was in the same seat in the back of the cart and his face resting on his hand—it is months ago since I saw the person who resembles him—it was before Christmas—when I saw Wilson the second time the horse was trotting—when I went to the police court Mrs Wittingham was with me—I had no particular reason for noticing Wilson except that he resembled a person Q Did you ever say that you noticed him because he was laughing A He was smiling and I thought he was smiling at the persons there—I heard him laugh which made me look at him and I saw he was like a man I knew—the man I know is about twentyfive he has little whiskers—his eyes are blue—when I got to the police court I believe the person with me said that the men had not got the same clothes on before I identified them—the policeman said they had some of the men in custody NATHAN GILBEBT policeman M 215 I know all the prisoners by sight—they are companions—I have seen them together—on Christmas Day I saw them all three about 10 o clock in the morning—I saw Jones and Wilson in Mr Perry s yard—he is a livery stable keeper in Swan-street Trinity-street in the Borough—Jones came out and went up Trinity-street he afterwards came back and just as He came back Wilson drove the dog cart with a black horse out of Mr Perry s yard—he went into Swan-street and Jones got up into the cart—they drove to Stone s End and into Blackman-street then Williams got up in the cart and they all drove away together—I have since seen the cart at Mr Perry s—it was the same cart that I saw driven out THOMAS RICHARDS I was a serjeant of the M division and am superannuated—I have known all the prisoners the last five years—I have seen Jones and Williams together frequently till within the last three or four months JONES— GUILTY WILLIAMS— NOT GUILTY WILSON— GUILTY Jones and Wilson were further charged with having been before convicted JONATHAN WHICHER police sergeant A 27 I produce a certificate This certified the conviction of James Punt Borritt in this Court in Feb 1852 for being at large before the expiration of the term for which he had been ordered to be transported for life and previous to that to be confined for six months —Jones is the man—I know him well he has been two or three times in custody THOMAS RICHARDS re-examined I produce a certificate This certified the conviction of Thomas Richards in Dec 1853 at the Surrey Sessions of house breaking after a former conviction and that he was sentenced to six years penal servitude —I was present—Wilson is the man—he had been twice before convicted—he escaped from servitude and had not a ticket of leave JONES—GUILTY Aged 55 — Transported for Fifteen Years WILSON—GUILTY — See next page

METCALFE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM JAMES HARE I live at No 28 St Paul s-street New North-road On 24th Jan I and my mother left the house about half past 4 o clock—I shut up the house and left no one inside—I returned between half past 12 and 1 o clock—found the house had been broken open—the parlour door had been broken and a piece of the panel forced out—the police were in charge—the back door was bolted top and bottom—the house might have been entered by a skeleton key—I found the things were disturbed up stairs and down but nothing was taken but four shirt collars—these are two of the collars I lost they have the mark of the maker on them COURT Q How do you know them A By the mark of the maker—here is the stamp 2 15 1/2 which means the size of the collar two inches by fifteen and a half Cross-examined by MR M ENTEER Q Where did you purchase these collars A In the Borough—I purchased half a dozen—I have not any of the others here—I had several sizes brought to me—I liked the pattern of one but it was not the right size and he said he would make them for me to that size which he did—some will have them made for you—these have only three folds in them—it was from a pattern I had these made—I can only know them by matching them with another collar COURT Q How long had you worn them A I had not worn them when I lost them—they had not been washed—there were four collars taken and some left behind WILLIAM SAINSBURY policeman N 52 I was at the police court when the prisoners were there on another charge on Saturday 26th Jan —I took this collar from the neck of Wilson I sent for Mr Hare and he came and identified it—I took the other witness to the cell where there were seven or eight persons and she pointed out Williams—I saw this other collar taken from Williams by Thorne Cross-examined by MR M ENTEER Q You say Williams was in charge A Yes and the prisoners were remanded—I sent for Mrs Waters—she did not know what she was coming for I sent a messenger to say I wanted her—I took her directly to the cell and asked her if there was any one there she knew—I stood about two yards from the door—she pointed out Williams and said That is the man I saw by Mr Hare s house —I should say there were seven or eight men in the cell ELIZABETH WATERS I am the wife of Robert Waters I live in St Paul s-street next door to Mr Hare On Thursday 24th Jan I saw Williams between half past 6 and 7 o clock—he was at the end of my railing close against Mr Hare s door—he was within three or four steps of me—there was a gas light opposite—I saw his face—he stopped and looked at me and when he got to Mr Hare s door he called Rover Rover twice—I went to my door twice—he called Rover both times but I saw no dog—the second time I saw him he was near the door and he went down to the end of the street and called Rover again and I heard him a quarter of an hour afterwards calling Rover all round the back streets—he had a young man with him but I could not swear to him—he was about the height of Wilson but I did not see his face—the lodger came home to Mr Hare s about half past 7 o clock and I suppose by her putting the key into the door it disturbed them—I did not hear the police there before 11 o clock COURT Q You say a lodger came home A Yes half an hour after I saw the prisoner—she tried to get in and could not—I tried to turn the key in the door—it did turn but the door would not open—it appeared as if it was bolted inside—there was no alarm given till about 11 o clock Cross-examined by MR M ENTEER Q When you first saw the man it was between 6 and 7 o clock A Yes—I remained at the street door five or ten minutes—my husband said It is no use your standing there —I heard Rover called and my husband said there must be a robbery because they were very suspicious characters—I had never seen Williams before that night—I looked at him twice—he looked straight in my face—when I was asked to go to the police office they did not say what it was for—I was never in a police court before—I supposed I was going as a witness but I never asked a word—I will swear that I never asked a word about what I was going for—he said I want you —I said What for I cannot go —he said he wanted me for the robbery committed next door—I was very much alarmed COURT Q Did he tell you what he wanted you to go down about the robbery for A To recognise the man WILLIAM JAMES HAKE re-examined I came out of the front door when I left and locked the door—to get out at the back they would have to get over a wall four feet and a half high—they could get over every wall very easily till they got three yards off and then there is an eight feet wall JAMES THORNE policeman N 485 I took the two prisoners and another named Keys into custody on 25th Jan about half past 6 o clock in the evening at Balls -pond—the two prisoners were in the garden at the back of a house and Keys was in front—I took Keys and went and found the two

of Robert Marshall—2nd COUNT feloniously receiving the same MESSRS BALLANTINE and LEWIS conducted the Prosecution ROBERT MARSHALL I am a silk manufacturer and carry on business at No 11 Spital-square—my warehouses are on the ground floor of that house—the upper part of the house is occupied by Mr John Wallen—when you enter the house you first go into a hall—on each side the hall there are two rooms on the ground floor and an inner door which communicates with the house but that is only opened when you knock or ring—the street door is open I do not keep the key of that—the two side doors inside the hall lead into my warehouse—I was in the habit of going out about 1 o clock in the day and remaining about three quarters of an hour—there might have been one or two exceptions but as a role I may say I did that every day—on 20th Feb I left my warehouse about that time leaving there a quantity of velvets and black silks—I returned at 2 o clock after being absent half an hour—I found thirty-two pieces of velvet gone and tea pieces of silk three pieces of which had been sold and were wrapped up in paper and left on the counter—they were perfectly safe when I left—when I came back I had some difficulty in opening my door—there were no marks of violence—I lost upwards of 400l worth of property—I have not recovered any portion of it—the premises are in the liberty of Norton Folgate Cross-examined by MR RIBTON for Hopkins Q What sized house is this A I do not know exactly the number of rooms I think there are about twelve—Mr Wallen s family occupy the upper part of the house and the lower part also—I rent the parlours from him—Mr Wallen is an architect—there is only that one family living in the house—there is one servant—there are no clerks—I do not know whether Mr Wallen is exactly out of business but he is a great invalid and not able to attend to his business—he has several daughters but only one I believe resides at home others are at home occasionally—he has a son who does not live in the house—I consider that he does no business now on account of the state of his health—he has no assistants or apprentices—I have no clerks—I have a little boy who comes early in the morning to sweep the warehouse light the fire and do various little things—I attend to the whole business myself I have no one to assist me—I send out things by a man who makes it his trade to carry for warehouses in the neighbourhood and who comes in at stated times generally about 10 o clock in the morning to ask if I have any goods to go out—he had come in that morning—I had not told him to come again—he does come again about half past 12 o clock or a quarter to 1—he had come that day at a little past 1 o clock and asked if there was any thing to be sent out—I told him to wait I was then making up the three pieces that I had sold—ho said he was going a little farther and he would call again—I told him to come in at 2 o clock was he did come in at 2 o clock just as I was in the act of trying to open the door—I have employed him in that way for about twelve months—I da not know that he knew my habit of going out between 1 and 2 o clock because he has generally come in at about a quarter to 1 o clock before I went out—I do not know whether my habit of going out was known in the neighbourhood I did not publish it—I do not know whether that man knew it or not—his name is Davis—he is not here—the street door is left open—my warehouse is on each side of the hall—I am in the habit of locking both doors with the same key—when I go away at night I always take the keys with me—I have been there eighteen or twenty months—the boy generally goes away about 11 o clock and does not return as I have nothing further for him to do Cross-examined by MR LAWRENCE for Stewart Q In what state did you find the place when you returned A The velvets are kept in boxes—they were taken out and the boxes placed on the floor helter skelter—I had been sewing some of those velvets that very morning—they were each in different boxes of about the same size—every piece of velvet is made to be about the same size generally speaking—with silk it depends on the fabric they vary—every piece of the same fabric would be made of about the same number of yards THOMAS LKVESQUE I am warehouseman to Mr Thomas Kemp a silk manufacturer in Spital-square Our warehouse is nearly opposite Mr Marshall s—on 20th Feb about ten minutes to 2 o clock I was coming out of Mr Kemp s premises and saw two men come from the private door of Mr Marshall s premises—I mean the street door the front door—I did not see them come out of either of the warehouse doors inside—etch man had a black bag on his back containing something about a yard long and twenty inches wide as if they were velvets—the bags were similar to an old clothesman s bag only new and glazed—they looked full—I watched the movements of those men—they turned towards White Lion-street walking one behind the other—they walked across White Lion-street out of the square and went towards Elder-street—there was a cart in Elder-street about a dozen yards round the corner with a man in it—the parties put the bags into that cart—they did not get in themselves—it was a dirty cart of a greenish shade I think—a spring cart—it had no covering—it was an open cart—Elder-street is very nearly opposite Spital-square within a few yards—I saw the two men leave the cart—they turned round to the square again turned out of Elder-street into White Lion-street and that was all I saw of them—I did not see where they went to—I then went to dine—I left the cart still standing there as if waiting for the parties to come back—I did not see it go away Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q The cart was some distance down Elder-street A About a dozen yards—I was about that distance from it when I saw the men go up to it—I passed down Elder-street close to the cart—that was how I saw the colour of it—I passed it before the bags were put in—I was walking on one side of the square when the two men were on the other side and I turned into Elder-street first and then I turned round and saw what I have stated—I had a full view of the cart—I passed within a yard or a yard and a half of it—it was standing close to the kerb—I had got about a dozen yards past H when I turned round and saw the parcels put into it—I had a friend with me and we were both looking at it—his name is Thomas Godfrey—he is not here—he saw the men as well as me—I cannot say whether he saw them in Spital-square—I named it to him in Elder-street or White Lion-street—I said I did not like the appearance of the way in which the parcels were brought out in black bags—I drew his attention to the men—he had a full opportunity of teeing then—he saw the cart as he passed it and the man in it—he had not so good an opportunity of seeing him as I had—I had a full opportunity of seeing him both in passing the cart and when I turned round and saw the parcels put in—I did not know of Mr Marshall s habit of going out between 1 and 2 o clock—I work opposite at Mr Kemp s—there are three persons in Mr Kemp s employment besides his sons and himself—I do not think any of them knew that Mr Marshall was in the habit of going out between 1 and 2 o clock—I know this was on 20th Feb because when I came back from dinner I was told that Mr Marshall bad been robbed—I do not see many persons go in and out at Mr Marshall s for when I go to my work of a morning I do not come out till dinner time—I have seen one or two standing about the door weavers I should suppose they were Cross-examined by MR LAWRENCE Q Between 1 and 2 o clock is the common dinner time in your business is it not A We have no rule it is according as business lets us go—that is about the usual time COURT Q You say you had the opportunity of seeing the man in the cart A Yes I saw his face but I cannot recognise him—I do not think it was either of the prisoners it was a taller man than either of them—I should say Hopkins is about five feet four or five or six—the person in the cart was sitting down when I passed it—he eased the goods down in the cart when the parties pitched them in—he was standing when he eased the goods down JOHN JAMES I am a journeyman silk dyer and work at Mr Hendry s in Blossom-street I recollect in Feb last seeing a cart in White Lion-street coming from Norton Folgate—Hopkins was in it—I can speak positively to him—I used to see him frequently in White Lion-street between 1 and 2 o clock in the afternoon—the cart was coming from Norton Folgate in White Lion-street and turned into Blossom-street—he was sitting in the cart—he went gently on until he came to Fleur-de-lisstreet he then turned towards Elder-street and I saw no more of him that day—it was on Wednesday 20th Feb —I heard of the robbery the same afternoon—Blossom-street is not the direct line to Elder-street—there is about a stone s throw between Blossom-street and Elder-street—since I was before the Magistrate I have stepped it and made it seventy-six yards or steps—Blossom-street is not the shortest way to Elder-street from White Lion-street the nearest way is along White Lion-street—I saw him turning into Fleur-de-lis-street but I did not see him further—if he was going to place his cart within twelve yards of the bottom of Elder-street he would be going round and not the nearest way COURT Q Had you known Hopkins before except seeing him about in the street as you say A I saw him upwards of three weeks previous to the robbery in White Lion-street—I had no acquaintance with him—I did not know his name—I only knew him by seeing him standing here and there in the street at different times and sometimes he was standing talking with a man as I was going to my dinner—it was about 5 or 6 minutes past 1 o clock in the afternoon that I saw him on 20th Fob—I know that because it was the time I was going home to my dinner from my work—it was a sort of dirty looking cart something of a darkish greenish dirty looking cart and a brown middle-sized horse rather a poor looking one Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Do you know Bowles A Yes—I think I was present when he was examined before the Magistrate but I could not hear distinctly what he was saying—I have not been talking to him about this transaction—he spoke to me first of all—he noticed Hopkins in White Lion-street before I did—he spoke to me about it about three weeks previous to the robbery—since the robbery I have spoken to Bowles about it in the dye house—I was speaking to him about it on the 20th in the afternoon—he told me he had seen a cart—he did not tell me the colour of it nor did I tell him—to-day is the first time I have said a word about it—I was not asked before—I have not been speaking to Bowles about it to-day MR LEWIS Q I suppose the robbery was the common talk of the neighbourhood A Yes I heard talk of it many a time COURT Q How near did the man pass you in the cart that day A I was close to him close to the side of the cart as he was turning round from White Lion-street into Blossom-street—the pavement is very narrow there—I saw his face—I have not the least doubt that Hopkins is the man THOMAS BOWLES I am a fellow workman of James—I know both the prisoners but one of them I have only seen once that is Stewart—I was in the habit of seeing Hopkins at about 1 o clock in the day in White Lion-street—I have seen him there for four or five weeks I should say a score of times or upwards about the same time of day—the last time I saw him was on 20th Feb the day of the robbery—he was riding in a cart—it was about 2 o clock—the cart was loaded—he was alone in it—he was driving into White Lion-street from Elder-street—I saw two men near the cart Stewart is one of them—he was in the road—I saw those two men I should say for about a minute—the cart was going at the rate of from ten to twelve miles an hour—I first saw it in Elder-street—it was then standing from ten to twelve yards from the corner—it was there that I saw Stewart talking to Hopkins—the cart then drove off—Hopkins drove the cart Cross-examined by MR LAWRENCE Q Do you say that you saw Stewart talking to him A Yes—I know it was Stewart because I had a good fair look at him—I am not troubled with bad eyesight—I never left my employment because of my bad eyesight—I am working now as a dyer and have been for upwards of twenty years—I have never left off through my eyesight only when I have done my duly labour—I have never been obliged to cease my employment for any reason whatever—I am still a dyer—I never saw Stewart only on that day—when I was first asked about this matter I did not say I believed it was Stewart but was not certain—I said there was another man talking to him at the side of the cart and when my evidence came to be read over they put it down a man as I was not in possession of either of their names—I never said that I only believed Stewart was the man—I did not see him again till he was before the Magistrate—I do not know of any reward being offered for the discovery of this robbery—I have heard it talked of—I have heard them say it was 150l COURT Q How near were you to the cart when you saw Hopkins and the other man by him A At the corner of the very street within ten or twelve yards—it was a very dirty cart a spring cart—it had been a green but most of the colour was gone—when I saw Hopkins talking to the other man he was standing still—the cart had not started—when it did start he ran after it a little way behind it—he went up White Lion-street—the cart went to the top of White Lion-street and turned out at the top of Norton Folgate—I had not occasion to go so far—I went down Blossom-street and lost sight of them—Stewart had turned into Norton Folgate before I went into Blossom-street—the prisoners are the two men I am positive I have no doubt at all about it—I could not see what was in the cart—there appeared to be a quantity of things in it but they were covered over with a white bag or a white cloth—I had observed Hopkins frequently before—I had not mentioned it to anybody—I think I have mentioned it once or twice in the shop that I had seen a man hanging about the streets—I am almost positive I have mentioned it—I will not pretend to say whether I have done so in James s presence—I mentioned it among the workmen in the shop ROBERT DYE I am a livery stable keeper in White Lion-street Norton Folgate I can see the prosecutor s premises from my house—I know both the prisoners by seeing them frequently about my premises not together but I have seen both frequently Hopkins for about three weeks previous to the robbery between 1 and 2 o clock in the afternoon—I did not see Hopkins on the day of the robbery—I saw Stewart that day opposite my premises and also the day before—he was in White Lion-street between 1 and 2 o clock on both days—on the 20th he was walking to and fro opposite my house and gateway which looks opposite the square Cross-examined by MR LAWRENCE Q You speak of Stewart by name now had you known his name before you heard of this transaction A No not till I went to identify him—I know it was on the 20th that I saw him walking to and fro because I heard of the robbery the same afternoon and I was about my premises particularly that day and noticed him—I saw him from my counting house window which looks up the square—there is a blind to that window—I might have to raise myself a little to look over it COURT Q From where you saw Stewart walking backwards and forwards could he see the door of Mr Marshall s house A Yes—I can see it from my counting house Q Look steadily at those men and do not be in a hurry to answer what do you say A They are the two—I hare no doubt—when I went to see them at the police office one was walking about and the other was sitting down—there were no other persons there but policemen—I was told that these two persons were taken for the robbery and asked whether I could identify them—it was at Spital-square station JONATHAN WHICHER I am a detective officer of the Metropolitan Police On Monday 25th Feb I was in company with sergeant Jackson in the Kingsland-road and met the two prisoners together—we followed them we were in plain clothes we followed them some distance down the Kingsland-road—I then stopped Hopkins and said Pray what is your name —he said My name why —I said I wish to know —he said I shall not tell you —I said Where do you live —he said I shall not tell you —I said I am a police officer and I have a motive in asking you —he said I shall not tell you but Mrs Welsh knows my name very well —there is a Mrs Welsh who keeps a low public house in the neighbourhood—I said Then if you refuse to give me your name and address you must go with me —he said Very well and I took him to the station house in Spital-square and after the witnesses Bowles Dye and James had seen them they were charged with this offence—Jackson took charge of Stewart—he stood close by during this conversation but said nothing—they both refused their address at the station to the acting inspector in my presence—they each said they should not give their address—I searched Hopkins and found on him a silver watch and 15s 9 1/2 d nothing relating to the charge COURT Q Were there any other prisoners at the station when Dye James and Bowles saw them there A No other men there was a drunken woman—we always do mix persons with other prisoners when they are to be identified but there were no others there on this occasion—it is generally done HENRY JACKSON police-sergeant 11 H I was with Whicher on 25th Feb in the Kingsland-road and took the prisoners into custody—I left then at the station and was away for absent an hour and a half—in consequence of a communication made to me on my return by Farrell a constable in whose custody they were left I went to the watercloset I searched the pan and in it found a quantity of small pieces of paper—these are them produced —they were taken out of the pan and given to Mr Marshall—he was present when they were taken out—he said he would take them home and paste them together he took them away with him—next morning I think he showed them to me pasted on this board—I received it at his house—I had examined the papers that I found the evening before—they were not soiled in any way some of them were wet—I can speak to some of these papers as being the same 1 found in the pan they are like what I found they have similar figures as them—water cannot be let into the pan from the cell it is turned on from outside—a person who uses the pan cannot empty it—that is done on purpose for precaution—a person using the pan can throw anything into it but cannot pass it below Cross-examined by MR LAWRENCE Q When were these pasted on the board A I believe the same afternoon I can speak to their identity by the particular figures on them which we made observation upon at the time we took them out and wiped them COURT Q Were you with Whicher when these men were asked their addresses A Yes Whicher asked Hopkins his address when he took him and he refused to give either his name or address and so did Stewart to me WILLIAM FARRELL policeman On 25th Feb I was on duty at the Spitalfields-station—the prisoners were brought there and left in my charge—Stewart asked to be allowed to go to the water closet—I granted that request—he was there about five minutes I did not follow him I stood at the reserve room door where I could see the cell door—I heard him tear up some paper—I communicated that to sergeant Jackson and afterwards went with him into the cell and picked out these pieces of paper from the pan Cross-examined by MR LAWRENCE Q This is an ordinary cell in which prisoners are received A Yes there are three cells this was No 2 cell—there is a water closet to each cell COURT Q Row soon after he had left it did you go in A About a quarter of an hour—no other person had used it in the mean time—I am sure of that—he did not appear to have used the pan in the ordinary way—I had not turned the water on so that I should have been sure to have found it there MR LAWRENCE Q There were other constables about I suppose A There was no other constable there besides myself at that time—I had rinsed out the pans with water about half or a quarter of an hour before the prisoners came in—the people at the station never go into those water closets ROBERT MARSHALL re-examined I received information on 25th Feb and went to the station and received from sergeant Jackson some pieces of paper—I took them home and pasted them on another piece of paper and matched them together—this is it—these are the pieces I pasted on—they are the same that I received from Jackson and no others—these are every one that I received from him—I find marks on them—on one piece there is the word velvet —it is on two pieces of paper which fit together each piece contains part of the word—I also find some numbers on these pieces they are compound numbers—I do not know how many pieces contain compound numbers—they correspond with the lengths that were on tickets attached to the pieces of velvet stolen—I can prove the lengths of the pieces of velvet stolen and I have made a corresponding list with these numbers—I have my book here containing the numbers and lengths of the pieces—they were entered as they were brought in by the weaver by myself—I began business at these premises in Sept 1854—I am able from this book to tell what goods came in and when—I cannot tell what remained on the premises by this book I should hare to take that from my stock taking last Christmas and the entries in my day book—this book will not enable me to say what goods I had on 20th Feb —it gives the widths and lengths of the pieces and by my other books I could of course tell exactly what I have lost—I have done so—those other books are not here—the letters dit on these pieces of paper I presume mean ditto —there are no numbers here only lengths—I can prove that I have lost pieces of velvet corresponding with these lengths—I prove that by my books—I have made out a list of what I lost—the books themselves would not prove it if they were here it is a process of arithmetic I should have to explain and make out the list in Court—I made an exact list of the goods I lost from my books—I ascertained what had come in and what I had sold and then the missing were not sold—this is the extract I made produced —it is not that the books refreshed my memory and enabled me to speak from recollection I speak from the books themselves they prove it—I can speak from recollection to some particular numbers and lengths being in the warehouse shortly before the robbery for instance those I had shown to a customer that morning—there was one piece of velvet of 28 yards and two pieces of 36 yards—lengths of velvet vary—that is so with all velvets—those three were peculiar numbers in themselves being rather unusual lengths for velvet velvets are generally made to come out of the loom at 31 yards— it was stated that the figures 28 appeared on the pieces of paper but not 36 —all the others that I lost I can swear to as being from 29 to 34 yards in length—that would be the case in almost any velvet warehouse—1005 yards is the exact quantity I lost—I am speaking from a calculation that I made of course I cannot speak from memory—there were 32 pieces taken away and the average length of them was 31 yards—that would make 992 yards a few yards of extra length would make it up to 1005—I made the list out and added it up very carefully several times and made it 1005 yards—this paper is similar to that used for velvet wrappers—I do not know whether it is commonly used I used it—I pasted these pieces of paper in this way at a friend s house Mr Beverly—he is in Court—I could not match the dates and I thought them unimportant so I pasted them on any way SOPHIA ELIZABETH WALLEN I reside at No 11 Spitalequare Mr Marshall rents the parlours of my father—I remember 20th Feb no one left the part of the house in which we reside on that day with any black bags HOPKINS— GUILTY ** Aged 56 STEWART— GUILTY * Aged 36 — Five Years Penal Servitude Hopkins was further charged with

WILLIAMS PLEADED GUILTY — Transported for Fifteen Years MR ORRIDGE conducted the Prosecution GEORGE ELIJAH ROWLETT I live with my father in Glebe-cottage Kingsland-road On Monday 27th Oct my brother asked for the key of his house and I went across the road—it was between half past 5 and 6 o clock—I went across the road and in going I saw Garnon standing at the end of my father s gate that is about twenty yards from my brother s house and I saw there was a light in my brother s house—I had not got the key the first time—I went back and got the key and when I returned Garnon was standing there then—I saw a light in my brother s bedroom—I opened the door and saw Williams on the stairs—I said What do you do here —he threw me down and knocked me on the head with a crowbar—I got my clothes torn all to pieces—I was very much injured and have been under the doctor s hands ever since—after Williams knocked me down became insensible—I know that Garnon had a cap on Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q You never saw Garnon before A Never—I passed him twice—I saw him the next day outside the police court—there were a great many people there—I pointed him out outside I the police court—I came there in a cab—my head was bound up CORNELIUS DESMOND police sergeant N 7 I took up a crowbar which was seen to be thrown away by Williams—I saw Garnon outside the police court—when he was taken he said I was not there I am innocent and again he denied it inside the court Cross-examined Q What did the prosecutor say A He pointed to him and said That is the man I saw outside the door —he was within a yard of him at the time—he had come in a cab and I came in another cab with the prisoner Williams WILLIAM PETERS I live near Kingsland-road I know Mr Rowlett s yard—it is next to mine—on last Monday evening I left work at half put 5 o clock—when I left off work I saw two men in the yard—my master authorised me if I saw any strange men in the yard to turn them out so I went and spoke to Williams who was one of the men and asked him what he did there—he said I have lost a little Spaniel dog —I said You have no business here —I then went and spoke to the other man who was leaning against another wall twenty or thirty yards off who I believe was Garnon I will not swear to it but I could as nearly as could be I never saw two peas more alike—I asked both him and Williams if I should hear anything about the dog who I should let know—they both said they were going to the Swan public house—they went out of the yard as near as I can say together Cross-examined Q Where did you first see Garnon after that A I saw him at the police court—he was in the dock—he was not pointed out to me—I was taken two days afterwards to the police court to recognize some one—I saw him at Worship-street—he stood in front of the bar before some gentleman—it was last Monday night that I saw the two men leaning against the wall MR ORRIDGE Q Did you point out Garnon at the police court A Yes—I said I never saw a man nearer like the man in my life MR ROBINSON called WILLIAM TURNER I lodge with the prisoner Garnon at No 1 Helmet-court London-wall I am a waiter Last Monday evening I came

him to a place in Bishopsgate—I waited at the corner of Devonshire-street—we went then to the Curtain-road—I went after a situation—in coming from there we walked round to Worship-street and we stood outside the court I dare say an hour and a person came and recognized him—I heard a young man speak about this case that was coming on—he said he was waiting to hear the case—we listened to that conversation—we were waiting to see if we could get in to hear the trial—I was present when Garnon was pointed out by the prosecutor—he was taken into custody—he was kept in custody that day—he was bailed out on Wednesday and has surrendered here this morning—I have known him about eighteen months—he was always a respectable man hard-working and honest Cross-examined by MR ORRIDGE Q Have you lodged with him all that time A I have lodged with his mother and his wife s mother about ten years when I have been out of a situation—he went to his work on Monday—I saw him about 6 o clock in the evening when I came home to have my tea—they had done tea when I came home—they generally have tea about 5 o clock but I was not at home—there is a clock in the room—I did not particularly notice the time when I came in but I know it was as near 6 o clock as could be—I know by where I had been—I had been in the City—I had been in Barbican about 10 minutes before 6 o clock I was not doing anything I was coming home—I guessed it was 10 minutes to 6 o clock by the time I got home—my friend was committed for trial they would not allow me to go in—on the morning I went to the police court I had been to Bishopsgate-street and to the Curtain-road—we went down Old-street and I called in the Curtain-road—Garnon went on forward while I went in—I did not succeed in getting a situation—I spoke to a man named Ward outside the police station—I did not know him at all but Mr Garnon did I believe—we were not talking above fire minutes about this case before the cab came up—we had been waiting there

o clock—it was exactly 4 o clock—there is a clock in the room which stands up against the door in the corner—I looked at the clock—it was 4 o clock—I looked at it again at 5 o clock—I looked again at half-past 5 o clock—I looked at it when I left—my brother had asked me to come to tea with him on the Saturday—he had been out of work a long time—there were two lodgers at tea and my sister my

left on the key-latch—no one was in the house when I left it—my wife was away—in consequence of information I received in the afternoon I went back—I found the front door forced—I went in—I saw a little desk was forced open and in the bed-room a chest of drawers was tampered with—there was a mark on the outside made by some tool—I went to the Police-station and gave information—a constable was sent out—he brought back the prisoners—I saw Stanley searched and these articles taken from him two chains a watch three gold studs a bracelet and a pocket-case MARY ISABEL TURNER I live in the Cowley Road about sixty yards from the prosecutor—there are three houses between two small ones—our garden runs not quite up to it—on 21st August about 4 15 p m I was in the garden and heard people coming up the road—I saw the prisoners drink something out of a bottle—they next walked up to the prosecutor s house looked at it went into the garden and into the porch of the house—they stayed there a little time and the man went round the back way—I saw him leave the porch—the woman remained in the porch—after a short time the man rejoined the female and they stayed in the porch fifteen or twenty minutes—the woman was holding a sunshade or umbrella—my suspicion was aroused and I went to the woman I did not see the man then and said Do you wish to see anyone —she said she wanted the lady of the house—I said She is away from home —she said Oh she is away is she and came away from the door—I asked her if she knew the lady s name—she did not seem to answer that but commenced talking about the Uxbridge Cycling Sports that were on—she walked from the house and left me a few yards from our house—I went in our house the front way and into the kitchen and stood upon a chair and looked out at the back window—I saw the woman go back into the garden—a few minutes after the man joined her and then went to the top of the road and down another road and she came down the road and past my front garden retraced her steps the man came down the other road and she walked behind him about twelve yards—I went to Mr Brian senior s house and informed him what I had seen—I then went to the railway

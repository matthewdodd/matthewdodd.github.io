<h1>First Draft</h1>
<p>In writing history there is a reliance on archives to provide all necessary documentation. Archives provide significant written work which forms the basis of an historical argument. Recently, however, the digitization and categorization of the archives has led to databases which contain far more information than was once usable. Specifically, court cases from the late seventeenth century to the early twentieth century have a digital existence in the Proceedings of the Old Bailey. The people in the almost 200,000 cases within the Old Bailey have been used to construct a further database and dataset in London Lives. The people involved in crimes committed in London faced a wide variety of punishments for their crimes, but the one under consideration for this thesis is that of exile and deportation.
<p>During the years that the Old Bailey covers there was significant migration into London. There was also significant deportation to a number of places around the world, including Australia as a penal colony. The recording, preserving, and displaying of the people involved and their crimes is a recent historical action. This action, however, has the direct consequence of cost; it is monetarily incredibly expensive to digitise and preserve, but there is also the cost of doing violence again to those that are being preserved and remembered. This violence is in again dehumanizing those that are preserved by recording them merely as data points for further visualization.</p>
<p>Doing violence again to subjects under consideration through data visualization or analysis is discussed in the digital humanities by scholars including Scott Weingart of Carnegie Mellon University and Dr. Lorna Richardson of Umeå University. These scholars question the use of digital tools in their creation of power relationships and the redoing of the actions upon the victims, specifically “reflecting on the material, monetary, and ultimately dehumanizing costs of processing ghosts into the machine,” according to Weingart.</p>
<p>My research will focus on the creation of visualizations, specifically maps and networks, and answering the related questions that will draw upon the information contained within those visualizations. Furthermore I will address issues within the digital humanities that are specific to my research including data management and retention, doing, or redoing, violence to the subject people, and whether the use of digital tools to perform analysis is simply due to the availability of those tools or is due to the unique answers and conclusions that can be formed from the use of the tools.</p>
<p>The foundation of scholarly work that I intend to build upon consists of material from London Lives which incorporates hundreds of accounts and articles relating to the lives of ordinary people in London between 1690 and 1800. Specifically, I intend to draw upon Dr. John Beattie for understanding crime and punishment in London during the period under examination from both a historical and legal perspective. Furthermore, I will draw upon Dr. Greg Smith as background in violent crimes that were committed and the subsequent legal and cultural outcomes of those crimes. Both of these works inform the questions of how and where was crime found or determined to be found by the police and justice system in London? Was violent crime found primarily in specific areas of London and why those areas? Where those areas lived in by non-white, immigrant, or otherwise “unwelcome” persons in the eyes of the Justice system? The questions posited here form the basis for how I will engage with the source material through a traditional historical perspective. </p>
<p>Scholarly work regarding the digital humanities perspective on the material under consideration requires multiple different perspectives. The first of these is in investigating how one can visually represent the material under consideration and do it justice. The second is in questioning how the tools themselves do violence to the subject matter and how this can be mitigated. In response to the first perspective: the most recent work is Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian’s Macroscope by Dr. Shawn Graham, Dr. Ian Milligan, and Scott Weingart. This book forms the basis for how to perform data visualizations and the background on data for humanities and history, including asking serious questions about “the broader implications of big data.” Secondly, I will draw upon The Programming Historian to provide questions and answers to big issues within the digital humanities broadly and my research specifically, including: how do we manage the data that will be used and analysed for this research? How do we provide access to the material and make the analysis reproducible?</p>
<p>The digital humanities, however, also forces the investigation of questions such as: what violence was done to the people, now data, under investigation and how has that violence been done again? How can that violence be acknowledged and mitigated without removing the integrity of the data or the visualizations? To explore these questions I will turn to Dr. Lorna Richardson and Scott Weingart who both explore the use of digital tools and the implications within those tools that may reproduce the same visual representation of the original violence. However, this can, hopefully, be mitigated by making the data open and my research visible to everyone. I will draw upon Dr. Fiona Godlee of the British Medical Journal who discusses making research open and The Historian’s Macroscope which was initially drafted online and remains online to view as a significant example of making available all research and questions.</p>
<p>Primary sources are not difficult to obtain, although much of the original literature is no longer physically existent. Google Books and other digitization services have uploaded thousands of original manuscripts regarding London, crime, and other material. The single largest issue with this material is that there is very little, or very poor, character recognition and so actually locating within the books the relevant material is difficult. This is compounded by the use of the “long s” (ſ) which appears to be an “f” and is not dealt with well be computers and scanners.</p></p>
<p>Initially, all material will come from London Lives and The Old Bailey which are the repositories of data that will be used to facilitate all research and visualizations. The first step is to gather what data is available from both sources and sort through it while doing all of this in the open and online. If possible the production of a map, including years, concentration, and direction, will include the convicted criminal’s place of origin, location in London wherein they were found/the crime was committed, and the location to which they were deported. This map would form the basis of visualizations from which to draw further conclusions and additional visualizations.</p>
<p>The questions that this map will provide the basis of information on are about the where, when, and who of the individual subjects under consideration. Where did these people come from that they entered London? Where in London did they go or were they found? Where, following conviction and sentencing, were they sent? When was all of this migration into London happening? When were areas of London being targeted? When were mass deportations occurring? And to whom was all of this occurring? The map begins as a simple, single layer that may have points placed upon it. As the data is expanded the map will grow in layers and become chronological, heat mapped, and data depth will form. The primary source literature provided through data of London Lives and The Old Bailey as well as their research literature forms the basis of where these answers must come from.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I will engage with the questions surrounding the usage of digital tools to perform much of this research including those listed above from Dr. Richardson and Weingart about redoing violence to historical subjects through data preservation and visualization. These questions will be posited, worked on, and answered continually throughout the project by including all of the thoughts and ideas online in an open notebook form through a digital repository hosted on GitHub. In this way there will be an attempt to mitigate that violence through transparency and openness. There will also be a need to work towards data management and retention and the initial proposal is to include all material in the same GitHub repository. This, however, will be examined in greater detail in conjunction with MacOdrum Library’s Research Data Management service to ensure that material is preserved and dealt with in ethical and logical ways.</p>

<h2>05 June 2017 - A Second Look at the Old Bailey API</h2>
<ul>
	<li>After taking another look at the link that I used as part of my "I can only get 1000 records?" issue, I noticed that I can stipulate a begin and an end point.</li>
	<li>Given this I quickly jumped into Excel and Notepad++ to generate the required links for wget to gather all the possible identifiers that matched my search criteria: "sentence: transportation."</li>
	<li>I quickly wrote the parameter file for wget with those links (a whopping 46 of them to b precise - I used 900 records per link to be on the safe side) and began my wget - ing.</li>
	<li>The first issue: I needed to use the "--no-check-certificate" flag because of this:
	<ul>
		<li>"ERROR: certificate common name `hri.shef.ac.uk' doesn't match requested host name `www.oldbaileyonline.org'."</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Once I did that, it worked perfectly and generated all 46 files. According to wget: "Downloaded: 46 files, 768K in 0.05s (14.0 MB/s)"</li>
	<li>From here it seems like it should be trivial to clean up all of the files and concatenate them into one larger parameter file again so that I can gather all of the transcripts from The Old Bailey.</li>
	<li>The big thing here, though, is that I will have to be kind and set a limiter on how much and how fast I download all of the information from The Old Bailey. I don't want to overload them or their server.</li>
</ul>

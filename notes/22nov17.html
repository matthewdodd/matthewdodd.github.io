<h2>22 November 2017 - After an Outline</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I wrote about 30 pages of an outline. I'm not really sure how I organized it or why I organized it the way that I did.</li>
	<li>But this is the beginning of the feedback that I received:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>"Are you sure about ‘popery’ = ‘paupery’ ? Popery I thought was synonymous with Catholicism…"</li>
		<li>"y’know your maps of defendant homes, and then where the crime was located? It might be interesting to put this into Palladio and visualize the movement between the two locations as a graph – this is what Caleb McDaniel’s students did in visualizing fugitive slave adverts…"</li>
		<li>"Maps where you’re showing the density of crime – maybe a chloropleth that distorts the map of london (at the borough level) to show that density?"</li>
		<li>""</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Cliometrics should be discussed as part of the social history discussion!</li>
	<li>Thrills in the ability to read/make sense of thousands of documents at a time; worries about what off-loading meaning-making to an algorithm does to our sense of humanity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10 October 2017 - Moving XML to TXT files</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I used a script from <a href="'https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/naive-bayesian">The Programming Historian</a> to convert all of my xml files to txt files.</li>
	<li>This had the consequence of also categorizing the files in certain ways, but whether I use this or not is still up for debate.</li>
	<li>All of these files can be found in the GitHib Repository under the txtfiles folder/directory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>06 June 2017 - All the Data</h2>
<p>- I began gathering the data using wget to grab over 40,000 records. Weirdly enough, despite The Old Bailey API informing me that there were 40,521 records, I have over that many unique identifiers.</p>
<p>- I will need to confirm that all of the cases/trials actually resulted in the consequence of transportation before going forward.</p>
<p>- All of the files being grabbed by wget had the prefix "text@div=" as part of their name and I prefer not having that as it doesn't help anything and so a quick way to deal with that (given that I am primarily in a windows environment) is to use PowerShell:</p>
<p>-- Change directory to the relevent file location: <div class="script">cd C:\users\doddm\Documents\Personal\ma_public\raw_data\text</div></p>
<p>-- Rename the files using this script: <div class="script">dir | rename-item -NewName {$_.name -replace [Regex]::Escape("text@div="),""}</div></p>

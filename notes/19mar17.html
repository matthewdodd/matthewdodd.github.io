<h2>19 March 2017 - Feedback from Dr. Kinsey</h2>
<ul>
	<li>How am I defining "violent crime"?
	<ul>
		<li>Is this something that I can get from my primary or secondary sources?</li>
		<li>How does this change from the 16th Century through to the 18th Century?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>What makes a person "unwelcome" or "non-white"?
		<li>The ways in which the racialized discussion changes from the 16th Century and the 18th Century will not be the same.</li>
		<li>White vs non-white may not be prominent while "gypsy" may be.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>How do the records of the Old Bailey refer to categories of difference?
	<ul>
		<li>Will need to come up with hypotheses and work on finding the answers.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>How am I defining "justice system"?
	<ul>
		<li>How was it defined in the different centuries under examination?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The act of labelling and categorizing the people that are being examined is itself a violence.
	<ul>
		<li>'[H]ow [will] the work [I] do perpetuate those categories?' (Kinsey)</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

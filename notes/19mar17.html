<h2>19 March 2017 - Feedback from Dr. Kinsey</h2>
<p>- How am I defining "violent crime"?</p>
<p>-- Is this something that I can get from my primary or secondary sources?</p>
<p>-- How does this change from the 16th Century through to the 18th Century?</p>
<p>- What makes a person "unwelcome" or "non-white"?</p>
<p>-- The ways in which the racialized discussion changes from the 16th Century and the 18th Century will not be the same.</p>
<p>--  White vs non-white may not be prominent while "gypsy" may be.</p>
<p>- How do the records of the Old Bailey refer to categories of difference?</p>
<p>-- Will need to come up with hypotheses and work on finding the answers.</p>
<p>- How am I defining "justice system"?</p>
<p>--  How was it defined in the different centuries under examination?</p>
<p>- The act of labelling and categorizing the people that are being examined is itself a violence.</p>
<p>-- '[H]ow [will] the work [I] do perpetuate those categories?' (Kinsey)</p>

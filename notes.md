-Initial notes and thoughts on my MA

##March 6, 2017
###Crime in London
-Heatmapping/Thick mapping of Old Bailey/London Lives to explore where people came from, where in London they went, and then where they were sent upon deportation.

- People from (where) to London(where in?) to (where)?

- Ethics of Big Data / Algorithmic transparency
-- How is violence done to these people again when brought in as data being analyzed?

- People to consider:
-- Caleb McDaniels "Open Notebook History"
-- Scott Weingart "Shoah Archive"

- Using an open notebook
-- Github.io
-- Mitigating the violence by being transparent?
-- Every PROBLEM, SOLUTION, and what that means about HISTORY

- Data Management Plan?

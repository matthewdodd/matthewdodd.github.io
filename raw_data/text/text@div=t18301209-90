I believe, found on them; Hart had most of it - only a few sixpences were found on Lee, in his watch-pocket; I saw my purse in the Policeman's hands - he had picked it up just before I came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where had you been to? A. To my uncle's, at Lambeth - I was not aware that it was so late; I went there to tea about five o'clock - I had been to no other public-house that evening; I was not perfectly sober, I was not drunk - I should not have fallen if a foot had not been put out; I should not fall from drunkenness - I do not think any body was with me but the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you thank them for their kindness if you was thrown in the mud? A. I was so surrounded with mud, if I had moved I should have been covered - I did not like to charge them with it; they walked as far as Plummer's-row, about thirty houses, after that - I was not aware that they had robbed me; I saw no watchman to inform of it - I had not presence of mind to return to the public-house; I am quite satisfied I had 18s. in my purse - this was a night-house; I was neither drunk nor sober - I had the rum and shrub because I felt cold, and am subject to take cold, and had no great coat; I was not violent at the watch-house, and did not want to fight the prisoners - I was quiet there; 14s. was found on Hart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a night was it - was the court lighted with gas? A. No - I could hardly see my hand before me in the court.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 15th of November, about a quarter or twenty minutes past two o'clock, I saw two persons run down King-street, and at the corner of Battie-street I stopped the two prisoners - that is about thirty yards from King-street; there is a court half-way down King-street - I stopped at the end of King-street; I suppose they saw me, and ran down the court - I think it is Well-court; I heard one say to the other, "Through this court" - they ran through it; it leads into Battie-street - I made for Battie-street, and at the corner of Battie-street, seeing them running at that hour in the morning, I took them into custody, with the assistance of a brother officer, and in a minute or a minute and a half, I saw the prosecutor - he came up while I was asking why they were running, and stated that he had been robbed by two men; I said I had stopped two - he immediately identified them as the persons who had robbed him; I searched them, and found 11s. 6d. in silver, and 8d. in copper, on Hart - I was present when a sixpence was found on Lee; my brother-officer and Elliott brought the purse up about two minutes after I took them, just as the prosecutor came up; and said he had picked it up at the corner of Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, which is across the Commercial-road, on the opposite side - a person coming from the court I saw them in, would not be in Greenfield-street, but I did not see them till they ran out of the Commercial-road, into King-street; they could pass Greenfield-street, between that and where the robbery was committed - the prosecutor claimed the purse; he was certainly not sober - he had been drinking, but was quite capable of taking care of himself, and know what passed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any money in the purse? A. No - 12s. 8d. was found altogether on the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prosecutor in such a state that he might easily mistake a man? A. If there was no gas-light there, there was one very near to where he was robbed, which I should think, is about sixty yards from Morris' house, the Yorkshire Grey; he pointed the place out to me - there is a light within ten or twelve yards of it; it was not a very dark night - I have seen it lighter; it was not moonlight; I will not swear the men I first saw running were the prisoners - they were running towards me.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 15th I was in Greenfield-street, Commercial-road I heard a shuffling and sort of running noise, which excited my suspicion; it proceeded from the Commercial-road - I did not see the persons till I came up to them in Battie-street- the place where I heard the noise is in a straight direction from the spot the prosecutor describes himself to have been robbed; I saw no other person there, nor any person running - I lost the sound all at once; when I came up to the top of Greenfield-street, I found the purse laying under a lamp, at the corner of Greenfield-street and the Commercial-road - I took it up, and have it here; immediately on taking it up I heard a noise in Battie-street, like five or six persons talking - I went there, and found the prisoners in custody; the prosecutor came up at the same time - I saw them searched; sixpence was found on Lee, and 11s. 6d. and 8d. on Hart - the prosecutor was evidently the worse for liquor, but quite capable of taking care of himself; he claimed the purse immediately he saw it - I asked the colour, and he told me before I showed it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was no silver in the purse?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090051"></xptr>A. No; the prosecutor might certainly make a mistake in the person of a man.</p>
               <p>Hart's Defence. I met Lee in Ratcliff-highway - we were going home, and as we went along we were taken into custody by two Policemen - the gentleman came up, and said, "These men have robbed me of a watch, seals, and 2l.;" at the station-house he said he had lost 24s., but not his watch; he afterwards said it was 26s.; he said this in the Policemen's presence and at the station he said,"Are you two Jews?" I said Yes - he said, "Come out of doors, and I will fight you;" the Policeman brought him away and said, "You must not fight here;" he said,"You d-d rascals, I will do any thing to you."</p>
               <p>ROBERT CAMPPEN. The prosecutor said he had no doubt, had it not been for his guard his watch would have been gone, and that he had lost about 1l.; he did not challenge them to fight at all. nor did I interfere to prevent it- I never left them together out of my presence.</p>

            . I did the doors about 10 o'clock; the maid got up first and found the house had been broke open, then she call'd me, I got up and found the cellar-door had a hole cut in it, that a person could put in an arm and unbolt a bolt, and also unskrew a skrew that fastened down the bar of the window; the hole was in the middle, so that by turning the arm up and down the fastening could be undone. It appear'd to be done by some body that knew the fastening without-side. The compting-house door was burst open, and the desk broke; and I am positive there was more money taken out of the desk than I have laid in the indictment.

            . I am servant-maid to the prosecutor; I got up in the morning last Friday, I heard somebody go down stairs, and found the door open, and saw no body, but I found the shop broke open; I went and told my master of it, who came down and miss'd the goods and money.</p>

            . I am the constable; I had a search warrant to search Coffield's lodgings, we found this box of stockings ( produced in court); when we secur'd Coffield and had tied his hands, he got them almost loose; he offered me 10 l. if I would let him go; we call'd a coach; when it was at the door, the minute the door was opened he push'd the man on one side, and ran away, and was gone half an hour before they brought him again; when we got him in the coach, there was his wife and my friend in the coach with us, Coffield told us both, he would give me 10 l. if I would let him go. We drove to the justice's door; when we went out on the left side, to go into the justice's house, he jump'd out on the other side and ran away, the people call'd stop thief; and this witness that took him before, being behind the coach, ran and took him again in a cellar. Upon his examination he said, that the goods and money were left him by a soldier that was gone abroad. Here are some tools that we found in his house (producing an iron colt-chissel about 14 inches long, a tinder-box, matches, flint and steel, and two gunlets). When I was searching the house, the woman said, her husband had brought home some money, and it was in a little box; we went and found in it about 16 l. and a receipt of his landlord, for rent he had just paid.</p>
               <p>Coffield's defence.</p>
               <p>A soldier came and left these things with me, and said he was to have them when he came back.</p>
               <p>Edmonds's defence.</p>
               <p>Coffield gave me the pair of stockings on Sunday, my wife carried them to Mr. Maschall's to sell; that is all I know of it.</p>

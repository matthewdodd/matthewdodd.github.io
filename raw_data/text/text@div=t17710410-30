They complained that they were almost starved, and begged I would give them a glass of something to drink; as they begged so hard, I went with them into a house of ill same in Butcher Row. We had one half crown bowl of punch, a pot of porter, and some negus. The girls kissed me, they desired I would stay all night with them; I told them they were welcome to the liquor, but I would have nothing more to do with them. This young man,

I said I was robbed of almost five pounds; the girl that is gone was the girl that first left me; the prisoners held me from pursuing her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you perceived they had picked your pocket?</p>
               <p>Wilkes. Not five minutes; I perceived it as she was going away: and as soon as I could get out of the hands of Boston and Bateman, that held me, I followed her: she was got out of doors.</p>

               <p>Wilkes. She stood by; she had not hold of me at all. We set by the fire place; there was no fire, and there was only two chairs in the room: they seized me as I set in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. So then only you and your friend sat down?</p>
               <p>Wilkes. No; only us. I could not overtake the girl, so I went back to the three prisoners; they wanted to go. I sent for the watch; soon after the watch came; and the waiter said to the prisoners, Let the girl be produced, that the man may have his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your money?</p>

               <p>This gentleman was coming along on Saturday night, and he asked us how we did; what house we went to: we told him the Ship and Crown tavern. He called for two shillings worth of liquor; this girl followed us in. We asked what business she had there; she said he spoke to her first. He seemed to like her best; she set by him, and all of a sudden she went out: then he laid hold of us, and said he was robbed.</p>

I am a widow, and live at Kensall-green—the pri<lb></lb>soner is my grandson—he lost his mother when he was about three years old—I and my late husband brought him up—he married about two years ago, and ceased to live with me—he was brought up as a carpenter, and I allowed him to occupy an outhouse of mine as a workshop—before this matter hap<lb></lb>pened, he used sometimes to come pretty often, and sometimes stay away a long while—a young man and his sister lodged in my front parlour, and my servant occupied the kitchen—on the night of 29th of Feb. I retired to bed, with Snell, about nine o'clock, or a little before—I locked the kitchen<lb></lb>door, and took the key up stairs—I had used a comb before I went to bed, and put it into a table-drawer in the kitchen—there were three silver tea<lb></lb>spoons, three brass candlesticks, a Dutch clock, and a comb, safe when I went to bed—next morning Snell came up stairs—I went down stairs, and found the place had been broken open, and these things gone—there is a shutter to the kitchen window—it was made for a room up stairs, and the pri<lb></lb>soner had altered it for the kitchen window, four or five years back—he would know the shutter very well—I informed the police—two or three days after, the prisoner came, about eight in the evening—I was very much alarmed, and told him I felt very ill—I asked him to go for a doctor—I said that for the purpose of sending for a policeman—after he was gone, I sent for a police<lb></lb>man, who came directly—the prisoner returned—he was searched, and this comb found—I have had it five or six years—it is the one I had safe on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mrs. Todd's servant I have lived with her three months—on the night of the 29th of Feb. I was with her in the kitchen—we went to bed between eight and nine o'clock—I locked the door, and gave the key to Mrs. Todd—it was my usual custom—I slept with Mrs. Todd that night, and got the key from her—when I came down to the kitchen, about seven o'clock, I unlocked the door—there was some resistance from something placed against it inside—I found the shutter down and the window open—when I went to bed it was fastened as it usually was—the window was down, the shutter shut, and bolted with two little brass bolts—I did not observe any marks of violence, except that the two pieces of wood that supported the upper sash were taken out from outside—we had three tea spoons in use down stairs—we had used two of them the night before, and the third was in the mus<lb></lb>tard-pot in the cupboard—a Dutch clock was gone in the morning before I had combed Mrs. Todd's hair, not the night before—I saw it safe in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and put it into the table drawer with the brush—I found the comb was gone—the prisoner had not been there that day—there had been no one there that day that I know of that would have taken the comb—we had no visitors.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>said coming to her house, annoying her, and putting her in bodily fear—I searched the prisoner—I saw him put his hands behind him—I proceeded with the search, and found this comb and chisel, and two or three other things on him—the comb was placed on the table—Mrs. Todd said, "It is my comb, and now I know who robbed me"—that was all she said—she gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody—the chisel I found on him was bent—I afterwards examined the window and the shutter—I had these two pieces of wood that supported the sash given to me by Mrs. Snell—I found they fitted into the frame of the window to support the upper sash—I think Mrs. Snell gave me the pieces of wood on the Saturday afternoon, and then I observed some marks on them—I had kept the chisel in my possession from the time I found it—upon comparing the chisel with the marks on the wood I found they corresponded—I also found some marks on the window sash which corresponds with this chisel—I should think it would require some force to press these supporters out, and such as would bend this chisel—it is bent as if it had been used for something of the kind—I noticed that when the shutter was up the bolt was a little above the lower sash—if a person was endeavouring to effect an entrance from out<lb></lb>side I should think the lower sash must be lowered in order to get at the bolts—they being above the lower sash, it would not be necessary to open the lower sash to do it—I should not think that the bolts are visible from the outside—shortly after the comb and chisel were found the prisoner asked me to give him the comb—Mrs. Todd had made the remark that it was hers before that—I said to the prisoner, "You hear what Mrs. Todd charges you with?"—he said, "I merely came to ask her"—Mrs. Todd interrupted him by saying he used her cruelly—I asked where he lived—he said somewhere in Long-acre—I asked where—he said he should not tell me.</p>

Bank Notes and 10 l. in Money; and accordingly he brought me back the two Bank Notes and ten Pounds in Cash for the Draught. I was not very well. I was at Mr. Neal's House in Million-Bank, and he brought me the Notes up into my Daughter's Chamber: I put them into my Purse, and the Purse into my Pocket. When I came Home I lock'd them up in my Buroe, in my own Bed-Chamber. This was over-Night; and the next Morning the Prisoner came up to know my Orders, and I had Occasion to send him to the Toy-Shop: He came close to my Dressing-Table to have his Order; I got up and went to my Buroe to take my Purse and give him the Studs that were in it; I turn'd my Purse inside-out upon the Table, Money and Notes -</p>

            . Yes, my Lord. I did this to find the two Studs that were at the Bottom of the Purse. After this, I put the Money again into the Purse, and going to put the Notes in, said I, Here is but one Bank Note; the other Note was gone. Look, Madam, said he, is it not upon the Ground? Well, we search'd diligently, but it could not be found. I look'd, and said it was not on the Ground. I did not charge him with taking it, nor mistrust him, as he had liv'd with me between two and three Years. I sent him into the City to Mr. Neale's, to know whether it did not slip out of my Hand in putting them into my Purse; but there was none found there. After this he (Mr. Neal) went with me to the Bank, to stop the Payment of the Note: The Prisoner also went there with me. Then I thought no more of it.</p>

The Prisoner, my Lord, came to my Shop in Cheapside: I am a Linnen-Draper, and he came and bought Cloth of my Man to the Amount of 2 l. 13 s. after which he presented the Bill to my Man and desired Change, and truly I did not care to change it for so little Money being laid out: But, however, I bid my Man run down with it to the Bank, and see whether it was a good Note. But my Servant returning, tells me that the Payment of it was stopt at the Bank, which I immediately acquainted the Prisoner with, and told him that I would go with him to the Bank, to know the Reason of it. As we were going along I asked him about his receiving it, and he said that he receiv'd it of one Sands, a Barber in Holborn; and he speaking broad, I asked him whether he was a Scoth Hair Merchant? and he said that he was, and that he had given for the Bank-Note 12 l. in Hair and 8 l. in Money. He was then well dress'd, like a Merchant; he had on a Snuff-colour'd Coat, a Silk Waistcoat of the same Colour, and a white Wig. He gave in his Name at the Bank,

He said his Name was Turner, and that he lived at the Blue Boar at Turn-Stile in Holborn. My Lord, I did believe him to be entirely innocent to the last Degree, for he had a very steady Countenance and an Air of Honesty; and therefore I offer'd my Service to go along with him to Mr. Neal's, to know the Reason why the Note was stopt, for it appear'd at the Bank that it was stopt by Mr. Neal. He made no Scruple to go to Mr. Neal; but as we were walking along in Lombard-Street, I turn'd about to speak to him, and he was gone. Mr. Neal lives in a Court in Lombard-Street.

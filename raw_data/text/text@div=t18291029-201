            . On the 10th of September I was with Rierdon - we watched the two prisoners for a few minutes - they stopped at a pawnbroker's; West left the other, and went into the shop - I followed him, and saw him with these shoes on the counter; I went to the door, and told Rierdon to go on - he went and took Lilley, who was then going away; I went and asked West where he got the shoes - he said a young man at the door gave them to him to pawn; I asked if he ever saw that young man before - he said No: I took him to the door, and said, "Is this the young man?" he said No; I said,"I saw you in conversation with him" - I took them to the office; I did not know who they belonged to, but I saw the name of E. Driver, Esq. on them, looked in the Court Guide, and found him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You saw the shoes in the shop? A. Yes - that was the first I saw of them; he denied that Lilley was the person who gave them to him.</p>

There was nothing but "Driver" on the shoes; I told the officer the person was waiting at the corner of the street, and if he would allow me to go to the corner I should be able to clear myself - he said, "No, I have got you;" in going to the watch-house he said,"Why don't you, like a good lad, say he gave them to you?" I said, "I will not bring an innocent lad into trouble;" the person asked me where the nearest pawnbroker's was - I said I would pawn them; he said pawn them for 5s. in the name of

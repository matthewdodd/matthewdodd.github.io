               <p>Court. Is that in the parish of St. George's? - Yes; on the 17th and 18th of June last I was robbed of a great many frame cucumbers, and a great many of my vines destroyed, which occasioned me to set a watch, one of my men, and on the 23d of June my man came and called me about ten minutes past one, I took my gun in my hand and went down, and I saw the prisoner and another man, one on each side of the frame, holding up the lights and getting cucumbers; I looked at them sometime, I went about six yards off them, and I told them if they did not surrender themselves, I would shoot them; the man that was at the back of the frames made off immediately, and I took the prisoner by the collar, and as soon as I got hold of him he said, you bloody thief, shoot away! I said, no, I have no occasion to shoot you, I have you safe enough; the other man made off, and my man shot at him as he went.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing taken away broken or destroyed? - The prisoner said some little time after, says he, what do you want with me, says I to take care of you; says he I ha lost my shoe, I insist on your finding my shoe; we brought him down to the watch-house, and when I came back there was a bag full of cucumbers and his shoe, I have his shoe here, they were laying at the frame and pretty near together.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you observe whether a great number of cucumbers had been cut from your frames or not? - Yes, there had been a great number cut, they had stepped into the lights.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said before the magistrate that he was drinking with a strange man at Westminster, and that this strange man brought him into my ground, and gathered some onions and cucumbers, and gave them to him.</p>

               <p>I was in the ground, but as to the cucumbers I never saw nor touched them.</p>
               <p>What business had you in the ground? - I was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he in liquor?</p>
               <p>Sprang and Townley. He was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have not a friend in the world, I rely on your Lordship's mercy, I was born in the West Indies; I have been here seven months, I have been about six weeks from Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of the cucumbers?</p>
               <p>Sprang. I valued the fruit cut and damaged at ten pounds, what they trod upon and gathered I could not count.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that a low valuation? - Yes, fifteen pounds would not make me amends.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the charge is under a particular act of parliament, which makes it felony to cut, pluck up, or destroy, any plants, roots, or shrubs, of the value of five shillings.</p>

On the 24th of November I was coming from the drawing-room; I stopped in a little room, where the lady's maid and the nursery-maid sat at work - I heard a noise down stairs; I ran down, and at the butler's pantry, where the plate is kept, I saw the prisoner, who was a stranger; I asked what business he had there - I callede him a thief, and said, "You are after the plate;" he said, "I am not after the plate - I came to see whether the chimneys want sweeping or dusting;" I said, "Why did not you knock at the door?" he said he got his bread in an honester way than thieving - he took off his jacket, and shook it; I was simple enough to let him go - when he was gone I counted the plate, and missed all these soons - I ran up the steps, and saw him turn into Park-street; I went and got the officer to follow him - he brought him back, but the spoons are lost; I am certain he is the man - the spoons were all safe when he came to our house.</p>

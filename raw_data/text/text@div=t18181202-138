On the 6th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our shop, and said he wanted a little tea and sugar, as his wife had been put to bed that morning, and could not come herself, but she dealt at my shop, and asked him to come, as she thought I would give him change, knowing her to deal with me. I served him with the tea sugar, and other things amounting to about 2 s. He then gave me a 1 l. bank note.

On the 4th or 5th of November the prisoner came to our shop, and bought half an ounce of tobacco, for which he paid twopence-halfpenny. While I was weighing it, he looked at a hock of bacon, and asked the price; he said his wife had been looking at it the night before, but she had no money, and he was come to fetch it. I said I thought it was wrong, for I had no hock cut out of the side, and I refused to cut it. He said he thought he was right, that it was a hind hock, and he was to give sixpence halfpenny a pound for it. He said his wife was ill, and could not come out for it, and that it was too late for him to come that night when he came home. He then bought some tea and sugar, which came to between two and three shillings, and gave me a 1 l. note. I asked his name and address? He said

Staple. I have known his writing for many years. The line with the date appears to be engraved, in a genuine note it is printed in stereotype. That uttered to Pemberton is also forged in every respect - it is a different note from the other; there is the remains of the name of

            . I am servant to the prosecutors. On the 12th of October, I saw the sugar in the prisoner's hat in his bed-room-it was lump sugar and worth 11d. it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; I first found it and shewed it to the last witness. About an hour afterwards I saw him take it out of his hat, put it in his pocket, and leave the premises. I said nothing to him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL DOBSON. I am an headborough. I was sent for on the 12th of October, at eight o'clock, and watched the prisoner out of the premises; I missed him and went home. In about an hour after I was sent for, and found him in the custody of White, and took him to the watchhouse; his master came in and charged him with stealing the sugar - He told one of the men that he took it out of the copper. I found some sugar-dust in his pocket - He said he sold the sugar to a person of the name of Ward; I took him to Ward's house, and found Ward there; I asked him where the sugar was that the man brought that morning - He brought out about one pound and three ounces of moist, and twelve ounces of lump; he said he gave 6d. for it. I found two pounds of sugar on the premises - He said he bought it all of the prisoner.</p>

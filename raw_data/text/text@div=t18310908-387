The prisoner Croft was in the habit of coming to the house, to go on errands, but was not regularly employed. On the 23rd of August, about one o'clock in the day, I had this spoon in use in the kitchen; I saw Croft standing by the kitchen door, about six o'clock, and about nine I missed the spoon - I found it at the office next morning.</p>

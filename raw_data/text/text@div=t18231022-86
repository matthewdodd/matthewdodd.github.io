            . I am a bookbinder, and have known the prisoner a long time. On the 27th of September, in the evening, he came to me, and said he had got the pointer out of the synagogue. I was flurried at the moment, and did not know what to do - he did not produce it; he said, if I would buy it, he would sell it to me. I said I would have nothing to do with it, and the best thing he could do would be to return it to his father, and have it returned to the committee; he said he wanted money, and wished to dispose of it. I thought I had better consult my father, and went to the synagogue to him - he came home. I told him of it, and he went away. The prisoner took the pointer out of his bosom at a public-house. where I saw him, and shewed it to me for a moment - it was round his neck; he opened his waistcoat, and took it out, and put it in again. I was urging him to take it back; my father then came to the public-house, and said as nobody was at home, he wished us to come and sit with him - we went; the prisoner's father and brother were concealed in the kitchen, ready to take him.</p>

            . I am beadle of the synagogue. I believe I saw the prisoner in the synagogue, on the 27th of September; I took him into custody, at ten o'clock at night, in bed, at his father's, and took him to the watch-house. I saw him next day in the lock-up room of the Mansion-house; he said he secreted himself in a cupboard under the staircase, at the further end of the synagogue, and staid there an hour after service, then went to the ark with a key, which was left in some other place, and opened the door with it, and took the pointer out - that the bells and other ornaments made such a noise, he was afraid to take any more, and he got out when they opened the ladies' gallery.</p>

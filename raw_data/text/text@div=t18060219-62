             sworn. I am a watchman of St. Pancras. After calling the hour of two o'clock in the morning, I saw a man coming along Tottenham-Court road with a bundle under his left arm, I followed him by an alarm given by a St. Giles's watchman of the opposite side; he came out of the road on the foot way, and when he found that I was after him, he threw this bag from him, with this lead in it, he went as far as Windmill-street, there I stopped him and brought him back; coming back, I picked this bag up, I searched him at the watch-house, I found in his pocket these two boxes, this bag, two gimblets, a shutter stud, and part of a lid of a seat; I went back to the building, I found the other part of the seat, and this ladle that he took the lead out of, I put the lead in the ladle, it fitted exactly the bowl.</p>

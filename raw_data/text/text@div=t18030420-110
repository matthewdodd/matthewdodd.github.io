I belong to the Westminster militia; the prisoner came into my quarters at Brentford, the sign of the Goat, about half after four o'clock, and said that he had enlisted with James Brisley; he said he was very much distressed, and wished to swap his hat for another old one; this is the hat; I gave him also 3s. I swap'd with him for the serjeant.</p>

               <p>Who has had the care of it? - It was two days in the public-house, in the cellar, I wrote my name at the top of it when I took it from him; it is written in ink on the cloth, it has been in my custody all but those two days; I saw it in the shop some days before; I saw it the day it was lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Wallis, that cloth you marked, is the cloth you took from the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But before that, was there any mark upon it? - All the mark was, that there was a piece cut out of it, no particular mark besides.</p>
               <p>It is a remnant, is it not? - Yes.</p>

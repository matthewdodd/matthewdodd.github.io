On the 10th of December I was in the office, and saw him pass into the yard; as he went down the steps I saw silk between his breeches and his apron - I told Pope to wait there till he returned; Pope then desired him to walk in to Mr. Ackroyd, the elder, who asked him for the skein of silk which he had in his possession; he said he had none. Ackroyd said he had, and desired he would give it him. After a little hesitation, he took a skein out of his pocket, and said he meant to return it. Ackroyd asked him if he had any more? he said No. Shires was sent for, and found in all nineteen skeins on him - four of which were were fastened with thread to a button of his breeches, and suspended between his thighs.</p>

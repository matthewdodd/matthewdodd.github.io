               <p>Prisoner. You and another gentleman caught hold of me, and I said, "Why not call the gentleman back?" - you said, "I don't want any gentleman - I am sufficient to take you," and then the officer came - they dragged me to the watch-house - the keeper would not take me, and then they took me to Fleet-street - this gentleman said he was a barrister, and he could make a case of it. Witness, He wanted me to let him go, that I might go after the gentleman.</p>

            . I am Ward officer. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, about half-past nine o'clock, and I took charge of him - the gentleman who lost the handkerchief was not there - there was another gentleman with this witness, who said he was going to Edinburgh, and could not attend.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Bigwell. On 20th May, I was at my sister's, Catharine Paraons, in Ironmonger-row, St. Luke's—she went out about 8 o'clock to fetch a loaf for breakfast—while she was gone</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Ironmonger-row. I went out on this morning—I might be gone about ten minutes—when I came back I missed a shawl, a quilt, a night-shirt, and a bottle—they were mine—I knew the prisoner by the description my sister gave me—she had robbed me before—I went to look for her, but did not find her—I afterwards found her going into a public-house with my shawl on her back, and one of her own shawls over it—I took my shawl from her, and charged her with having taken the night-shirt and quilt—she had some halfpence in her hand, and I said, "I suppose the money you have got is what you sold my things for?"—she said what she had got neither I nor anybody else should have; the gin-shop should have it—I gave her in charge—this is my shawl—I never gave her authority to pawn these things.</p>

            . The prisoner was in the same house with me. I had occasion to go backwards, and the prisoner followed me; and before I had buttoned my breeches up, he knocked me down; and the blow he gave me, took my breath away. He put his knee upon my breast; he then took my watch out of my pocket, and a ring from my finger, and a brooch from my breast, and the money from my pockets together with a smart ticket. I then made for the tap-room as quick as I could, and he tried to get in before me; and when I got to the tap-room door, he gave me a blow on the back of the neck, finding he could not get in before me, which knocked me down two steps into the tap-room, with my head against a settle. He then ran out, and it was a week after before he was taken up. I have seen my watch again, and that is all.</p>

               <p>ANN COLLIER. I saw them go out into the yard, and the prisoner in coming back, ran by me like a dart.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH FELLOWES. I am a pawnbroker, in Princes-street, Soho. I produce the watch which was pawned by the prisoner on the 29th of March. I advanced a guinea upon it; I am positive as to his person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soap-manufacturer in High-street, Wap<lb></lb>ping, my premises are by the river-side, close to where the Tunnel will open, at the bottom of Old Gravel-lane; the back of the premises is bounded by Brewhouse-lane—Brosnan has been in my employ about two years, and was employed in the fancy soap-manufactory, which was then at the back of the premises adjoining Brewhouse-lane—there is another soap-maker's at the top of Old Gravel-lane, and a small manufactory about the centre of Old Gravel-lane, but not very near my premises. On the 23rd of September, the witness Austin called at my counting-house, and gave me some information—I directed him to go and look among my men—he came back and gave me some further information—in consequence of what he told me, I called Brosnan before me, not in Austin's presence—my son, who was in the counting-house, first said to him, "You have robbed us"—he replied, "You cannot prove that"—I immediately said, "That is no answer, you have robbed me"—he turned exceedingly pale and became much agitated—he caught hold of the bars in the counting-house before the desk, and after a little while he said, "It is too true;" or I have robbed you"—I cannot exactly say which of the two sentences he uttered, but either one or the other he certainly said—I asked him to what extent—he said, "Not to much"—I said, was it to the extent of 5cwt.?—he said, it might be—I said, perhaps it was half a ton, for I began to be a little alarmed—he said, yes, it might be half a ton—I then said to him, "Now, it will be better for you to tell the whole"—I afterwards desired him to go to his work, and sent for an officer—he was taken into custody about ten minutes afterwards—after being in custody about a fortnight he was discharged—he never had any authority to sell any soap—from the extent of my stock a considerable quantity might easily be taken away without its being missed.</p>

                  </hi>.

I have done it, and he has returned the money to me—I remember a man called <hi rend="italic">Patty</hi> being there—he is an Irish-man—Patrick, I believe, is his right name—he goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Patty</hi>—he has been there a good many times—on one occasion when <hi rend="italic">Patty</hi> was there, Mason said to his wife, "Move the soap into the kitchen, and don't let <hi rend="italic">Patty</hi> know we get any from Wapping"—I remember the day on which Mason was apprehended—I watched his house for some time after that, and I law the prisoner Brosnan leave the door.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time in the day was the basket taken out after you heard the wife say a letter had come from Wapping? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes I left off work at half-past five o'clock—that is our regular hour, and about a quarter be<lb></lb>fore six I returned home, and I have seen Mason take the basket, likewise I have seen him send a young man with a basket to Wapping—it was al<lb></lb>ways in the evening I saw it, after I came from work—he was gone about two hours and a half—I have had a quarrel with him—he did not turn me put of the house—I paid my rent honourably every week—he never called in the police to get me out of the house—I swear that—I was never taken into custody by the police by his directions—I have been in custody of the police, but was never taken out of that house—he did give me in charge of the police, about nine days after I left—it was in the court</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was that you said about a robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told you that he had me locked no because I accused him of being a thief, or receiving stolen goods, and an assault—I did accuse him of receiving stolen goods nine days before he charged me with the assault—he brought an action against me—at least I had a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been locked up in the station-house before you went to Mr. Charles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the action was not brought against me for a fortnight after I went to Mr. Charles—I know Messrs. Price—Mason did not work for them at the time he sent me to the station—I do not know how long ago he worked for them—I went down there, and Mr. Price was not at home, and I wrote a note to Sir Charles Price—that was before I was put into the station—it was after I had left his lodging—I did not leave the lodging on account of any quarrel—Mr. Price came to me in consequence of the note I had written to him—I do not know how soon it was after I left the prisoner's lodgings—it must have been within nine days—he did not con<lb></lb>tinue in Messrs. Prices' service, notwithstanding what I said to Mr. Price—he had warning at that time—I have seen Mr. Price a good many times—I saw him yesterday.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames-police. I apprehended Mason at his house in Norfolk-street, Blackfriars-road, on the 10th of October—I had been to his house about a dozen times before, but was not able to see him—I made an arrangement with his wife, not in my police dress, and saw him—I then took him, and told him that we were come to take him into custody for receiving a quantity of soap belonging to Mr. Charles, of Wapping, from a man who went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Mike,</hi> who worked for Mr. Charles—he said he did not know such a man—I told him he was a tall man, with a patch on his eye—he said he knew nothing of him—he was afterwards placed in company with Brosnan at the office—they</p>

               <p>appeared to know each other then—he spoke to him—Brosnan had previously been apprehended and discharged—in consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion on the following Sunday, I went on the Friday to Mason's house, and saw Brosnan and his wife go into Mason's house, remain there some time, and then come out again—when I apprehended Mason, and told him what it was for, he said he knew nothing of it, but he knew who bad done it—his wife came in at the time, and she said, "Yes, that fellow at the top of the street" (meaning Austin), and Mason said Austin bad done it—Aus<lb></lb>tin's name was mentioned several times by Mason—I told him we had a man named Eastman in custody—he said he knew nothing about him—I asked if he knew him, he had been a porter—he said he knew nothing about him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Price. Mason was in their employ as warehouseman from September 10th, 1840, to September 11th, 1841, this year—he came at six o'clock in the morning precisely, and never left till eight in the evening, except the hour for dinner—there was no other time allowed for meals during the day—it was my business to be in the warehouse, so as to know that he was there—he was the most regular man from his meals that we had on the premises, and he bore one of the very best of characters for honesty.</p>

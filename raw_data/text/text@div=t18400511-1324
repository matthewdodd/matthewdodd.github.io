                  </hi>. I live in Hampstead-road. On Thursday afternoon, the 9th of April, about half-past three o'clock, I was walking opposite St. Giles's church, and saw the prisoner staring at me very hard—he was with another man—I am certain of the prisoner—I ob<lb></lb>served his features and appearance at the time—when I got opposite Lau<lb></lb>rence-street he came up to me, and pulled hold of my bag—the string was twisted round my finger several times, and I held it in front of me—he pulled at it three or four times—the string then broke, and he ran up Lau<lb></lb>rence-street with the bag—it contained a purse, a sovereign, one shilling, a pocket-handkerchief, and a key—I went into a shop, and asked them to send for a policeman—they did so—I gave him a description of the pri<lb></lb>soner, and about half-past five o'clock the policeman brought him to my house—I knew him again directly.</p>

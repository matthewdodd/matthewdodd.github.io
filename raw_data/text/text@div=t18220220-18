I found the duplicate of a pelisse and shirt on her - I asked her where her mistresses property was, she said she knew nothing about it. While Frost was gone into the pawnbroker's, she told me I should find the things in a front garret, at a cook's shop, where she lodged, in Liquorpond-street; she had a padlock key in her pocket which opened the door. I there found a number of things, but I did not know which they were, as she lodged there with another person. I had her brought, to point out the property, and she pointed out the bed, bolster, and several other things, which we brought away.</p>

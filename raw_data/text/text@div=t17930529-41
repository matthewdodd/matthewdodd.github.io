               <p>Prisoner. I unfortunately lived and cohabited with this here woman, and I believe, who has been the perpetrator of the act, and to screen herself has entirely laid it on me: I know no more of Bunyan's things nor never handled any thing of them, or took any thing out of the room; I met that woman in the street on the 2d of March; she told me she lived in Corbert's-court; did not know Mr. or Mrs. Bunyan before she said if I would come and be with her as usual she would be glad; accordingly I went with her, she took me up stairs into the chamber and walked round the room, after some few words passed I said, I suppose these things to be none of your own; she said they were not, but part were and part were Mr. Bunyan's; I then asked her what she paid a week rent for the room? she told me half a crown; on Saturday night following she asked me for the money, she said she had no money to pay her rent; I asked her what the rent was? she said, three shillings; I thought she wanted to impose upon me to get the six-pence for herself. I am very sorry, my lord, if the law allows by my paying for that week's rent to be brought into a scrape for what is done; I went to Mrs. Bunyan's and paid the two shillings and six-pence, little thought what I was to come to through that, I stayed there the whole three weeks; in the course of this time I found one morning a sheet pawned off my bed, I said to

Another time I came home in the day time I missed a saucepan, I asked her what she had done with it? I said, I hoped she had not pawned the saucepan; she said, no, Mrs. Bunyan had got it down stairs for her own use. Another time I found a different quilt on the bed to what I saw at first, I was then told that Mrs. Bunyan had changed it; I told her I did not chuse to stay with her any longer, and then I found out this quilt she had pawned; I then gave her the money to fetch it out again, and insisted on her fetching it home; she went out and when she returned she brought a quilt, which I thought was the same that she had first when I came away, I did not know whether she meant to stay there or not, she told me she should stay, and I sees no more of her for five or six days, when I was accidently going through the street and she called after me, she then told me that she had got a room in Twister's-alley and had left Mr. Bunyan's; I then went home with her into Twister's-alley. On the 24th of April Mr. Armstrong and Mrs. Bunyan came up into the room, as soon as Mrs. Bunyan came up she took up a pair of bellows, she said they were her property; I never carried them to the place where they were, nor was I there till after the bellows were there; the things which Mrs. Bunyan calls her mattrass was joined to another piece which we made use of for a bed, being stuffed with straw; I was then carried before a magistrate, when I came there

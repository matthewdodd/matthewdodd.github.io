            . On the night of the 11th of November, I was locked out of my masters house, and was walking down Drury-lane, between twelve and one, when the prisoner accosted me, and I went home with her to <placeName id="t18151206-90-crimeloc504">Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

I went to bed with her, and fell asleep immediately, and never awoke until about half past five in the morning. I put my hand on the table to feel for my watch, where I had left it, and found it was gone. I then got up, and felt about for my clothes, and I found them all safe except my braces. I found twenty shillings were gone out of my left hand waistcoat pocket. I then went to the door, and found it fastened outside. I knew what sort of a neighbourhood I was in, and did not like to make a noise. When it was light, a man came and let me out, and I asked him if he knew anything about the woman, and he said no.</p>

            . The last witness came to me, in company with Parsons, and informed me that he had been robbed of his watch, chain, seals, handkerchief, and braces. I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and knocked at the door, but she refused me admittance; and I told her who I was; I told her I should break open the door, if she did not; and I did break open the door, and she was lying on the bed in her clothes. Between the sacking and the bed. I found this pair of braces. I then told her I must search her person, and on searching it, I found this handkerchief tied round her body, under her clothes.</p>

             - he lives in Broad Arrow-court. On the 27th of July I was on the Pavement, near Finsbury - I saw Farley lift up the gentleman's coat, take out the handkerchief, and give it to Hay, who went down a street, across the road - Hay put it into his hat; the prisoners then met together again - Farley had been a school-fellow of mine; I had seen Hay in Milton-street.</p>
               <p>Farley. He said at the office he could not see what was taken out. Witness. I could not see at the time, but when he got across the road I saw it was a handkerchief; he held it up in his hand.</p>

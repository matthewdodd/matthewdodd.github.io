Hayes lived with us for one week as servant—on Friday, the 5th of December, my husband went out—the money was in the cupboard, and the other property on the table in the bed-room—I saw them secure at about eight o'clock on Friday morning—I locked the bed-room door, and hung the key up in the bar at eight o'clock—I went to the room again about two o'clock in the af<lb></lb>ternoon—Mary was at home then—I found the door locked—I unlocked the door and locked it again—I missed nothing then, but I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther it was gone—I hung the key in the bar, in the usual way—I did not go to the room again till I went to bed, which was between four and five o'clock in the morning—I then found the lock broken off the door, and the wood work broken away—I went in, and missed all the property front the table and out of the cupboard—Mary knew where the key hung—I missed all the property stated in the indictmeut—an officer was sent for at half-past ten o'clock on Saturday morning—business prevented our sending</p>

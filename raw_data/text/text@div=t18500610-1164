                  </hi>. I live in Eccleston-place, Pimlico. had a silver watch in my bed-room—I saw it safe about twelve o'clock on Sunday, 2nd June, and missed it at half-past nine on Monday morning—on the Friday afterwards, in consequence of something I heard, I went to Samuels' shop—I asked him about the watch—he asked me 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I offered him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he showed me the watch which had been stolen from me on the Sunday before—before he gave it me, I told him I did not wish to prosecute, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

In consequence of directions, I went to Samuels' house, 33, Strutton-ground, on the Tuesday after the Sunday—a woman named Murray, who is not here, went with me—she pointed out Samuels, and said, "That is the man to whom the watch was sold"—he denied it, and said, "I have no watch; I have seen no watch"—Daniels was brought to the shop, and he said likewise that was the man, but I did not hear what was said between them—on the Wednesday I went again to Samuels—I said I heard he bad had the watch—he said, "Yes, I had it, and changed it away, but could get it again"—I told him he would have to appear as a witness, and he had better keep it till the following Tuesday—I told him the inspector warned him not to part with it—he wanted to know the inspector's name, which I gave him in writing.</p>

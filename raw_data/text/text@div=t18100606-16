On Monday the 28th Mr. Lee brought the prisoner into our shop, and the print, and about a quarter of an hour before I had laid the print on the counter within three yards of the door.

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of May a little after seven o'clock, I was passing down Ludgate-hill, in company with Hardy, I observed the prisoner whom I knew to be a suspicious character go into Mr. Laming's shop. I set Hardy upon the watch, I sent for assistance, I did not see the assistance I expected on Ludgate Hill. I returned and saw the prisoner within three or four doors of Mr. Laming's, towards Fleet-market; she was alone walking very brisk, she went down Fleet-market, and then I stopped her; I asked her what she had got in her apron; she made no answer but instantly gave it me out of her apron, this is the piece, I told her I knew where it came from, I took her back to Mr. Laming's.</p>
               <p>Q Was the linen claimed by Laming's people - A. Yes, instantly as I took her in the shop; I have had the linen ever since in my possession.</p>
               <p>- HARDY. I was on the opposite side of the way and saw the prisoner go into Mr. Laming's shop, I saw her go in twice she came to the door and went in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060013"></xptr>again; when she came out I followed her with Lee, she turned up a court, two other persons were with her, they all three went up the pawnbroker's court, a woman that was with her gave the property to her at the pawnbroker's door in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons had been in the shop besides this woman - A. Two others, the prisoner came out first, the two others came out in about two minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all go up the pawnbroker's passage - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lee join you at the time - A. He joined me coming up the hill; I accompanied Lee till he stopped the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up in the pawnbroker's court, I was never in the shop so help me God, in Fleet-market the gentleman came up to me, I said, if it is your's take it, nobody gave it me; I picked it up and saw no owner to it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.to Hardy. Did you see the woman come out of the shop - A. I saw the other woman take it out of her apron and deliver it to the prisoner.</p>

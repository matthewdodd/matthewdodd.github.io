            . I belong to a brig, which laid in Bellwharf tier. On the 30th of August I was at the Paviors' Arms public-house. I changed a sovereign, and laid out 9d.; I then had 19s. 3d., which I put into my pocket, with a medal of the late Duke of York - I saw the prisoner at the house, and gave her something to drink; I had a bad bowel complaint, and asked her to show me a bed - she took me to a house, and I laid down with my waistcoat on; I vomited, and then went to sleep - I awoke about half-past three o'clock, and found my pockets entirely emptied; I was alone in the room - I went and described her at the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. How much did you have at the house? A. A pint of beer, and half a pint of gin; I did not drink it all - I did not notice how many girls were there; I treated nobody but the prisoner - I merely went to out of the room - I did not send her out for gin, nor give her any money at all.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the evening of the 31st of August, I found Shilton at the door of a noted brothel, in <placeName id="t18310908-342-crimeloc1762">Isaacs-buldings, Bluegate-fields</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was he not very much intoxicated? A. Not at all; the first thing the prisoner said to me was," Is the man got out of bed."</p>
               <p>(Medal produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Priosner's Defence. What he says is false; if he changed a sovereign it was before I was in his company- when I went in he sat there drinking; he asked me and ten other females to drink - he then asked me to show him a bed, which he gave 1s. 6d. for; he gave me 5s. 9d.</p>

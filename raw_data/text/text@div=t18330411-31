               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She said she had got them from her sister-in-law? A. Yes; I had not told her that her sister-in-law had acknowledged to giving them to her - she had the opportunity of taking them herself; I did not say, that if she gave them up I would not prosecute - I owed the prisoner seven weeks wages, at 10l. a-year.</p>

            ; we live at Battersea. I called on the prisoner, who is my sister-in-law, at Mrs. Richardson's; I think it was on the 12th of February; Mrs. Richardson came to my house, and found these articles - my sister gave me a bundle; I did not open it- I do not know whether these are the articles; I did not see what was in it - a man brought it to my house; I had not seen any articles at Mr. Richardson's - the bundle was given to me, but I do not know what was in it; I did not receive any thing in the prosecutor's house, but in the street, when the prisoner came out with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now, let me caution you; you will certainly be sent to Newgate if you do not give a true account? A. When the prisoner came out she gave me some things in a bundle, and a man took them home - I had not taken the man with me; he was a stranger to me - I went to the prosecutor's house about two o'clock, and came away about five - I did not see what was in the bundle; I walked part of the way with the man, and then rode home - the man carried the articles upon his shoulder, I suppose - I paid him for carrying them - when Mrs. Richardson came to my house she found the things up stairs in my bed-room- I had not opened them; she had no trouble in going up stairs - she said if the things were given up without a search-warrant, she would not interfere any more in it; she said she supposed I knew the business she came on; I said No, I did not - she said Elizabeth had been robbing her, and she had come for the things which were brought from her house last night; I said, I had not brought any thing - she did not claim a piece of carpet which was on the floor - I said I had nothing but that old piece of carpet, which Elizabeth had given me some time before, but I do not know when - I do not know whether there was a child's toy, called a Noah's Ark, at my house; I do not know whether the prosecutrix asked me for a piece of coarse cloth - I do not remember that I denied having it; I do not know whether she found it at my house, as the things were all in a bundle - she followed me up stairs, and the things were on the floor.</p>
               <p>MRS. RICHARDSON. I knew her sister lived at Batterses, and for that reason I went there: the prisoner had been staying with her before she came to me - my French teacher came to me for my cook to have two hours' absence on the day her sister came to my house; when I went to the prisoner's sister's, I left word for the prisoner not to leave my house till I returned, but she ran away five minutes after I was gone; she came the next day to demand her wages - this old piece of carpet was on her sister's floor at Battersea; these other pieces, which were in the bundle, are pieces of my drawing-room carpet - I know this cloth by a cut which I made in it; I compared it with what remains, and it makes up the exact quantity I had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have heard Eliza Newman examined - is it true that you had considerable trouble before you saw the things? A. Yes, she said she had nothing of mine, and I had no right to come without a search-warrant - I said I thought she would like me better to come alone; the things were not tied up - I could see what they were.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ARKELL (Police-constable N 68.) I took the prisoner the next day - I went in at the back of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110024"></xptr>house, and found her sitting in the passage in a chair, and this property by her side.</p>
               <p>MRS. RICHARDSON. These are my property; they had been kept in the servants' bed-room, at the back of the kitchen.</p>

            , brewers, in Little Pulteney-street, Golden-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, perfectly well; he was a <rs id="t17970215-29-deflabel153" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17970215-29-defend282 t17970215-29-deflabel153"></join> in the brewery; I gave orders, under the direction of Mr. Jennings, to a number of draymen to start some beer; William Burnaby was one of the draymen, and Cutlan was employed to assist in unloading the casks in a remote cellar, under a chapel between Hpokins-street and Berwick-street, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. What beer was this that was to be started? - A. Ale.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a guile of beer? - A. One whole brewing.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by starting? - A. Breaking the beer while it is young out of small vessels into larger ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Into whose vessels where they to be put? - A. Mr. Jennings's and Mr. Starkey's; this was a remote cellar belonging to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many vessels or casks were put upon the dray that evening? - A. Fifteen half hogsheads; I am the delivering clerk; he called me out to enter his load in a book which we had for the purpose, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these fifteen half hogsheads of one guile, or different guiles? - A. All of one guile, having no other in the store-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number of that guile, part of which you sent out that evening? - A. It was marked A. A. 63.</p>
               <p>Q. When you send out casks, do they bear the number of the guile upon them? - A. Yes; these were all marked 63.</p>
               <p>Q. In the state in which this beer was sent from your brewery to this cellar, was it in a state in which you sell it, or was it too new for sale? - A. It was too new for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they take the guile away? - A. Between eleven and twelve at night we set off.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a time that you deliver beer to customers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time on that evening afterwards receive information of a loss? - A. Yes, after one o'clock I received information from a watchman, who was sent by another watchman of the name of Ireland; in consequence of which I went to St. James's watch-house, and found Cutlan in custody; Ireland was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you and Cutlan? - A. Yes; I asked him what he had been doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any threats? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any promise to induce him to confess? - A. No; he said it was a cask of ale which they had left upon the dray out of the load under a mistake; he said he was fearful to bring it home, that I should fine him, or make words.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Between one and two in the morning in the watch-house; after that I went with Ireland, and the beadle and another watchman, to the dwelling-house of Thomas Rogers, in Portland-street, which runs from Poland-street to Berwick-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The same man that was taken into custody upon this business? - A. Yes; his back door opens into Portland Mews, the front door is in Portland-street; I knocked at the door and got admittance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any cask there? - A. Yes, I did; in going down into a back kitchen I found a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to know whether that was one of the fifteen casks you delivered out that evening? - A. Yes; I am positively sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark was there upon that cask? - A. It was marked

            63, which I pointed out to Rogers at the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that cask full or empty at the time? - A. It was empty when I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been emptied recently, or for a long time? - A. Within an hour, I am sure, from the yeast and the fob adhering to the bung-hole, and the cask was still draining.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the fob? - A. The froth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that was your master's, and had been recently emptied? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it was one of the fifteen casks loaded upon that dray? - A. I cannot swear that it was one of the casks upon that dray, because we sent out more drays than that the same evening of that guile; but I am positive it was one of the casks sent out that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the cellar in Hopkins-street, from Rogers's house? - A. From a quarter of a mile to half a mile, to the best of my judgment,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150050"></xptr>and then we took Rogers into custody, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You state the firm of this house to be Messrs. Jennings and Starkey? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any body else interested in that business? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know, in fact, either one way or the other? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Rogers before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, in fact, Rogers dealt for beer at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not very astonishing then, that he should have beer of your's, that you had sold him, in his possession? - A. No; but we never delivered any beer to his dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you did not deliver any beer at his dwelling-house, was it not his practice to have beer from you at your warehouse, and he took it home? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he did not buy beer at your master's warehouse, and then had it removed? - A. No; he used to come for the beer, and take it where he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks did this guile or brewing consist of? - A. I cannot justly say how many there were.</p>
               <p>Q. More than fifteen I should think? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many more? - A. Above one hundred more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the casks of that guile marked the same as the casks that you sent out? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my learned friend there were other drays went out, with casks marked in the same way as this? - A. Yes; exactly in the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. How many drays think you? - A. Eight more, not different drays, but they went eight different turns; there were two different drays besides the one in question, drove by different people, of the same guile and brewing.</p>
               <p>Q. Going out that very same evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks do you think were loaded upon each dray? - A. Five.</p>
               <p>Q. If they are all marked in the same way, appearing to be of the same guile, it is impossible for you to say upon which dray this particular cask, which was found at Mr. Rogers's, went? - A. Certainly, I said so before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other person that went with the prisoner along with his dray? - A. This prisoner was not sent with the dray, he was sent to assist in filling the empty vessels.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not go with the dray? - A. Not from the brew house-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time the dray went out of your yard? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went away with the dray? - A. William Burnaby only, he called me to take his load, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Burnaby is the man that was taken up upon this charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he had the care of these casks to take them to Hopkins street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Burnaby has told such a story before the Magistrate, that he has admitted him as an accomplice? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. He was concerned in this business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He has been admitted an evidence for the prosecution? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Not know he is a witness? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not know he is going to be examined? - A. Yes, I know he is coming to be examined; I don't know that he is going to give evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. If he was not examined, you know he would be tried for this charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he it was to whom they were delivered, and who drove the dray; and the prisoner was not to meet him, till he got to Hopkins-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was in the situation of a hindman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A situation inferior to that of Burnaby's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Though Mr. Rogers was a customer of your's, you never used to deliver beer in at his private house? - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of that guile bargained for by any customer whatever? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a fit state to sell to customers? - A. No, it was not saleable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever deliver out beer to customers, between twelve and one in the morning? - A. It is not customary.</p>

             sworn. - Examined Mr. Knowlys. I am a watchman of the parish of St. James.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you upon your duty upon the 24th of January, at night? - A. After I had cried the hour of twelve, I saw the prisoner; my beat was then in Poland-street, I had just come on duty; as I was returning from crying the hour of twelve, to my box, I observed a dray at the corner of Portland-street, in Poland-street; the dray was in Poland-street, with the horses heads towards Broad-street; I saw the prisoner at the bar and another man lift a cask off from the dray upon the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the other man was? - A. I cannot say I do; the dray afterwards went off, and likewise the other man, and left the prisoner to roll the barrel up Portland-street; I followed him; and in that street there is a Mews, called Portland-Mews, and I followed him in there with it; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150051"></xptr>in that Mews there is a side door that runs into Mr. Rogers's house, and I saw him take it in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, know that that house belonged to Rogers? - A. I knew the corner house belonged to him, and I thought that that side door might belong to him likewise; upon that I left him; upon seeing him go into this private place to Rogers's, I went out of the yard, and retired to one side of the way out of the Mews into the footway; then there was another watchman, and he and I stood talking by the side of a public-house, at the other corner; and while we were talking, who should come by out of the Mews, but the prisoner; -</p>
               <p>Q. As he was rolling the cask, did it appear to be a full cask or an empty cask? - A. Full; when he came up, says I, my friend, have you lodged that barrel of beer safe; says he, what barrel of beer; says I, that barrel of beer that I saw you take into the place; says he, why? says I, there is no harm in asking a civil question; here, says he, take half-a-crown a piece, and say no more about the matter; I told my brother watchman, since it was so, to assist me in taking him to the watch-house; upon that, he offered me five shillings, and from that to half-a-guinea, and then two guineas between us; and he offered me two guineas all the way, till we got very near the watch-house; and I told him he might as well offer me twenty pounds, for I would not take a farthing; he rather tried to make his escape, but we secured him, and took him to the watch-house, in Little Vine-street, St. James's; when I got him to the watch-house, I gave charge of him upon suspicion; and the constable of the night sent a message to the brew-house; and then Mr. Barker came; and I went with him to Mr. Rogers's house, in Portland-street, the same house that I saw him take the beer in the back way; I went down stairs, and saw a cask among some dust, with the bung-hole downwards, and there was the fresh froth all round the bung-hole; it was lying upon a kind of sink, with dust all round it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a cask of similar size to what you saw rolling? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not pretend to swear that you took so much notice of it, as to be able to say it was the same cask? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The cask you say was a cask that had froth about it, but whether it was the cask you saw rolling, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The fellow who was admitted an evidence, ran away directly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BURNABY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was servant to Messrs. Starkey and Jennings; I was employed to drive the dray; that night we loaded fifteen half hogsheads from the brew-house, in Little Pulteney-street, to be carried to Hopkins-street, where we were to start it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver all the fifteen casks, as it was your duty to do? - A. We delivered fourteen.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the fifteenth? - A. It was taken into Poland-street, the corner of Portland-street, and delivered to Rogers by

               <p>Q. Is one man able to take that off? - A. Yes; and he delivered it to Mr. Rogers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him deliver it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was carried there? - A. Because, after my horses were in the stable, I went to see if it was there or not, that was in the course of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know that Cutlan was to take it to Mr. Rogers? - A. Rogers had spoken before that he would take such a thing, if we could get it for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. And you had the good luck to be made a witness? you had better have been transported a great deal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Now, Honesty, so you come here to give evidence against the prisoner, to save yourself from being tried? - A. Not for that particular, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Public justice, perhaps for honesty's sake? - A. For honesty's sake I told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you tell the truth until you supposed you should be made a witness? - A. I did not suppose that at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you given to understand at Bow-street, that you might be made a witness, if you told the truth? - A. I was admitted so by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you knew you could not be tried for it? - A. No, I could not be tried for it.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore it was that you knew that you could not be tried for it, that you have been telling the story you have been now telling-have you ever been in this Court before? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Never? - A. Never in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor never before any Justice? - A. Only at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did Rogers say this to, that if you could get this thing, he would take it? - A. To my partner the prisoner. and me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had the honesty to consent to it, and the first opportunity you had, you conveyed it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150052"></xptr>him, - you drove the dray? - A. We were both with the dray.</p>
               <p>Q. But you drove it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the weight of one of those casks? - A. I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Pretty bulky is not it? - A. It is heavy enough.</p>
               <p>Q. About twenty-seven gallons is not it? - A. It is called so.</p>
               <p>Q. Pretty heavy for one man is not it? - A. Yes; another man is obliged to help them often-times.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my learned friend, just now, that the prisoner was the person that took the cask out of the dray? - A. Yes; he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not assist in taking it down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you assist him at all? - A. Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing? - A. Standing by the dray with the whip in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. So you mean to have these gentlemen understand that only one person took this cask off the dray? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor you did not give any assistance to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if Ireland, or any body else, has said you were both engaged in taking it off the dray, that is not true? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it usual, if you deliver such beer as that to a customer, for that customer to keep it in such a cask, or is it necessary to empty it? - A. Not at all that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this beer was delivered to an ordinary customer, in the day time, would that customer have kept it in the cask? - A. Yes; all customers that we deliver to keep it in the cask.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Burnaby told me that I was to take that cask to Mr. Rogers's; he got up upon the dray and handed it out, and he said to me, take that cask to Mr. Rogers's; and I took it according to his orders, which I was hired by my master to do, to go by that man's orders.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Jennings.) Q. Has the drayman any authority to order the man to take a cask any where? - A. In general it is so when Burnaby goes out with the dray, but this night they were out upon separate employments; their employments are fixed by the clerk upon these occasions.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Barker.) Q. You were clerk that night? - A. Yes; I had the arrangement, I gave orders to these men to take their different situations.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any order to Cutlan to deliver any beer to Rogers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any orders to Burnaby? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not it sometimes happened that Cutlan has gone out under the directions of Burnaby as the foreman? - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you mean to swear that he did not? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

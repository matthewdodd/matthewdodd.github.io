                  </hi>. I am a clergyman, and live in Shropshire. In July I and my daughters were living at Mr. Low's, Surrey-street, Strand, for about four days—we left on the 19th—the prisoner was servant there—I have every reason to believe I had a watch in my portmanteau—I did not see it while in the house—I missed it when I got back to the country, and directly wrote to Mr. Low—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no doubt this piece of chain is mine, but cannot swear to it.</p>

On 23rd July, Mr. Low spoke to me in the prisoner's presence about this watch—she said she heard a gentleman, who lived in the house, <hi rend="italic">tiptoeing</hi> about the stairs, as if not wishing to be heard—she mentioned a name, but I do not know what—I made inquiries, but found no grounds for suspecting him—on 12th Oct. I was called to take the prisoner—she gave her address, 1, Dean-street, Fetter-lane—I found she lived at 12, Neville's-court, Fetter-lane, in the back parlour; and there I found, in this work-box, this gold watch and guard and other things.</p>

I know nothing of the watch"—she said, "Yes you do; I want you to say that when you brought the body of Mrs. Low's dress home, that Mrs. Low brought the watch in a piece of paper, and asked you to get a new glass put into it"—I said, "Certainly not"—she said, "Oh, do! I would do as much for you if you were in trouble"—I never had a minute's conversation with Mrs. Low about the watch—I gave Mrs. Low this chain at Bow-street.</p>

The prisoner passed me and shoved me against the wall; I put down my hand, and caught hold of his arm; and he attempting to get away, pulled me off the flags into the street pavement: a person behind said, damn him, knock him down: he struck me with the stick I have now, on the cheek; I have the mark now on my face; I was obliged to let him go; he ran through the church-yard; I pursued him, and called stop robber! stop robber! he was about four or five yards before me in the passage: I called out, and a young man tripped him up; I never lost sight of him the whole time; I have no doubt but he is the man that robbed me: I lost half a guinea, nine shillings and sixpence, a pocket handkerchief, and a glove; I lost the money out of my breeches pocket, and the handkerchief and glove out of my coat pocket.</p>

I saw the prisoner running through the passage the end of Holywell-street; I caught hold of the flap of his coat, and he turned round and tried to strike me, and I hulled him down; I picked up this stick. Mr. Moore came up directly: I took him to the watch house; and going along, he threw some money away: and at the corner of Newcastle-street, a fellow shoved me, and took something from the prisoner; and there was a mob raised, and they tried to rescue the prisoner.</p>

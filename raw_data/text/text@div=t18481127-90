                  </hi>. I am a builder at 18, Praed-street, Paddington. On Sunday night, 29th Oct., I was going along Albany-street, and met the pri<lb></lb>soner—I had seen her before—she said she knew me, and asked me to accom<lb></lb>pany her to her place, and I went with her to 8, Fitzroy-row, I think—I went in with her, and she desired two females who were in the room to go and get something to drink—they were gone about five minutes, and brought what I understood to be rum—she gave me a glass of it—I had had two or three small glasses of gin-and-water before, not more than that, but was not tipsy—I almost immediately became insensible—on recovering, about seven o'clock in the morning, I missed my watch, a scarf, a silk guard-chain and gold clasp to it, three sovereigns and thirteen shillings—I am quite sure I had them before I went into the house—I gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live in Ratcliff-highway—on the 17th of March I was paid off from the <hi rend="italic">Columbine</hi>, at Chatham—I left there about ten o'clock that morning, and three more mates came as far as the Bull's Head public-house with me—I met with the prisoner—he had a one-horse fly; and he agreed to take our party to London for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—there were four</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Lord Duncan, Broadway, Deptford. About seven o'clock in the evening, on the 17th of March, I heard a scuffle in my tap room—I saw the prisoner and another man putting the prosecutor on the bench in the tap room—I do not know whether the other man was Wilson—I asked the prisoner why he brought the drunken sailor into my house—he said he had been directed by him to do it, he had been paid off at Chatham, he was directed to leave him there, and he could not take him any further—I said I should not allow him to leave him, unless he gave me a satis<lb></lb>factory account about him—I asked the prisoner if he was paid—he said he was, and he knew the prosecutor very well—he said, in the course of conversa<lb></lb>tion, that he belonged to Blackwall, and he was going there, but he was directed to put the prosecutor down there—I said that unless he gave me a satisfac<lb></lb>tory account of his employer and himself I should not let him leave him, and he did so very willingly—I then asked him to hold the prosecutor up while</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184304030198"></xptr>
               <p>I searched his pockets—he said he believed the prosecutor had got money, and he hoped I would take care of it—he said he thought it was in his bosom; that he heard it rattle—he then held him up, and I noticed that the bosom of the prosecutor's shirt was open; and I made an observation that I was sure he had been wrongly dealt with, from the appearance of his shirt being rumpled—I then saw a string, and found a small leather bag round the pro<lb></lb>secutor's neck, and the bag had been torn down—a sovereign was hanging out of it, and one sovereign was at the bottom of it—I said, "Here is further proof that the man has been robbed"—I said it seemed unreasonable for him to put his cash in such a purse as that, and I was sure he had been wrongly dealt with—the prisoner said it was impossible, for there had been no one in the fly but himself, or "ourselves"—I found a half-crown in the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers in his jacket pocket—he was in a very helpless state; he could not sit on his seat—I saw the key of a watch hang<lb></lb>ing at the back of his trowsers, and found the watch attached to it—the pri<lb></lb>soner was then gone—he went away after he gave me the address, and said he should be there the next day with some more sailors, as there was another ship to be paid off—after I had searched the prosecutor the prisoner said, "Now you have searched the sailor, I should rather you searched me"—I said, "No, there is no occasion for that"—he showed me a shilling, a penny or three halfpence, and said that was all the money he had about him—he asked me particularly to take care of him, as he knew him very well, and had known him for years—he gave me his own name and address, and his em<lb></lb>ployer's, and the sailor's, and where the sailor would be going when he got sober—about midnight the prosecutor came to—I had kept him by himself entirely—I took his bag, and after he got sober he directed me to look in it, and I found six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in it—on the Sunday following the prisoner called in with another one, who I understood was his driver, who drove the van and drove Miller up—he asked me if I had seen any thing of the sailor—I said I had, and he was still with us—I told him the sailor had been robbed, and his complaint was that he had been robbed in the van—he said it was impossible—he did not stay—he said he was in a hurry to go, as his horse wanted to go back—he said he would call the next day and hear further about it—I told him we had found the watch which we had searched for before he left.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Chatham, and am a van driver for Mr. Baker.

            . On Sunday, the 22d of July, I was coming from a friend's in Jermyn-street, about nine o'clock in the evening - the prisoner turned round upon me just at the corner of <placeName id="t18230910-61-crimeloc346">Castle-court, Chandos-street</placeName>

               <p>"What is the matter;" I said,</p>
               <p>"I am robbed, and there is the man," and he ran away with three or four more of the gang. I am certain of the prisoner's person, from his hinder appearance. I did not see his face - he used no violence. I went to Bow-street immediately, and described his person, as near as I could, and saw him at Bow-street on Wednesday, and have no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. It was done so suddenly you could not see his face - A. Not to notice it. I speak to him from his make, shape, and clothes. If I had met him four days after, I should not have noticed him; but when he was shown to me I knew him. I really believe in my conscience that he is the man. He was taken from my description.</p>

            . I am conductor of the Bow-street patrole. On Monday morning, I received information of this robbery, and took the prisoner from the description I received, on Tuesday afternoon, about five o'clock, in Chandos-street, and asked where he was on Sunday evening, about nine o'clock - he said in a house in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked where I slept, I said in St. Giles's. Two men were brought against me, who had a full view of the person who robbed Mr. Ledwick - neither could swear to me, but said it was a taller man. At my first and second examination, the prosecutor would not undertake to say I was the person; but at last swore to me, as he was instructed by the officers.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. Two men were brought up, who are not here; he said he slept in St. Giles's, and was in St. Giles's at nine o'clock. Mr. Ledwick never doubted about him. I took one Pearson also; but the prosecutor could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>MR. LEDWICK. These two men were very loth to come, and gave me a false name. I swore to him at first, and had no doubt at all of him.</p>

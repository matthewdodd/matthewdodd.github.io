The great coat belonged to a woman that came in with him; the woman went away; I found fourteen yards of printed cotton in the great coat he had under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the handkerchiefs - A. I value the three handkerchiefs at ten shillings, and the cotton at ten shillings; I had seen them in the shop the day before.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the shop when the prisoner came in on the 28th of January - A. Yes; the prisoner and a woman came in together; the woman asked to look at some printed cottons; I shewed them some; they were close together at the time; they bought seven yards; I shewed them a vast deal of different patterns; the prisoner bought three yards of linen at two shillings per yard; he paid me six shillings for the linen; he gave me a seven shilling piece, the shilling was to be left on the gown till nine o'clock in the evening; they asked me to shew them some silk handkerchiefs, I shewed them a great many different patterns; the prisoner bought one silk handkerchief at seven shillings, which he paid for; they went off; the boy in the shop saw the silk handkerchiefs under the coat.</p>

               <p>Q. The boy had seen him take them perhaps - A. I cannot say whether he did or not; Mr. Foulkes came in at the time, and saw the same as the boy. I went to Bow street for an officer.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met with a woman in the street, I asked her if there was a linen draper's shop nigh hand, she said yes; she went with me into Mr. Foulkes' shop; the woman looked at a piece of cotton for a gown, I looked at some Irish linen at two shillings a yard; I told him to cut me off three yards; I paid seven shillings for a handkerchief, and six shillings for the linen, and a shilling was paid for the woman's gown. I was coming out of the shop, the woman asked me to carry the coat while she tied up her apron; the little boy came to me, and said, I had some of his master's property. I went and laid the coat on the counter, and what I had bought, on a great many things; they searched the coat, and told one of the gentlemen of the shop, to go to Bow street for an officer. I was brought into this business; I was quite innocent, I know nothing of the woman; I never met with her before.</p>

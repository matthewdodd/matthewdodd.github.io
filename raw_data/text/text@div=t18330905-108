On the 27th of June I was returning from Vauxhall-gardens - I was quite sober- I fell in with the prisoner in the Commercial-road, she was walking along and appeared to be in a state of intoxication - when I got up to her she laid hold on my arm - I asked her what was the matter - she said, she had been out so late with a party of friends, and was afraid to go home to her parents, and she asked me as a favour to go home with her - I went half way down a street, and asked her which house it was, she then said she did not live there but in White Lion-street - I told her I could not go there, as I lived in Norfolk-street - she hung upon my left arm - my purse was in my left hand breeches pocket, and my watch was in my fob - I hade her good night and went away - I then missed my purse, which contained a gold ring, two sovereigns, about 10s. in silver or more - I knew it was safe three minutes before I saw the prisoner, and I had not met any other person - I then ran down the street, and saw a policeman at the bottom - I told him the circumstance, and the prisoner was taken on the 6th of July - I had not been with the prisoner more than three minutes.</p>

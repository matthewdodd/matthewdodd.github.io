                  </hi>. I live with my father, Job Bishop, who keeps a clothes-shop in Charlton-street, Somers-town. I was sitting in the parlour on the 6th of April—the door was open, and I saw this frock taken down—I ran into the shop and saw the prisoner on his hands and knees, with this frock on his apron, which he had on the floor doubling it up—I asked what he wanted—he said, a pair of shoes—I said he did not want shoes, he wanted that frock—he said no, he did not; that he was going to work in the factory on Monday morning—he said he did not unpin the frock, but I saw him reaching up and doing it, at least I saw the frock move—I did not exactly see his hands, but I ran forward, and there he was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was not on my hands and knees—I went in and knocked several times—a woman came out, and I said I wanted a pair of shoes.</p>

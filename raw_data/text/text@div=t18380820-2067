                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Cross-keys-passage, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey-street. I keep the house—it is in the parish of St. Olave, South-wark—on the 11th of August I left home, at a quarter to nine or nine o'clock at night—I locked the street-door, and took the key with me—my brother, James Edward Cable, lodges in the house with me—we are the only two who occupy it—he had been out all day—it was not quite nine o'clock when I left—I generally leave the key at the Cross-keys-passage when I am out, but I took it with me on this occasion—I returned just upon eleven o'clock—I found the house open, and my brother James inside, all in a gore of blood, and a policeman inside with him—I missed fifteen feet of lead pipe, weighing twenty-seven or twenty-eight pounds, from inside the house-nobody could get it without effecting an entrance into the house—it was safe when I went out—it has not been found—it was carried away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother of last witness. On Saturday evening, the 11th of August, I returned home, between ten and eleven o'clock—I found the door open, and two persons walked out—the prisoner was the third person who came out of the house, and I collared him—he immediately struck me in the mouth with his fist—I kept hold of him, and a struggle took place between us—I found myself all over blood, and my head was cut—that was not done with a blow from the fist—we struggled for a quarter of a hour—he got me down, and got upon me, and called "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>" who I supposed was one of his companions—I became insensible for a few minutes, and cannot tell when I got the blow which produced the blood—the struggle was outside, in the street—I did not let go of him till he was apprehended.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I contradict it—he struck me first in the head, I threw him, and I suppose that was the way he got cut in the head—he then laid hold of me and shook me.</p>

I could not see whether the other two had aprons on—they did not appear trades people—I found no box of lucifers the pri<lb></lb>soner came out of the door of the house—he had one foot over the sill when my son caught him.</p>

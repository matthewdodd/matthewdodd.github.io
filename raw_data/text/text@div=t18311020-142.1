            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I went to the prosecutor's house last Monday morning, about seven o'clock - I was in pursuit of another person as well as the prisoner; I went to the prisoner's house, which is a cottage with one room, in Nova Scotia-gardens, Crabtree-rew, Bethnal-green - I got there about halfpast seven o'clock in the morning; I found a woman there, who was said to be Mrs. Stocks - I found under the bedstead, these nine staves, and these six pieces of wood; the two staves which have been identified were among them - a person mamed Grubb was taken, and the prisoner came down to the office, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was only one room? A. No; there was no other convenient place to put the wood- some part of these appear to have been out; it might have made legs of bedsteads, perhaps, but I do not know- I never saw oak bedsteads; the prisoner was not at his house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Grubb asked me to make him a bedstead - he said he could find stuff; I said I would at my leisure time - he said he was in no hurry; I said he might take the stuff to my house at any time, and if my wife was not in the way, he might lay it down on the premises; he brought this wood at twice - I did not know it belonged to my master; I thought it was his own - when my wife said they had been and taken it, I was astonished, and went to the office.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. ROSLING. Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of handling any of these staves? A. That laid more with the foreman than myself - he was jobbing about, and had access to them; there were twenty thousand staves there sometimes.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDSON. He sometimes had to remove staves from one part to another - he was an odd man, doing anything; wood in this shape is used almost exclusively by coopers - some part might be convered into a bedstead; Grubb had no right to take it.</p>

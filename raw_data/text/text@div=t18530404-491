                  </hi>. My husband is a constable in the police force. On 25th Feb. I lived at No. 133, Sloane-street—the prisoner is my nephew—he had been in the habit of visiting roe, this was his fourth visit since Christmas—he came to the door on Friday, the 25th, I let him in—he laid he had been on business into the King's-road; he said, "Is uncle gone?"—I said, "Yes"—I asked him to come in—he came in, and sat down in his uncle's chair—I asked him if he would take supper—he said he would—I asked if he would take a cup of coffee—he said he preferred water—I put supper on the table, he helped himself, and I then cleared away the supper—he said he had a sovereign, which he could not get changed anywhere, and asked me if I thought I could accommodate him—I told him I would—I got the change, counted it out, and put it on the table for him—he did not produce the sovereign, or take the change; he sat there, and talked till 10 o'clock—I was ironing some things—about 10 minutes before 10 o'clock I told him if he did not go, he would not be able to get across the park—he said, then he must go round it—he said he had a violent toothache, and I gave him some ginger for it—it was then about 10 o'clock, as near as could be—I told him be had better go—he then buttoned up his coat, rose up out of the chair, and then unbuttoning his coat, he said, "I forgot the change"—I said, "If you are not particular, I do not want to part with it, because it is all I have;" meaning that the change would be more acceptable than the sovereign—he said, "I am not particular"—I then took it up, and put it into my own pocket—he put his hands into his two waistcoat pockets, and feeling, said, "I have dropped my sovereign"—I stooped to look for it, and the prisoner immediately seized on my head with his left hand, and squeezed my head down on the carpet; he held it down, put out the candle, and <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> a razor across my throat—I could not see the razor at the time—it was something sharp, like a razor—I threw him off, and pushed the razor from my neck, and said, "George, George! if you are doing this for money tell me, and you shall</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040059"></xptr>
               <p>have money"—he said, "Then give it me, then give it me;" still seizing my head—he would not let me get up—he took hold of my head again between his legs, or his feet, and tried to put the razor to my neck again—I put up my hand, and prevented it—the blade was in my hand, and I broke the razor, as I held the blade in my hand—I did not see the handle till the policeman showed it to roe—I escaped through the prisoner's legs, as he was holding me by the head, and <hi rend="italic">lolling</hi> himself over my back to keep roe down—I tried to get away, he seized on me again, and held me by the neck, so that I could not speak—I forced one of his hands from my neck, and he took the other away, and held my dress behind—I was trying to go to the window—he put his hand behind him, and reached my poker; it was in the fireplace, close by where he bad been sitting—as I was raising my arm to open the shutters, he struck me a violent blow across my shoulder—he then pushed me against the bed, and hammered my head with the poker, until I got possession of the poker myself—I begged of him several times to spare my life, for the sake of my children—he tried to take the poker away from me, but he did not succeed—I then tried to get to the door, as we were holding the poker—he put his back against the door—we had a severe struggle, to see which would get the poker, but we both kept hold of it—I asked him why he had been using me in the manner he had—he said he had parted from his master, and his father had forbade him the house—I then asked him what I should give him to go, and not hit me any more—he said, "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and light the candle"—I bled very much from my throat and hand—I was wearing a piece of velvet tape round my neck, which the policeman has; and I was wearing this brooch at the throat, and the razor cut across the brooch and cut the velvet—when the prisoner said "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and light the candle," I said, "I will give you the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you will go with me up to the front door"—he said, "You will halloo"—I said, "I will not light the candle; as you put the candle out, you may light it;" he then put his arm round me and kissed me, and said, "My dear aunt, we will go together and light the candle"—we had a little more conversation, but I cannot call it to mind; it was all of the same nature—he said he was sorry, and said, "Give me a knife, and I will cut my own head off"—I talked to him for several minutes—he dropped the poker into my hand, and turned from the door—I threw the door open, and ran up to the front door and gave the alarm; the gentleman from No. 135, and the cook from the next door (No. 132) came down—the policeman came down about three minutes after—the prisoner was then sitting on the bed—I went to him and talked to him, but he would not answer me—I told the policeman where he had attacked me—he lighted the candle, and the gentleman and the cook also brought in lights, and the policeman picked up the handle of the razor—I said, "I don't know whether it was a knife or a razor, it was very sharp"—the policeman said, "Here is the handle of the razor"—I said, "I threw the blade somewhere, I don't know where;" and he looked in the fireplace, and found it there—I then gave him the poker, and the piece of velvet—I was afterwards attended by a surgeon—it was a fortnight before I was out of my room—I was six months gone in the family way at the time—no sovereign was found—the policeman searched in my presence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 55.) My attention was called to the house, No. 133, Sloane-street, on this night, at a quarter past 10 o'clock—I found the door open—I went down stairs, and saw the prisoner sitting on the bed, and the prosecutrix having hold of his hands—I saw the blood running down from her bead, and I saw two severe wounds on her head—I asked her in his presence what he had been doing—she told me he had been trying to cut her throat with a razor, which she had broken out of his hands and thrown on one side—I found the razor-blade near the fireplace, and the handle in the middle of the room—she told me that he had asked her for change for a sovereign, and that he had said he had dropped the sovereign; that she took the candle to look for it, and he immediately seized on her, flung his arms round her, and with the razor tried to cut her throat—he heard all this—her hands were cut and bleeding—I produce a piece of velvet, which is cut through—I took the prisone into custody—he said he was mad—he said at the station house that he did it through want, for he was starving.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WHITMORE</hi>. I am a surgeon, living at 124, Sloane-street. I was called in to see the prosecutrix—I found her sitting on a chair—I found a superficial wound on the neck, and a number of smaller incisions, but none of any importance, none that required me to attend to them more than once—I found two wounds on the head; they were deep, cut to the bone—I also found a little wound on the cheek, and others on the right hand, and a number of smaller abrasions or scratches on the palm of the hand—the wounds on the head were very severe; they must have been done with a blunt instrument, such as a poker, from the fact that the hair was not divided; it was split; it seemed as if the scalp had been split by the weight of the weapon—she was quite conscious, but agitated and exhausted—this was perhaps half an hour after the attack—there was not much blood running at the time, but I think, judging from the blood that had coagulated, she had lost a good deal—the piece of velvet round her neck would in some measure blunt the edge of the instrument—the injuries on the head and cheek were decidedly inflicted by a sharp instrument—she was threatened with premature labour—I consider her quite well now—she had occasion to keep her bed for about a fortnight—during that time I cannot say she was ever in great danger, not in any immediate danger; but there was the chance of premature labour coming on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the depth of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Barely through the skin—if it was done with great violence the velvet would not have prevented it, the brooch would—I have seen some cases of madness—I have read Beck's "Medical Jurisprudence," and Dr. Taylor and Dr. Conolly's works—there are generally premonitory symptoms of insanity—there have been cases</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040061"></xptr>
               <p>of persons all at once being seized with paroxysms—I never heard of Miss Lamb's case—I should be inclined to think a person mad who all at once without any motive, cut the throat of another to whom he was previously always affectionate and kind; it would be a strong symptom of insanity—that would be what is called homicidal insanity.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But surely you do not mean to say that the mere violence and ferocity of an act would lead you to say it was an act of insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not necessarily so, certainly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Morgan's-lane, Tooley-street, on Monday, the 27th of March, from nine o'clock at night till six o'clock next morning—I know the prosecutors' warehouses, they were all safe in the morning, when I went off duty at six o'clock—I returned again at nine o'clock the same evening—it is my habit to examine the fastenings every night, as I come on my beat—I did so to the prose<lb></lb>cutors' warehouse, a little after nine o'clock, and found this padlock hang<lb></lb>ing on the staple of the door, with the bottom upwards—it was unlocked, but hanging as if it was locked—I tried it, and found it came open—the outside iron bar was up as usual, and the lock on the staple—I looked about a little, and saw Rice, standing about twenty yards off—he walked past me, close by me, and when he had passed me, six or seven yards, he turned back again, and examined a bill that was on the door, and as he walked away from the bill, he asked me if the door was unlocked—I said, "Why?"—he said, "For nothing"—I asked him if he belonged to the premises—he said, "Oh no," and walked about eight or ten yards, and turned up against the wall, as if for a necessary purpose—when he left, I went and examined the place where he had been standing, and found it perfectly dry—he walked opposite the public-house adjoining the ware-house, and went in at the front-door—after speaking to the watchman I went back to the warehouse-door, which I had left about four minutes to call the watchman—on my return, I found the padlock had been turned up the other way, and locked in its usual way—I saw Rice again in about half-an-hour, coming down Morgan's-lane, towards the warehouse—I said something to him—I did not say it would be better or worse if he said any thing—I said I should take him to the station, on suspicion of doing something wrong—he said, "Very well," he would go along with me, which he did quietly—I asked if he had got any keys about him, he said, "No"—I said, "I dare say you have no objection to walk down to the warehouse-door," which he did, and the watchman asked him if he had any keys about him—he said "No" again—the watchman said, "If you have got the key, you had better give it up"—he said he had not got it—I took him to the station—on the road to the station I saw him try to pass something to a boy who he met—I looked to see what it was in his hand, and saw it was a key, with this wood to it, marked D 1—I took him to the station, took the key, went back to the warehouse, and found it would unlock the lock—I unlocked the door with it, took the padlock off, turned the iron bolt down, and found the door fastened inside—I could not get in—we got a crow-bar put in between the two doors, (it is a double door,) and wrenched the bolt back—it took nearly an hour to do that—when we got inside we found the prisoners Lodan and Gravestock inside, standing behind a crane—I told them to come to the station, and asked if there was any body besides them inside—they said there was not—I locked the door, took the key with me, and took them to the station—they said it was a bad job—I came back, and found four tin cans in the warehouse, hold<lb></lb>ing about four gallons each—two of them were full of oil—I found a great</p>

               <p>many barrels of oil in the warehouse, and the remains of a candle which had been burning—my brother constable picked it up from behind where the prisoners had been standing—I was with Berry when he examined the barrels—I found one side of one barrel was wet and the other dry, as if the oil had been running down from a spile-hole—here are two phials, containing a sample of oil, one from each of the full tin cans—and Berry has a sample from two different barrels, both of which appeared to be wet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Emanuel and Thomas Silva, wharfingers. I know the warehouse D No. 1—there were thirty-five casks of oil in it, some was brown seal, and some pale seal oil—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 23rd of March, I had been at the warehouse—I then had this key with the label now produced—when I left I locked the door, and hung the key in the counting-house, in its proper place—I had no occasion to go to it after that before the discovery, nor had anybody else to my knowledge—if the key had remained in its proper place, it should have been hanging up in the counting-house—Rice was a weekly ser<lb></lb>vant of Messrs. Silva—I did not know him before he came into their service—I have known Lodan many years—he was occasionally em<lb></lb>ployed by master, but seldom—he knew all our warehouses very well—I do not know Gravestock—we keep candles in the counting-house—the candle which was found did not belong to us—we do not use candles in the warehouse, but oil.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cellarman to Pilcher and Co., oil-merchants, in Morgan's-lane. I have dipped two barrels of oil at the warehouse of the prosecutors, D No. 1, to see what was gone—they appeared to be deficient—I took a sample from the two barrels, which I produce—I dipped seve<lb></lb>ral—they differed in colour—these two were what I call straw-oil, and corresponded with that found in the cans—the ground was wet with oil—here are two samples from the cans—in my judgment they are the same quality as these samples taken from the cans—they are all straw-oil, but one barrel is paler than the other—the oil in. one barrel corresponds with one can, and the other with the other.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 30th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was crossing from the end of Cornhill to the Mansion-house, and saw the prisoner coming down Lombard-street, with something in a handkerchief under his arm, he passed me, and turned down Charlotte-row; I went up and felt the bundle, and asked what he had got, he said a blue coat, which he was going to take to Crown-court, Fleet-street, that he brought it from Mr. White's, No. 15, Fenchurch-street. I found it did contain a blue coat, I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me a lie, and send me to Fenchurch-street to no purpose;" he said," I will tell you the truth, a man, at the corner of Lombard-street, gave me the coat to carry to Mr. Smith's, in Crown-court." I went to No. 15, Fenchurch-street, but could find no Mr. White there; I then went to Crown-court, and found that one Smith had lived at No. 9, some time back, but nobody at No. 3. I returned, and Mr. Dutton claimed it.</p>

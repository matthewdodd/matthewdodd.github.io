                  </hi>. I live at Brockley Hill, Little Stanmore. On Sunday the 6th of November, I put two sovereigns, a half-crown, a sixpence, and five shillings into a little box, which was in a large one—neither of the boxes were locked—on Monday the 7th, the prisoner came to my house, as I was going to supper, and said, "I am going to work for your master to-morrow"—I said, "It is time you went home"—I was going to bed—I live alone—he said "I will come early in the morning"—in the morning he came again—I said, "You had better go to work"—he said, "I shall stop a little longer"—I gave him a cup of tea, and he cut some bread, and buttered it—on Tuesday night I was going to supper, and missed some cheese, and half a pound of sugar—I looked into my box on Wednesday, and my money was gone.</p>

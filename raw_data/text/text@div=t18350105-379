                  </hi>. I am a fancy trimming manufacturer, and live in New Nichol-street, Bethnal-green. The prisoner was in my employ—it was his business to go about the town, sell goods, and receive money—my son delivered the goods to him in the morning, and it was his duty to bring back the goods or the money—on the day before the officer took him, which was in December, he came into the warehouse where I was, and said, "A fine morning, Sir"—I turned and said, "Yes, and a fine game you have been playing with me"—he fell on his knees and said he hoped I would forgive him, and give him two years to pay the money back—I said, if I gave him that privilege, he would rob me to a greater amount still.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I have been fifteen months in his employ—I used to take out goods, and sell them to whom I pleased—he asked me, on my return, where I sold them—the books will prove that I had weekly, monthly, and even longer accounts. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He was to return the goods or the money every night, except goods which he booked to customers—some of them paid weekly, some monthly, and some when they pleased—he had weekly wages himself—in many cases he entered these goods to persons who never had them.</p>

He gave no information, but I believe some trifling articles have been returned—eight dozen of gimp.</p>

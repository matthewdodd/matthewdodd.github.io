On Thursday evening the 7th of August, about ten o'clock in the evening, I met this woman on Westminster bridge; she asked me to give her a glass of ale, I went into a public house and gave her a glass of ale; she then asked me to go with her to a house in <placeName id="t18060917-49-crimeloc263">Whitcomb street</placeName>

               <p>Q. You did not recollect your watch before you came out of the room. - A. No, and when I came down stairs again, the woman was gone out of the house, I went out of the door but I could not find her, I did not see her again till she was apprehended; Gillmore the officer, shewed me the watch at Queen square.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Queen square. On Monday night the 11th of October, I was out with a warrant to take up disorderly persons; on Tuesday morning about two o'clock, I apprehended the prisoner at the corner of Whitcomb Street, in company with two other women of the town, I saw her almost in a state of nakedness, and two women were dressing her, I conveyed them all three to the watchhouse; in the pocket of the prisoner I found this watch, I asked her how she came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170037"></xptr>by it, she told me it was her husband's watch; there being a particular mark in the inside case, I asked her if she knew the watch by any particular mark on the inside case, she said there was no mark in the inside case, it was quite plain; that convinced me it was not her husband's watch; I enquired at all the houses in Whitcomb street, till I found the prosecutor out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Gilmore asked me for five pounds, and then he said I should have the watch again; he found a tin box in my pocket and fifteen duplicates, there he stands.</p>
               <p>Gilmore. The box and the duplicates are as she describes, but all the rest is false; why, I hold the duplicates are for five shillings, it is not five pound, it is for what she had at the watchhouse that I am accountable for.</p>
               <p>(The watch identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

             sworn. Q. Do you live servant at this house in Whitecombe street. - A. Yes, I recollect the prosecutor coming on that night to the house with the young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the house. - A.

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether the prosecutor went back again. - A. Yes, the prisoner went out and the gentleman followed her, he went into the street, and came back again; he told us he had lost his watch, he left his address, and when Mr. Gilmore enquired we told him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw that lady in my life before, nor do I ever recollect seeing that gentleman before I saw him on Westminster bridge; he wanted to do a very bad thing with me, and instead of the money he gave me the watch to keep me quiet, he said he had not a farthing of money about him; he wanted to do that which does not become a man.</p>

               <p>LAZARUS LEVY. I live with my father, who is a general-dealer, in Kingsland-road. I was going along the Strand on the 13th of March; the prisoner and a man came to me, and asked if I bought old clothes - I said Yes- she then said had some books; she showed me these six, and asked 12s. for them - I offered her 7s. for them, and bought six of them for 8s.; I sold them for 10s.</p>

               <p>MR. THOMPSON. These are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How do you know them? A.By having had them thirteen or fourteen years in my possession - I have not seen many bound in this way; I know them from the colour being faded - there is no mark on them; the prisoner was a fortnight in my house - she went on errands occasionally; I live in chambers - there are other offices on the same floor - I do not know whether any one lives there; the prisoner came to me with a false character, which she has since acknoledge she wrote herself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am grainer, and live in Medway-street, Horseferry-road; on 11th April, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was coming down on the right hand side of Holborn-hill, the side the church is—I was nearly at the bottom of the hill, walking with Ann Davis—as I was walking along I saw number of persons—I cannot say how many—there was sham fight going on between two men—I believe it to have been a sham fight—the other persons were round them—in going through these people Miss Davis said someone had hold of her dress, near the pocket—I did not stop at all to look at the fight—I was surrounded, and could not get on—I turned round, and there was jerk at silver guard chain which was round my neck, and I missed my own watch directly—I turned round, and saw my watch in the prisoner's hand—I saw portion of it—the ring and the knob were out of his hand—it was very large watch—I do not think a man of his size could grasp it in his hand—I could not do it myself—the prisoner then ran away, and ran up court, and some persons stopped me from going up—he was let up the court, and I was not—when I lost my watch I was trying to get the female out of the crowd—I said, "It is only a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, take care of your pocket"—when the prisoner entered the court I was almost within arm's length of him, running close behind him—the court was about as far from where I lost my watch as to the corner of this court—I believe the prisoner is the man who took the watch. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>

                  </hi>. I live in Long-lane, Smithfield. I was talking that evening to the last witness on Holborn-hill—I saw the prisoner, he got up a sham fight, and I saw him run out of the mob and run up Plumtree-court—the prosecutor was running after him—I have not the least doubt that the prisoner is the person—I have seen him before—I knew him by sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Hyam, a Chancery-barrister, who has chambers on a third floor in Lincoln's Inn, immediately over the cham<lb></lb>bers of John Augustus Francis Simpkinson. At half-past five o'clock in the afternoon of the 25th of March, I came to my chambers—as I was going up the second flight I heard Mr. Simpkinson's chamber door slam to, and two persons running up the stairs that lead to Mr. Hyam's cham<lb></lb>bers—I went up—Mr. Simpkinson's outer door was then shut to—before I got to the landing of the third flight I saw Riley just coming down—he was on the top stair—Buncher was looking out of the staircase window of that floor—upon my being seen, Riley spoke to Buncher, and said, "I told you it was not him," or something to that effect, I did not correctly hear it—I passed them and went into my own chambers—I took some papers, and came out with them in my hand down on the second floor land<lb></lb>ing, and saw Mr. Simpkinson's outer door open, and the inner door not quite closed—the two men were then gone from my landing—about five minutes had elapsed from my seeing Mr. Simpkinson's door shut and finding it open—I then made a communication to the officer, and returned immediately—I was about the second person that went up—I was then going up the second floor staircase, and saw Stacey seize Riley, who had this red bag in his hand—we all came down together—I took the bag from him in the square—I took it to the station, and gave it to the officer—I afterwards saw Buncher in the custody of Baker—he brought him down the staircase—I saw both the prisoners searched, and some keys and other things taken from Riley—I saw the keys tried, and one of them opened the chamber doors—I went up the third flight of stairs after that, and found this other bag.</p>

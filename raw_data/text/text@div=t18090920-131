            . I live at Hampstead, I saw the prisoner on the 21st of July about a quarter before ten in the morning, he went over the heath towards Hendon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him - A. Nothing then, I am sure it was him. About 12 o'clock I saw him coming from Church Hill where Butcher lives, I was at a distance when I saw him first, whether, he had any thing I cannot rightly tell. I saw him lay down behind the furse-bushes on the horse-course, he laid there about five minutes, he got up again and came towards Hampstead. I followed him down Hampstead into Shepherd's field at a distance. I never lost sight of him above a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overtake him - A. I did not; he got over the stile out of one field and into another. I run down to the stile when he got over he got half way down the field, he stopped and looked back, he had no chickens with him at that time; Mrs. Hartley met him she said she saw him put down a bag, we afterwards found the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow the prisoner after he laid down among the furse bushes and get up again - A. Yes, he did not see me as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for following him - A. I had suspicion of him before, there were three chickens in the bag two dead, and the other lived near two hours after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there when the bag was taken up - A. No, he was gone down the field he was taken in custody that night and taken to Hampstead watchhouse, he was afterwards taken to Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the chickens - A. Mr. Adams kept the chickens, they were produced at Hatton Garden.</p>

I kept the prisoner in sight, he came from the horse-course towards Hampstead. I followed him into Hampstead near the trees, I lost sight of him twice and saw him again in Shepherd's field.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man you saw in Shepherd's field is the man that you saw squatting down in the horse course behind the furze bushes - A. Yes, because I had him in custody before, I knew his person well.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see whether he had any thing about him or not - A. No, I afterwards found this green bag by the information of Mrs. Hartley in a corner of the field where he had passed, it contained three chickens I also found in the green bag this little bag with some wheat in it.</p>
               <p>Q. That bag does not belong to Butcher - A. No, I kept these chickens till they were produced at Hatton Garden. Mrs. Butcher saw them, I saw the prisoner at 12 o'clock, we took him about four, we lost him in Hampstead town after he had been in Shepherd's field, I found the bag about half after twelve.</p>

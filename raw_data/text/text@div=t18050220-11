               <p>Q. On the 21st of January, was the prisoner Hilsley in Mr. Brickwood's service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that day, in the afternoon, did you go up into the floor, No. 2.? - A. Yes, about four in the afternoon; and I observed the heap of malt, and a strange man with the prisoner, in the floor No. 2, they were standing by a sack of malt, one on one side, and one on the other, by the malt heap; there were two sacks lying down, and one standing up, the sack that was standing up was turned inside out; all the sacks were close to the malt heap, the two sacks lying down had Mr. Brickwood's mark on them.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You could not read what was marked on the third sack? - A. I could only see there was a mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you make any particular observations on this sack of its contents? - A. There were red letter marks on it, and there was a little bit of a hole just by the top of the sack, I put my finger in this third sack, in the hole, and found it was malt; I did not say any thing to Hilsley then, nor the stranger, I left them there, and came away; about ten minutes afterwards Hilsley was coming out of No. 2, and going down stairs; I spoke to him then, and asked him what he was about; to the best of my recollection, he said, that he had been shutting a door in at the top; I then went up to No. 2, and the strange man was standing by the sack of malt, I staid there about five or six minutes, and then I came away, the strange man continued there; I only came down to No. 1, the floor below, where I staid ten or twelve minutes, and then went up to No. 2, again, and the strange man went to the floor No. 1, I saw him come below, and when I went up to No. 2, again, I saw

                  Richard

            , he went up before me to No. 2, and when I went up the third time, Hilsley took one of the sacks in his hands and set it up an end; I came down and left him there, and stopped below perhaps ten minutes or longer, between the wharf-gate and the mill; Hilsley came down, to the best of my recollection, and stood by the strange man, I was never out of sight of the warehouse, nor from under the roof all the time; I said to the stranger, I think you have the appearance of a soldier; Hilsley said, yes; I told Hilsley, and I spoke to a man that we had, that I was going to my quarters; I live in Old Fish-street-hill, I went away almost immediately, and left them both there in the wharf, this was near five o'clock; I had dropped a pocket-book, which I observed as soon as I came home, and returned immediately; I had not been gone from the wharf above ten minutes, at the farthest, and when I came within six or seven yards of my master's gate, in Broken-wharf, I saw Hilsley scrapling a sack on his shoulder, just as though he was taking it out of my master's little gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he outside of the gate before you saw him? - A. Yes, just got there; it appeared to my eye that he had just come through the wicket, by his scrapling it up; there are two glass lamps just by the gateway; I could see to pick up a pin; he got it on his shoulder and met me, and I met him in the yard, with the sack on his shoulder; the two lamps reflect a very bright light, within five yards of my master's gateway; I saw his face, his stockings and shoes, and likewise the sack of malt that was on his shoulder; I am sure it was Hilsley, I spoke to him but he would not speak to me; I felt the sack with my hand, and felt it to be malt; the sack appeared to have no mark on it; I stopped at the gate, and found somebody was fastening the wicket.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could you by the light of the lamps form any judgment whether the sack was turned inside out? - A. It appeared to be wrong side out, by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was it the usual hour to shut the gates? - A. No, just as the carts come in; sometimes eight or nine o'clock; they are usually put to before they are finally fastened; I followed the prisoner by the light of the lamps; he went up Broken-wharf, and went into No. 57, Upper Thames-street, a <rs id="t18050220-11-viclabel61" type="occupation">green-grocer's shop, kept by Lawless</rs>, as a person told me; he went into No. 57, the door was then standing open, he went into the passage and pitched the sack down, I am sure it was Hilsley that went in with the sack, he went into a little room, the glass door of which faced the street door; a man came with a light.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all see that man's face so as to know him? - A. I could not; Hilsley staid in the house about ten minutes, and I stood at the street door; I saw Hilsley in the room, and when he came out I stepped back, and then I came up to him, and said, Richard, is that you; he replied, yes; I then went immediately to Mr. Brickwood's warehouse, No. 2, and there I saw that the sack that was standing up first, and had been turned inside out, was missing, and only the two other sacks were there; there was no malt at that time at No. 1, only oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform the clerk of any suspicion that you had? - A. Not till the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time was it on the next day that you told any body about it? - A. Perhaps twelve o'clock to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200011"></xptr>Q. You were upon extremely good terms with Hilsley? - A. I had nothing against him, I had a few light words, but not to bear him any malice; I never had any quarrel with him, only a few sharp words, such as when men are at work they catch up one thing and the other another thing, and one finds fault with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with your master? - A. About a fortnight before last Michaelmas; Hilsley was on the wharf when I came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master is a lighterman? - A. He is a corn and coal factor.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not a variety of people's sacks in your master's warehouse, and so you borrow one of another in the course of your trade? - A. Never, none but the London company's sacks; they are sacks that come with flour.</p>
               <p>Q. These are not the only persons that your master deals with? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there are other sacks that find their way into your master's warehouses? - A. It might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, whenever you have taken out the malt from a sack, you turn it inside out if it belongs to another person; have you never seen that done before in your life? - A. I never saw it done there; I have seen flour sacks turned inside out, and then turned back again.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw the prisoner pitch it on his shoulder, that was the very time that the person, whoever it was, was going through the wicket? - A. It was just by the wicket, he had just got through the wicket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamp there? - A. There was a light there.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if any person was there he must see the person go through the wicket? - A. I cannot say, I did not see the other person.</p>
               <p>Q. But if there was any person they might have seen him for what you know; you have said, the moment that person went through the wicket, the gate was shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that you stood at the door of the house, No. 57, and you looked through the passage to the glass door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a lamp at the street door? - A. No, there might be a lamp-iron at the door, that I cannot say; there was a light in the room, and the glass door opened immediately as he went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went into the room where there was a light, did the door shut immediately as he went into the room? - A. Not immediately; I believe it was a minute or two after Hilsley went into the room with the sack before he shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that he left the door open to give an opportunity of looking at him, whoever it was; and that he shut the door after he had let you see every thing he had done? - A. He pitched the sack, and then the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, in your original examination, that a man came with a light? - A. Yes, he had a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us whether you know the face of that person again? - A. I saw the face of that person, but I cannot tell him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us how that man was drest? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hilsley return to work again? - A. I never saw him any more that night; I saw him the next day at my master's wharf as usual, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the size of the wicket? - A. I never measured it; it is a wicket I can go through with a little difficulty, by stooping my head I can easily go through it myself, it would not take two persons to go through at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you yourself seen persons carrying loads through the wicket? - A. No, never; the gates are always open in the day, I could take a sack through there with stooping my head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say you could carry a sack through, could you pull a sack through? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a usual thing to turn sacks inside out, and then fill them again? - A. Just as they require it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any quarrel with Hilsley to bear him any malice? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You observed this stranger a great deal, was it light or dark? - A. I did observe him, it was about four o'clock in the day, not very light, I could see to do any thing in the granary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know him again if you were to see him? - A. I think I should; I never have seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were watching Hilsley in the passage of No. 57, do you think that person who had a light had his back to you? - A. He stood with his face to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suppose that he saw you? - A. I cannot form any judgment whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not speak to Hilsley or any parties at the time the sack was being carried to No. 57? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not any reason to know what was in the sack but by feeling as he was going from the wicket to No. 57? - A. I felt it a great many times, I did not put my finger in the hole then; I never lost sight of the prisoner, when he came out of No. 57, I did not observe he had any empty sack then.</p>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18050220-11-victim152 t18050220-11-viclabel62"></join>, at Broken-wharf? - A. I do: On the 22d of last month, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200012"></xptr>five o'clock, I took with me two constables, Hughes and Comley, to No. 57, a green-grocer's shop, where I found the prisoner, Lawless, on the ground-floor, in a room where he usually slept, as I understood; I found three sacks and a half of malt there; I took a separate sample from each of the three sacks, but not from the half sack; I compared the three samples, and every one of the samples were like the bulk of malt in No. 2; I could not discover the least shade of difference in the world between the bulk and these samples; I have been in the malt trade upwards of thirty-four years, I have had a great many thousand quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you are not an unexperienced person, and as far as belief can go, what is your belief? - A. Really, as I am in the presence of Heaven, I believe that the three sacks of malt were stolen from me, I have no doubt of it; on the 23d, I had the bulk measured by sworn meters, I found a deficiency of two quarters and six bushels.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bushels did you find in the sacks? - A. I believe them to be as near as possible about four bushels, they were full sacks; I saw Lawless when I first went in, but he was taken away by Hughes, the constable; Comley assisted in searching, I did not see the malt when I first saw Lawless, he was not in the room where the malt was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand that you knew the prisoner Lawless, that he has been in your service? - A. He has, and I have known him living at No. 57 for nearly a twelvemonth; he had worked occasionally for me as a labourer, he had never been a fixed servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that he carried on any business at that time? - A. No, I have heard he kept a chandler's shop, and sold greens.</p>
               <p>Q. People who deal in the chandlery line sell beans, and malt, and other articles? - A. I never heard of a person that sold greens to sell malt.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take any notice of the room with the glass door? - A. I was in that room, I took no notice of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard that that was the room in which the malt was deposited? - A. I heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you sell by wholesale or retail, or both? - A. Only wholesale.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you sold any quantity of malt? - A. On the 14th of January I sold fifteen quarters to Messrs. Dodd and Turner, in Tooley-street, and five quarters to Mr. Golding, in St. Giles's; I estimated that I had ten quarters, and it was from that I was induced to send for sworn meters, to ascertain the quantity; I took stock about the 2d of January.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any other person who keeps corn within any warehouse to which your gate leads? - A. None, I do not let any part of my warehouses to any corn-dealer whatever; I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the three bushels? - A. Two pounds.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you are ward beadle to Queenhithe? - A. Yes: On the 22d of January, I went with the prisoner, Hilsley, to the Compter; I then went to Lawless's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the house, No. 57? - A. Thirty-eight years, I have known Lawless six years, he has kept the ground floor of that house for three or four years, I have seen him in the room where the malt was found, he sleeps there, and I have seen him with the mash-tub, brewing in the back room; he keeps a chandler's shop; I have seen him making use of all the three rooms; the back room has had a glass door, but the glass is all out, and has been some years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you been frequently in this shop? - A. Yes; he sold oysters, candles, small beer, and split peas; it is not a corn-chandler's shop; I have seen him brew there about once a week; I measured the wicket, the width is one foot three, and the heighth is four foot six.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you go with Comley and Mr. Brickwood to No. 57? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him live there? - A. He has been there three or four years; he paid twenty-seven pounds a year for the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him before in that room before you apprehended him? - A. Yes, he keeps a chandler's shop there, and sells butter and cheese, and all kinds of greens.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you considering of - have you ever been here before? - A. Yes, as a witness and a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever tried here? - A. Yes, I was, but I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Hilsley's defence. I am innocent of this piece of business, I am wrongfully accused; Grant accused me the next day when I had been at work; as I was going out of the yard, he asked me if I did not carry a sack out of the gate, as I was putting on my coat to go to dinner; I said, no; he said, he thought I was the man; he said, he saw a man carry a sack from the gate, and go along with it up the street; I gave him some rough language, he told me the less I said the better; we had been filling a tub full of oats, I worked there all the day till night, when Mr. Hughes came and took me; he swears wrongfully to me, I am not the man.</p>
               <p>Lawless's defence. I am innocent; I never bought a grain of corn of this gentleman in my life.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200013"></xptr>Knapp. Q. You are in Mr. Brickwood's service? - A. Yes; I am ostler.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 21st of January, did you bar the wicket, and put the chain up? - A. Yes; I cannot justly say what time, it was past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner go out that afternoon? - A. I let him out at the wicket, he was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light, or any candle, at the wicket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner, to see if he had any thing about him? - A. He had his great coat on his back, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him go to the wicket with any thing on his shoulder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else go out with any thing on their shoulder that afternoon? - A. No, I did not; that I am quite sure of, I can be upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You did not see Grant go through the wicket at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you see him standing by the wicket? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it be possible, in the situation in which you were, for him to have gone out with a sack on his shoulder without your seeing it? - A. He had nothing on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any man take a sack from your master's yard without your seeing it? - A. I cannot say, because when I am in the stable I cannot see what is done there; I was in the stable when Hilsley came and asked me to let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he had been out before, or had not been out, you do not know? - A. The wicket was chained when I went to let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body might open the great gates? - A. Yes, they were not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing I were there, and had a sack upon my shoulder, I might have gone out and you not have known it? - Q. It would make a great rattle if you did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you venture to swear that nobody opened the wicket, and put the chain up again, without your knowing of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you mean to swear is, that when you let Hilsley out, he had no sack on his shoulder; and the moment you let him out you shut the door, therefore, whether Grant was at the door you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any suspicion that caused or induced you to look, to see if any body was outside of the wicket? - A. No; I did not look to see, I had no suspicion.</p>

I saw the prisoner, and the last witness letting him out at the yard; I saw the prisoner go first, and Dennison go afterwards; I did not observe that the prisoner had any thing with him but his great coat, he stood within half a yard of me at the time he went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were at that time bushel-man, and foreman to Mr. Brickwood; you were turned off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the care of the malt, had you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took good care of it? - A. I took as good care of it as I possibly could, I did not see any carried away; I do not recollect that I had been up to No. 2, since the morning; I had lived with Mr. Brickwood about nine months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. If you had seen any body take any sack of malt on his shoulder, what should you have thought it your duty to do? - A. To have told my master; if the prisoner had had a sack on his shoulder, I should have told my master; but I swear positively he had not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the smallest quantity that you sell? - A. I never knew any less than a quarter sold at the time I lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) What is the smallest quantity that you have sold? - A. Five quarters; to oblige a friend, I might have sold two or three quarters; but that I do not believe I have done above two or three times in my life; never so little as a quarter.</p>

No; he would have turned me off, he left word with the miller for me not to stay, but I was going off; I saw the prisoner in the dusk of the evening, at No. 1, and I saw him going down stairs, it was between four and five o'clock, he had nothing with him only his great coat; I did not see him any more that evening, I staid not quite half an hour after him; I am sure he had nothing with him when he went down.</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you are agent to the Henley Navigation company? - A. Yes, I live at No. 4, Amelia-place, at present, and I hold an apartment of Mr. Lawless, for which I pay him eight guineas a year, at the back of the passage in the front of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any glass-door to that room? - A. There is a glass-door, but not much glass in it, it is almost broken, the door is generally open at all times of the day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How often are you there? - A. Generally every day, sometimes I am there two hours, and sometimes four or five, and sometimes I do not come at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are not there Mr. Lawless has the use of that room? - A. It is free open for any person to bring sacks in.</p>
               <p>Q. I might go there if I choosed; he brews there once a week? - A. I cannot say that, I have seen him brew.</p>
               <p>Q. Every fortnight? - A. I cannot say, he has brewed frequently in that room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know the other prisoner, Hilsley? - A. I do not know him when I see him, I heard of Lawless being taken up on the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. On the evening before he was taken up, did you light any man with a sack into that room? - A. No; I am sure I was not there so late.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any authority to dispose of any of the Henley Navigation company's corn? - A. No, I have sold corn so far as this, if I wanted a sack of corn for myself or my friends, I could have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell any sack of malt to Lawless? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor.) Q. Supposing a person employed in the warehouse No. 2, could any person come from the warehouse No. 2 with a load, and not be observed in No. 1? - A. Yes, for nothing is more clear; there is a fire burning for three months together in the kiln, and it very often happens that men are roasting potatoes at the fire; when I have gone in the floor No. 1, and could not find them, nothing is so easy for fifty men to come down from No. 2, and not to hear them; there is a temporary erection which would conceal fifty people in No. 1, what we call the pea warehouse, and persons passing from No. 2 could not be observed, but there are many situations in No. 1 in which persons could not pass it without being seen.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Waight.) Do you mean to say that there is no part in No. 1 but in which you could observe any person coming from No. 2? - A. No, it is as Mr. Brickwood has said; but all the part where I worked at no man could pass without my seeing him; I was at work for half an hour at that part of the warehouse which overlooked the stair-case that leads to No. 2, I was sorting of sacks, the ragged ones from the whole, and putting the room to rights.</p>

            . My husband is in the Guards. I lodge in the house - the prisoner and prosecutor came together - I had not seen the prisoner before, but I know she is the woman - she asked if they could have a bed for the night - I lighted them up stairs, and I had a shilling for the bed - she said, "We are differently situated now to what we were when he went to sea, "and she said "He cannot stop all night, but I shall" - she came down in about an hour, and said she wanted a plate to go to a cook shop - I gave her my landlady's plate - I said it was too late, but she said she could get it - she went out and never returned - I then went to the prosecutor, who missed his property.</p>

             (police-constable B 78). Last Thursday night week, I was on duty in Grosvenor-place, and the prosecutor gave the prisoner into custody for robbing him - she admitted having been with him in Grosvenor-place, but denied going to any house with him.</p>

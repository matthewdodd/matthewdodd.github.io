            . I am superintendent of Police at the West-India-docks. On the 10th of August the prisoner was brought to me by Bishop; I examined the casks in the waggon, and one had been plundered - I had it weighed, and it wanted 24 lbs. of the original weight; this found in the bag is the same quantity and quality - I examined the carman and the prisoner, as to whether they knew one another; they said they did not, but it was proved they had loaded the waggon together - the carman went off after they had been to the office.</p>

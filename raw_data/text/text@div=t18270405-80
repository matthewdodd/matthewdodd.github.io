            . I am eleven years old, and live at No. 7, Wood-street, Spa-fields. About six o'clock, on the evening in question I was opposite Mr. Brown's shop, and saw three men at his window, one, who had a white apron on, took a pair of trousers which hung in the window - I saw him come out of the shop and go down Rosoman-street alone, the other two went away after he came out - Taylor is the man who had the white apron - I saw him in custody at Hatton-garden two hours afterwards and knew him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner TAYLOR. Q. Which side of the way was you? A. On the other side, facing, and when you got to the bottom of Rosoman-street, I met Warboys, and told him.</p>

            .

               <p>Prisoner TAYLOR. Q. Were you not big enough to take me if I had stolen any thing? A. I was not certain that you had stolen any thing, though I saw a bundle in your apron; I followed you till I lost sight of you.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I was in the shop and saw three men come up to the window; one of them came in and asked for a light - I refused to give it him; he went out and said something to the other two; then they both came in, and one who wore a blue apron, held me with my head in his lap, while I saw Taylor, who had a brown coat and white apron, take something from the window - I saw the two prisoners at Hatton-garden on the Thursday following, and am certain of them - I am certain Yates is the one who held me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner TAYLOR. Q. If your head was in Yates's lap, how could you see me take them? A. I got my head on one side. (This witness was a cripple).</p>

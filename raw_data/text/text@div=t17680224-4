            . I was upon Lambeth-hill; I saw the prisoner running toward the water side, and I heard the lad cry, stop thief; I stopped the prisoner, and asked him if he was the thief; he said, no; he had a hat in his left hand; I let him go; then the lad came up to me, and asked me whether I had seen a man with a hat in his hand; I then ran after the prisoner and called, stop thief; I saw him jump from off the stairs into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240005"></xptr> a lighter; he laid himself down with his face downwards; I took him out of the lighter, and carried him to Mr. Blinkhorn's house; then I took a candle and went to the lighter, and there I found the hat; I brought that to Mr. Blinkhorn also; he had his own hat on his head.</p>

               <p>There was a young man in a light coloured coat running with two hats in his hand; I followed him, and called, stop thief; he jumped into a lighter and went over that, and where he went I do not know, and they came and took me.</p>

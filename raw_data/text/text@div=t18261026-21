The prisoner is my first cousin - I met him in the Park about eight days before this; he was in distress, and I invited him to my house to live. On Saturday evening, the 30th of September, when I went to bed, I pulled a yellow silk handkerchief off my neck, and put it on the mangle in No. 2; I then went into the other house to sleep. In the morning, when I got up, my handkerchief was gone; the prisoner had no victuals or clothes, except what I gave him - he slept up stairs at No. 2, by himself, in Perkins' room - I missed him in the morning, when I came from work - I also missed my handkerchief and 7s., which had been in Perkins' box; I had seen him put it into his box about a week before. I found my handkerchief in pawn, at Chelsea.</p>

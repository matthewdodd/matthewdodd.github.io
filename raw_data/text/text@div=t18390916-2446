The prisoner is a boot and shoe-maker, and lives in a house of mine, which I let on lease to another man—he has lived there many years—I never knew of his dealing in brass cocks till I discovered this—he was in the habit of coming to my house to work both for me, my son, workmen, and apprentices—I encouraged him all I could—on the 4th of March I missed fourteen brass cocks—I have seen eight of them since at Mr. Stevens's, the pawnbroker, in Wardour-street, and Mr. Franklin's, a pawnbroker, in Tottenham Court-road.</p>

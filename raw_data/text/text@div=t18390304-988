                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. On the 16th of February, about twenty minutes after seven o'clock in the evening, I was in High-street, Whitechapel, and, passing Mr. Hutchins' shop, heard a noise at the iron bar—I turned my head, and saw the prisoner throw a shawl down, and run off towards Whitechapel church—I picked the shawl up, gave it to a person in the shop, and pursued the prisoner with several others, crying "Stop thief"—I did not lose sight of him—he stopped in a crowd, and then turned back—I kept alongside of him two or three hun<lb></lb>dred yards—he walked through a public-house—I followed, but not seeing him in there, and knowing there was another way out, I went round the other way, and took him, and told him he must go back with me to Mr. Hutchins'—I am sure he is the same person.</p>

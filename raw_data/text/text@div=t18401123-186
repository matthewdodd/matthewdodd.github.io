                  </hi>. I am seven years old—I go to school, and have been taught the Lord's Prayer—I know it is wicked to tell a lie—I live with my parents, in White Lion-street, Chelsea—I met the prisoner at the top of George-street, in Sloane-street, three weeks ago last Monday—she asked me how my father and mother, and sister were, and said she would give me some apples and pears, and a pair of green boots—she said her mother was just round the corner—I went a little way with her, and she gave me a farthing cake—she took me up and carried me—when we were next door but one to the Dispensary in Sloane-street, she unlaced my boots and took them off—she then went away, and said she would be back in a minute, and bring me a pair of green boots—I went home without any boots—while she was with me I met Maria Smith, and she asked the prisoner if she would let me go home with her—the prisoner said as she had brought me out she would take me home.</p>

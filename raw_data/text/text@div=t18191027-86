            . I live at Mr. Williams's, High-street, Marylebone. On the 2d of October, about one o'clock, I was serving beer about Marylebone-place, and saw the prisoner and another in company in Devonshire-place; I went home, and saw them again about five minutes after one o'clock in Nottingham-place, one on each side of the street, looking down all the areas - they both came to the corner, and were in conversation together. The prisoner went down the area of No. 5, and came up with something under his coat, the other stood at the corner of the street - I left them. About three o'clock I heard of the robbery, and told what I had seen. I saw the prisoner in custody on the Monday; he is the man, on my oath.</p>

            . I am a porter, and live in Wardour-street. On the 2d of October I was passing in Nottingham-place, and saw the prisoner and another together; one said to the other,</p>
               <p>"He is not coming!" I then watched them - they had black-lead pencils and sealing-wax for sale. They went as far as Berner-street, I then observed the prisoner was bulky, and stopped them both. I found six handkerchiefs under the other man's coat; he got away, and I kept the prisoner. Squib afterwards claimed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you live in Wardour-street - A. Yes, at No. 11; there are two houses of that number.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I know Hoare lives in Wardour-street. I was in Newman-street, saw the prisoner coming along very fast, and stopped him. He said he had done nothing, and begged of me to let him go. I took him back, Hoare said he was one of them, and I took him charge - I found a bundle of pencils on him.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went down a few areas to sell pencils. I saw a man in velveteen trowsers, and asked him if he wanted any? he said he did not; I went away. At the end of the street I passed the witnesses, why did they not take me then if they suspected me? I came to Berner-street, and the young man was in the witness's custody; he saw me, and let him go.</p>

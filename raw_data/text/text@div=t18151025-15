            . I am a partner in the house of Oxley and Co. The prisoner is a rider for our house. When he sets out upon a journey, it is the constant practice for him to take a little book, with the names of the persons upon whom he is to call in the course of his journey, each upon a page; and the sums due by each of those persons written there-under; then on his return, he gives that book to us, with the sums received upon each of those accounts entered in the several pages. He rendered this book to us on the 6th of May, after the journey in which he ought to have called upon Mr. Wicken. (Book put into the hands of the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the book which the prisoner rendered to you - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to Mr. Wicken's page and see what entry there is there - A. Mr. Wicken is charged eight pounds seventeen shillings, and under that is the prisoner's hand writing, in the words</p>
               <p>"next journey;" signifying that it was to be paid the next journey. The next journey, we sent another traveller and by that means discovered this fraud. The words</p>
               <p>"next journey," are in the prisoner's hand writing. We never have received this money upon Mr. Wicken's account.</p>

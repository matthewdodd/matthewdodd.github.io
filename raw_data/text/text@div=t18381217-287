                  </hi>. I left this property in a bag on board the William Joliffe steam-packet, from Calais, which was lying off the Custom-house—the porter said my bag was missed—this is my bag and clothes (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)—I left it to go to the Custom-house.</p>

                  </hi>. About six o'clock in the evening of the 6th of December I observed the prisoner cross from Ironmonger-lane to Queen-street with something before him, and in Queen-street I said, "What have you got there"—he made no answer, but left the bag in my hand, and ran away—I called out—he ran backwards and forwards—I secured him—when I got him to the Mansion-house he stated that a man gave it him to carry.</p>

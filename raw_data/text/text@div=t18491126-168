                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On 28th Nov. about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners in a public-house at Dockhead—they asked me to treat them, and I did so, and changed a sovereign—I put my change in a bag in my right trowsers pocket—I then had sixteen shillings in it, in half-crowns and shillings; it was mostly shillings—there was one new one—when I came out, I met two women; I asked them where I could get a lodging—the pri<lb></lb>soners followed us—Cummins caught hold of me on one side and Morgan on the other—I said, "I will not have anything to do with you, if that is the way you are going on"—they said if I would give them a pint of gin they would keep clear of me—I went back and treated them—I came out again</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184911260171"></xptr>
               <p>and they followed me—when we got to the lodging outside the door, Cum<lb></lb>mings struck me in the face—I fell with my head against the step of the door, and my senses were gone—I knew nothing more after that—when I came to, my bag and money were gone—I was not sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I and another female were with Be van; the prisoners came up—I knew Cummins and Morgan—they would insist on following us—at the lodging-house door Cummins pushed the sailor down by his shoulder—he did not strike him—he struck his head on the kerb—Donovan and Morgan were on each side of him with their hands in his pockets, while Cummins held his head between his legs—I fetched a policeman, and gave them in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Smith and Bevan.

About half-past ten o'clock I was on duty, and saw the prisoners on each side of Bevan, and one walking behind—he was the worse for liquor—they were sober—about a quarter before twelve I saw them again with the two women, and about a quarter of an hour after that I saw them going towards their home—I received informa<lb></lb>tion and took them—Cummins was in bed.</p>

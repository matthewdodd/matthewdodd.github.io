               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner accosted you, your coat was buttoned up? - A. Yes; and when I went into the house with her, as we were standing by a sofa, she said to me, what is the reason that you have your coat buttoned, and she took hold of the bottom part, and ripped it open; I am sure my coat had not been unbuttoned till then, from the time I left my shop, in Princes-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. When your coat is buttoned, does your pocket-book make an appearance on the outside? - A. Yes; this is the pocket-book in my pocket now, just as it was when I lost it; there was in it, a Bank-note of 40l. a 20l. note, a 10l. note, a 5l. note, two small notes of 2l. a piece, and three bills of Exchange; I have two of the bills of Exchange,(produces them); one of them I have received the money for since; I have never recovered any of the Bank-notes; I had not taken any account of the numbers.

               <p>Court. Q. Was there any thing in the pocketbook that denoted where you lived? - A. No; I had given information at Bow-street the next day where I lived.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been in possession of these notes? - A. The 40l. and the 20l. I received on the 4th of August, they were paid to me for a check of 60l. that I had upon the house of Morland and Co. in Pall-Mall, drawn by Charles Mills.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not her hair powdered? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take your coat off? - I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you seen Mrs. M'Cann write frequently? - A. I have, many times; I have had many letters from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, and tell us if it is her hand-writing? - A. I do believe it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How many times may you have seen her write altogether? - A. I suppose I may have seen her write twice, once an agreement, and once an authority; and I have had repeated letters brought by this servant, Mary Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her write her name, and her name only, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had never received a letter from her, but only seen her write her name twice, would you have undertaken to swear it was her handwriting? - A. Yes, I would.(The Letter read).</p>
               <p>"Madam,</p>
               <p>"I met your husband sometime ago, whom I did not know, nor would I know if I were to see him; there was another company in the room that went out when we went in; along-side of the sofa I saw a pocket-book; I did not know who it belonged to; but I kept it from Thursday until the Monday; you shall hear more; and I mean to make Mr. Trotter acquainted with the whole transaction, as he is well acquainted with the innocent man Mr. Milne has imprisoned; I am very sorry to hurt you by making you acquainted with this affair."</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Bates). Q. How thick might the letter be which you say you took? - A.It might be a double letter, it was full as thick as my hand, tied round with a packthread.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What was inside, you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Milne). Q. Did you find your pocket-book before this letter arrived? - A.No; when I came home, I found in the possession of my wife my pocket-book, and that letter, with three bills of Exchange.</p>

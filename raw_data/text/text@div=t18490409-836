On Friday, 9th March, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Priest-court, Foster-lane, and saw the prisoner come over a wall in the rear of the Rose and Crown—I took him by the collar, and asked what made him come over the wall—he said it was all right; he had slept there that night—I said I would ring the bell, and see the landlord—I rang it, and he struggled to get away, and bit my hands several times; he then got me down, got my thumb into his mouth, and bit it to the bone—he kept it there about a minute and a half; he then hit my head against the flagstone, and cut it—he got away—I got up, and overtook him by the Post-office gates—a postman came to my assistance, and I took him to the station—I went to the Rose and Crown, then returned, and searched the prisoner, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a pair of gloves, and a handkerchief.</p>

On 9th March I was awoke, and went down to the prisoner's room; he had slept in the house that night—he was not there; there was a bunch of keys in his bed—I missed this dressing-case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and watch, gold chain, and seal, from my bed-room, which was one flight of stairs above his—I have not seen the watch since—the dressing-case contained ten sovereigns, a guinea, seven silver coins, two gold eye-glasses, and other things—I found them all in it—the lock had been tried, but not forced—the prisoner went to bed at ten, and I at two o'clock—I found the landing-window open at six next morning—I had fastened it the night before; it must have been opened from the inside—a person could get down the water-spout from there, and over the wall into Priest-court.</p>

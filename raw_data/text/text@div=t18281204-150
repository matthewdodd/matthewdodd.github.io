            . I am a watchman. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner, and went up and asked what they were doing there - it was a few yards from Feathers-court - they seemed to be arguing aloud; when I spoke to them the prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him - I took her; she dropped five penny-pieces, which I picked up; we thought she had something in her mouth - I put my hand to her throat and she dropped the shilling out of her mouth; I then took her to the watch-house - she had a good way to walk, and I there saw the half-crown taken from her bosom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you find on her altogether? A. I found nothing on her - she dropped the shilling into my hand, and the watch-house-keeper found the half-crown in her bosom; the prosecutor did not say how much he had lost till he got to the watch-house - I will not be certain whether it was before or after the prisoner was searched, that he said he had been robbed - we had trouble enough in taking her to the watch-house- she kicked, and bit, and struck every person that came near her; she appeared very drunk, the prosecutor appeared perfectly sober; to the best of my belief he did not see me before I spoke to them.</p>

            . I was beadle of the night - the prisoner was brought in, and I asked the prosecutor what he was robbed of - he told me; I found this half-crown, this shilling, and this halfpenny, in the prisoner's bosom, and a dirty cap; the prosecutor gave me this farthing, and said he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search her pockets? A. I shook them outside - I did not take them off; the prosecutor said what he had lost before she was searched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040065"></xptr>here is all he said he had lost within sixpence and one halfpenny.</p>

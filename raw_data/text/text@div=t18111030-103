               <p>Q. Was your box locked. - A. No only corded. I put the box in an empty second floor, locked the door, and kept the key myself. On the next day I asked my mistress leave to go out, I obtained leave, I went to the box and got some clean things out, and to get two one pound notes, and left the five pound note in my box. This was between nine and ten on the Sunday morning. I found the things safe in my box, I locked the box and took the key up to the landlord; I returned on the Monday morning; I slept at my mothers; I went up stairs for the key, the landlord was out, I found the key on the table, I took it, and went into the room; when I came back the prisoner was gone. I found the room door locked; when I entered the room I found the rope not tied as I left it, there was nothing left in the box, all the clothes, and the five pound note were gone, I value my clothes at ten pound, I had seven gowns, they cost me twenty-five shillings each, on the 27th of October, I received information that the prisoner was in Oxford Road; I went and saw her, she had one of my gowns on her back, she said she had pledged the things, and left the duplicates at Mrs. Barlow's in Gravell Lane, and if I would forgive her, she would tell me all she could, and pay me half a guinea a week.</p>

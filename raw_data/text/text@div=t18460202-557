               <p>deed—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—"Southall Park, Aug. 12, 1845. My dear Sir,—I thank you for your kind offers of assistance in any matters relative to your dear cousin and myself. There is one little affair in which you can most essentially serve me, and I am sure you will not refuse. When I first addressed dear Mary, I assure you it was not with the most remote wish or thought, that with her I should receive one sixpence fortune; however, from Lady Ellis's kindness and consideration this will not be the case; and as I do not like to be altogether thought in<lb></lb>sensible of appreciating her ladyship's liberality, and also as I wish to pro<lb></lb>vide in the best way I can, although but a humble one, for dear Mary's future comfort, will you, but I know you will, give me your opinion upon the fol<lb></lb>lowing proposal. Under the will of her mother, my late wife was entitled to 916<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., (I think the shillings are right, I know the pounds are,) pay<lb></lb>able on he death of her father, now sixty-eight, and also to one-third share of two shares in the Barnsby Canal, (present price each 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) This of course is mine at the death of Mr. Armstrong. I propose that you would draw out a deed expressive that the above properties should be placed in the hands of trustees, (I submit that yourself and Mr. Henry Wood should be named, if you both will undertake the office,) the interest for our mutual benefit da<lb></lb>ring our lives, and, at the death of us both, that the principal should be divided equally amongst as many children as may be living. I should also wish that a clause should be inserted, saying, that upon the consent of myself and dear Mary, and the two trustees, that it shall be possible to give up to us 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the sum—I will just explain my reason for this wish. As far as we can see at present, prosperity is with us in the world, but God only knows what is in store for us; it may be that hereafter misfortunes may occur, and I think that with that sum at our command we could, by perseverance and industry, perhaps redeem our lost position. Now, will you candidly tell me, have I put my wish in a manner likely to suit the interests of dear Mary? any suggestion from you to alter the plan, believe me, I will receive most thankfully; my only object is to make a provision against possible, though, I trust, not probable adversity. One favour in addition I have to ask, your perfect silence on the subject. I have not as yet told Lady Ellis; I may or may not, but to dear Mary I mean it to be an unexpected marriage-gift, when I place the deed in her hands on our return from church. If you will let me know how much the stamps will cost I will send or call with the amount; the sum altogether will be nearly 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; not much of a settlement, you will say, but my only excuse is that it is the best I can do. Perhaps you will be good enough to let us hear from you in a day or two, at your convenience. I men<lb></lb>tioned to Lady Ellis that I was about writing to you, and she desired me to say that little Willy is very well and happy, and has expressed his intention of going with her ladyship to chapel on Sunday. I fear my long letter must have tired you; so, with every wish and prayer for the health and happiness of yourself and family, request you to believe me most faithfully yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">RICH<lb></lb>ARD COOKE</hi>."</p>

               <p>time I had occasion to become acquainted with his handwriting—I was an attesting witness to this deed—I saw the parties sign this deed—I believe this signature, "Richard Cooke," to this register of a marriage, is the prisoner's handwriting—I believe the signature to this letter to be his handwriting—(letter read)—"21st March, 1844. Dear Sir,—I yesterday addressed a letter to your son, with proposals to bring to a close our present unfortunate situation; and my object in writing to you now is, that you will kindly lend us your assistance towards the accomplishment of such a desirable event. You will perhaps think it rather a bold request on my part after the letters I have addressed to you, but I trust that you will in your goodness forgive the part, as I assure you that nothing but downright starvation staring us in the face could have prompted me to such a measure on my part. I am willing to re<lb></lb>peat any apology you may suggest, or sign any one you may require. I will inform you the terms on which I rely on your interference and favour in our behalf. I have written to Mr. C. Armstrong, begging that he will not prevent Bessy raising 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon her reversionary interest, at your decease. The man<lb></lb>ner in which I propose expending it is as follows: 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the purchase of a business, which I can complete under most favourable circumstances, at Cob<lb></lb>ham, in Surrey; 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid to your son, which he advanced us since the disposal to him of Mrs. Buosseto's legacy; and the remainder to purchase whatever stock may be wanting, and necessaries attending our removal. In return for this, I propose that Bessy shall settle the whole of the remainder of her property, both in possession, or which hereafter she may be possessed of, to heir or heirs, and you in trust for the benefit. The day after this deed it signed I will marry Bessy, and then I trust an end to all our troubles. The business at Cobham is a most excellent one, and the purchase-money includes shop fixtures, a bottle stock (not very large,) and a good portion (one sitting and two bed-rooms full) of household furniture. The 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I propose paying off at the rate of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, so that in four years we shall be free. The rent is only 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a good house, shop with every convenience for business, and no opposition, with 2,300 inhabitants, with my attention and qualification for business, I think I can appeal with confidence even to you—as to my success in Bath, it will prove what my assiduity and patience effected. You may say, on reading this letter, if my intentions are honourable, why not marry Bessy before this settlement is made? I will tell you—owing to my insol<lb></lb>vency, were I to do so, my former creditors could claim every sixpence of Bessy's property in liquidation of their debts, to the amount of 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This I am sure you will see with me is best avoided. Now, sir, that I have pointed out to you the bright side of our prospects, I will state the dark side. To rescue us from our late distressed and dreadful condition we are determined to do something. If your son refuses his sanction to the mortgage, Mr. Binns has a purchaser for the whole of the reversion, with all its faults, for 466<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and, with a full knowledge of the consequences, Bessy will sell it. In every money transaction with you and your son I have taken from Bessy a written consent and authority for the act, indemnifying me from all consequences. We have laid the whole case before counsel, and are aware that if you and your son can prove that you were not aware of our living together unmarried, we are liable to be indicted; but the greatest punishment that would be awarded would he six or twelve months'imprisonment. Now, sir, this, for the sake of hereafter providing for ourselves and poor children (three and another coming) we are prepared to undergo: you can only punish us once, and then Mrs. Bousfield's legacy will also be Bessy's. Now, sir, I implore you to pause before you consign your child and me to a dungeon, and my poor old mother and the poor children to a workhouse. For your child's</p>

               <p>welfare I am sure I need not plead, as her affection for you has ever been in the extreme, and her love for you even now greater than for any one on earth. As to myself, I believe I was not mistaken when I reckoned upon you as my best friend, with your son, and I was only sorry that I could not do more to prove my gratitude than lay in my power. We throw ourselves upon your and your son's power; and may the Almighty God incline you to be merciful towards us. If not, do not think that we shall shrink from our purpose—we shall not, for imprisonment will be far, far better than the penury and wretchedness we have suffered the last eighteen months. In case your son should not be<lb></lb>lieve my statements, I have sent him the agreement for the sale of the busi<lb></lb>ness to me, and the authority sent to Bessy by Mr. Binns for the sale of the reversion. In conclusion, let me beg and pray of you to grant us your in<lb></lb>terference and favour; and in the hope that you will write to me by return of post, I am, dear Sir, yours, &amp;c, <hi rend="smallCaps">R.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live at Ware, in Hertfordshire. In 1844 I knew Mrs. Cook, who was Miss Thomas—in con<lb></lb>sequence of seeing her, I was afterwards in communication with the prisoner—a separation by deed was alluded to, and his marriage was alluded to inci<lb></lb>dentally—he mentioned that he had been married at St. Michael's, Bristol; and I think the year was mentioned, but I am not certain—1825, I think—I know the prisoner's writing intimately, from the communications I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020122"></xptr>
               <p>received I have no doubt whatever that the signatures in this marriage register of "Richard Cooke and Sophia Thomas," are the writing of the prisoner and Mrs. Cooke—the first communication made to me was in Feb., 1844—I did not see the prisoner subsequent to Feb. or March, but I saw Mrs. Cooke through the rest of the year.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: I was with the last witness on the 17th of December, when the prisoners came to Nathan's, in Swallow-street; I was inside the door with another officer, Blackiter; I opened the door; Blackiter said, here are two with swags; that is, that they had something with them; I heard the kegs drop, and a crow; I said to Ferris, that is a crow, I will be bound for it; we took them into the parlour, and Ferris and Blackiter hand-cuffed them; there were two lights in the room; and I took one, and went into the passage, to see what it was that dropped; and I found these two kegs, and this crow, (producing them); I took them into the parlour; and one of them, Wilson, said, they did not belong to them, they did not know any thing of them, they were come in to buy a shirt, I think they said.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What does Nathan deal in? - A. Stolen goods.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That I take for granted; but what is his visible business? - A. He writes up "Nathan, Salesman."</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ferris). Are these the same casks? - A. Yes; one of them fainted away, while we were handcuffing him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Saunders). Look at these casks. - A. These are Mr. Gordon and Mr. Foot's; I know them by the marks; there is a brand mark, and a chalk mark upon them; P.M. White, and F. G.; they contained three gallons of peppermint, and three of gin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Your masters are eminent distillers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They must have a vast number of casks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, I suppose, there is no difference between these casks and other casks, they are made in the same way? - A. Yes; but these are the casks that were taken away out of my cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person in the business with these two gentlemen? - A. No other name that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other partners in your house? - A. No.</p>

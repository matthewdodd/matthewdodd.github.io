I saw a person there, who represented himself as his housekeeper; and, in consequence of what passed between her and myself, I was perfectly satisfied, and sent the goods stated in the indictment to the house, with an inventory of them, and the terms of hire per week, which was 10 s. 6 d.; they were delivered on the 8th October, 1821; I had not then seen Mr. Berry; on the following Monday the week expired, and the housekeeper brought back a pair of sheets and pillowcases, and paid 10 s. 6 d. for the week's hire. In the afternoon an order was sent for six more tablespoons for one night's use, which I sent without a list; and about three days after I sent the porter for the spoons; he did not bring them, nor have I seen them since. Five or six weeks after, not having received any more money, and hearing something, I applied for the arrears, and saw a person who I understood to be Mrs. Berry; I got neither goods or money from her. A few days after I called again, and saw the servant. I went several times until the 21st of December, when I was determined not to leave till I got satisfied. I was in the house about an hour and a-half, and while there, the prisoner came in, the servant said to him,</p>

I said, Mr. Berry, I have come for the goods which you have belonging to my master; and out of the house I cannot go without the goods or the hire." I told him where I came from, and shewed him the list of the goods; he said his wife was in the country - she had the property locked up, and that on Saturday on her return they should be given up, and the hire paid. I left very dissatisfied, and said I would not quit the house; he then took out his pocket-book, and shewed ten or twelve bills of exchange to the amount of about 2000 l. He picked out one for 150 l., which he said was the smallest, and I was to hold it as security until the following Saturday, when he would return the goods, and I left (the bill was here produced, dated 1st November, 1821, upon

            . I am proprietor of the furnished house, No. 2, Park-street, Grosvenor-square. On the 3d of October, I let it to Mr. and Mrs. Berry, for the year, at 190 l. The prisoner said they came from Worcester, and they could only give reference to two houses in the city; they referred me to Bull and Brooksbank, No. 5, Adam's-court, at the back of the Bank - who the prisoner said were their agents, and said he was a gentleman coming to reside in town with his aunt. I went to Bull and Co., who gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230066"></xptr>him a very excellent character. I never got a quarter's rent, and could hear no more of Bull and Co. Calford applied to me; I gave him information. They went from my house, a little before the quarter was due, all but the maid-servant. On my coming in, she said she had received a letter from Mrs. Berry, to meet her in Portman-square. I sent a person with her to meet her mistress, but she ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had the goods, or saw them - and Mrs. Berry says she never ordered them, nor ever paid any thing for the hire of any thing in the house.</p>

No, he appeared to be intoxicated; I shewed him several patterns; he took up one handkerchief and laid it down on the counter and put his hat upon it, and when he took the hat up again the handkerchief was not there; he asked me to shew him more patterns; I told him I could not; he took his hat in his hand and went out of the shop; I communicated to Mr. Watts what I had observed; he told me to go and bring him back immediately; I did so; he had got two yards from the door; I brought him back, I asked him for the handkerchief; he said he had not it; I spoke to Mr. Watts that the prisoner was to be searched; he went in a great rage and passion; he said he would scorn such a thing; he turned one of his coat pockets out to convince me that he had nothing about him; the constable arrived and searched him; the handkerchief was found under his arm, between the shirt and the body; when he was charged with the constable he did not seem to be intoxicated.</p>

I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of this man, July 12th, between eight and nine o'clock; when I came to the shop; we took him backwards into a little room; I unbuttoned his waistcoat and put my hand into the bosom of his shirt; I found the handkerchief concealed under his arm between the shirt and the flesh; I searched his pocket book; I found a five pound note, which I have got in my possession; it is a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the handkerchief any mark on it - A. Yes; it has now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He pulled the shirt over my shoulders; can he look at me as an honest man and say that he took the handkerchief from me; when he found the five pound note in my pocket, I said it is a bad one. I said I was ordered to keep it in my pocket book till. I found the owner that gave it me.</p>
               <p>Pinner. I took it from under your arm. I am sure he was not intoxicated; after I had got charge of him I took hold of his right arm; going along, about twenty yards from the prosecutor's house, he hit me on the face and knocked me down; at the same time I twisted my leg and entangled it in his; he was secured; I used him directly.</p>

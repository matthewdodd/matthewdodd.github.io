            . I am one of the company's elders, my business is to take care of the company's goods when they come in, and see them delivered out; the prisoner was employed as a labourer. On Thursday the second of April, when I was discharging the people that were employ'd in the company's warehouses, the prisoner at the bar came down (I being informed before that he had been clandestinely at work at the teas in the chests, and that he had concealed some in a bag in his breeches behind) when he came I searched him, as I usually do at going out, I rub them down as they call it; I said to the prisoner, What have you got here in your breeches? and put my hand between his thighs. He said a little tea. I ordered him to pull it out, and let me have it. He unbuttoned his breeches, and took it out, and gave it to me, and I delivered it to the king's officer, and took him into the compting-house, and sent for Mr. Mordan; we weighed the tea in the prisoner's presence, it weighed one pound eight ounces. I was before my lord mayor with the prisoner, the prisoner was charged with taking of it, and he owned he had been guilty of it.</p>

            . I was a labourer belonging to the company; on the second of April I saw the prisoner walk round the place where we were all at work; I walked after him, I saw him take tea out of several of the chests; I had often before told him he should never walk by himself, and so had other people; we were at this time making up the tea in the chests after the shew.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do with the tea you saw him take?</p>
               <p>Boulderston. He put it in a bag, this was about nine in the morning, I let it alone till near two, then I informed Mr. Adams of what I had seen him do. When we went to go out I was next but one to the prisoner, I saw Mr. Adams search him; Mr. Adams ask'd him to give it to him, the prisoner took it out, and delivered it to him; it was afterwards weighed, and before my lord mayor he was charg'd with taking it, and he own'd he did take it, in my hearing, and said he was very sorry, and said he left it to his lordship's mercy, as well as the directors.</p>

            . I am housekeeper to Mr. Bedford. I saw the prisoner at his house on the evening of the 7th of January - Mr. Bedford went out; he waited about half an hour, and went away a quarter to eight o'clock; he asked me to do him a favour - I said I would if I could: he said it was to take a note to get some money for him -I said we had no ink, and he gave the little boy a halfpenny to get some; he was gone some time - the prisoner said he could not wait; I said if he would mind the place I would go and look for the boy; I went, and was absent two or three minutes; when I returned the door was open, the prisoner and the watch were gone - it was there when I went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not requested me to watch the place before? A. No; I never said the boy was dishonest and had robbed his parents; I have said he was a bad little boy for stopping on his errands - I never said I could not trust him to bring home money; I have found him deficient in a halfpenny or so; but I never said so to the prisoner.</p>

I have gone home and found two or three persons there; Mrs. Suttle and I have had a bit of talk, and sometimes had a drop of gin together; she has left me to mind the keys; this is the first time I ever was in my present situation - I am innocent; Mrs. Suttle soon after sent the boy for a halfpenny worth of ink, and she went after him - I was obliged to go to meet a young man who is now at Chelmsford - and when I went, on my oath, the watch was there.</p>

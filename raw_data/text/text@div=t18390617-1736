On the night of Easter Sunday I was at home—I went to the door to let a friend out about ten minutes after eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner Moylan get out of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about three doors off, and run up the court—he was up there about ten minutes—he went towards his mother's house—when he came back he met the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> opened the door, and somebody inside gave him a parcel out like sheeting or bed furniture—he took it up the court, came back, and took a second parcel, and then a third—as he was taking the third out a white Tuscan bonnet fell down out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner Thomas, as I suppose it to be was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he tried to stoop, but the cab seemed so full he could not stoop, and Moylan said he would pick it up—I then went in, and went to bed, and heard the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> off about a quarter of an hour afterwards—this was on the same side of the road as our house—our door is close to the court—I was not above a yard and half or two yards from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I have known Moylan between six and seven years—I supposed the other person to be Thomas by his voice, which I had heard two or three times before, and I had seen them go out together between two and three o'clock that afternoon—I have known Thomas nearly two years—I only saw him in the act of stooping in the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

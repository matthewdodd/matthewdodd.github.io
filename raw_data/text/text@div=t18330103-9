On the 10th of December, at one o'clock in the morning, I took a cabriolet in Tottenham-court-road; the prisoner was the driver - I drove it to various parts of London, and returned to Tottenham-court-road at a quarter to four o'clock; I went into a public-house there: I had nothing to drink there - I went to the King's Head, and think the prisoner had something to drink there; when I got to the public-house in Tottenham-court-road, I paid the prisoner 4s., and one of the traces being broken, he demanded 6d. more - I would not pay him, and he gave me in charge of a Policeman; I was taken to the station-house, and on giving my address there, the inspector set me at liberty - I passed up Tottenham-court-road, and saw nothing of the prisoner till I crossed the New-road, towards Camden-town; I then met the prisoner without his cab - a person named Young was with him; he said, "He was extremely sorry for taking me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030020"></xptr>the station-house:" I took no notice; and then he said as it was a cold morning, would I object to give him some warm beer - I said, "Not the least," and we went to the King's Head, at the corner of Hampstead-road; he had some beer there, which I paid for, and left the house - he followed me; I went through several streets, until I arrived at <placeName id="t18330103-9-crimeloc62">Carburton-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A clerk; I have to say, that in taking the prisoner into custody, he was in such a state of intoxication, we could not take him before the Magistrate at the usual hour, and deferred it till the evening - I consider that he got intoxicated with my money; I had been at a party in the King's-road, Pimlico: I went there about eight o'clock, and staid till about half-past ten - I played at cards, and different diversions; I had about two glasses of home-made wine there, that was all - I went from there to my employer's, in Edgware-road, staid there about a quarter of an hour, and went from there to Tottenham-court-road, without stopping: I live in York-place, Kentish-town - I drove to different parts of London, first to the King's Head, St. Giles'; the prisoner had a small glass of brandy there, which I paid for; I had nothing - I drove myself; I got to the King's Head about a quarter past one o'clock: I went from there to the watering-house in the Old Bailey; I had no business there, it was merely in my way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where to? A. To no place in particular - I did not get out of the cab there; the prisoner said it was cold, and wished for something - he had a small glass of brandy there, which I paid 4d. for; I then drove over Blackfriars-bridge, and back over London-bridge, down Fenchurch-street, to the Old Bailey again: I gave him a glass of brandy there - then drove through Covent-garden, Drury-lane, to Tottenham-court-road; I went into the Red Lion there, and gave him up the cab - it was about five o'clock; I called for some bread and cheese for supper, and he came in, and asked for 6d., for the broken trace: I did not pay for it - 4s. was what he demanded for his fare.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was pulling you into the house in Carburton-street, why not give an alarm? A. I did not consider his intention was to rob me; I told him repeatedly to desist, but he would not, and then he tried to push me in - I did not call out, because people were standing by, and if I had chosen to use any means I could have done so, without assistance; there were one or two cab-men standing by the door, when I called for the Policeman - my money was scattered about the street; the persons about were a set of cab-men: I saw nobody in the house, but two women - if I had offered to detain the prisoner I considered I should not have got off so easy, as there were a number of cab-men, and such sort about; I am not in the habit of associating with such fellows - I considered the 245l. quite safe; I have had treble that sum in my pocket - it was a silly foolish excursion; I am not in the habit of doing so.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live in Carburton-street. On Tuesday morning, the 10th of December, I was at my door, and observed the prosecutor pulled about by a set of cab-men, and observed the prisoner lay hold of his coat and pull it open - his pocket-book fell out, and the money fell out; I saw the prisoner pick up some money, but what it was I cannot say; and I saw Young distinctly pick up money, and put it in his pocket; I beckoned to the prosecutor to come over - I certainly observed the prisoner pick up something; I could not tell whether it was money or not - he picked up something twice off the ground; I could not see what he did with it - I could distinctly see that it was money which Young picked up: I beckoned to the prosecutor to come over to my door - he came into the shop; he gave me his pocket-book to take care of - there was a 200l. note in it, and other notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the prosecutor pulled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030021"></xptr>about by a set of cab-men? A. Yes, I saw the prisoner pull him; there is a cab-yard next to my house, and the cabmen assemble at the house opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Just tell me whether you saw the prosecutor pulled about by the cab-men, and then the prisoner seized hold of him? A. Young, who has escaped is a cab-man, and they both pulled him about - the others were round him; I cannot say whether they touched him - I did not go up to the prosecutor; I was across the street - the prosecutor stood against the Lord Nelson public-house; I did not leave my shop to give him in charge - I had nobody in it; the prosecutor called for a Policeman for a quarter of an hour, but there was none - the station is about a quarter of a mile from my house; the prisoner had wooden shoes on - I saw him go away at last; he walked away leisurely.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prosecutor intoxicated? A. No, he appeared as if he had been out all night, raking, but not drunk; he knew what he was about, and delivered his money into my hands.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SOPER. I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner at twelve o'clock on Tuesday, the 11th of December, at his lodging, Ames-yard, Charles-street, Hampstead-road - he was drunk and asleep; I told him I wanted him to go with me - he said, "I know all about it, go on, and I will follow you;" he then dozed off again -I told him the gentleman gave charge of him for robbing him; he said, "It was a b-y good job to charge him with robbing him, for he had got nothing;" I searched him and his lodging, and found no money at all - the prosecutor was with me; I saw him about nine o'clock - he appeared as if he had been drinking, but was not drunk then.</p>

            , I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Tottenham-court-road, on Thursday morning, about five o'clock - the prisoner gave the prosecutor in charge for not paying his fare; Roberts, at that time, I could perceive had been drinking, but knew perfectly what he was about - I could tell by his appearance that he had been out all night - he talked rational; I afterwards saw the prisoner in company with another man - I overtook them in Tottenham-court-road; it was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after Roberts was discharged; I was with them in the Blue-posts public-house, and drank a glass of rum with them - I heard the prisoner say Roberts had got plenty of money, between 200l. and 300l. - that he saw two 10l. notes in his front coat pocket, and he put his hand to his breast: Young and another person were standing behind him at the time - he knew that I was present; he left the house with Young - they drove the cab away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you on duty that night? A. Yes, my beat is nearly half a mile from Carburton-street; I had my uniform coat on - the prisoner paid for my rum; I was sober - I was off duty then; we are not forbid to go to public-houses when off duty - I did not know him before; the prisoner said he had been paid 4s., and demanded 6d. more at the public-house, but at the station-house he demanded 2s. 6d. - he demanded the 6d. for his fare; I heard nothing about the trace till afterwards - there ought to be a Policeman round Carburton-street, but it takes the man there half an hour to go round his beat; the station is three quarters of a mile from the Lord Nelson, I think.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Who was driving the cab? A. Nobody; when I saw it they were in the public-house, and the cab was at the door - the prosecutor walked from the station-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor went to several houses and was quite intoxicated; he drank at every house as I did - he changed a sovereign at the Old Bailey, to give the waterman something to drink; he treated several people who stood round.</p>

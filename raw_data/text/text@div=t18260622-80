On the 10th of November I let the prisoner a back parlour, furnished, for 5s. a week - he lodged there four days and left without notice; when he had been gone out about three hours I saw a large fire in the room; I went in and extinguished it - it appeared to have been done designedly - it was the cupboard which was burning, about two feet from the fire-place; there was no fire in the fire-place, but there had been a candle upon one corner of the mantel-shelf, which is connected with the cupboard; the paper of the wall had been pulled down, and there had been paper put under one of the cupboard shelves, which had been burning, but had gone out; I did not see it burning; I then missed the property - I believe the door was locked, but I broke it open as I did not get any answer. I never saw the prisoner or his wife till the 28th of May, when I was, by chance, walking along Park-lane, and saw him talking to another man - he ran down Park-lane and into a mews, where a gentleman stopped him, and he was taken to the watch-house. No person was in the room during the four days he occupied it but himself and his wife. I had lost the key out of my parlour door while he was there, which made me suspicious.</p>

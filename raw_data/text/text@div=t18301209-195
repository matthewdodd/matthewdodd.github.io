               <p>THOMAS WOOLCOTT. I am in the service of Richard Hall and another - they are <rs id="t18301209-195-viclabel1095" type="occupation">linen-draper</rs>

The prisoner came to their shop on the 10th of November, and had a cloak on her arm, which I suspected she had stolen from the door; I looked, and missed one - she then put it on a stool; I served her with what she wanted, and she took the cloak and went out - I followed her six or seven yards from the door; I then examined the cloak, and found it was my employer's - I asked her how she got it; she said a woman gave it her to carry - I had never seen her before; this is the cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the prosecutor's shop, which is not five minutes walk from my lodging, to get some silk and some calico to finish my work - I came out and was crossing the road, when I recollected I wanted some black silk; I went back to the shop, and before I got to the window a woman asked me to carry the cloak to No. 12, Eyre-street-hill; I was going that way in a minute; I went into the shop, bought the silk, took up the cloak, and was coming out, not knowing it to be stolen- is it likely I should have gone and stolen the cloak in a public street, then go in, lay it down before the eyes of the shopman, take it up, and come out again with it?</p>

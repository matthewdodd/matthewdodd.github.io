I was at the portico of the chapel, and heard the prisoner say, "Look if your handkerchief is not down on the ground;" the prosecutor looked, but it was not there; the prisoner then said let him look, he stooped, and I saw him take this handkerchief from some part of his person, and put it on the ground.</p>

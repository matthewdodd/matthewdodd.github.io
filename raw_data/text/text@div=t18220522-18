            . I live at Rotherhithe, and have a warehouse in Broad-street. On the 11th of May, about nine o'clock at night, I was going up <placeName id="t18220522-18-crimeloc95">Lombard-street</placeName>

My chain and seals were brought up from an area in Ball-alley, the pendant of the watch was broken.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and was in Ball-alley; I heard a cry of Stop thief! coming from the Lombard-street end of the Alley. The prisoner was running in a direction from the cry, nobody else was in the alley - I collared and held him till the prosecutor came up, which was in about one minute and a half; he begged me to let him go; I refused; he did not ask why I held him. I stopped him over an area, he shuffled about, and I thought I saw something drop from him. A number of persons had come out of their houses by that time. A woman in the house brought up the chain and seals, and gave them to Mr. Lainson who appeared much hurt, and desired me to hold the prisoner - he gave no account of himself, but begged Mr. Lainson to excuse him, and look over it, and it should not happen again; he said the same at the watch-house.</p>

            . Last Tuesday, between one and two in the Afternoon, the Prisoner brought this Pot to sell; my Husband stopped the Pot, and came in, and told me, he had got a Pot of Mr Crisp's; I said to the Prisoner I will go along with you to Mr Crisp's: No, says she, by G - you shall not; and gave me several Blows, and said, no, I will not go; I do not care a Pin for you; I would have detained her if I could, but she went out of the Shop.</p>
               <p>Mr Wilson. The Prisoner brought this Pot to me to sell, whether she put it into the Scale, or whether I did, I cannot tell; I asked her whose it was, she said, she would go and fetch the Person that owned it; I told her, I must stop her, she gave me two or three Slaps, and tore my Shirt out of the Gathers; we followed her, and took her; when she got into London, she said, she did not value us; she abused us very much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had the Pot from a Person who came from Mr Crisp's House, and was so much in Liquor, that I could not tell what I did. <rs id="t17430629-59-verdict328" type="verdictDescription">

On Monday morning a little after six o'clock, I heard the street door open, it was double locked; the door stood open for some considerable time, for a few minutes; and I said, damn the fellow, he has left the street door open; and as I got up the door shut too; I went down and called to my wife, and asked her if the bed and bedding was in the one pair of stairs, she said yes; I said they were gone; and I heard no tidings of them till my wife brought the prisoner to Guildhall.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner in out of charity, I let him have that bed and blankets, he said he paid one shilling a week, and had only the floor to sleep on; I thought it very hard as I had that bed to spare; I bought him a halfpenny worth of bread when I had not another halfpenny in the world, because he brought home turnips and potatoes and had no bread; I told him if he would come home at twelve o'clock the next day, I would endeavour to get something for him for dinner after his being at work, for he said he had a place at a paviour's; he never came home again, and I never saw him again till I met him on London Bridge on the Saturday after; with that I asked him how he could be so cruely after my being such a friend to him, to take these things away as I was but poor myself; he said, he knew it was very wrong, but he expected to receive some prize money, and he would make me any acknowledgement whatever I desired; but he said, he had not made away with the things, he had them all, he told me, he would take me where the things were; I said, I did not chuse to go where they were; I said, if he would go home with me to my husband he might acknowledge the things to him, with that he walked out of Tooley-street to go with me, and he came down Thames-street, then he turned up a turning where I did not know my way home, I told him it was not the way home, I had hold of him by the right arm and he shifted to the left and gave me a terrible lick on the side with his elbow, and threw out my arm; he turned down a turning where a man stood at a cart, and I bid him lay hold of that man and he did; I took him to the Lord Mayor; when he was at my Lord Mayor's, I said, I believed he had the trowsers on, and they were taken off, when my husband came, he said he knew the trowsers were his; I never found the things again.</p>
               <p>Did you mention to him what things you had missed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What things did you tell him you had missed? - I asked him what he had done with the bed, he said he had got it; I mentioned the shirts, he said he had not made away with any of them, nor would on any account; I never found any thing but the trowsers.</p>
               <p>What were these things worth together? - About nineteen shillings and six pence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in the Minories. I have some land at Plaistow, in Essex—I had three oxen and ten sheep in the Four-acre field—I saw them safe at four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 11th Sept.—I saw them again on the 15th Sept., in a stable or shed belonging to the prisoner, in Rawstorne-place, City-road, between eight and nine—I was with the inspector—I have since seen the skins of eight of my sheep (I lost nine sheep) at a fellmonger's in Russell-street, Bermondsey—after the pri<lb></lb>soner had been examined before the Magistrate, I went to the cell where he was—he said to me, "Mr. Youl, I don't wish to keep you out of your pro<lb></lb>perty; the nine sheep were slaughtered by Mr. Pritchard, and the carcases were sent to Mr. Chandler, a meat-salesman in Newgate-market; any time you like to call, you can have a check or the money for them."</p>

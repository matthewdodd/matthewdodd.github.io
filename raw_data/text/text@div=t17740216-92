            . On the 19th of January, in the morning, I went down to the water side; I saw Russel stand on the south-side, and Powell rowing a boat from the north-shore to the south; my brother, who was with me, thought they were smugglers, and asked me if I had any skulls, and said if I had there was a chance for me; as I am a custom-house officer. I went into a boat and overtook Powell; when I came along side I saw it was iron; Powell rowed the boat on shore; I followed him, and found Russel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160050"></xptr> walking to and fro by a blacksmith's window. I asked him who the iron belonged to; he equivocated; I said it looked as if it was run, and if it was I would seize it for the king and myself; he said it was not worth my while to seize such a piece of iron as that: then he said it belonged to a mate of a ship, and then to

             a blacksmith; the smith got up, and said it was not his; then I asked for a piece of chalk and said I would put a broad arrow upon the boat, for I believed the iron was run or stole: then Russel went down and stept into the boat, and was going to push it off; I took him by the collar, pulled him out of the boat, and brought him up to an ale-house, and there was Powell. Powell rowed the boat over and went into the ale-house; when the boat was rowed on shore I was about a hundred yards from it; I pursued them directly; when I came on shore they were neither of them in the boat: I left my brother to take care of the boat while I went on shore after them; I secured Russel; the other ran down, put the boat off, and threw the iron over-board; my brother, seeing him throw it over, got a boat, and rowed after him, and brought him back; I gave the constable charge of both of them. I asked him why he threw the iron over-board; he said I might be d - d, the iron in the water could tell no tales. They were carried to the round-house, and my brother and I went to search for the iron, and took up five bars.</p>

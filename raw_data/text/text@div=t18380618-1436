                  </hi>. In April last I was in the service of William Tho<lb></lb>mas, and others, boot and shoe makers, in Cheapside—I cannot tell to a month when I went into their service, but I was there about six or seven months—the prisoner was in their service when I went—about two or three months after I had been there, when we were down in the cellar where we worked, he asked me if I was <hi rend="italic">dry</hi>, I said, "Yes"—he said no more then, but he gave me a pair of boots at the corner of Cheapside, when we went to dinner, and told me to go and pledge them—he had fetched them down stain, I believe, but I did not see—I pledged them—from that time until the 2nd of April we were in the habit of doing this—he used to fetch them out—on the 2nd of April we went away together at dinner time, one o'clock, and we went to Drury-lane first—I received a pair of boots from him there, and did something with them by his directions—after I had done so I went with him to Farringdon-street, he there gave me these shoes—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a fair of shoes</hi>)—and told me to go and pledge them—I said, "No; it is your turn"—he walked right into the pawnbroker's, (Mr. Fleming's,) and came ont without the shoes—he told me he had got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them; he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he showed me the duplicate, and then chewed it up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you convict this man do you expect to get off yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know; I should think I should get off—I was dressed just the same as I am now when I went to Farringdon-street—I had a hat—the prisoner was dressed just as he is now—I was porter in the house—I believe there were plenty of boots and shoes in the shop—I have always heard so—I have been in the shop—I was in the shop once with Mr. Thomas's brother—I do not know how often I have been in the shop—it is a good many times—I thought you meant the warehouse; the shop opens at eight o'clock in the morning—the place I was in once with Mr. Thomas's brother is up stairs where the shoes are kept—I have been often there with some of the men—I was never there alone—Mr. Thomas knows that—he is not always there—I cannot tell whether I have been there twenty or thirty times—I have been sometimes in the morning, and some<lb></lb>times at noon, but not at night—I have been there a few times—I will not swear I have not been there fifty times—I did not deny all knowledge of this till I was before the Magistrate—I expected to be tried.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not tell your master when you had pledged two or three pairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know how to get out of it—I thought I was doing wrong the first time—I never did any thing of the kind before in my life—I asked the prisoner whose they were—he called me a bad name, a fool, and told me to go on—I knew whose they were—I do not know why I asked him—I did not know exactly at first whose they were, because my master's mark was not on the first pair—I looked to see if his mark was on, and then asked him whose they were—he called me a b——fool, and told me to go on—he did not tell me whose they were at first—I pawned them after a bit, about five minutes after—I did not like to do it—I did not go and tell my master, as I did not wish to get him into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I pawned the first pair against my will—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that—I did not care about taking that—I gave the duplicates to him—he gave me a few of them, and I gave them to Sharp who used to work with roe at Mr. Hawes's, in Green-street—he is not a friend of mine—I do not know what I gave him the tickets for—I was afraid of being caught.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. Fleming, a pawn-broker in Farringdon-street. On the 2nd of April I received a pair of shoes in pledge from the prisoner for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have the duplicate—he gate the name of John White, No. 9, Union-court—I have not been asked by Mr. Thomas, or any one, to state what was untrue for any sum of money, nor should any thing tempt me to do it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you missed property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Our stock is so extensive it would be impossible to miss it, unless it were tiny thing of a peculiar kind—our stock is some thirty thousand pairs—it is kept in three or four different places—these were at the top of the Cross Keys Inn—the persons who work in the cellar had to go up to that warehouse to fetch the stuff—Brooks had no access there, unless he was sent by the prisoner—if he chose to go up he might—we should have thought it extraordinary if we had known it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, my father is a tailor. My father seat me out on an errand on 27th Jan., and as I was coming along Brick-lane it struck half-past twelve o'clock at night—when I was near Wentworth-street I saw the prosecutor at the corner—I never knew him before—he put his hand into his right trowsers-pocket, and said he had not a shilling in his pocket—he was talking to himself—he went from the corner and came back again—the prisoner and three or four men were at the corner—one of them caught the prosecutor by the collar, and the prisoner turned his pockets inside out—I am sure he is the man that did it—I was three or four yards off him—he then caught him by the arm, brought him four or five yards down Went<lb></lb>worth-street, and there he threw him down on his head—I did not see him take anything out of his pocket—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> do not think that they saw me—the pro<lb></lb>secutor was quite drunk—the others had gone up Brick-lane, and after the prisoner had thrown the prosecutor down, be ran up Brick-lane—I saw the prosecutor's head bleed—I stayed there till a policeman came, and then there came three or four more—the one that came first ordered a stretcher to be brought, and he held up the prosecutor on his knees till it was brought.</p>

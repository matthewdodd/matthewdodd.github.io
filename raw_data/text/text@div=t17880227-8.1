               <p>Who pays the rent of the house where you live? - I myself; on the morning of the 31st of January, the watchman alarmed me about four o'clock; he called out, the front door is open; I saw that door secured over night; I came down stairs, and went into the parlor, and found the parlor door that goes into the shop open, which very much alarmed me, for I had the key of that door in my pocket, and knew it was locked; I did not lock it myself, but I always look at the doors; I looked round the parlor; we have a large desk and a small one in the parlor, both of them were fast; I went into the shop and looked at the window, but missed nothing there; I then looked round the shop again, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270017"></xptr>saw a glass case was out of its place, and I found it on the ground near the parlor door, with the back upwards, and the lock broke open, and one watch left in it; there were thirty-five watches in it the night before, it was the case we kept the watches in that we can warrant, and that want repairing; I sent my boy to Kennington to acquaint Mr. Davidson of the situation we were in; I went to Bow-street about seven o'clock, and gave information of what I had lost, and printed hand-bills.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any part of the house where any body had got in? - On going down stairs, I found a sky-light over the kitchen dresser broke, big enough for a man to get through, there were two panes broke, they were feather panes, one over the other, and nothing between; there were some pieces of glass on the dresser, and the mark of a foot: about nine o'clock, Mr. Littler, who is servant to Mr. Jones pawnbroker, in Fleet-street, came to me; I went with him to Mr. Jones's, where I was shewn a watch; I did not immediately recollect it, it being a watch that had been left with me, and not my own; I recollected the string and the key, but upon looking further at it, I recollected the watch; the prisoner was there; I got a constable and secured him; he was taken into the parlor and searched; I observed he had something in his hand be wanted to get rid of; I secured his hand and found these ear-rings in it, which are mine, I took them out of the prisoner's hand myself; there were some other things found upon him by the constable in my presence; the inside case of a watch, and a French beuded buckle, and a duplicate of a watch which was pawned at Mr. Fleming's, in Holborn; a person was sent for that watch to Mr. Fleming's, and brought it to Mr. Jones's; some of my property was in Kent-street-road, near the turnpike.</p>

               <p>On his cross examination, it appeared that the partner had never slept in the house, but that the rent and taxes, with the servants wages, were paid out of the joint-stock; on which accounts, the Court were of opinion, that the burglary should have been laid to be a breaking open of the dwelling-house of both the partners, and that not being so laid, the indictment was not sufficient to support that part of the charge.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Fleming, pawnbroker, in High Holborn. On the 31st of January, about half an hour after eight in the morning, the prisoner came to my master's shop, and offered a silver watch to pawn; I lent him a guinea upon it; I made out a duplicate of it myself, and gave it him; this, (looking at it) is the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes; he is the same man; the Monday before he left a coat, and redeemed it when he brought the watch. (The watch shewn the witness.)</p>
               <p>This is the watch; I just now opened it; the screw being loose, the top sell off.</p>
               <p>What are the words after Hollingsworth in the duplicate? - Drury-lane; he said he lived at White-horse-yard, in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Essex. That watch is mine and Mr. Davidson's property; the chain has a link of it broke; I have a clear recollection, that I observed that watch among the rest, the night before they were lost; was put there as it wanted repairing.</p>
               <p>Look at the gilt metal watch; do you know that? - Yes, by the key and string; it belongs to a gentleman we do business for; not being my own, I was at a loss for the name and number, and did not specify them as I did the rest.</p>
               <p>Do you know the ear-ring? - Yes; I can swear to it; I have had it a long time in my possession.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark upon it? - We never mark our goods particularly, farther than from observation.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark upon it? - I don't know it but from occular demonstration, as I know one man from another.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that rings are to be distinguished from one another, as much as men are? - Much more so.</p>
               <p>Can you identify that buckle? - I cannot, they are more common than rings are.</p>
               <p>Court. What are these ear-rings? - Garnet coloured.</p>
               <p>What stone is it? - I don't think it is any stone; I believe it is composition.</p>
               <p>To Littler. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - I saw him the very morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270019"></xptr>he came to our shop between eight and nine o'clock, in the road leading from the Obelisk to Black Friars Bridge; I took particular notice of it; I thought, at first, he had been a person I knew, who is shop-man to Mr. Davidson, in the Borough, and was going to speak to him; upon his coming to our shop, I said to myself, this is the very man I met, and mistook this morning.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know by these entries for whom you clean these watches? - By the numbers; it goes on, No. 1, 2, and so on.</p>
               <p>Then these following numbers are all let to Mr. Essex's account? - Yes, there are other names before and after; I keep a day book for chance customers.</p>
               <p>What are these figures in the margin; there is a 6 and an 8? - The days of the month; the 6th and the 8th of February; I had cleaned none for Mr. Essex, from the 26th of January, to the 6th of February.</p>
               <p>In the former entries the month is put to all the figures; how came you to omit it in these latter numbers, in February? - I can give no other reason but neglect in me.</p>

On the 31st of March I went to bed at ten o'clock; I fastened the doors and shutters myself - I let the kitchen and first floor to Bracher, who went to bed before us - I was not alarmed in the night; I got up about seven; Bracher was up first - when I came down the house was perfectly secure, as far as I saw; but in about half an hour I missed a pair of lustres, worth about 2l., from the parlour mantel-piece, also two silver spoons and a mustard spoon, worth 30s., and two coats, which hung in the passage - the party had got into the house by cutting open the glass of the kitchen window, and putting through their arms to remove the fastening; the kitchen window looks into an area in the street - when Mrs. Bracher came down, she found the place in confusion, and called my attention to the window; her things were displaced - on the following day, the 1st of April, about noon, I took the prisoner myself; I found one of my coats on his back; it was one of two coats stolen from the passage - he had been in my employ about four years, and has fastened these shutters scores of times; I am certain it is my coat - I had worn it the night before; he was not an apprentice, but paid by the week; he had absconded himself from me on the 8th of March, without notice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never fastened the shutters. Witness. I am certain he fastened them oftener than I did.</p>

            . I lodge in the prosecutor's house with my wife - we have no servant; I occupy the kitchen and first floor. I went to bed a few minutes before ten o'clock - the kitchen has inside shutters, and a wooden bar; I am quite sure the shutters were secure when we went to bed; I saw them safe at half-past seven in the morning - I found the curtain rod displaced, and the square of glass broken; a person could get in by putting his arm over, turning the cross of the bar, and get into the house - my wife went down before me.</p>

            . I went to bed with my husband; I came down about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - I went into the kitchen before him; I found the iron bar displaced, and the window broken, which enabled a person to get into the house - the tinder-box was moved; a brass tobacco-box and pack of cards were taken away - every thing was perfectly safe when we went to bed; I do not know whether the prisoner ever fastened up the shutters.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 1st of April I was in Red Lion-street; Mr. Ladson delivered the prisoner into my charge - he said nothing to the charge; I took the coat off his back - Mr. Ladson claimed it - the prisoner made no reply to that.(Coat produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought that coat on the Wednesday before the robbery, in Petticoat-lane - the prosecutor did not live in that part of the house; what could I have to do with the shutters?</p>
               <p>MR. LADSON. He had repentedly fastened the shutters, which were broken open.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did you employ him to shut up your lodger's window? A. No; it was at a time when the lodgings were unoccupied for a quarter of a year - I have not found the other property.</p>
               <p>MRS. BRACHER. I fastened the shutters that night.</p>

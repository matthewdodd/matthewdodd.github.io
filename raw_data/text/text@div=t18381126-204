                  </hi>. I am assistant to my father, John Dale; he is a master carman, and lives in Stoney-lane, Tooley-street. On the 10th of January I gave Dennis two hogsheads of sugar—he was a carman of ours—I had known the prisoner before—he had been in our employ six or seven months—Dennis was to take one hogshead to Mr. Sayers, and another to Mr. Davies, of Cullum-street—he was gone longer than he ought to have</p>

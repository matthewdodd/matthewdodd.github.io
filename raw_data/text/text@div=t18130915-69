             an assistant there - A. He was. The prisoner asked to look at some calico;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150045"></xptr>she gave me a five shilling and sixpenny dollar, and asked me to give her change for it; at the same time she asked me to let her look at some French cambric, and when I shewed it her and opened it I told over the pieces. I observed her hand upon that single piece of cambric, that made me look more particular at her. I had suspicion of her when she came in. At last she fixed upon a cambric, and asked for three nails, and while I was cutting it I observed her take a piece of cambric from the counter, and throw it under her arm. I cut the piece of cambric for her, and moved the cambric from off the counter. I gave her the change, and while I was stooping for the paper I observed her put the cambric that she had stolen under her apron. After I had given her the change I charged her with stealing a piece of cambric.</p>

               <p>Q. You observed her steal it - A. Yes. She denied having the cambric at first; I told her I must search her, upon which she put her hand into her apron and threw the cambric behind the counter. This is the piece of cambric; it is the property of my employers. The value of it is six shillings.</p>

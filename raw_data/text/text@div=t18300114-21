            . I live at No. 3, New-court, Angel-alley - my father is a weaver; I know Mrs. Patten - I was coming out of Long-alley, and saw a young man coming down the steps with a bundle under his arm; I do not know who he was and have not seen him since - I was coming along and met the prisoner; I am certain of him - the first young man was about twenty yards from him, going down the same way; the prisoner also had a bundle under his arm - it seemed like a clock wrapped up in a cloak with lace; I could see by the shape that it was a clock, and he had the pendulum in his hand: it was about half-past three o'clock - he was a long way from Patten's; I went up stairs and told my father - I then went and told Patten, who asked my father to go with her for an officer; I knew the prisoner by seeing him standing by his mother's stall in Bishopsgate-street, and am quite certain of his person - I saw him in custody three days after, at the Mansion-house; I never saw the clock again.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PRATT. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday morning, the 3rd of December, at his mother's in Skinner-street, a very short way from Mrs. Patten's - I had been to her house and seen her lock broken; he said he was innocent.</p>

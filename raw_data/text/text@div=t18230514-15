I am not certain whether I left anybody there or not, or whether I locked the outer door. I returned about ten o'clock, and found a note on my table, which I now produce. Next morning, I missed from my book shelf Bacon's Abridgment, seven volumes, octavo, which were safe the preceeding day, and a tortoise-shell snuff box, with a painted lid, which was on the table in the course of Saturday. I found the books on the Saturday following, at Cooper's shop, in Fisher's-alley. They have marginal notes, in my own hand writing - I found the snuff box in pawn afterwards.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Addison. I was gone to dinner when he left the chambers. After I returned, the prisoner came to the chambers, a little past eight o'clock, and asked how long Mr. Addison had been out - I said I had not seen him since four o'clock. He said he would write a note to him, and went into Mr. Addison's room; I followed him in - he asked if Mr. Addison had Bacon's Abridgment; I said Yes; he told me to get them down for him - I did so, and asked if he wanted them for Mr. Whiting, whose name he had mentioned. He said. Yes, and took them away. I had not noticed the snuff box. I saw Mr. Addison on Monday; he said Bacon's Abridgment was gone - I said a man had been for them. (Looks at the note,) this is the note he left. On the Thursday following, I went with Limbrick, to the prisoner's house, in Clarence-street, Rotherhithe - I saw him, and told him a gentleman was waiting for him at the bottom of the street; he said he would come to him immediately. I returned to Limbrick; we waited half an hour for him; he did not come; we went to the house, but could not find him - we went again on the Sunday following, and took him. I have seen the books since, and know them to be my master's, (Note read.)</p>

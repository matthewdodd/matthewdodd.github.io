               <p>Did he always persist in denying it? - When Sir Sampson asked him if he had taken it, his answer was, it was a hard question to answer. (The half crown and shilling produced.) It has not been in my possession till I came into Court; it has been in father's possession ever since; he could not attend.</p>
               <p>But how do you fix that the money you are going to produce now is the same you took from the prisoner? - By the mark which corresponded with the marked money in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Jury. You doubted the mark on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190116"></xptr> shilling, was the mark that was on the half crown the same that was on the shilling? - The same mark undoubtedly; the shilling was taken first before I went to the shop, the half crown was taken the time I was in the house; and the half crown I could particularly swear to, because I particularly examined it after I found the shilling had been taken.</p>
               <p>What sort of marks were those that your father put on the money? - With the rim of the shilling and the half crown they formed a triangle.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. The lines meeting upon it formed a triangle with the rim of the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the same mark put on the shilling and on the half crown? - I think on one parcel the mark was rather larger than on the other.</p>
               <p>But I speak on the parcel which was found on the boy, the shilling is the same? - Exactly the same, except it had been made by a rule.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect no specific difference between the mark on the shilling and the half crown? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Had the shilling and the half crown of that parcel which he took the same mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you examined this mark then to see whether they have the same mark? - I have, and they agree as perfectly as possible.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any specific difference (I do not mean by line or compass) between the shilling and the half crown? - I do not.</p>

               <p>The half crown, that has the impression plain upon it, was that which was found upon the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe on the other parcel the difference of the marks? - (Shewn to the Jury.) - I can speak with greater certainty to the half crown than I can to the shilling, although in my own mind I believe as to he shilling, the impression on the half crown is stronger, and I particularly examined the mark to see whether it was plain, whether if it was to be taken away I could distinguish it again.</p>

               <p>The money the prosecutor lays to my charge is the money I received from Mrs. Morrice.</p>

               <p>The prisoner talled three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Evans. Is this place kept locked? - It was generally, but I cannot swear it was then.</p>

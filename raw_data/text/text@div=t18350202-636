                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Mitre Tavern, at Greenwich. On the 21st of October, I put a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, three shillings, and four sixpences, in a purse, in my coat pocket, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—I hung my coat behind the door' in the pantry, and left it there all night—on the following morning, I went to look, and the money was gone—I told my master—he desired toe to keep it quiet, and he had no doubt we should find it—the prisoner was porter at the tavern, and in the evening we heard he was going to Charlton fair—my master said he would grant him leave to go—I-went after him, brought him back, and told him what had happened, and that I thought he had taken it—he denied it, and was a little saucy—I searched him, and took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him—my master <hi rend="italic">started</hi> him, and in about two hours he came back, and gave me in charge to a policeman for robbing him of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he said was his money, and he would summons me next morning for it.</p>

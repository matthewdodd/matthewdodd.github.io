                  </hi>. I am servant to Peter Crocker, of Beal's-place, Nor<lb></lb>thams-buildings, Somers-town, shoemaker. On Sunday, the 18th of Feb., master and mistress went out to chapel about six o'clock, leaving me in charge of the children, and nobody else in the house—about half-past seven, I went out with the children, and shut the door after me and tried it—I returned in ten minutes, and found it still shut—I went to the window-shutters, found</p>

               <p>them partly open, and the window up—I had left it shut down—I called through the window, "Is that you, Mr. Crocker?" using my master's name—a voice answered "Yes"—I saw the street door open, three men come out and run away—the prisoner was the last who came out—I am certain of him—I called out "Stop thief," and he was brought back by a policeman, who said, "Go up stairs, and see if anything is lost"—I went up, but did not miss anything myself—my mistress's boxes were broken open, which I knew were locked when she went out—several articles were turned out on the floor—I fetched my mistress from chapel—I saw a salt-cellar and a pair of snuffers on the stairs, which had been in their proper place before I went out—there were several other articles on the sideboard in the first-floor front room which had been removed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 182.) I was on duty on the 18th of Feb., and at the end of Northern-buildings, I heard an alarm of "Stop thief"—I looked into the buildings, and saw the prisoner running, and crying "Stop him"—I took hold of him, and said, "I shall stop you"—I had seen nobody else running—he said, he did not want to go back, that was his way home—I said he should go back till I saw the cause of the alarm—I went to this house—I saw Hemming, and asked her if he was one of the men who had been there—she said, he was—I took him up stairs to search, and felt him take some<lb></lb>thing out of his pocket on the stairs—I called for a light, and the salt-cellar and snuffers dropped out of his hand on the stairs—he denied having put them there, and gave his address, at Shoreditch, but no street—I saw two pictures taken up at the foot of the stairs—I did not see him take the salt-cellars out of his pocket, but felt him do it, as I held his hand and I heard them drop—he leaned against the wall—I am quite certain he took them from his pocket.</p>

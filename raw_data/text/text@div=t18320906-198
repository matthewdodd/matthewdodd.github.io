About six o'clock that evening I went out, leaving a gold watch and appendages on my dressing-room table in my bed room - the watch cost 20l.; I returned about one o'clock in the morning, and about eleven in the morning I missed them - I gave notice to my servant, who had attended when I dressed, and about the 6th of July I found my property at Worship-street office.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cassell, a pawnbroker, Old-street. On the 26th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, and pawned a gold watch, a gold chain, and six shirt studs, in the name of John Stennet - I have seen him frequently before, and am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say it was not for myself? A. I asked him what name - he said, "The name I in general pawn in,

                  </hi> I was cook and housekeeper to Dr. Dowler, and the prisoner lived there in attendance on an insane gentleman—I afterwards met him, in Oct. last—I saw him frequently after that, and an arrange-ment was made that we should be married on the 30th of Nov.—on the 20th of Nov., I sold out 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock, which I received in gold and notes—in the morning of the 26th of Nov. the prisoner called on me—we were going that day to pay that money to take a coffee-shop—I had got my cloak and bonnet on, and was going to the door when he said to me, "You had better hand over that money to me, as I have had the paying of the other money, and I will pay it"—(he had paid in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before)—I con<lb></lb>sidered a few minutes, and I said, "Well, Mr. Gillies, as you had the paying of the other, I suppose you will have the paying of this;" and with that I drew the money from my pocket, and handed it to him, 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we walked together to the coffee-shop on Ludgate-hill—we did not stop anywhere—when we got there we looked over two or three things, and we were then called into a room amongst a number of gentlemen to settle it—one of the gentlemen said, the money was then to be paid—the prisoner then jumped up and said, "I have lost my book"—I said, "That is impossible"—he said, "Then I have dropped it from my pocket in your room; give me your key to go back and look for it"—I gave it him—he went out, and returned in half an hour, or an hour, and said it was not there—I said it was impossible it could be lost—he said I was to go and get the numbers, and stop the notes at the Bank—he continued to visit me up to the 29th—he all the while proposed marriage to me, and wished me to ask the price of my lodging, and said it was too dear—I saw him on the evening of the 29th—he did not say anything particular to me then—I did not see him any more till he was in custody.</p>

I ob<lb></lb>tained the bank-notes—we were together every day after that, till the day the coffee-shop was to be taken—I had not handed him over this money before that day to take care of—when I received it I asked if he would count it—I saw it counted—he then kept it in his waistcoat pocket till we went into some inn, and went into the parlour—I did not like to have it in the street—it was afterwards counted over in my room, at my table—no one was present but the prisoner and I—I think the purchase of the coffee-shop was to be 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, but the landlord took off 20—I gave 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner was to make up the remainder—it was understood that he was to take the house and me likewise—he had some money on him when he was taken—when I received the money, he had it in his pocket, all the way from the Bank to Bayswater, because he said he could not trust me with it home; but he gave it me when we got home.</p>

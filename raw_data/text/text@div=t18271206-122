            . I am an officer. On the 29th of November, I was in Whitechapel, and saw the stage coming from Church-lane; the prisoner ran behind, got up, and hung by his hands for about a hundred yards; he took a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and then got down - I ran up and took him with it, took him to the watch-house, and sent Fryer to tell the gentleman; there were some other boys at the corner of Church-lane, but not in company with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not offer a boy 5s. to say I was in it? A. I did not - I found 6s. 3d. on him; he said,"You may take that, and let me go" - I said, that was not the way I did my duty.</p>

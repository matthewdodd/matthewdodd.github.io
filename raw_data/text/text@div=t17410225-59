               <p>Mr. Malleson. On the 28th Day of last Month, the 2 Prisoners came into my Shop, and asked for Handkerchiefs; I shew'd them several and they bid Money for one or two, and presently I saw the Prisoner King draw a Piece of Handkerchiefs off the Counter with her right Hand. When she had done this, I rapp'd with the Yard on the Counter for one of my Servants to come down, and bid him go into the Back Shop to tie up some Irish Cloth, at the same Time giving him the Wink to observe the Motions of the Prisoners. I cut the Prisoner Arm a Handkerchief, she borrowed 1 s. of the other to pay for it, and they both went away together. I immediately got over the Counter, and saw there was nothing on the Ground; I then pursued the Prisoners and brought them back, and just as I brought them to the Threshold of the Door, the Prisoner (King) dropped the Goods.</p>
               <p>Pris King. I went with this young Woman (Arm) to buy a Handkerchief, and she not having Money enough to pay for it, I lent her some. There was another Woman in the Shop at the same Time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Malleson. There was another Woman in the Shop, but this very Piece I saw the Prisoner off the Counter, and the same Piece I saw her drop at the Door.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutors. The iron is their property. I have known Dove some time, Pike is his brother-in-law. I have seen Cooper on my masters' premises, and my masters told me always to order him out - he used to go about buying old iron. When we employ waterman they always have a delivery note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COOPER. Q. Have I not dealt with your master - A. Six months back my masters bought some nails of him, as they could get none elsewhere.</p>
               <p>PIKE's Defence, (written.) I acknowledge myself guilty of the crime, and have nothing to say in my behalf, when I have plunged three innocent individuals into an abyss of misery. I employed Dove to take the iron to Cooper for sale.</p>
               <p>DOVE's Defence. Pike hired me to fetch the iron away. I did not suppose it to have been stolen.</p>
               <p>COOPER's Defence. I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. I and my husband dealt in marine-stores. Dove came and said he had a quantity of iron for sale; I agreed to buy it, not suspecting it to have been stolen, and in the evening told my husband I had left it at Kean's till he called to see it.</p>

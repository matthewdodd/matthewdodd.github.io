            . I live at Lower Shadwell with my brother, who is a chain dealer. I was with Mr. Yallowley, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it into his own; I pointed the prisoner out to Mr. Yallowley, who seized him, and the handkerchief dropped at his feet - he denied taking it; another handkerchief, quite a different colour, was found on him - I am sure I saw him take it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Here is the handkerchief I had, it was not torn at all; I was coming through the fair - there was an immense crowd opposite a show - the mob forced me against the gentleman's pocket; he charged me with the robbery - I said I had not seen it; he felt in his pocket, then turned round, saw it laying down, and charged me with it.</p>
               <p>MR. GEDDES. I am sure of his person - he never moved after taking it; nobody but him could possibly take it.</p>

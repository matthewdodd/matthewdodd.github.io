            . I am a watchman in Great-Ormond street. On the 10th of May, my partner, named Jenkins, and I, found the prisoner and these goods on his shoulder. We first saw him within about twenty yards of the Foundling Hospital gate; he had them in a hand-basket: he told us he brought them from Oxford-Road, and was going with them to Cold-Bath-fields. When before Justice Girdler, he said he found them in the fields, coming from Tatenham-court road. Mr. Girdler desired I would keep the bundle, and I have had it in custody ever since; there were a kettle and a pair of bellows, two shifts, two shirts, two towels, two aprons, a neckcloth, a tin cannister, and a tin drinking pot. ( Produced and deposed to by prosecutrix ).</p>

               <p>Q. to Ferguson. Are all these things your property?</p>
               <p>Ferguson. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a tea kettle, bellows, and a black jack; Are they your property?</p>
               <p>Ferguson. They are my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Which are really and truely your own?</p>
               <p>Ferguson. A shift and three aprons are my own.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the whim of saying they were all your property?</p>
               <p>Ferguson. There were disputes when before the Justice: I said there were so and so of mine. My master would not appear.</p>
               <p>Court. Therefore you was to come and swear for your master?</p>
               <p>Ferguson. They were all in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court. Did that make them yours?</p>
               <p>Ferguson. They were in my care.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of a conscience have you to swear at that rate? Because your master would not come, you were determined to swear for him.</p>
               <p>Ferguson. He would not appear; and I told him if he would not I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not have said they were your master's, as well as that they were your own?</p>
               <p>Ferguson. They were my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Indeed they were not.</p>
               <p>Ferguson. They were in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these other things, the shift and aprons, are your own?</p>
               <p>Ferguson. Yes, they are.</p>

I told him to come with me-when we got to St. Martin's-lane, he said he must have some drink, and that he would pay me when he received his prize-money; he ran away, but was stopped.</p>

            . I live in Blue-court, Tottenhamcourt-road. Coleman left my lodging on the 18th of August, leaving the things in my charge-the prisoner slept in the same room with him. On the 20th of August I missed his property. The prisoner said he had pledged the things.</p>
               <p>ANN WELCH. I saw Coleman's things safe on the 19th of August; the door of the room was locked every morning, and the key hung up; I went out and when I returned I missed the key.</p>
               <p>ELIZA HUSSEY. I was left in care of the house. On the 20th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in and asked me to make his tea for him; he took the key off the nail and went up to the room; when he came down I told him there was a man waiting for him in the court; he went out, returned, and went up stairs again, he then came down and went out with a bundle, without his breakfast, took the key with him, and never returned.</p>

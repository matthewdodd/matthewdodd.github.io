On Saturday, the 4th of April, this painting had been standing on a double chest of drawers in the shop; I had been out, and was returning home, when I met the prisoner with the painting, which I knew had been sent to be sold at our auction-room- not knowing whether it had been sent for, I passed him, and inquired if it was all right; they seemed to know nothing about it, and I pursued him; he dropped it, and I took it up - he got away at that time, but in about ten minutes I met Tyrrell, the officer, with him in custody; this is the painting.</p>

            . I am an officer. I had seen the prisoner in company with another lad, opposite the prosecutor's door; the other went and spoke to the prisoner - then the prisoner went into the shop, and in a minute or two came out with this picture; I pursued him a little way, and saw him turn - I took another turning, expecting to meet him; I met him coming towards me, and took him into custody; I knew the other person very well, but I did not know the prisoner.</p>

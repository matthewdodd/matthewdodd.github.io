On Monday, the 27th of January, I received 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, on the ship's account, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I put the money into a bag which had a division in the middle of it—I put some of the money in one side and some in the other—I put the bag in my left-hand trowser's pocket—I went down to Blackwall—I was going to my ship—I went into the Two Mariners public-house, and saw M'Carthy standing facing me—she came towards me, and said, would I give her something to drink—I said, no—she said, "Will you go across the way with me?'—I went with her to a room on the ground-floor of a house opposite—as I went in I observed the tall figure of a man, but I did not take any further notice of it—I had some silver in my right-hand pocket, and I took a shilling out, and gave it to M'Carthy when I went into the room with her—I put my coat off, and laid it down on a chair—I took nothing off but my coat—I was on the bed with M'Carthy—I cannot say for how long—I had not taken my money out of my pocket—I am sure it was in my pocket when I was on the bed with M'Carthy—after I had been on the bed some time, I found every thing was not correct, as I found M'Carthy was making motions, and putting her hand down as if in the act of robbing me—I then got up—she got up also, and as she got on the floor, my key, which had been in my right-hand pocket with ray silver, fell from her person on the floor, but I did not see any silver fall from her—upon that, I put my hand to feel if my bag was safe, and it was gone out of my left-hand pocket—the key and the silver were gone from my right-hand pocket, and the pocket was turned inside out—when the key fell, she stooped and picked it up—I seized hold of her hand, and took the key from her, and one shilling, which was in her hand—she directly sprang out of the room—I then searched for my bag, and found it on the lower part of the bed, on the counterpane—I found that the quantity of money was not the same as it had been—the bag was quite light—I put on my coat, and sprang out of the room as</p>

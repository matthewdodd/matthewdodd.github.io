                  </hi>. I am cook in Mr. Benjamin Worthy Horne's fa<lb></lb>mily, in Bedford-place, which I believe is in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. On Wednesday, the 2nd of March, I was in the kitchen—I heard a noise in the pantry—I went towards the pantry, and saw the prisoner coming out—I never saw him before—it was at ten mi<lb></lb>nutes after two o'clock in the afternoon—he had some silver with him—I said, "You rascal, you have got the plate, put it down, "—he made no an<lb></lb>swer, but made his way towards the area-door—I and my fellow-servant both seized him and pulled him back and he then put down the silver tea<lb></lb>pot and coffee-pot—when he put them down, I went out into the area and locked the door on him, leaving him inside, with shut with my fellow-servant, Ca<lb></lb>therine Brennan—I found the area-gate shut and locked—he must have got ever it or opened it with a skeleton key—we never have it open—I saw him come out of the street-door afterwards, and he ran towards Bloomsbury-square—he was brought back with in a few minutes—I said, "This is the man," and he said, "Yes, I am the man"—I am quite cer<lb></lb>tain of him—he then took out of his pocket four spoons and a milk-pot.</p>

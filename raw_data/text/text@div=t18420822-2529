                  </hi>. I am assistant to William Turner Hayward—he is a lace dealer, and lives at No. 81, Oxford-street—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to my master's shop for lace, for the last nine or twelve months—it was customary to put the box of lace before her when she came—she came on the 13th of July—in consequence of suspicion I had counted twenty-two pieces of lace, and put them in the box—she took her seat at the counter—there were only these twenty-two pieces in the box, which was put before her, but there were three pieces of lace of a different description, about a yard from this—while she was looking at the lace I went into the warehouse, and brought back another piece of lace to her—she had then decided on one of the pieces in the box, and said, she intended to take a part of that which she had in her hand—I examined the pieces of lace in the box as well as I could, and found there were only nineteen—I called to Biddle who was in the shop—I afterwards saw four pieces of lace on the floor, close by where the prisoner had been sit<lb></lb>ting—I am perfectly able to say that they were in the box—they are worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cost price.</p>

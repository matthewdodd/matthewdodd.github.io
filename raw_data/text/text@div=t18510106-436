                  </hi>. I live at 11, Freeman's-lane, in the parish of St. John, Southwark; it is my dwelling-house. I gave the prisoner an asylum in my house for a short time, and he left about the middle of Sept.—he had then been with me four weeks and four or five days—he was in a state of destitution, but was going to sea, and was waiting for his ship—he has lived with me on and off twenty-two or twenty-three years—a few days prior to 26th Sept., I had warned him to leave, and on that day I missed two watches out of my drawers, which were locked, and on the following day a mourning ring and a gold ring—I went out to work in the morning, leaving the drawer safe, and when I came back I missed the things—I afterwards saw my son with this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the prisoner's writing; I know it, I have seen him write many times—it is directed to my son, who is here—my son had at the same time the duplicates of two watches, which I have since seen, one in the prisoner's hands and the other in the pawnbroker's—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—</p>

On the 4th of July he came and told me his master was gone out of town, that he had had a child sworn to him, and asked leave to remain in my stables for a few nights; and on the 10th, when I came home, he said the Colonel was returned, and he was going back to him. I went next morning to the loft where he slept, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. I went to the Colonel's, and found he had left the service. I was going over Blackfriars-bridge next day, and saw him running before me - I pursued, and the officer took him, and found my watch in his pocket. It hung over the fire-place on the 9th, when I went to bed.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th July the prisoner ran by me. I saw Huckey pursuing him; he ran down Pedlar's-acre, into a coal-wharf, and finding it no thoroughfare, returned, and I took him. He pulled a watch out of his fob, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is your watch."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We were drinking together all the week; I pawned my jacket and waistcoat to get drink; he said his master was in prison, and he could get no money, and asked me to pawn his watch. They would not give what I asked for it. I spent the money, and was afraid to return.</p>
               <p>DANIEL HUCKBY. I never gave him any thing to pawn.</p>

            . I keep a sale-shop on Saffron-hill. On Wednesday, the 23rd of December, the prisoner sold this seal skin cap to my wife for 1s. - I was at the door, and gave the 1s. out of my pocket; I then went down to my other shop - my wife came there, and brought this powder-flask; I went back to my other shop with the Police-man, and the prisoner was gone - I looked, but could not find him: at last I found him in a privy - he had left the powder-flask with my wife; the Police-man said,"You are the man I want; you have stolen these things"- he said, "Don't handcuff me, and I will go quietly."</p>

             BARKER. I have a blanket and a quilt, pawned by the prisoner on the 23rd of December.</p>
               <p>MAURICE NICHOLAS. I am a Police-man. I took the prisoner - I have three caps, which I found in the shop, and this hat was on the prisoner's head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About ten days previous to last September a circumstance took place in which they attempted to implicate me in taking eleven sovereigns and a watch -I found the person who had been guilty of it; I advised him to return, but he would not - I then promised that I would take it all upon myself; I wrote a letter to my mother-in-law, stating that I had eight sovereigns and a half, and if they would send to me I would deliver them up - a Bow-street officer accompanied them, and took me; I was in confinement, and when I went into society again I could get no situation - I had one hundred and four guineas a year in my former situation; I had discharged some men for drunkenness, and they took this opportunity of injuring me - I am guilty of this crime, but previous I had been like Caesar's wife, beyond suspicion; I told the officer that I sought for transportation, as I was miserable - happiness is the pursuit of every man, and I must seek it through the means of transportation.</p>

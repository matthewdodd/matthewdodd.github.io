We went to No. 8, very early in the morning, and st about six o'clock in the evening, we heard a noise as if a press were at work, at the back part of the house; that is at No. 8, Sewell street. The door of the adjoining house was open, and I and Thomas Foy went through No, 7, into its<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060027"></xptr>garden. The garden of No. 7, is separated from that of No. 8, by a small low fence. I left Plank and

             in the street, and desired them when I got through, to knock at the door, and get admittance that way. When we were in No. 7, we heard the same noise. I got over the fence, and into the prisoner's garden. The whole back of the prisoner's shop, at the back part of the house, is a window, and looks into this garden. I saw all the prisoners, at that part of the shop where the press is. The candles were lighted, but I could not immediately see how they were employed; but they were all at the press. I went into the shop by a door which goes from the garden. My brother went in with me. At that time there had been a knocking at the front door, but I did not hear it. When I went in at the shop door, William Bagnell the elder went into the kitchen; he attempted to pass one of the front kitchen door, but finding it secure, and finding some one there, he return'd into the shop where I was. We took the three prisoners into custody, and as soon as my brother took hold of William he threw down a quantity of dollars; I saw him throw them down; there were six in number; they were perfect dollars; I marked them, and gave them to Mr. Westwood. In taking the father into custody, I was about to search him; he had his hand clinched, I opened it, and found four dollars on him in that hand (dollars put into the hands of the witness. Those are the four dollars I found in the hand of the father. Those are the six thrown away by William Bagnell the younger. Then I searched the shop, and found a stamping press; the lower dye of which bearing a matrix of the King's head, was fixt; I parted it, at the same time I found that the collar was on.(Articles put into the hands of the witness.) This is the upper, and this is the lower dye; the collar fits them. The use of the collar is to prevent the mettle spreading in stamping. From the appearance of the press altogether, it is my opinion that it had been working previously, and from the upper dye being warm, I think it had been just struck. On the press I found a spanish dollar, with the original impression upon the sides and edges, obliterated apparently by a file or some such instrument; that would inable the impression to be made with more facility. There was an iron tray, in which were thirty two Spanish dollars similarly prepared From the appearance with which it was working, when we heard it, there must be three persons at work at it. The principal upon which it is worked is this. - An immense weight is raised by two persons, and then let go, after the manner of a pile-driver, upon the dyes, and thereby occasions the impression to be made on the piece of metal between them. This weight is raised by a rope going over a wheel, and a third person feeds the dyes, that is, puts in the blank metal, and takes out that which has the impression. Plank and my other brother had come in at the front at the same time. The father said I hope you will observe, we are only stamping Spanish dollars, and hoped his case would be represented as favourable as possible; and said, that if his giving up the persons who employed him would be of any service, he would do that willingly. We apprehended all three and brought them away, with the press and all the other things,</p>

            , I am engraver to the Bank. I look at the dollars, and the dyes, and these dollars are made from the dyes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley, on the part of the prisoners, objected that the offence with which the prisoners were charged, was not the one contemplated by the statute; because that was to prevent persons for counfeiting five shilling dollars-when in fact, this was counterfeiting five and sixpenny dollars; and therefore this offence did not come within the letter of the statute. A similar punishment was alloted to persons convicted of coining three shilling, and eighteen penny bank tokens. Suppose the bank chose to issue the one for three shillings and six-pence; the other for one shilling and ninepence; after such nominal value, could the counterfeiter be punishable under the act as it now stood? unquestionably, in the learned counsels opinion-not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry, on the same side stated, that in the preamble of this statute, the bank appeared to think it necessary to recite their authority for assigning three shilling and eighteen penny tokens, by doing so; and he objected that it had not shewn its authority for issuing five and six penny dollars; and the case of the prosecution being closed, they were now excluded from doing.</p>
               <p>COURT. We will first dispose of the objection taken by the latter gentleman.</p>
               <p>It is not material upon the present occasion, for the bank to shew their authority for affixis ng a nominal value of five shillings and sixpence to the dollar; and it is merely an engagement on its part with the public, to give that sum for the dollar. In respect of the first objection taken, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060028"></xptr>the indictment charges the prisoners with making and coining, and acting and assisting in such making and coining pieces of coin, resembling certain silver dollars coined, &amp;c. by the governor and company of he bank of England, containing certain impressions; which the indictment recites, and in the indictment of which consists the offence aimed at by the statute, and therefore the value nominal, or real, has nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Bagnell the elder defence, now put in a written defeuce, most solemnly denying any intention to defraud the bank; but stating that he had been employed by a person named Goldston, to immitate a certain coin which that person gave him, which though in a degree it resembled, was not so like the bank dollar, or for any one to be deceived by it. This he immitated, and it was in its impression considerably different from the bank dollar; he further agreed that it was a well known fact, that he as a dye sinker, and every man in his profession, with equal case, had he been fraudently inclined, could copy most correctly the impression upon genuine dollars; and he concluded by endeavouring to exculpate his sons from any blame in the matter.</p>
               <p>A number of witnesses were then called to character.</p>
               <p>THE COURT then summed up the evidence for the jury, and informed them, that it was immaterial for this charge, what the mettal or composition was of, which the counterfeit coins were made.</p>

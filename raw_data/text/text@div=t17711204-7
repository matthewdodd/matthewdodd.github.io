The prisoner laid in the same room; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, on the 11th of November. I had them at night when I went to bed, and missed them and the prisoner in the morning.

            . The prosecutor told me he was robbed, and suspected the prisoner. I met the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040007"></xptr> prisoner afterwards in the street; I saw Aldin's waistcoat under his arm; I charged him with having robbed the prisoner; he desired I would make no noise about it, and let him go. I took him before justice Kynaston; there he was searched, and the prosecutor's shirt and gold-ring were found upon him. The prisoner desired I would go to a man that was in company with him when I took him, and desire him to come and assist him. I went after that man; as soon as he saw me he run away. The prisoner said at the justices that that man was not concerned in the business.</p>

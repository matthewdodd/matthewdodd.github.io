I was in London on the 26th of November, and was taken to a house near the Tower, by a relation of mine on the 27th, and there I saw the prisoner; it was late in the evening - I slept there all night with her - I am certain of her - I lost three sovereigns and a seven-shilling piece. I know they were safe at twelve o'clock, and the next morning, about day-light, she awoke me, by opening the door to go out. I instantly looked for my clothes, which were under the pillow, and missed them from my watch pocket - I got up and wrote a note to the landlady, requesting her to detain the prisoner if she returned, and that I would call at seven o'clock at night, which I did, and found her in custody of an officer. She said she had spent 1 l. 12 s., in Field-lane, and had 35 s. of my property left, which she threw on the table in the bag, it was in when I pinned it in my fob.</p>

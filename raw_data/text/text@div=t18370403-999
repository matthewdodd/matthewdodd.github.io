                  </hi>. I live in Judd-street, St. Pancras. On the 4th of March, a little before ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner Smith was brought into my shop by a policeman and another person, with a roll of flannel, which is the property of myself and my partner—I had seen it safe ten minutes before.</p>

I was on duty in Oxford<lb></lb>rtrwt, and saw the two prisoners in company with another between half-past nine and ten o'clock—I am quite sure the two prisoners were together—I was in plain clothes—I followed them through a number of streets to Judd-street, where I saw the two prisoners go to Mr. Blakeman's shop door, and look in—Higgins then went and stood by the window looking in, Smith passed by the door and looked in—he then passed the door and stood a few seconds—he then went and stood by the window alongside of Higgins, and appeared in conversation—he then went by the door again, and I saw Higgins make a sign with his hand—Smith then went up on the step of the door and took this roll of flannel off a box—he walked away with it—I pursued, in company with Mr. Heath—I took him, and Higgins ran away—I apprehended Higgins yesterday week at his lodgings in Grafton-street Soho—I know him perfectly well.</p>

I am a dairywoman, and live at Hackney—I am mistress of the house I sleep in—the prisoner was in my service five months—he sleeps in the house—I have a maid-servant, who sleeps with me—about eleven o'clock, on the night of 18th July, I fastened up the front door—the prisoner fastened up the back-door, and as far as I know he went to bed—I afterwards tried it, it was fast—before that I counted some money in a cupboard in my back room—there was 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in sovereigns, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, two 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. -coins, and some halfpence—the gold was in a blue purse in my work-box—I then put my work-box in the cupboard, locked the cupboard, and took the key in my bedroom with me—there were no persons in the house but me, and the maid, and the prisoner—at a little before five in the morning I heard the prisoner go down—he afterwards came to my bedroom door and said the back door was open—I said, "It cannot be so, did not you fasten it last night?"—he said yes, he would take his oath he did—I said, "And I tried it after you"—I then heard him go back to his room—I and my maid got up—my maid went down at half-past five, and I went down about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I then called the prisoner, who was in his bedroom—I then went to my cupboard to give change, and found the money was gone, with the exception of a half-sovereign, a sixpence, and some halfpence—I sent for a policeman, and for the inspector, who examined the premises—while the inspector was there the prisoner came back—he had gone to a house that he went to every morning—the inspector called him to the back door and asked him some questions—the prisoner said he was quite positive, he had fastened the door the night before—the inspector told him there was no mark of violence; the robbery had been committed by some person in-doors—the prisoner said did he think he would rob his mistress—I gave the prisoner in charge—I went with the officer, and found some money under a flag-stone in a closet in the kitchen, which the prisoner had for his accommodation—a sovereign and some silver was found on the prisoner—his wages were 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I paid him every Saturday—I bad paid him the Saturday before—amongst the money that was found there were two 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. coins—I know I had such—the prisoner knew where I kept my money.</p>

I have seen Stevenson since and brought him to Mr. Clarke's house; he said he lived at No. 15, Grafton-street, Soho; so he did; I asked her how she came to tell me they belonged to Mrs. Thompson; she said, because she was a poor woman, and she thought I might not take them of her; so through the recommendation of the man I bought them of her, and gave her 30 s. for them; in the course of the afternoon I went out and I went down to Westminster, to the house where she lived, and the man gave her a very bad character; through that I went in search of her and took her up, and I said to her, how could you bring me stolen goods;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200012"></xptr>she said, she found them in New Bond-street; I asked her for the money that I had lent her on them; she said, she had but 9 s. 6 d. left, and wanted me to take the 9 s. 6 d. and let her pawn them for the rest of the money.

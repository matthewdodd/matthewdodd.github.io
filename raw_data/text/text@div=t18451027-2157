                  </hi>. I am a tide-waiter in the Cus<lb></lb>toms, and live in Adam-street, Rotherhithe. On Thursday, the 24th of Sept., a few minutes past eleven o'clock at night, I was at the door of No. 62, King-street, Borough, in the act of ringing my daughter's bell, when the prisoner came up to me, caught me by the coat, and gave me a violent push, in consequence of which I fell—I had 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—there were two new half-crowns, three shillings, and one sixpence—she put her hand into my pocket—she ran away—as soon as I recovered I fol<lb></lb>lowed her—she was never out of my sight—the policeman stopped her about three or four doors from my daughter's—I missed the two half-crowns and the three shillings and sixpence from my pocket—I told the policeman to hold her, for she had robbed me—I am positive my money had been safe in my pocket about four or five minutes before—I saw some half-crowns before Mr. Traill next day—I could not swear to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a searcher of females at the station in Black man-street, Borough. I had to search the prisoner in the cell one night last month—I do not remember what night it was—I think it was the 5th of Sept.—I think it was in the early part of the month—she took something from her bosom—I asked what it was—she said, "It is the money you are looking for,"(giving me two half-crowns,)" put it into your pocket, and say nothing about it, and I will never tell"—she repeated that several times, and said she was quite sure, if I told of it, it would transport her—I produce the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I solemnly swear I never said such a thing; I said it was what the gentleman gave me, and it was a hard thing to be locked up for nothing; she knows it is false, neither did she mention it to the inspector, or say a word of what she states now till she went before the Magistrate in the morning; the gentleman gave me the money, and he wanted it back again, after he had taken indecent liberties with me; I was with him from eleven o'clock; I met him against St. Thomas's-street, as the clock facing the hospital was striking eleven.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I was on duty at the time the prisoner was searched—it was on the night of the 25th of Sept.—I saw the prosecutor in High-street, Borough—he was alone—I saw him turn down King-street—no one was with him then—the prisoner, in company with another fe<lb></lb>male, was following close behind him—she left the other female, crossed over to the side he was walking on, and went up King-street—I saw the prosecutor standing at the door, as though waiting to be admitted—I did not see him ring the bell, I was not near enough—I saw the prisoner walk up close behind him—I saw him fall, and saw her in a stooping position over him—I was about 100 yards off—I saw her leave the prosecutor—he got up and called, "Stop her, she has robbed me"—I stopped her, took her to the station, and she was searched that night—the prosecutor went with me to the station—he said, in the prisoner's presence, that she had robbed him of two half-crowns—she said he was mistaken, it must be another person! she came up the other way—this was before she was searched,</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner came to me on the 17th of August, to know if I had a horse for sale—I am a baker, but I have been out of em<lb></lb>ploy for some time, and was obliged to commence general dealer in fruit, and such things—the prisoner came for the purpose of buying a pony I had to sell—he wished to see it tried in harness—I put it in harness, and put my cart to it, and drove him to Woburn-mews, as he directed me—he said he had a new set of harness there, and if it fitted the pony he would have it—I took the pony into a stable there—the harness did fit—he then said he would buy the pony, but he wanted a friend to see it, if I would permit him to have it till ten o'clock next morning—as we were coming out of the stable he said, "You have a nice light cart, lighter than mine," (pointing to a cart which stood there,) "and as you cannot make use of one without the other, perhaps you will allow me the use of that as well as the pony till to-morrow morning, and come and take your money for the pony, and then you can take it away"—I did not object to that—he took me to a public-house, and called for a pen and ink—he had a piece of paper, and he wrote on it, "You hereby agree to sell a bay pony for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I looked</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had no intention of any felony; I agreed to pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the cart, and have a witness to prove it.

I said, "Bring down the cart and pony, and I will try and buy them of you." He did so, and showed me that one side of the cart was broken in, and said he would tell me of a man who would mend it for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I sent the cart to my wheelwright's the next day, and as the side was decayed, he put two new plates in, and said, "The best job would be to try to sell it."

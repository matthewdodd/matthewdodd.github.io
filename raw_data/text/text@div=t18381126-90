On Sunday morning, the 30th of September, between two and three o'clock, I was in Taylor's com<lb></lb>pany after he had quitted Brown; he had a pair of pattens in his hand—he was in liquor—I had only had a quartern of gin between four of us, and one glass of rum to myself—after having that, I and Taylor went back to Bluegate-fields—we came by Collins's door, and she spoke first to Taylor—she appeared to be very much in liquor—she said she was glad to see him along with me, and not with the witness Brown—I told her to mind her own business, and not trouble herself with us, and Taylor called her a b——w—the prisoner Robertson was standing at the door with Collins at the time—Collins went in-doors into her own room on the ground-floor, and came back again instantly to the door—I left Taylor, and went to the door, and pushed both the prisoners inside, and shut them into Collins's house—the door was opened again directly, and both the prisoners came out, and Collins said, the first b——that touched her, her man should <hi rend="italic">knife</hi> them—I told her not to be so fast with her knives-Robertson flew from the door, and struck Taylor a blow in the mouth with his fist directly—Taylor was about a couple of yards from the door at the time, and had the pattens in his hand—he staggered from the effects of the blow-Robert<lb></lb>son ran up to him, drew a knife from his sleeve, and stabbed him in the breast, as I held him by the jacket—I did not see Taylor use the pattens at all—he had no time to do so—he had them in his hand-Robertson did not appear very sober—I held Taylor against the wall while he was bleeding, and went to fetch a policeman-Robertson made away directly he had stabbed him-Lee the policeman came, and Taylor was taken to Dr. Bird, and then to the London Hospital—I had been drinking three or four glasses of gin and some beer in the morning before, but I went to bed after that—when I am in liquor my memory is bad-three or four glasses of liquor and beer will make me drunk—I cannot say how much beer I had drunk-five or six of us were drinking together—I had enough to send me to bed at three o'clock in the afternoon to get sober, and I kept in bed till half-past</p>

                  </hi>. I am the agent for the Sailors' Home, which is a refuge for sailors who come from sea. On the 1st of October I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Golconda</hi> vessel with the male prisoner—it is the ship he came home in—I afterwards went with him to King William-street to get his wages paid—I left him a little while, while I went into a public-house to see for the rest of the men; and when I came back I asked him if he had been paid—he said, "No; I must make haste and get out of this, for they will be after me"—I was not aware of any thing having happened, and asked what he meant by that—he said he had got into a row at the King William last night; and said, "The man struck me with a <hi rend="italic">batten</hi> on my head—I did not know what I was about—I took out my knife, and stabbed him,"' making a motion towards his right breast.</p>

                  </hi>, I am house-pupil at the London Hospital. On Sunday morning, the 30th of September, about five o'clock, Taylor was brought in—he had a wound in the upper part of the right side of his chest—the orifice was about an inch long-such a knife as this might do it—it was a punctured wound, full three inches deep, but I did not ascertain that at that time—he lived till the 29th of October, just a month—there was a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I have no doubt the wound was the cause of death-an artery of the lungs was cut into—atthe time his examination was taken I hardly think he knew he was dying—he knew it was unlikely he should recover.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a Magistrate of the Thames Police. I attended at the London Hospital, to take the examination of the deceased, on the 5th of October—I did not ask him his impression as to his recovery—I thought he might recover, and I think he thought so too—the prisoners were present at the examination—it was taken on oath</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183811260093"></xptr>
               <p>—I should state that both prisoners were not present at first, bat the man was; and, in consequence of something he stated, I adjourned the examin<lb></lb>ation for an hour till Collins was apprehended—the examination was then recommenced from the beginning—I took it all afresh-what had passed was read over to her—I took the examination with my own hand—she made some remark in the course of the deceased's statement, but I forget what it was—this is the signature of the deceased, taken in my presence, and countersigned by myself—the prisoners had an opportunity of putting any questions—they had a solicitor present—I should state, when Robert<lb></lb>son was first brought before me, besides the wound on his forehead, he ap<lb></lb>peared to me to have a mark of a circular reddish rim on his forehead—it was not a precise wound—I thought it to be such an impression as might be produced by the rim of a patten—(<hi rend="italic">the examination was here read, as follows</hi>:) <hi rend="smallCaps">"EDMUND TAYLOR</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">sworn, saith</hi>:—I saw the prisoner Robertson once before now—it was on the morning of the day on which he struck me—I never saw him before then, nor did I know him—on Sunday morning last about four o'clock, I think it was, I was in Bluegate-fields—I passed near a b——y-house there, with a girl named M'Carthy—I do not remember that I was carrying pattens—I do not think the girl had any pattens with her—the prisoner Robertson was just in the b——y-house passage—when I was going by I heard the prisoner Collins who was standing at the b——y-house door, say, "Stick him with a knife"—I saw a knife pass between the two prisoners—it was a sailor's clasp'd knife, with a sharp point—the prisoner Robertson ran out of the door, and stabbed me, and the blood gushed out-if I struck him with a patten, I must have picked one up, but I do not recollect doing so—I had not one with me—I staggered back against a gateway, and two policemen came to me soon after and took me away to this hospital, where I have been ever since—I do not remember that I said any thing to the prisoner Robertson, nor he to me, before he stabbed me—I had not been at the King William that night, but I was not sober, but I know this is the man, by his hair and his countenance—I did not go into the b——y-house in Bluegate-fields—I was going home to No. 23, New-street—I am not a sailor, but I hare been to sea—I am a cooper by trade—I had known the prisoner Collins be<lb></lb>fore—I had no particular acquaintance with her—this is the girl Collins.</p>

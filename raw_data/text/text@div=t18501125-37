On Tuesday, 1st Oct., I gave my little boy, Edward Bennett, a bundle, in a blue and brown handkerchief—it contained two shifts, two pairs of drawers, a tablecloth, three towels, and a nightcap—he was to take them to Miss Mortimer's, in Newcastle-street, Strand—they were her things—I had had them to wash.</p>

On Tuesday, 1st Oct., my mother gave me a bundle to carry to 2, Newcastle-street, Strand—I went away with it, and my little brother Henry, who is seven years old—I gave the bundle to my brother—as I was going along I met the prisoner by Chancery-lane—I had a top with me, and was playing with it—the prisoner spoke to me first and he said, "Will you let me have a <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with your top?"—I did, and he gave it me back again, and he said to me, "Ask your brother if he would like a rabbit," and he asked me if my mother would let me keep it—I said, "I dare say she will"—he told my brother to stand by Little's, the butter-shop—my brother had the bundle at that time—he stood there, and I went up to Carey-street with the prisoner, to go to his house for the rabbit—when we were in Carey-street he said, "Stop here, I am going in a house to get the rabbit"—he came out and said, "I am going to my mother, and I can get you the rabbit better; stop here"—he left me and did not come back at all—I went to where I had left my brother—I did not find him there—I found him when he came home from school—I did not wait in Carey-street above five minutes—I have not seen the bundle since.</p>

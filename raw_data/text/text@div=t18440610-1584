The prisoner Cotton was our footman—Sharpe was six or seven months in our service, as housemaid—she quitted in September, last year—on the 4th of May we left the house, for the purpose of going into the country—Cotton went with the carriage to the terminus of the railway, about half-past five o'clock—he returned with the carriage to the house, as far as I know, and was to remain at home till our return on the Tuesday morning—he had been with us three years last March—down to the time of our leaving London, he had not given the slightest intimation of quitting our service—there had been no quarrelling or anger, or anything of that sort—I was in the habit of keep<lb></lb>ing small sums of money occasionally, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the my writing-desk, in the drawing-room—on the Tuesday before this Saturday I went to my desk for some money, for a soda-water bill, and gave it to Cotton—he saw me go there—I kept a memorandum-book in the same desk, and there was one sovereign wrapped in a piece of paper, with the word, "Baby" written on it—I returned with Mr. Driver on the Monday night—I saw a box in which he kept his duplicate keys—he brought it into my room, where I was sitting—I went to my writing-desk on the Tuesday—I found the lock apparently as I had left it, but on opening it I found all that had been in it misplaced—I missed the sovereign I have mentioned—the spirit bottles were kept in the sideboard cupboard in the drawing-room.</p>

On Saturday, the 4th of May, I left town with Mrs. Driver—I returned on Monday, about nine o'clock in the evening—I was sent for express—I got to my office about nine—when I went out of town these papers were left in a canvas bag, in a drawer in my library—on Mon<lb></lb>day night I went to that drawer before I went to bed, and missed that canvas bag, and all the money that was in it—there were five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

About twelve o'clock I lighted a fire in the pantry; I left the glass off the lamp; I did not happen to put it on again. When I went out in the evening I locked the pantry door, so that nobody should go in to take the plate; I cannot say whether I put out the light or not; I had had a little drop to drink; I went out about half-past one; and the reason I did not re<lb></lb>turn was, I missed two or three spoons, and was afraid to go back, as I knew I should have to replace them, and I could not afford that. I took these cloths to this young woman with my dirty things; I meant to have taken them back; the decanter I took with a pint and a-half of gin, as she was not very well; the lamp I took as she said she was very poorly of a night, with a pint of oil to burn, in case she should be taken ill; I meant to take it back as soon as she got better; I took some dripping in the butter-dish; the glass I bought for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the wine-glass I took with the decanter, because we had not one then; the robbery I know nothing about; I have had the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces some time, and I gave them to her; she knew nothing about it; I went to her place, and asked if she had a mind to go into the country with me for a little while; she said no twice, and then she said she would go; I lived with Mr. Driver's mother two years before I lived with him, and she can give me a very good character.</p>

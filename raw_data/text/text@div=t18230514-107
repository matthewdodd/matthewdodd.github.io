               <p>"Where? where?" and the prisoner stood behind. The three set off, and prisoner ran off with the handkerchief off the child's neck - I saw it in his hand, and ran after him as fast as I could. He ran up a yard which was not a thoroughfare - a gentleman caught him, and the handkerchief was produced; he was taken in about ten minutes; he had got out of my sight. I am sure of him, for I had seen him for three quarters of an hour.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker, and live in Northampton-square. I saw Davis crying - she said a boy in a brown coat had taken the child's handkerchief; she was looking towards Percival-street. I saw a boy running - she said he was one, but not the one who took it. I pursued, and saw the prisoner running, in a brown coat, and caught him down a court, which was no thoroughfare; he had got into a cart. I saw him throw the handkerchief out of the cart before I pulled him out. Davis saw him in about ten minutes, and said directly that he was the boy.</p>

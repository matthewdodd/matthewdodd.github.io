                  </hi> I was servant to Mr. Carlton, of Parson's-green, Fulham, in January last. I did not receive any letter that month containing half-a-sovereign and sixpence from my sister—I heard afterwards of such a letter having been sent; in consequence of which I went to Mr. Drake on the 5th of February—in consequence of what passed between him and me I went to the prisoner, and told him I had called respecting a letter which I understood I ought to have received on the 14th of January—he hesitated—I told him I could not account for it unless he had given it to somebody else to bring it to me—(the prisoner knew me—he had delivered letters to me for three or four years)—I said I could not account for it, as I had always received them punctually before—he said he had been ill and got his brother to deliver fur him—I told him then that I had traced the money to him, and should expect him to make it good to me in two or three days; and he said he would do so—I said I should not trouble my<lb></lb>self any further about it, and left him—on the 6th of February, he came to</p>

               <p>me at my master's house—(I had seen two gentlemen from the Post Office before that)—I said, "Oh postman, this is a sad job!"—he said it was all respecting my letter; he knew he had done wrong, and was very sorry for it—this was about four o'clock in the afternoon—I told him of the two gentlemen having been there; and he said he knew it—he came to me the same evening about eight o'clock, and said he did not know what he should Do, as nothing of the kind had ever occurred before—I said, "I can't sup<lb></lb>pose You intended to rob me;" for I considered him strictly honest—he said there were two officers then after him—he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—before he was taken he said he did not know what had become of the letter—this "Elisabeth Foreman" to this receipt is not my writing—I never signed a receipt of that kind.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant V</hi> 5.) On the 9th of February, I went in search of the prisoner to a house at Sandy-end, Fulham, kept by one Wheeler—I went in and found the prisoner up stairs in bed—it was about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon—he had all his clothes on, except his shoes and hat—I took him by the collar and said he was my prisoner—I told him it was on a charge of felony—he said, "I know all about it; it is concerning the letter of Miss Foreman's, of Parson's-green, I have made that all right, I have paid her the money, and all would be very well had I not forged the receipt, and my comrade given information againt me"—I took him to the station, and heard him say to the inspector that there was half-a-sovereign in the letter; and in a few seconds after he said, "She told me so"—I then searched him and found five letters on him, and two blank receipts—I returned one of the letters to him at Bow-street by the desire of the Magistrate, as the superintendent of the Post Office said it did not at all relate to the case—it was connected with his own business—it had been then opened—I believe this to be the letter I returned to him, (<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at one</hi>) but I cannot swear to it—I kept the other four letters in my possession till the Saturday following, when he was examined again, and I then gave them to the superintendent of the Post Office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the relieving officer of the Strand Union. On the 11th of February, I was coming down Bow-street and saw the police van just turning the corner into Russell-street, I saw a letter thrown from the blind behind the van—it dropped from the van—two boys ran and picked it up and gave it to me, and I immediately gave it to Tyr<lb></lb>rell the gaoler—this is the letter.</p>

On the 11th of February I took the prisoner from the House of Correction to Bow-street in a van—there were several other prisoners in the van—I received this letter from Mr. Kirby when I arrived at Bow-street—as the prisoner entered the passage of the office I had this letter in my hand, and he said, "That is my letter, I dropped it out behind the van, thinking somebody would pick it up and put it into the Post Office"—he said two or three times, "Don't show it to any of the officers"—I afterwards opened the letter in the clerk's office—there was a leaf of a Bible in it, and something written in pencil on a piece of paper inside the letter—it was directed to Mrs. Cumber.</p>

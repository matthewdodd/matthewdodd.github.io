            . I was eleven years of age last March. I am in Rider's employ. I was sent by him on the 27th of July, from Crispin-street, Spital-fields, to take three baskets to Bethlem Hospital; when I was near <placeName id="t18250915-355-crimeloc1933">London-bridge</placeName>

I went back in about five minutes and the baskets were gone - I looked about and saw the officer with two men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RICHARDSON. I saw the witness, and asked him to go for a pennyworth of biscuits, and he picked up the note and took it to the house. Witness. No; he gave me the note.</p>

            . On the 27th of July I saw the prisoners together in Cheapside; I saw Richardson go to a lad who had a bag on his head, and speak to him for some time; I then followed the prisoners toward London-bridge, and when they got near to Eastcheap, Adey sat down on the end of the curb - Richardson went up to the witness who put the baskets down; in a few minutes Adey took them up - he and Richardson went away together - Adey pitched them down in George-street, and I took them into custody. I came back the same way, and found the witness, who was crying - he had two halfpence and this note in his hand.</p>

                  </hi> I am a baker, at Royal-hill, Greenwich—Christain Ryle was my servant for about a year and eight or ten months. In consequence of a communication made to me, my attention was directed to him in the bakehouse—I called in an officer, about nine or ten o'clock is the evening, and searched about the flour-room—I found about twenty-five empty bags, which had had flour in them, concealed behind the four-sacks—next day I searched for them again, and they were gone—no one had access to the flour but him—I have discovered very great deficiencies in my stock of flour for the last eighteen months—after he was in custody he sent for me, and I went to him—he asked me to forgive him, as Mr. Baxendale had forgiven his man—he said he would come and live near me, and nothing of the kind should happen again, or he would leave the country.</p>

               <p>I took a room of this man and pledged two or three of the things for money to go to market; his wife knew it and agreed to let me take them out as I could; I endeavoured to bring them in as fast as I could; I never gave up the key; I brought in one saucepan and an iron, and the Sunday following gave her eighteen pence in money; she said she would be content to have the things as I could give them her; I could not get it so fast as I could wish to get it; when I was taken to prison, he came and said if I would tell where the things were, he would take them out at his own expence and make a debt of it, and I should pay him one shilling a week or what I could, and that he would not hurt me; so I told him where all the things were.</p>
               <p>Q. to Whitroe. Did you promise to take it at a shilling a week, or make any promise to her?</p>

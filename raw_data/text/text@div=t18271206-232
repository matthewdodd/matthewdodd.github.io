I missed four 5l. Bank notes, a cheque for 6l. 3s. 8d., and I believe twelve sovereigns, and five half sovereigns, which had been all in one pocket. I turned sharp round, and saw the prisoner, I collared him, and said "You have robbed me;" he struck at me, and knocked me away from holding him - he struck at me four or five times afterwards, but I received only one blow - I got a black eye. I still held him, and called for assistance; a person caught hold of one of his hands, and he said I was not robbed, for I had got my money in my pocket - he was trying to put his hand into my pocket again - I caught hold of his hand, told him to open it, and I took the notes from his hand - the cheque was wrapped in them; I said, "Now give me my sovereigns" - he said he had not got them - I put my hand to his waistcoat-pocket, found something rattle, and said, "You have;" he then put his hand into his pocket, and gave me eleven sovereigns and five half-sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was he searched afterwards? A. Yes, and a sovereign and some silver found on him; I had lost some papers, which were not found - the prisoner had not time to pick the money up - he did not say he had done so.</p>

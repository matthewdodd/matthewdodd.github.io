On the 1st of this month, the prisoner came into my shop, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and bought a small article to the amount of one shilling of me; she left the shop. After that, my lad stated to me that he missed these shawls off the counter; it struck me that it must be the prisoner that had taken them. My lad went out, and brought the prisoner back with the shawls. I sent for an officer, and she was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before - A. She had been in my shop repeatedly before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe her take the piece of shawls, did you - A. No. I had not the least suspicion she was a thief. These shawls were laying on the counter just by her elbow.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Gregory. I missed the shawls after the prisoner went out of the shop; I had placed them on the counter just before she came in. I told Mr. Gregory; he sent me after her. I went, and found her at the corner of Long-alley, just going into a gin shop with the shawls; I brought her back and the shawls into my master's shop. These are the shawls; I can swear to their being my master's property. The value of them is half-a-guinea. I brought back the prisoner with the shawls upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was another woman in the shop, she was as likely to take them as me. I am quite innocent of it.</p>

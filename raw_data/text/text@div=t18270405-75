            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 22d of February, a little before six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners coming up Tower-hill, about one hundred yards from Mr. Hurst's - one was drawing a truck, and the other pushing behind; something very heavy was in it; I followed the truck to the house of Wilks, a smith and furnishing brasier; Rudd, who had been pushing behind, left the truck before it got there; Sibley took it to the house - he then threw a sack aside, and took out a large piece of lead - he took it into Wilks' back premises- it appeared to be a sheet of lead rolled up; the bag still remained in the truck, which Sibley returned, and fetched in; I went into the back shop, and saw him put the bag down by the side of the sheet of lead - they weighted together 160lbs.; I asked Sibley who the lead belonged to - he said he did not know, but as he was coming along near Irongate-stairs, he saw the truck, and a man employed him to drag it; I asked who the man was - he said he did not know, but that he had left him, and promised to overtake him; I said, "How came you to bring the lead here?" he said the man told him to take it opposite to Nightingale-lane, and that he had seen the man once or twice before; I said he must go with me and point him out; he went down Tower-hill, but no man was pointed out; I asked who the truck belonged to - he said he did not know, and then said he believed it was Mr. Hurst's, for he had had the use of it two or three times; I went with him to Mr. Hurst's, and saw him - he said he had not lent his truck to anybody, but that Sibley worked for him, and he had employed him for the last two or three weeks, to look after the lead in particular, and that the truck was his. I examined the house next morning, and found two sides of the dormer stripped of lead - I applied the three pieces of lead to the dormer - it corresponded exactly with the nail holes and what was left; I have no doubt whatever of its having come from that house; the next day, in consequence of what passed before the Magistrate I went with Lill, and apprehended Rudd - he said he knew nothing about it, but that a slater employed him to push behind the truck; I asked how he came to leave the truck - he said he went to purchase some handles for Mr. Hurst's drawers.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050047"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you see Mr. Hurst's foreman with the truck on the road? A. No. I saw Sibley take the lead out of the truck, and put it down by the side of a sheet of lead, which I believe he had first taken in. He said a man employed him to drag it, and in consequence of that Rudd was taken. Mr. Hurst has many servants; several adjoining houses had been pulled down, but this had not been began; the lead exactly fitted the place.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw Sibley at the handle of the truck, and Rudd pushing behind; he left about two hundred yards before it got to Wilks'. Littledale's account is correct; I saw the lead taken in, and afterwards saw it fitted to the dormer of Hurst's house - it fitted exactly, in every respect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was all the lead taken from the dormer? A. No, the two sides - I fitted it to what was left.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, employed by the Dock Company. On the morning of the 23d of February I called at Hurst's, to know when he could give possession of the house, and found the lead had been taken away the night before; I saw it fitted to the dormer - it corresponded exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the Company exercise any ownership over the materials at that time? A. No. None of the other dormers were covered with lead.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. HURST. Q. Did you know what your dormer was covered with? A. No. When the next house was being pulled down I drove some persons off my roof. Sibley was working with the rest of my men; I had four moving furniture within the house. I have told him he was welcome to the truck whenever he could earn a shilling with it, but I never allowed any body to take it without my knowledge - the foreman had no authority to lend it. I was at the house from half-past one o'clock till five - it could not have been brought down during that time, or I must have seen it. Sibley was employed that day carrying goods for me - Rudd was employed to fit up the house I was moving to.</p>
               <p>SIBLEY's Defence. I wish to ask, as Mr. Hurst says I had the care of the lead, if any more were shown to me than what belonged to the water-closet. I was to set in the parlour to see if any one came to take that, and one night somebody put up a ladder, which I pulled away and kept - I was never up stairs. I am often called from his house to Irongate-stairs, and on this night, as I went home, the other prisoner asked if I wanted a job, as a man wanted this lead taken to East Smithfield - it laid on the pavement; I ran back, and borrowed the truck of Mr. Hurst's foreman - Rudd helped me up the hill with it.</p>
               <p>RUDD's Defence. I assisted him up the hill, but never saw him before.</p>
               <p>JOHN HURST re-examined. The back of my house is covered with lead - I employed Sibley to watch that, but the dormer was on the roof. The prisoners were both occasionally in my employ, but I do not think they were acquainted.</p>

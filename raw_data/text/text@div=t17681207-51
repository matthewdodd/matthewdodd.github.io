The prisoner came into my shop the 25th of October, about ten or eleven in the forenoon; he wanted to see a pair of black stocking breeches; I shewed him a pair: he went to the end of the compter in order to try them on. At the end of the compter there lay some Bath-coting, and some other things: they did not fit him; I reached him another pair, he said they did not; then I reached another: then he walked out with a pair, in order to show me that they did not come high enough on the hip. Then he said, as they did not fit him, he would call again in an hour: as he was stooping to buckle his shoes. I observed something bulky on his back part: I laid hold of his coat, (he had two coats on) I said, what have you got here? You have something that you should not have: he said no, I have nothing at all. I said, you have made a great mistake; let me see what it is. With some difficulty I got to the bell, and rang for my people to come down; I being a constable, thought proper not to act on my own account. I sent for another officer, I was obliged to let go the piece to ring the bell, and then he let it drop; I found, when I had hold of the end of it, part of it was in the waistband of his breeches, and great part hung out. (Produced and deposed to.) It lay upon a shelf on the same side he was on, beyond the compter about a yard and quarter from the place were he was trying the breeches, before he took it.</p>

            . I am the officer; the prosecutor sent for me; I asked the prisoner, how he came to do so? I had charge given me of him. Mr. Ament said, he pulled it from the prisoner's breeches. The prisoner said, he pulled it from himself, and that he did not know how it came into his breeches: he offered to make the prosecutor a present of two guineas, if he would not take him before a magistrate: Mr. Ament said, he would not take any thing, he should take what the law allowed.</p>

I stood still, and said not a word; he took hold of the cloth and called for assistance; I was with my breeches half on and half off; he called his people down, and gave charge of me; and sent for a constable: the constable said, it was impossible I could put them in my breeches; he insisted upon holding me; I said I would not be held; he was taking me before a justice; I said then, I would have a coach; then I said, I would give two guineas for any of my relations to be there, to see how ill I had been used; when I came before the justice, I did not know whether I was dead or alive, I was so surprized; I was sent from thence to Clerkenwell Bridwell.</p>

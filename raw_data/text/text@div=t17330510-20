Yesterday morning, before I and my Wife were up, there being only a Servant Girl below, I heard a Man come in and call for a Pint of Beer; it being a Stranger's Voice, I whipp'd up my Stockings and Breeches, and stepping to the Stairs-head, I look'd down and saw the Prisoner go to the Bar, take up a China Punch Bowl, and put it under his blue great Coat. My Girl came up with the Beer, and I presently went down. When he had drank his Pint he was going out very orderly; but I stopp'd him at the Door, and told him it was not kindly done of him to carry off my Punch Bowl. What do you mean? says he, I am the King's Officer, I have had an Information that you keep run China in your House; and I have Authority to search and take it where I find it. - Here's my Deputation. I ask'd him if he had a Deputation to go a Thieving, and not finding that he had, I carried him before a Justice, and the Justice committed him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I belong to the King, and to prove it, I have got my Deputation ready to produce. - Here it is. Then the Deputation was read. 'Tis dated Octo. 24, 1728. It impowers the Bearer, having a Constable and a Writ of Assistance, to enter Houses in the Day-time, and seize Goods prohibited, or for which the Custom has not been paid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have had several Informations of Tea and China being carry'd to the Prosecutor's House, and had no less than three when I went thither Yesterday to search.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any Constable or Writ of Assistance?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I can't say that I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Who gave you the Informations?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I must beg your Pardon there, Sir, we that are the King's Officers must never discover Informe rs.</p>

On the 21st of February, I was in Rose-street I saw a truck under a gate-way with boxes like this; I thought the prisoner had taken the box from the truck, he got in the wide part of the street, and put the box on his shoulder, and then he run very quick; I saw Palmer pursuing him, Palmer seized the prisoner, I came up and took the prisoner to the watch-house, I saw the box delivered to Mr. Green in his shop; I requested him not to disturb the box we should want it, to take to Malborough street office. I marked the box with a notch that I might know it again, and after it was taken to the office; I have had it ever since, this is the box, it contains Hyson tea.</p>

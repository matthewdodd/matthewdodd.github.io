               <p>JOHN CLARK. On Saturday, the 26th of December, I went with the prisoner to a house in <placeName id="t18300114-77-crimeloc426">George-street, St. Giles'</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the watch, and that he knows; he gave me a penny to go and buy a candle when the candle went out; and when he came out of the public-house he began fighting with two men. Witness. There was no fighting - I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>DAVID CLYDE. I met Clark as I was going to a tobacco-shop, and took him to a public-house to treat him with a quartern of gin; when I came out he did not come out - I looked, and saw him talking to the prisoner and some other girls - he afterwards came out; the prisoner came out and called to him to go with her - this was at the corner of Crown-street, at the bottom of Tottenham-court-road - he was sober; he came to me on the Tuesday following, and said the girl I saw him with had taken his watch from him; I said I would look for her; I afterwards saw the prisoner dressed differently to what she was that night; I went to her and said, "If you will give me the duplicate, I will let you go;" she said she would give it me; I went to her house - I would not go up stairs, I said I would wait - I waited, but she did not come down; I described her to the Police-man - he went in and took her.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SIMMONS. Clyde told me to take the prisoner - I asked if his friend would come forward - he said he did not know, but he came again in two hours and said his friend would; I found her next day from the description, and took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On boxing-night the prosecutor was with four women talking in the street - he came over and asked if I would have any thing to drink - he took me to Mr. Clark's, and there we drank for about two hours; when we came out, a young Irishman and the prosecutor began fighting - I took him away - he said he would go home with me all night - I said I would take him to a house, and he gave me a penny to get a candle; I went out - there was a piece of work in the street, and two girls were taken to the watch-house; I went with them - I never saw this watch.</p>

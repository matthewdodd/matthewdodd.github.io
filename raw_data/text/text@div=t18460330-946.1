On Tuesday morning, the 17th of March, I saw Stone in Catherine-street, Limehouse-fields, between five and six o'clock—there were two men with him—I did not see their faces dis<lb></lb>tinctly, but I saw their dress—Stone had got a copper, with some<lb></lb>thing in it—he was going in a direction from Stepney church, towards the Regent's-canal—I asked what he had got—he said a copper, and he was going to set it at No. 20, in that street—I said I would walk there with him—the other two men walked away on one side—it is my belief that the other two prisoners are the men who were with Stone—Caffle had a light jacket on and a blue cap, and he was the tallest of them, and the other, who was about the same height as Smith, had a long blue coat and a hat on—one of them stepped to the left and the other to the right hand side—when I had spoken to Stone, he said the copper was rather weighty on his shoulder, and asked me to move it—I took hold of it and got it in my hand, and then he started off—I followed him down Catherine-street, springing my rattle—I followed him till M'Gregor, another policeman, went after him, and then I went back to the copper—M'Gregor got sight of Stone before I went back—I saw him run after Stone, and I knew that he was the man I had stopped with the copper—M'Gregor brought him to the bridge—I took the copper to the bridge—in the copper there was a coal-skuttle, a copper tea-kettle, a warm—ing-pan, and a lid of another kettle or saucepan—I searched Stone at the station, and found on him two silver teaspoons, marked G. M. S., and one salt-spoon, and three stockings—one of them is marked Smith—these are the articles—M'Gregor was not bound over to attend—it was quite light in the morning, and I had a distinct view of Stone—I lost sight of him when M'Gregor ran after him—I am quite sure he is the same man—I had a dis<lb></lb>tinct view of him befere he started.</p>

I am the wife of James Smith—we live at No. 62, Beaumont-square, Stepney—on Monday evening, the 16th of March, I shut up the house very early, perhaps between six and seven o'clock—I went to bed about eleven—the house was all safe at that time—I was alarmed by the policemen about seven in the morning—they directed my attention to the kitchen door, leading into the garden—I found that door open—I had shut it myself the night before, and bolted and barred it—there was a pane of glass cut out of the window—by doing that, they could lift a piece of wood which fastened the window, open it, and get in—a part of the window-frame was cut—I missed a kettle, a warming-pan, the lid of a stew-pan, a coal—skuttle, and a copper—four haras were lying ready to be taken—two tea—spoons and a salt-spoon were gone, and four shillings—I know these spoons, they have our initials on them—this skuttle and other things are mine—they were all safe that night—our house is in Stepney parish.</p>

             MAHONY. I lodge opposite the prosecutor. I saw the prisoners and another boy standing at the corner of Church-lane, about one o'clock in the morning; when they saw me, they went away. I was attending a sick person. Between two and three o'clock I saw them again. Jones went into the prosecutor's passage, the door was open; I saw the pigs come out, he let them out of the yard. Crouch and the other man waited at the door, Jones and the other man each carried a pig, Crouch went away with them. I called out "Stop those young men with the pigs." I was at the door at the time; I had gone out to get some cloves. The watchman was at the top of the street, he did not hear me. I saw the prisoners next day at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILLIAMS. I am a patrol of St. Giles's. At four o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoners and another man going up High-street, with two black and white pigs. I knew them before, and did not stop them. On Sunday night I saw Crouch and took him into custody. I asked him if he hurt himself much with the pigs; he said no, not much. I had seen him fall, and the other fell over him, He said he only drove the pigs out for a bit of lark, and he did not know what became of them.</p>
               <p>JONES. Q. Did you not ask me to take the pigs to the Green-yard - A. No.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, about ten minutes past four o'clock, I saw the prisoners, and another man dressed like a butcher, driving two pigs. The prisoners went after the pigs, as they went a contrary way. Jones ran against Crouch and pushed him down, as he ran after the pigs. I went up and asked what was the matter; Jones said the pigs had broken out of a pound; that Crouch knew the owner, and was driving them home. Crouch made no answer; he appeared hurt. I did not suspect him. The pigs were black and white. I saw Jones in Dyot-street, at ten o'clock that night, and took him. He denied the charge.</p>

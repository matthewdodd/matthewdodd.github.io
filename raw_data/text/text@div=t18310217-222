On the 6th of December, I called in the prisoner to sweep the kitchen chimney, about ten o'clock in the morning - my husband's watch was hanging over the chimney; when the prisoner had got the machine about half-way up, he told me to take down the watch, which I did - I put it into a basin on the dresser, and covered it over with a little silk bag; I went up stairs to get some money, and left my little girl in the room, but she went out to see if the machine was up the chimney - I was away about a minute and a half, and when I came down she was out in the yard; the prisoner soon finished the chimney - he made some difficulty about putting the soot into the bag, and I asked if I should hold it; he said No - I paid him 4d., and he went away; I missed the watch in about ten minutes - no one had been in the house but him, from the time I had put it into the basin; I received information, and went to White's-yard, Rosemary-lane, saw the prisoner, caught him by the jacket, and said,"Where is the watch you took from Walter-place, Schoolhouse-yard, where you swept a chimney this morning?" he said, "You had better come and see;" he struggled, got from me, and ran as hard as he could - I value the watch at two guineas; it cost me four - it was as good for me as when I bought it; my daughter is twelve years old, but she is very ill - I am certain no one was in the house but her and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before she saw me she wanted to swear to another man of the name of Fossett. Witness. No - a Policeman took another person, but I said that was not the man. I was informed he either resorted to, or lived in White's-yard - I went there, he came out of a passage, and I caught him.</p>

            . I live in Essex-street, Commercial-road. I have known the prisoner a great while - two Policemen came, took me to the office, and the prosecutrix was going to swear to me, till I took her under a gaslight, and said, "My good woman, what are you going to swear to?" I took off my cap, and then she said I was not the man - if I had not spoken to her, she would have sworn to me, and I should have been where the prisoner is now; I never knew any harm of the prisoner.</p>

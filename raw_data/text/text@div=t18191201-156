            . On the 18th of November, I left my place, at Mr. Williams's, at Stepney-green, and left my box at the green-grocer's, at the corner of Stepney-green till next day, and then being recommended by that woman, I employed the prisoner to carry it to Pentonville - I agreed to give him 2 s. 6 d., and said I would go with him. We set out; he met his brother, and asked him the nearest way. He walked very slow, and took very long rests - I told him to walk his pace. He then rested on a post for near a quarter of an hour - it being very cold, I and my sister walked on, but not perceiving him behind we went back. When he saw us he came on, and carried it as far as the Hackney-road, rested a long time, and then carried it about ten minutes longer, and sat down at a public-house door in the Hackney-road. Being very cold I gave him a pint of beer, and directed him to bring it to No. 6, Suffolk-street, Pentonville - I told him three times, then left him, and went on. Not finding him come I went as far as Finsbury-square, but could get no tidings of the box; I went to Stepney-green that evening - he had not returned. Next morning I gave information at the office, and he was apprehended on Saturday - this was on Thursday. I found two gowns, an apron, and a handkerchief at the pawnbroker's - that is all I have found - I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am a schoolmaster, and live at No. 56, Church-street, Mile End. On the 18th of November the prisoner brought a box to my house, and asked to leave it till he went home to tea. He came about eight o'clock, and said he wanted something out of it; he brought a young man with him, who he said was brother to the young woman that belonged to it. He said it was too late to take it home, but she wanted some things - he took it away next morning. I knew him before; his father is a respectable hair-dresser, and his brother once lodged with me.</p>

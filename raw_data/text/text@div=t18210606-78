            , I am a constable. On Sunday, the 25th of February, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I was on Blackfriars-bridge, and saw the prisoner in company with five other persons, two of whom I knew; I watched them into <placeName id="t18210606-78-crimeloc453">Crown-court</placeName>

I did not know who he was. About the middle of the court I saw him take it quite out - the others were with him; I laid hold of him immediately, but have never seen the gentleman since - I was quite alone. The other four went on as soon as I took the prisoner, and the gentleman got out of my sight. I took him into a fruiterer's shop - he resisted very much; while I was getting my handkerchief from my pocket to tie his hands, he rushed out - I secured him again on the step, and as I took him along he threw the handkerchief down.</p>

            . I am a constable. About seven o'clock on the evening of the 25th of February, Mason and two gentlemen gave the prisoner into my custody in Pall Mall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I have had the handkerchief some time. As I came through this court I was shoved into a shop by Mason, and the mistress pushed us out, Several told him to let me alone, and asked him for his authority - he said he had left it at home, and in the scuffle the handkerchief fell from me.</p>

On the 9th of June, the prisoner came in and asked for a pair of child's shoes - she was shown a pair, and asked to see another pair - she then offered less than I could take - but knowing her before, I said she should have them. She then made an excuse, and said she would send her child for them - she went out. I missed nothing, but followed her, and asked her if she had anything of mine - she said No; I called and brought her back. I felt her clothes, and a yard of patent cord dropped from her. I picked it up, she then said she hoped I would forgive her; I said I would not, for I had long looked for her.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the lockers of the Custom-house, in the warehouse of Mr. Cornish: On the 10th of November, the prisoner was at work there; I saw him with a candle in his hand, walking about the warehouse, between twelve and one o'clock at noon; he went to the further part of the warehouse, and there is a window next the alley, which he shut, among the casks of raw coffee; this raised a strong suspicion in my mind; he came backwards and forwards two or three times in the warehouse; that determined Mentor and me to rummage him as he came out; he slipt out of the door; Mentor followed him down the steps immediately; I stopped at the door; there are five steps down to the street; Mentor called, Cleaver, I want to speak to you; he turned short about, and said, what do you want with me; and then he brought him up the steps again; Mentor laid hold of him by the collar, and I rummaged him, and said, he had coffee about him; he said, he had none; in rummaging of him, I found he had coffee in his breeches, in a bag; he got in by me into the warehouse, and he pulled his hat off and threw some coffee out of his hat, and said, there is the property, what do you want with me further; I suppose his hat would hold two or three pounds; we went forward, and he pulled the bag out of his breeches, and shot the coffee close to the side of him, and threw the bag away over the casks; he said, now you have got all the property again, let me go about my business, you cannot hurt me now; an officer was sent for, and he was committed to his custody; the officer has the coffee.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The value of this property may amount to one shilling? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What coffee is it? - A. Raw coffee.</p>

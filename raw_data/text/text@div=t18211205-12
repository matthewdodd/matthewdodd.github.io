At the end of the second act, the prisoner and his companion rose instantaniously, to quit the Theatre - I immediately felt for my pocket-book, and finding it was gone, I charged the prisoner with having taken it; he denied it, he rose to go out, and his companion was going away in a different direction - I seized the prisoner, we struggled considerably for some minutes, in the course of which, we had moved towards the side of the benches, I saw him stretch out his arm as far as he could under the benches, apparently as if depositing something there - I asked the people who sat there to look if there was a pocket-book near their feet, Mr. Williams who sat third or fourth on the bench from the end, picked up my pocket-book, and gave it me. I detained him with some difficulty, and gave him in charge of Bond. I should know the person on my left, he went out on the opposite side while we were struggling, and when he stretched out his arm, no other person stood near us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you entered the Theatre, there were many people about you - A. Yes; the pit was not at all crowded till after the second price. Several people were with the prisoner, they left, only the prisoner and the other sat near me. The lining of my pocket was cut at the bottom, I charged him with it without asking any one if they saw him do it - he was genteely dressed - the pocket-book was found within arms reach of the prisoner.</p>

            . I live at Kennington-cross, and am teacher in a school. I was at the Theatre, and standing up at the end of the second act, I heard a scuffle behind me, turned round, and found the prisoner endeavouring to disengage himself from Mr. Thomas, who was calling for an officer. Directly after Mr. Thomas turned round in the direction in which I stood, and desired the persons near me to look for a pocket-book; I stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050010"></xptr>down, and directly under my seat, picked one up, and gave it him, he claimed it - they were at the end of the bench behind me.</p>

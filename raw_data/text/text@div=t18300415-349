On the 16th of February, about half-past five o'clock, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and said he wanted twelve pairs of red garters for Mr. Dosseter, of Threadneedle-street; I believed him, and gave him twelve pairs - they came to 14s.; he was a stranger to me - on leaving the warehouse he said he also wanted some warped net-purses, and looked out a dozen- he gave me the invoice of the first goods, and I added them to it, charging Mr. Dosseter with them; they came to 22s. - he came again the next evening, about the same time, and said the garters he had the over-night were not large enough, he wanted some larger, but Mr. Dosseter would keep those also; Mr. Hall said he had none in the warehouse, but would send them down - I went to Mr. Dosseter's to inquire, and found there was an imposition; I saw the prisoner next day at Cambridge-heath, and took him into custody - he denied knowing any thing about the charge.</p>

I saw the prisoner on both these occasions, and am certain of his person; I have no customer named Dosseter, but the one in Threadneedle-street - my man looked the things out; I entered them, and having a stiffener to repair for Mr. Dosseter. I said to the prisoner, "Here is a stiffener belonging to Mr. Dosseter, you may as well take it to him" - he said, "Oh, certainly," and took it; he asked for warped silk purses, which were added to the invoice - on the following evening I discovered the imposition.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Amidst the greatest difficulties to encounter, I now enter on my defence - I do not mean to attribute perjury to the witnesses, but alledge they are under a mistaken idea of the identity of the person; here I am charged with a crime I am innocent of - look at the evidence of Taylor; he says, after he found out the fraud he went round to the tradesmen, and among others to my late master, Mr. Bunnell, who, in giving a description of my person, said he thought that he had such a person in his employ, and gave my name and address; Taylor came to the house, saw me outside, and immediately said I was the person - he, of course, anxious to bring the real perpetrator to justice, has unfortunately fixed on the innocent person; if I had obtained the goods should I have gone to Mr. Dosseter, where I am well known; for I should have been sure to be identified - with a full opinion that if you have a doubt of my guilt you will give me the benefit of it, knowing that it is better that ninety-nine guilty persons should escape than one innocent man be convicted.</p>

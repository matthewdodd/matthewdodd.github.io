                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No</hi>. 476.) On the morning of the 20th of August, between one and two o'clock, I was in Nicholas-lane, near the Black Boy and Horse Shoe—after hearing the landlady lock the door and go up stairs, I saw a light in the bar—I watched it for some time, listened at the door, and heard a lock forced back—I knocked at the door, and asked three times whether all was right—I could get no answer—I tried the door, and found it unfastened—I went inside, and there was a light in the bar—I asked if it was all right—it was put out immediately—I went out and sprung my rattle—Lamboll came up immediately—we called the landlord down, searched the house, and found the prisoner in the water-closet below pretending to be asleep—I took him out, searched him, but found nothing on him—I took him to the station.</p>

At a quarter past two o'clock I went to the Black Buy and Horseshoe—I found Gozzard at the door, and left him there with a brother officer while I went inside and aroused the inhabitants—the landlady, the barmaid, and the boy came down—I went into the bar with the landlady, and found a screw-driver lying alongside the till, which was on the floor—I was called to the water-closet by Gozzard, and found the prisoner there—I took him out, and searched him—he said he had come in there a little after nine o'clock, called for half a pint of beer, and asked the waiter to show him down, and he supposed he had fallen asleep—the stairs are rather steep.</p>

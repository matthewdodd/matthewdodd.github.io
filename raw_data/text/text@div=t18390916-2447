                  </hi>. I work at the water-side. On the 23rd of August, I was employed to watch a barge, which was on the Thames, alongside the Isabella Sarah, off Irongate, at the Tower—It was laden with tea and sugars—It was covered with a tarpaulin—I went on board about nine o'clock at night, and at half-past four o'clock in the morning the pri<lb></lb>soner came alongside in a boat—he made the boat fast, got into the barge, undid the tarpaulin, and took out a chest of tea, and put it into his boat—I said, M Halloo, what are you doing there?"—he put it into the boat before I could get up to him—he then shoved the boat off, I jumped into it, collared him, and called for assistance—the carpenter of the <hi rend="italic">Isabella Serah</hi> came—the prisoner said if I did not let him go he would drown me.</p>

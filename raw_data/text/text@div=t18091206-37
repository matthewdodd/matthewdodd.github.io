On the 14th of December, the prisoner, in company with another man, knocked at my shop door, I let them in; the prisoner said he wanted a quarter of a pound of butter, I asked him what price; the prisoner said, oh, he did not know; the other man said fourteen-penny will do; I weighed them a quarter of a pound, the prisoner observed how crumbled it was; I said, if he liked I would beat it up; the prisoner said no; the man in company with him said, you had better have it beat up, and then he withdrew to the door and took one of the hams that were laying in the window; I cried out that the man had stole a ham, the prisoner said, what man; I told him it was the man along with him. The prisoner was going to the door, I told him to stop, he did; I called the next door neighbour in, and gave him in charge of the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you never saw your ham again, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner and the other man came in as if they were connected together - A. They were in conversation when I opened the shop door.</p>

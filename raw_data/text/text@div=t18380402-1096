                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Seth Smith, a builder, who is building near Grosven or Terrace, Harton-street, and Eaton-square. I am employed under Woodneld, the foreman of the plumbers—on the morning of the 15th of March, I cut some lead for gutters, by Woodfield's directions—I left a piece of lead remaining on the premises, which the foreman said was a waste piece—he told me to roll it up—it was from forty to fifty lbs. weight—the premises are in the Mews, between Chester-square, and Eaton-square, not far from some buildings in Wilton-cretcent, on the right band corner of Belgrave-square—you can go down Belgrave-square from where the lead was, to the building I have named, but there are several ways to go, one as near as another—you can go through Chapel-street, from the buildings in Chester-square, to the buildings in Belgrave-square—it is a bye way—the straight way would be down the square—I know the house of Carr—it is in Belgrave Mews, at the back of Belgrave-square—I saw the lead, which I left on the premises, in the shop, at half-past eight o'clock on Friday morning, the 16th, when I returned from breakfast—I saw Buckingham and Holden, there were more men there—Carr was not there—Woodfield was—I saw Buckingham take a piece of lead on his shoulder out of the shop, in com<lb></lb>pany with Holden, about a quarter before nine o'clock—they went away together—it was the piece I had left the day before—it is here—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing it)—I</hi> have examined it, and am certain it is the same piece—I was afterwards at Can's house—I was sent for when I came back at one o'clock—I found the officers Edwards and Thatcher there—Holden was in custody—I saw the officers bring the piece of lead down stairs from Carr's house.</p>

This plan (<hi rend="italic">looking at if</hi>) accurately represents the plumber's shop, and the buildings, erecting in Belgrave-square—a person going from the shop to the square would have no business in the Mews, if he went in a direct line—on Friday morning, the 16th of March, I received information from Fitzgibbon, a little before nine o'clock, and followed Buckingham and Holden—I went through a building in Eaton-square, and saw them both in Belgrave-street—Holden was near Eaton-place, and Buckingham had just turned the corner of Chapel-street, which leads to Belgrave Mews—Carr's house is in the Mews—Holden was some distance behind Bucking<lb></lb>ham—I ran into Chapel-street, and stood by the corner of Belgrave Mews, where I had a view of Carr's house—I stood there about five minutes, and saw Buckingham come out of Carr's house, with the fingers of his right hand in his waistcoat pocket, as if he had put something into his pocket—he had no lead on his shoulder, nor had Holden any that I could see—Buckingham went into the Coachmaker's Arms, a few doors from Carr's—I then returned, and gave information to the police—I accompanied the officer to Carr's house, between twelve and one o'clock—Carr was at home—I asked if he had purchased a piece of lead that morning—he said he had not, that he had been from home to town, to purchase lead, he had been away in short from six that morning—I saw his wife in the shop, and asked her—she said no, there had been no lead purchased—Thatcher, the officer, asked Carr if he would allow him to look round—he said yes, and I believe he also said that was all the sheet lead he had got in the house. pointing to what was in the shop—a few words passed between him and Thatcher, which I do not recollect—I went down into the cellar and found a great quantity of lead—there was sheet lead there—the officers went up stairs and brought down some more lead.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did you leave his house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half-past nine, or twenty minutes to ten o'clock—I remained there from about half-past seven o'clock waiting there, talking to one of his men, and when the men went to breakfast, Mrs. Carr said she ex<lb></lb>pected him in immediately—I saw no man come in a little before nine o'clock with a roll of lead—if there had been I must have seen it—I am confident about the day, it was a Friday morning—I believe it was three weeks last Friday—I had to give in a contract for a job, and I wanted to consult him—I had to give in my contract on the 22nd, and this was on the Friday previous—I never saw Buckingham before—I am quite sure he did not come in with any lead—I carry on business in Harrow-road—I have known Carr about six years—he has carried on that business ever since I have known him—it is not an uncommon thing to have rolls of lead in a cistern half full of water—it might be placed there to repair the cistern, and the water come in after it was put in, before the job was done, and that would stop the job—some one came into the shop while I was there, but not with lead—I did not take particular notice who it was—the person came to the door and asked if Mr. Carr was at home—he was told no—I was talking to two workmen in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber. I have been in Mr. Carrs em<lb></lb>ploy, six and a half or seven years—I was at home on the morning Mr. Carr was taken into custody—I went to work about six o'clock, and went back about eight—during that time Mr. Carr was not in his house—I re<lb></lb>turned from breakfast about half-past eight o'clock—my master was not at home then—Mr. Nelson came in at half-past seven o'clock, and re<lb></lb>mained there till I returned from breakfast—he left, I should say, at half-past nine o'clock—a person called about a quarter before nine o'clock, and asked if Mr. Carr was at home—I said he was not—I think I have seen that lead before—I cannot swear to the lead which was taken out of my master's cistern—I put some there—the cistern required mending, it was very bad for some time—I had put it in the day before, the 16th of March—there was no water in the cistern at the time—after I cleared the cistern out I was</p>

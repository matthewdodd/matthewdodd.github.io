            . I was in the prisoner's service; on the Thursday before Conner was taken I saw him at my master's - he came for some draught phials, and had two baskets with him with something in them, but I do not know whether these are the baskets - he staid, I suppose, a quarter of an hour; I was paving in the yard, but I could see him - there was no sale of bottles of this kind, or I should have seen it; to my certain knowledge there were no such bottles as these in the shop - there are some fish-kettles there in which nails are put; I saw Conner go away and take the baskets which he brought - I took in the phials which he bought on the Friday; I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Conner seldom came to the shop? A. He deals in bottles, and calls there sometimes - I went there on the 28th, but I have worked there before; I have seen Conner there twice - I do not know what was in his baskets when he was at the house - they were talking about the phials; he was to have them at 8d. a dozen - I took them on Friday, and brought my master the money - I never saw such bottles as these on my master's premises; I do not believe he would buy them, they are so very conspicuous - I have known him to turn away a great many things that came to the shop, because he was afraid they might be stolen - I never saw a doctor's bottle in his house; he deals in phials - these would not sell in his shop; he does not sell to doctors.</p>

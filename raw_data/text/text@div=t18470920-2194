On the 2nd of Sept. the prisoners Barnett and Thomas Rush were looking in at our window—there were rings, watches, and other things in it—they went away, returned, and stood in the same place they had done before—they then went past the door—they came again, and I saw them go away the third time—I then ran down to the bottom of the shop, and saw that a card of rings was gone from the window—I went to the door, looked towards Ratcliff-highway, and then looked towards Shadwell, and saw Barnett—I caught hold him, and brought him back to the shop—I told him on what account I brought him back—he said, "Me! me! you are mistaken"—I have no doubt that he and Thomas Rush are the persons I saw at the window—a small corner of the pane of this wis<lb></lb>dow was cracked previously, but after the rings were gone it was broken away—there was a large piece out—a lad brought in two rings immediately after<lb></lb>wards—I had observed the window shortly before I saw the prisoner there—it was then quite safe.</p>

               <p>came in—he went away, I believe, about two o'clock, or a little after—he had only to go opposite to his door—he did not go away at three—he went from two till a quarter after two—he was doing as he mostly does, being an oppo<lb></lb>site neighbour, he comes in and calls for his half-pint with his lunch—he has no general time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he do that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He called for half-a-pint of beer, drank it at the bar, and then walked into the tap-room and sat down—I cannot state exactly where he sat—he was in conversation—I cannot say whether he was sitting with the prisoners—people in the tap-room cannot sit apart, the room is small—I cannot tell whether he talked to the prisoners—he did not dine in my house that day—I do not know Barnett—I cannot say whether he has ever been at my house.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 53, Holywell-lane, and am a hair-dresser. I live nearly opposite Mr. Gladman—I recollect quite well being in his house on Thursday, the 2nd of Sept.—John and Thomas Rush were there—I went there about twelve o'clock, and did not come away till twenty minutes past two—Thomas Rush came in about twelve o'clock, and John Rush about one o'clock, and I left them there—I did not have any dinner—I had one pint to drink—John Rush went out for five or six or seven minutes, and came back with some tripe in his hand—he was not gone long enough to have gone to Ratcliff-highway, I should think—they asked the landlord for the frying-pan and put the tripe on—I saw them eat—Turner is her—he was there at the time—I have known John Rush ten or eleven weeks, by seeing him pass in and out—I have known Thomas Rush about fourteen months—he is a shoe-maker</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you have your pin of beer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Gladman brought it me out of the bar into the tap-room—I was not at the police office—I was not asked to go there—I do not know what John Rush was doing the whole time—he was sitting and talking, except when he went out for the tripe—he did not move, but just to eat his tripe—I do not know who cooked it.</p>

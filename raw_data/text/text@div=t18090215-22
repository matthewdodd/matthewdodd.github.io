               <p>Q. Then any body could take them down on the outside - when the shutters were taken down, what prevented them from taking any thing out of the shop - A. They were taken out by breaking the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the window so the evening before - A. It was broken, it had been cracked, and I had put some putty to keep it tight, the window does not slide or open; nobody could get any thing out except through one of the panes; one pane of glass had been cracked, but kept together with putty; that was the window that was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that sufficiently strong, so as to require same force to break it open - A. I think so; it would not have fell out without being touched.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of the violins since - A. I saw two about half after three in the morning; I was alarmed in the middle of the night by the watchman; I went to the watchhouse; there I saw the three prisoners.</p>

I was, in St. Giles's parish, about an hundred yards from Mr. Aireton's; I heard the rattles sprung, and the cry of stop thief; I saw two men run from the place where the shop was broken open, I stopped Skiddard; the other man run away. When Skiddard saw me coming he cried stop him, they were running towards me; the other man changed his direction, the prisoner Skiddard stood still and cried stop thief; Skiddard had nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150014"></xptr>with him, he told me he was coming from a club, and that he was not one of the persons at all.</p>

               <p>Stevens' Defence. I was coming by that place, this man ran after me and catched me; I had been to a public house with my father, my father had left me and I was going home.</p>
               <p>Bremmer's Defence. On Saturday evening I went to Well street with an acquaintance, and after having a supper with him I was returning home to my lodgings in Drury lane; on my going on I kicked my foot against something, it proved to be a violin: a watchman knocked me on the back part of my head; I heard the cry of stop thief, and for fear of being thought one of the party, I run.</p>
               <p>Skiddard's Defence. I was passing from Baker street, Manchester square; coming along I heard the watchman say, there is thieves, pursue them; I ran behind this watchman ten yards; he ran after the man down a court; I run back again and passed the place; he turned back and ran after me; I stood still and said I am not one of the part.</p>

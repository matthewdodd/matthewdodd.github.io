The watch produced in court and deposed to. A lad and a woman came and told me the prisoner was at a house in Penitent-street on the 27th, they described him as plain as could be, I went there and there was the man; I took hold on him and gave him an ugly fail and took him before the Justice.</p>

            . I stop'd the watch, I happened to be at an alehouse, the prisoner came in and said he had been robbed of seven guineas and a half, but happened to save his watch in the sob of his trowsers, and that he had pawned it for 15 shillings, and if any man there would take it out he would sell it; he said he had bought it at Portsmouth, then he said he bought it in Jamaica; he asked five pounds for it, then he drop'd at once to thirty shillings; we thought proper after we had fetch'd it out of pawn to stop and advertise it, then the prosecutor came and owned it.</p>

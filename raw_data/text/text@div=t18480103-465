                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin William West Dobson Binder and keep a tobacconist's shop. I have a weight at the door, to give notice when any one comes in—on 18 Dec., about half-past seven o'clock ✗in the morning, I heard the shop-door open—a boy put his head in as far as he could, and asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—the prisoner then put his arm and shoulder in, and took a cigar-box from a little shelf in the window—there was nothing in it—he could not get his head in—he could not see whether there were cigars in it or not—I said, "What do you want, thief?"—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him, and heard him throw the box away, and swear at it because it was empty—it is mine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it does not open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was not the box found 100 yards from your place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You picked it up again—I knew you before as a very bad character—I swear to you—it was past day-break, and there were three gas-lights on the other side of the way—I did not give you into custody until ten o'clock, as I did not wish to take any trouble about it—I have watched you at my window for a fortnight or three weeks, and have been told to beware of you—you sent a boy at half-past eight o'clock for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco, to see if I suspected you—I told him I did—he told you, and you ran down the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in York-street, and am a clothes-salesman. On the 2nd of December I saw this coat about eleven o'clock, and was asked the price of it—about a quarter after twelve o'clock it was taken from the shop by some one—I was told something, in consequence of which I ran after the prisoner—he ran one way, I turned back and met him in a dif<lb></lb>ferent way buttoning the coat on—I collared him—he endeavoured to take if off—I got him as far as a neighbour's house, about fifteen yards from my own, and got them to render me assistance, as he was likely to get the better of me, as I was in a flurry—this is the great coat—he said, "What do you mean by collaring me?"—I said, "You vagabond, that is mine"—I took him to the neighbour's house, and then we got the coat off him—as I was taking him to the station-house the policeman met us.</p>

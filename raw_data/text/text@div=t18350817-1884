               <p>I said any thing, and Benjamin, in his presence, asked if Mr. Stephens would give any further security; whether either of the refrees would be<lb></lb>come a party to the bill—I had given them refrences before—it was agreed at this interview to give four bills—Benjamin Levison drew the form in the prisoner's presence for four bills at three, six, nine, and twelve months, for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, the signature to be left blank—the prisoner saw the paper delivered to me—I cannot find it—I have looked for it, and believe it to be destroyed—the bills were drawn exactly from that form—when I was asked to give security I told him Mr. Stephens objected to give the refer<lb></lb>ences as parties to the bill, but he had a life-policy which he would give as collateral security for the payment of the bills.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see Benjamin do any act as his clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; once writing out an order for samples of wine in the London Docks, signed, "J.

On the 13th of July he sent me out with some cloth, and I was to call at Mr. Rush's and receive two ends of black cloth, which were my master's property - they were worth from 40l. to 44l.; I was to bring them home to the warehouse; after I had got them from Mr. Rush, in Bridge-street, Westminster, I went to Adam-street, Adelphi, and there I, with another boy, put them into a coach, and drove to the prisoner's - we found him at home - he asked what we would take for the cloth; we said 30l. - he did not agree to that, and said he would give no more than 10l. 10s. for it - after some time we agreed to take the money; he asked where we got it, and we said, from Bridge-street, Westminster - we sold the cloth to him, and received the money from him; we did not go back to my master - we staid in London that day, and the next morning went down to Gravesend; at the last Session I stood where the prisoner does now - I was delivered to my master; there were marks on the cloth - Nathan said he would burn them, and he took hold of them and tore them off each end; they were the numbers of the cloths from my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose this is your first beginning in robbery? A.

            . I am a butcher, and live at the corner of Shrewsbury-court - I know the prisoner's house. On the 13th of July I saw the coachman stop against my shop door, and this boy brought out the cloth - Nathan's house is fifty or sixty yards from mine; I went up the court, having some suspicion, and I saw them take it to a house opposite the house in which Nathan then lived - I went into a water-closet adjoining, which has a window, which looks into the yard of the house they went into - I heard some boy say, "Forty-pounds," and I heard Nathan say, "Ten-pounds;" I knew his voice, and am sure it was him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you went and gave information? A. I did, when I received information of some cloth being lost from Mr. Brand - I had some suspicion it was stolen; I did not go to any Police-office - I am sure it was 40l. I heard; I am positive of that - it was not 30l.; I do not know about getting any expences; I am subpoenaed to come here - I never said that Nathan did not buy the cloth - I have heard him say he never bought it; I do not know that he did buy it - I will not positively swear that I never said to any body he did not buy the cloth - I never said, "Where is the use of my coming to give evidence when I can say nothing whatever about the transaction;" I never said so to an officer, nor ever said, "I can be on my oath Nathan did not buy it" - I did not go to Mrs. Nathan and say so; I did not go to her house and get drink since this trial - I had prior to it; I never went in after the day in question to my knowledge; I do not recollect that I did - I cannot say whether I did or not; I have drank in the house several times; I am sure it was not to myself that it was sold - I was not sure it was stolen, I only suspected it - I could not leave my business on any consideration.</p>

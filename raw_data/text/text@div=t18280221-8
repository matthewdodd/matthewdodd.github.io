               <p>MARIA CLARK. I live at Mr. Beningfield's - the street door is generally open in the day time. On the 5th of February, about twelve o'clock in the morning, I left my things safe on the third floor, and about one o'clock I found the prisoner, who was a stranger, in the two pair of stairs back room; I asked how she came there - she said she had got leave from a young lady, who was down at the door talking to a gentleman - she had nothing in her hands - I found the articles stated in the indictment in a handkerchief, which did not belong to the house; they were in the wardrobe by her - she denied ever having touched them; I am the only person who had care of the house; the cap belongs to Mrs. Beningfield; she had moved that out of the front bed-room; she still denied having touched them; I brought her down to the kitchen, and Mr. Beningfield sent for an officer, who took her.</p>

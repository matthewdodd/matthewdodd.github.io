            . Q. Were you employed on the Archduke Charles as a gangsman. - A. Yes, in July we began on the 12th to unload, she was unloaded on the 31st of July, I know the prisoners and Jarvis were working on board the ship several days.</p>
               <p>GEORGE JARVIS. Q In the month of July, were you a labourer in the employ of the London Dock company. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed in unloading the Archduke Charles. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember while you were unloading the Archduke Charles shifting some seal skins in the coal-hole. - A. Yes, Bassett and Ford were with me, I then saw something in a bag, it was some kind of metal, it looked very black, there was a hole in the bag, Ford and Baskett were in the ship with me and two lumpers besides, the bag was left there that night till the next morning. I told Bassett and Ford that I had found it almost as soon as I found it, Bassett told me to bring up a piece the next morning, he would take it out and see what it was. The next morning I took it up out of the hold, and gave it Bassett about five minutes before eight, he was at a place behind the warehouse, Ford was in the ship's hold at the time I took it up, we had agreed the night before what to do.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning what time did you go to work. - A. About eight o'clock, Ford was there as soon as I, he saw me take it I have no doubt, this was on Thursday morning, I gave it into Bassett's hands, he put it into the crown of his hat, he went out with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Chip come. - A. I did not see Chip until the Thursday following, Chip was ordered in on the Wednesday night to fetch some.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which was afterwards conveyed away by Chip part of that bag. - A. Yes, it was part of that which was taken out of that bag out of which Baskett took away that morning one piece, and then a week afterwards Chip came and took away some more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The week following did you see Chip come into the dock. - A. Yes. Ford had told me in Chip's cellar that he was to come. Chip has a cellar in Well Street, he sells beer. In the morning Chip came in about ten minutes before eight, Ford ordered me to be there a little before him to give 
               <persName id="t18110918-68-person515">Chip</persName>
             a piece every morning, it was hid under some flax in a shed in the London Dock, that was where Ford told me to hide it, I took a piece from under the flax and gave it to Chip and he went out with it, Chip came in again about twelve o'clock, Basset gave him another piece, he went away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there was a great deal of noise made about this, and at last you were taken up. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And after you were in custody you made this confession. - A. Yes, what I have said is true.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHIP. I keep an ale and porter cellar in Well Street.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of June last, do you remember the prisoner Ford coming to your cellar. - A. Yes, On Tuesday morning, a little before eight o'clock, he asked me whether I wanted a job, I said frequently, he said it was something valuable to sell, it was a kind of silver, he asked me if I could get sale for it, I told him if it was any thing valuable there was no doubt but I could sell it, he made an appointment to come on the Wednesday night, he did come and Jarvis with him, he then asked me to come to a box in the Docks, on Thursday morning, I went there on the Thursday at eight o'clock, and Jarvis gave me a piece of silver, I wrapped it up in this handkerchief, I took it out of the Dock gates, I went again at twelve o'clock, I saw Ford, Bassett, and Jarvis, Ford pointed to me to go to Jarvis, I heard Jarvis say to Bassett I have been once it is not my turn, I then saw Bassett go to the place where Jarvis had gone in the morning, Bassett gave me another lump, he said there I can trust you, I took and hid it under a watch box in the Dock, the other piece I took home in the morning. When they left work at four Ford came and asked me if I had got any money, I said no, you did not tell me what to do with it, I asked him what he called it, he said it was the best virgin silver. I went to Lloyd's Coffee house to find the captain of the vessel to give information, I took the piece of silver I had at home to Mr. Clarke, coming home I saw a paper, I went to Mr. Barry's office, I left the card with my address at the broker's.</p>
               <p>Q. That led to the ultimate enquiry, so it was a voluntary act on your part. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARK. I live in Husher Court, Water lane. Q. Do you know the witness. - A. I know him by bringing porter and ale to our house, he brought a piece of metal that looked like lead on what day I cannot say, he brought two officers and came for it about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which was delivered back in the presence of the officers the same that he left. - A. Yes.</p>

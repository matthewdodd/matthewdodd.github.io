                  </hi>. I am a cattle-dealer, and live in Cardigan-shire. I went to the Sun Inn, at Addington in Northamptonshire—I went to bed—the prisoner was to sleep in the same room—I had a pocket-book which contained the bag with 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it and the notes state, which were for cattle I had sold—I put the property under my pillow—I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and got up at a little past six—I was out for two nights before—when I got up all my property was gone, but 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; no one else was in the room—my silver watch was gone, and a knife was found in the window where I had left my watch—I had gone there looking after a horse that was taken in the pond, and the prisoner spoke to me in the street and went with me—this is the bill of exchange that was in my hook, I took it of George Jolly.</p>

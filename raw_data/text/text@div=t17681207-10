On the 6th of November, Mr. Robinson came to me, and asked me if I had not lost some shoes, saying, a man was stopt with some, and by the manner of his selling them, there was reason to suspect he had stole them, and that he had stopt him, and shewed the shoes to a master shoemaker, who said they were mine; he brought some with him. I know them to be mine. I had sent sixty-seven pair on the Thursday before to Mr. Houch's Waggon, to go to Mr.

I went immediately to Mr. Houch's, book-keeper, to know if my man had delivered them, there I found he had, and they were booked. On the Monday morning, the prisoner, who had been offering some to sale, was brought before the Justice; it appeared that he was the man that drove the cart out of the inn yard.</p>

He had a parcel of shoes in a bag. I went to a shoemaker, and asked him whose mark it was upon them, he told me, Mr. Heath's. I went to the watch-house, and got the constable of the night, and secured the prisoner, and the next morning I went and informed Mr. Heath of it.</p>

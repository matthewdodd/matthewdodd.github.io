               <p>I went with him to his lodgings; he told us he had only that room, and we went down stairs; when we came there, he opened some drawers, but there was one which was locked up, and he said he could not find the key; his child said her mother had it, and the key of the two pair of stairs; at which he seemed angry, and shook his fist<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150039"></xptr>at her; we found two boxes; one was marked; there was in one of them many quires of paper: when he was detected, the prisoner said, for God's sake, Mr. Hussey, interfere, and do not hurt me! I said, you are a damned rascal, you ought to be hanged: he did say that one of the boxes was given him by one of the porters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. The printed calico was made up in gowns? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you not say it would be better for him, if he confessed? - I did not; he said there was a box there.</p>
               <p>Do not these porters consider these boxes as perquisites? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you swear at him before or after? - I don't recollect.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: on Monday Mr. Hussey called, and told me he wanted a constable; I went with him, and found this box, and these things in them (produced); they have been kept at Mr. Hussey's ever since; they were sealed at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>(The box deposed to, and the contents.)</p>

               <p>All I know about the box is, that it is my master's; there is my master's name upon it.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knapp. These boxes you consider as perquisites? - We cut them up for firewood, some of them, not all.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

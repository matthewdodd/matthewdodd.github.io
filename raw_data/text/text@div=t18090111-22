            's gardener. I lost these ducks last Sunday night, they were in a hen house; I missed them on Monday morning, I had seen them on the over night, between four and five in the evening; they were locked up in the hen house in an enclosed yard; I lost eight ducks from the poultry house, and five from the fattening house, and three chickens besides I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this man of taking them - A. On Tuesday morning I went to Leadenhall market, I found twelve out of the thirteen; they were all alive.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these ducks are your master's - A. Yes; they had a private mark on them, and one of the drakes had but one eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man - A. He lived about a quarter of a mile from us; I cannot say I know him, I know his wife very well.</p>

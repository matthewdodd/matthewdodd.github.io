               <p>I am a widow. Last Thursday morning, some few minutes after three, I was waked by a knock at the door; I threw up the window, and a watchman desired me to see if I had lost some lead: I looked, and found some lead rolled for to take away, from over the shop window; it was quite cut away, and separated from the house, and wound up in a small compass; and there was as much taken away as was rolled up; I had seen it all safe the same night when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. You are a widow, and keep a shop? - I do; a leather cutters and curriers.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether it was joined to the lead that was left, or separated? - Intirely separated; it came away without the least obstruction; my servant came and took it up.</p>
               <p>Court. What light had you? - The watchman put his candle up by the help of a stick, and my servant took it, and delivered it to the watchman.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. What night was this? - It was a dark night.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice whether this lead was separated intirely? - I did, by the candle of the watchman.</p>
               <p>Who conducts her business for her? - You ask me too hard a question.</p>
               <p>You do not conduct it? - I do not.</p>

               <p>Did you feel or examine the thickness, either by your eyes or fingers? - By both; and I believe it is the same; I laid it all down, and it exactly fitted.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole of St. James's parish. My partner and I was going along on Thursday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130040"></xptr>morning, we made a halt, and saw a man within two doors of Mrs. Morgan's; we made a run, and seized him by the collar, and the other two came off the house; they jumped down, I saw them; and they ran from the house; Swinney was the man I came up to in the street, and stopped him, and he never got out of my hands; the others ran; my partner took one half way down the street; and he called to the watchman, and he stopped the other; I lost sight of them when they turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough for you to know the same men, and are you sure that they are the same men you saw in the house? - I can, from their dress; I saw them in custody in less than a minute.</p>
               <p>How did they get down? - Down by the spout and rail; we took all three to the watch-house, and came back again to Mrs. Morgan, when we found there was a piece gone, and a piece rolled up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You have told his lordship that you saw them coming down by laying hold of the spout, then you did not see the rope that was hanging down? - There was no rope there.</p>
               <p>How high was it from the ground? - About ten feet.</p>
               <p>Did not one let himself down by his hands? - They came nearly down both together, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Swinney. Did you see me near the place? - I did.</p>
               <p>I would wish to ask whether you saw me run or no? - I cannot tell that particularly.</p>
               <p>Peatt to Crutchford. What distance from Mrs. Morgan's house might you be when you took Swinney? - About eight or ten yards.</p>
               <p>He is a young man, rather strong? - He is rather strongish.</p>
               <p>You was using your hands very attentively with reference to him, and your eyes with reference to the other two? - I did.</p>
               <p>What sort of a light did you use at this time? - We carry no light.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About half past two.</p>
               <p>Then the lights in the street were almost out? - No; there were people about to light them.</p>
               <p>However that might be, you say that the two men, that were ten yards from you, you could know them again? - I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>No; I do not doubt that; but you may be mistaken of men that you did not see come back for a pretty length of time? - I am certain they are the men.</p>
               <p>What circumstance has led you to suppose they are the men? had they round hats or cocked ones? - Round ones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watson. Please you, my lord, I had a cocked one all the time.</p>

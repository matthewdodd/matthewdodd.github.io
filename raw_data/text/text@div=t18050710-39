This man was taken up on the 5th of July, he told me he had taken them, and if I would go with him, he would go and shew me where he had deposited them; he then led me up the lane, and took the pistols from a hedge; from there he took me to a dunghill, and scratching it about a foot deep he produced a great number of articles in two sacks; I then asked him for the screw-winch, he took me two fields from our house, and took it from a hedge; I asked him the meaning of depositing them in so many places; says he, I was overloaded, and I intended, when I had got sufficient, to have gone to London, and brought a cart and took them all away. I asked him where he lodged, he said in Chapel-street, Tottenham-court-road; I went there and found an axe, which is a different axe to the other, and this saw, they were in his workshop; I found these duplicates on a shelf under a stone in his workshop. I am sure the whole of the property is my father's.</p>

            . I went to search Myddleton's house on the 2nd of March - I found the painting hanging up, when I took Martin there; I afterwards took the prosecutor to the house - he identified it; it hung in the front room - a piece of plain paper was pasted over the name of the vessel; Myddleton was not at home then - I saw her afterwards; she said she had bought it twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said two months. Witness. I am sure she said twelve months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long after you apprehended Martin did you take it in your possession? A.About an hour and a half - I noticed it there when I took him; I am sure she said she had had it twelve months, and the tea-pot the same time; she had got forty duplicates.</p>

The prisoner and a woman came in and called for a pint of beer; they drank it and called for another; when we lighted up candles he moved from the window near the fire, and called for a pint of hot; then came in a young man, and called the prisoner Mr. Brown, and asked him how he did; then he moved from the fire, and came and sat in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220016"></xptr> seat overagainst the fire for a little time; then he came and sat against the middle seat where the pots lay; I was then called away; when I returned, the child told me he was putting pots into his pocket; he was then writing with a piece of chalk upon the table; I said, What is become of the pots that were here? I touched his coat and felt something heavy in it; I said, You villain, you've robbed me; we searched, and took two quart pots and a penny pot out of one pocket, and two quart pots and a penny pot out of the other; (produced in court) Here are our names upon them: They were taken from among more, that were some lying on the table, and some on a shelf by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible that his pockets could contain two quarts and a penny pot each?</p>

               <p>Q. Before that, did he stop you, or say any thing to you? - A. Not a word; it was a silver watch, with a gold chain, two gold watch-keys, and a gold seal, I valued it at 5l. he went towards Aldgate, and in about two or three minutes he was brought back again, when I recognized him immediately.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What part of Jewry-street was it that you stopped the prisoner? - A. That end next Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. And because the prisoner called out stop thief, you were kind enough to suppose he was the thief? - A. I had every just reason; I looked straight forward and saw nobody before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know you will have a share of a forty pounds reward? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of a reward of forty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Roe-buck public-house in Shoemaker-row - do you know Mr. Chapman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Chapman it might be a nice thing for you? - A. I told Mr. Chapman if I had any share of it I would put it to a good use, I would give it to some charity or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or not know that there is such a reward? - A. I do not wish to have it; but if I was to have it, I would give it to some charity; I come here to speak the truth, I know nothing of either of the parties.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about the dusk of the evening? - A. It was between fifteen and twenty minutes after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that he threw away the watch, before you fell or after? - A. We both fell together, and as soon as we had fell, he scaled the watch away.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you even see the watch in the man's hand at all? - A. I saw the chain, and not only the chain, but I afterwards saw him chuck it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the watch since? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch-glass broke? - A. There was nothing broke.</p>

Mr. Smith immediately said, that is the man that robbed me just now; I asked him if he should know the watch; he said the maker's name was Grant, in Fleet-street. I searched him, but found nothing upon him except this whip, which he had in his hand. (Produces the watch).</p>

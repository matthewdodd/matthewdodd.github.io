He began to cry, and said he never touched any thing, and then he said he never would do the like again if I would let him go; so on the left hand side on the floor going into the room there were sixteen of the towels, and a woman's petticoat rolled up in an old check apron, which hung upon the back of a chair a little before; then they found a petticoat wrapped up in the seventeenth towel, which I saw pulled out from under the dresser.</p>

Strahan and Co.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had this man lived with you? - About since the month of October, or November, before the March these things were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. You had always found him an honest man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a partner in this line of business? - Not in this business.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the business is that? - In the anchor boats.</p>
               <p>Q. This man works with you occasionally? - He has been constant since the latter end of June, but before that he has not been above sometimes two days a week or three days or so; but when he was out of my employ it was his own fault. I paid him 3 s. a day as long as he worked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the Minerva sailed after the 28th of March? - She proceeded immediately, she left the river about the 29th or 30th.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard nothing of the loss of this till June, and then I believe you took a search warrant to search the prisoner's lodging? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing there? - I did not; I took him before Justice Staples, where he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that from June to a very little time ago he continued in your service? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you told him that you had heard something more about this box, and you expected he would attend before Justice Staples again? - No, he was taken before Mr. Staples; I had no suspicion till he came before an attorney, and I found that he could not clear up his point.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said, that you thought the prisoner was innocent? - No.</p>

               <p>I was the captain of the Minerva; I delivered on the 28th of March, the box in question to Busher, I have known him four or five years; I did not discover the box was not on board till I was half way on my passage to Madeira, about three weeks after I left the river, it contained 5,854 piastres and a broken one; they were in a wooden box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where did you come on board? - At Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not been told that there was a box brought under the stern at Gravesend, which he said wanted some repairs, and then took it back? - I never received it at Gravesend; I did not ask for it there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When you did ask, was you so told? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never heard any thing of that sort while you was in the river? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. This I take it was one of the most valuable part of your cargo? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the rest of the boxes contain money? - No, it was the valuablest one and smallest one of the cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. The cargo was known to them on board? - It was certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. That box was not unknown to the people? - The people did not know any such a thing was coming on board the vessel.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150098"></xptr>Q. If it had got on board it would have been known from the weight, to have contained money? - Most certainly it would.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you was a good deal surprised that you had not been told of that before; you was a good deal surprised that your crew had been so negligent? - They did not know the box was to go on board the ship; they told me a box was along side; I asked myself about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it strange they did not tell you of this before? - No, I did not think it was strange, because they did not know it was coming on board, they had seen a small box, but when they were told it was to go back for alterations, I did not think any thing of them about the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Galloway your mate? - He is, he has been with me five years.</p>

The prisoner came under the stern, about twelve o'clock at mid-day; the tide had raised the ship fifty or sixty feet, and he hailed and told us he had something for us, but he was going down the river further and he would call when the tide served to come nearer the vessel; he went away at that time down the river, and he came when the water was lower, along side, about three in the afternoon; on his coming along I asked him if he had any thing heavy in his boat; he said, there was nothing heavy in the boat, but one box which was going back, (pointing at it,) and there was some alterations he believed to be made in it, and he believed he was coming down with it in the afternoon; immediately I ordered

               <p>Court. When did the captain enquire? - Sometime before he got to Madeira.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How many things did he bring in this boat? - I cannot tell the number of things, there were several things for the ship, that this man brought.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boxes? - Only one, the letter box.</p>
               <p>Q. And he pointed particularly to another box? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you that that wanted some repairs and alterations and he believed he should be down in the afternoon, signifying there were more things coming down for your ship? - So I understood him.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are quite sure of? - So I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it the captain came on board? - He came on board at Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him you expected some more things would have come on board, but they went back for alterations? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you was a good deal disappointed, was not you? - No, being so full of business we did not think about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the last package? - It was that came in a wherry; there was another man came down, but with no packages.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a good deal surprised he did not keep his word? - I was so.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you did not tell the captain? - I did not.</p>

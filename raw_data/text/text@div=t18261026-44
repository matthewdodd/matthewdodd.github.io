            . I am a constable. On Sunday, the 15th of October, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I had just come off duty, and met Webley in Long-alley, Shoreditch, four or five hundred yards from Mr. Corys' - he was carrying a bag with two cheeses; I followed, stopped him in Angel-alley, and asked where he got them; he said he found them at the top of Cornhill - I took him to the watch-house, and found thirty eggs in his hat, and in his pocket two leaves, corresponding with a book which Mr. Cory had in his shop; Mr. Cory claimed the cheeses. I took Sawyer on the Monday, and at the second examination the Lord Mayor sent for Cornwell - an officer brought him, and he was committed.</p>

            . I am porter to a wine-merchant. On Sunday morning, the 15th of October, I saw Cornwell waiting with two persons, opposite Mr. Cory's door, from six o'clock to half-past six; when they saw me at the window Cornwell said something to the other two, and walked down the street a little way - he then returned to them, and walked away again; I saw the other two run across opposite to Corys' door - I was going out in about half an hour, and Cornwell passed me with a bundle under his arm, tied in a black handkerchief.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CORY, JUN. I am in partnership with my father - we live in Bishopsgate-street. I know the prisoners, by seeing them all walk about the street, but I have not seen them in company. These cheeses are ours - we did not miss them till Fincham brought them; we have too many to miss them, but I know we never sold them.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Cory's service. On Sunday morning, the 15th of October, about a quarter past six o'clock I opened the door - Webley and Sawyer crossed over, and came into the shop; Webley followed me down stairs, and brought up a cheese, which he gave to Sawyer; I knew them before. It was agreed they should come - they had been there the Sunday before, and I had made an agreement on Saturday with Webley, that they should come - I knew Cornwell before, but not Sawyer so well as the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came on Sunday morning? A. Webley and Sawyer. When Webley gave Sawyer the cheese he took it out, wrapped in an apron; Cornwell then came in, and I gave him a piece of butter, and twenty or thirty eggs; he wrapped the butter in a black handkerchief; Cornwell went away with them - Webley had a bag - he took two cheeses and put into it, and had thirty eggs, some in his hat - that is all they had that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of robbing your master? A. Yes, for about three Sunday mornings - I am still in his employ. I was taken up, and then mentioned this circumstance; Sawyer had never been there before - the others had been twice. I have lived a year and a half with Mr. Cory.</p>
               <p>WEBLEY's Defence. He carried the game on long before I knew him; he knew three or four more lads, and never came out of the shop without his pocket full of copper.</p>
               <p>CORNWELL's Defence. I met him on Saturday - he asked me to come down, and said he would give us anything.</p>
               <p>SAWYER'S Defence. He told us to come at half-past six o'clock; we waited opposite the shop, and he called us; he called me out of bed one night, and gave me some ham; every morning he used to bring out halfpence, and give to us to change at the shop for silver.</p>

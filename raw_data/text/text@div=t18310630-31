               <p>WILLIAM WOOLY SIMPSON. I have an office in Bucklersbury, and live at Chelsea. On the 13th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was returning from my banker's to my office; by the back of the <placeName id="t18310630-31-crimeloc171">Mansion-house</placeName>

            . I am a hair-manufacturer. About four o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a cry of Stop thief! in the Poultry; the prisoner was running as hard as he could - I went and caught hold of him; he instantly struck me in the eye - I then let go of him; he got about twenty yards further, and was secured - I have no doubt of him.</p>

            . I am under beadle of Cheap ward. I was at the bottom of the Poultry, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned round, and saw Hutchins catch hold of the prisoner; he struck him a violent blow in the eye with his fist, and I suppose the box was in that hand, for I saw dust fly - Hutchins let him go, and I saw Neale take him; I am certain of him.</p>

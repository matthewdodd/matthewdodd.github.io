            . I am an officer. I was at the Horse-guards - I saw the prisoner go up to Mr. King<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150056"></xptr>take the handkerchief from his pocket, and put it into his breeches pocket; he turned round to come away and I took hold of him; he then took it from his pocket and threw it down.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been standing with my back against the wall for ten minutes, when the officer called me, and among the thick part of the mob he picked up this handkerchief, a yard-and-half from where I stood. The prosecutor said if I would find my accomplice, he would not prosecute me; and on Thursday when a person went to him he wanted 20 l. in money; the officer has been several times times to see my wife about it.</p>

            . His wife sent for me - I went to her, she begged of me not to appear; I said I certainly should, but as I found he had not been in custody before, I should state it to the Court. The prosecutor is in a very large way of business, and he said as the prisoner was not an old offender, if he could find a person to put the amount he was bound in, into a person's hand, he would not appear. I told him it was compounding felony.</p>
               <p>MR. KING. I was not aware that it was compounding felony till the officer told me. I then would not proceed further.</p>

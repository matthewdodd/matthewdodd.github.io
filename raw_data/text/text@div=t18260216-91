            . I am foreman to Mr. Baxter - Paine worked under me. I came down the street, and knocked at my own door, when I saw the prisoner coming out of No. 279, with the basket of tools. I asked where he got them, and he said they belonged to a young man, named Johnson, who had gone to Castle-street, to dinner. I asked him to go with me to the cook-shop, which he did - I called Paine out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not he say a person gave him the tools? A. He said a person had gone out of the window, and he had taken up the tools.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce the tools and the basket, which I got at the cook-shop in Castle-street; they were laying on the floor, and when I came in Paine said, "That is the man" - I took him, and as we went to the office he said he saw a man go into the house, that he followed him, and took the tools, and was going to take them to some man in the cook-shop.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a man loitering about - I watched him into three or four houses, and saw him get into this window; I followed him, and as I was going down the kitchen stairs he was in the passage, and threw the basket of tools down. I took them up, and the witness came and said, "What do you do with them?" I said a man had taken them up, and had left them there, and he desired me to take them to the cook-shop. I had not touched them before he told me.</p>

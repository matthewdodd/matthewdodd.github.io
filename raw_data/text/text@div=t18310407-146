               <p>JAMES BOON. I live with Mr. Sadd. I was at home when the wine was brought by the prisoner and two tacklemen - the prisoner took two empty baskets out of the winecellar, and wanted to leave one in, but my young master took it out; he then came up, and told me to go down and mind the men - I went down: the prisoner said, "Put these two baskets up the flap," and I tried to do it, but they would not go up - the prisoner then took an empty basket, went into the wine-cellar with it, put two bottles in, and tied it up: I did not see what he did in the cellar, as the door shut immediately after him - he came out and tied it up; I suspected there was something in it - I went out, and told my master; the prisoner threw it up to be put into the cart, and my young master went and took it - I swear it was an empty basket when he took it into the cellar.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was no straw in the basket? A. Yes, there was a little he put in - I could not possibly swear it was my master's wine; I told the Magistrate the prisoner took the basket into the cellar, but I did not say I saw him put the wine into it - my master had been holding a candle, but he had gone up to the bar, and sent me down.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. SADD. Q. Did you speak to the other two men about the wine that was in the basket? A. I do not recollect that I did - Boon said he saw the prisoner go into the cellar with the basket, and the other two men said they would attend if they were wanted; it was the other men put the basket into the cart from the flap.</p>

            . I am the officer. I took the prisoner and the wine - there were two vintners' porters there; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, and so did the men - I took the two men, who took the wine from the prisoner, and put it into the cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the wine-cellar putting away the champaigne - Mr. Sadd was holding the light, and the two men stood alongside the binn where they suppose this wine came from; this hamper was tied because it had no binges, but who tied it I do not know - I never went out of the cellar; the porters handed the baskets out, I never touched them - I valued my situation, where I had worked eleven years, more than to do that; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070075"></xptr>into the cellar as the place was nearly up to our knees in water, and I put the basket against the door that I might see with the light where to get the wood - I came out with two pieces of wood and the basket, which I put down against the cellar-door; the two porters were in the cellar the whole time.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman in Smithfield; I met the prisoner on Monday morning, between twelve and one o'clock, with a large parcel on his shoulder; I asked him what he had got there; he said meat, and he had bought it of an acquaintance of his the other side of Blackfriars-bridge, in Cuper's-bridge; I asked him how he came so late with it; he said, he had met a friend, and he had taken him to drink with him; then he told me he was stopped by a watchman, and taken into St. Sepulchre's watch-house, and detained there some time by the constable; he told me when they found every thing safe and honest, they let him go; I called the next watchman to me, and asked him to go to the watch-house; the watchman went there, and the prisoner said he would go with him there, and they knowing nothing of the prisoner at the watch-house, nor the parcel neither, detained him; the watchman came back to me, and I took the meat to the watch-house, and delivered it to the constable of the night; he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Jones.) Q. You swore you met me with a parcel on my shoulder, and you stopped me with it, was not that parcel on the door when you came out of the box? - A. It was when I come to you; when I first came out of the box it was on your shoulder, and when you saw me come out, you threw it on a cil of a door opposite my box.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prisoner.) Q. You claimed it afterwards, and said you bought it of a friend the other side of the water? - A. I said so after I got to the watch-house.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's: I searched the prisoner at the watch-house, and took these keys from him, (producing them;) there is a latch-key and two other small common keys; I took the prisoner to the Compter; at the time I took him to the Compter, there was a crow found behind the cushion on the seat where the prisoner had been sitting; the stock of the crow corresponded with the wrench that forced the door open.

             sworn. - I was officer of the night; the prisoner at the bar was brought in by the watchman, charged with stealing this meat; I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been there from the time the prisoner had been there till the time you came back? - A. No. (Produces the meat.) I asked him how he came by it; he told me he bought it of Mr. Druce, at Cuper's-bridge; I asked him how he came to be so late; he said, he had been drinking; I asked him how he came by such a quantity; he said, he meant to let a friend have a part of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Do you know that meat? - A. I do, I know every joint; I lodged this meat in my slaughter-house about half past eleven o'clock on Saturday night; it was taken from my slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought it of a person of the name of Druce; I took it of him, thinking it might be of use to my family; I was thinking of salting the legs, which they do in my country which is as useful as any thing else. As to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050018"></xptr>crow, I never saw it in my life, nor was there any cushion on the seat in the watch-house; it is not common for watch-houses to have cushions on the seat.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prisoner.) Where is the man you bought the meat of? - A. I sent for the man; he lives at Cuper's-bridge, but he is not here now.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

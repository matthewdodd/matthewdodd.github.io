            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I was at home - the key of the trunk was in the table-drawer; I did not miss the trunk till the property was brought up stairs to me in the sitting-room - they had been picked up in the street between eleven and one o'clock; I then went to the bed-room, and the trunk was gone - it was found in the back-kitchen, broken open and empty; a great many things have not been found - the value of the whole is nearly 3l.; I know these articles were in the trunk at eleven o'clock - I had not seen the prisoner in the room; he could be there without my hearing him, as it does not communicate with the front-room.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. On the 10th of June, a young man came and took a lodging; the lady on the second-floor was always desirous of his earning 6d. - though he has been a bad boy; she got him a job to fetch a box and pair of trousers from a linen-draper in Bishopsgate-street; he brought the box and took it up to the second-floor, by Mrs. Wells' bed-room; this was between eleven and one o'clock - after that, I saw him sitting in the back-kitchen, for I would not have him in the shop; in about ten minutes the young man came and inquired for his trousers - I called him twice - he did not answer; I went and found him in the yard - I was looking at the gentleman, and he ran by me through the shop; his jacket projected out - I ran after him - the dust blew in my face; he ran by me - I saw a handkerchief and some white linen in his bosom; I said "Where are you going?" he ran into One Swan-yard, and I after him - I fell over a child, and he dropped part of this linen; he ran on to the other end of the yard which leads to Petticoat-lane, and I lost him - I did not see him again till the 31st of August, when he was at Hatton-garden; I brought the things back to Mrs. Wells, who claimed them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

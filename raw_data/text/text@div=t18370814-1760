                  </hi>. I am a boot maker, and live in Bell-yard, Lincoln's Inn. On the night of the 11th of July, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was walking along Jewin-street, and I felt something at my pocket—I turned round and my handkerchief was gone—I found the prisoner quite close behind me—I seized him, and told him he had picked my pocket, as there had not been time for any body else to do it—he denied it, and asked me to search him—I found it about a yard from him in the road—he got away—I pursued him—he fell down, and I secured him, and in going along he begged me to forgive him—this is my handkerchief—he was the only person near enough to take it—there was no other person near me—there was another person at a distance, who I suspect was connected with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>, I was in the road when he turned round—there was another man close to him—I never took his handkerchief, and never was behind him—I did not ask forgiveness, but said I was entirely innocent.</p>

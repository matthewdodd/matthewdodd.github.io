               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Lomas. I am an <rs id="t17580222-20-viclabel103" type="occupation">oil-man</rs>.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no wife?</p>
               <p>Lomas. No, I have not. About the beginning of last December I employ'd the prisoner to make me six-shirts, after which I soon set out into the country, and returned in about six weeks after. Then I went to the prisoner to know if she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220017"></xptr> made my linen. She said she had made three of them. I desired she would bring them, that I might see how they were made to sit. She seemed to tremble much, and said she could not bring them till the morrow. She not bringing them to her word. I sent my servant for them, but she was not to be found. At last she was brought. I told her I perceived by her behaviour that she had pawned them, and if she had, and would take me to the pawnbroker's, I would fetch them out, and forgive her. She took me to Mr. Brown, a pawnbroker on Snow-Hill, and asked for two shirts that she had pawn'd there, which were produced, and I took them out. Then she took me to a second pawnbroker, and asked for two more. I took them out. Then she took me to a third, and asked for one, which I took out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they pawn'd for?</p>
               <p>Lomas. I paid, I think, three shillings for the two first, four shillings for the other two, and three shillings and six pence, or four shillings for the single one. I said, what must I do for the sixth shirt? She said, she would consider what she had done with that. I went again to Mr. Brown, and desired him to examine his books, to see what he had taken in of her, which he did, and found many things; among which were five shirts more of mine that I had missed, but have not charged her with taking them. (He produced the seventy-five yards of linen she was charged with, three pieces of twenty-five yards each. ) She had cut two of them into a variety of pieces, but one was whole, which I can swear to. She acknowledged them all to be mine.</p>

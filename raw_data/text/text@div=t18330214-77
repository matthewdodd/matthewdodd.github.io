On Sunday morning,, the 10th of February, between two and three o'clock I was going through Fitzroy-square - I had left work at eight o'clock the evening before; I was sober; the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to go with her - I said I was going home, and did not wish to be bothered with her; she followed me up <placeName id="t18330214-77-crimeloc425">Brook-street</placeName>

I gave her in charge - she denied it, but at the station she gave it up, and said I gave it her by mistake for 1s.</p>

             (Police-constable, S 153). The prosecutor called me, and charged the prisoner with taking a sovereign from his waistcoat-pocket; she said she did not, and had not her hand in his pocket; but at the station she pulled it out, and said she thought it was a shilling - I found on her 1s. 6d. in silver, and 6 1/2d. in copper.</p>

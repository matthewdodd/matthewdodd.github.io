On Saturday, the 4th of December, about eleven o'clock at night, I was at Jones' wine-vaults, at the corner of Plumtree-street; the prisoner, who was a stranger, came in, and asked me to treat her - I and two or three more were together; we gave her a glass of gin - I was sober: I had not been drinking - I went with her to a room on the first floor in <placeName id="t18301209-134-crimeloc766">George-street, St. Giles'</placeName>

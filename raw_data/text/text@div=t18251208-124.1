On the morning of the 11th of November, between seven and eight o'clock, I went up to her room, and found the bed and bolster rolled up - two sheets, a counterpane, blanket, and quilt, were gone - they were a part of the furniture I had let to her with the room - I saw her afterwards at the watch-house, and asked her about the things - she at first said she knew nothing about them, and then she said she was very sorry, and told where she had pawned them. The tickets were given to the watch-house-keeper.</p>

I was clerk to John Wyndham in March last—I have been writing for the houses of Lords and Commons since, till the Session closed—I did not go with the prisoners to see the agreement signed—I used to go to the Fleet to see a friend, and was recommended to Mr. Creswell by my friend to draw up the agreement—this is my hand-writing—it is a negotiation between Creswell and signed—I did not know Wheeler before—I do not know for what term they took the premises—I drew up the agreement from a rough statement given me by Mr. Creswell—there was no term mentioned in it.</p>
               <p>(The agreement being read, was dated November 26, 1836, by which Wheeler agreed to take the premises of Mr. Creswell, at the rent of £60. per annum; it described Wheeler as living at Shepherd's bush.)</p>

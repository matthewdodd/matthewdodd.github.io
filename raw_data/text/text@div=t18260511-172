On the 18th of April the two prisoners came to the shop together, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and asked to look at some Irish linen - they looked at some, and I turned to get some more - my back was not turned more than a minute. Vallance then bought two yards of linen; they left the shop, and I missed a piece of printed cotton from the counter; I knew it had been there an hour before, but I thought it might have been removed. I went out, and brought them back - they had got about twenty yards. I brought them into the shop, and Bell dropped this piece of print from her, which I had seen on the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BELL. Q. Was there not a shopman at the door, hanging up prints, and some were on the floor? A. No; he was on the steps, hanging up prints, but they were not on the floor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What size shop is it? A. It is a large shop - and the print was taken from the further end. - There were only two articles near the print, which made me remark it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>BELL's Defence. I met my fellow prisoner in the street - she asked me to go with her to buy some linen. I never saw any cotton - the man came and tapped us on the shoulder, and said he had lost something - he laughed. We went back, and some cotton was on the floor.</p>
               <p>VALLANCE's Defence. I asked her to show me a linen-draper's-shop - we went to the further end of the shop; there were several pieces of linen.</p>
               <p>HENRY BROWN re-examined. Q. How near were they together when they returned? A. About two yards from each other, but I know it fell from Bell; a neighbour said"Look out," and I saw it fall from her - I had hold of her arm.</p>

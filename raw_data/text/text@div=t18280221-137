Morris came out; the prosecutor fell upon her, and two or three more upon them. I went up and saw Cooper strike the prosecutor; he struck him again slightly - I rushed in between them and took Cooper, and my brother watchman took Mooris - they were taken to the watch-house, but nothing was found on them.</p>

I went into the passage, and there I saw the three prisoners in custody, and heard Harding say he would a bl - y sight sooner be lagged than he would split, meaning he would be transported rather than tell of the transaction.</p>

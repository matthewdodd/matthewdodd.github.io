                  </hi>. I live at Cheltenham. In June last I was staying at Exmouth, in Devonshire.—On the 25th June I sent a letter to my sister from Exmouth, enclosing in it two small notes and a sovereign, which I wrapped in a piece of tissue-paper—these are the notes that I enclosed, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) and it was in such paper as this that I enclosed the sovereign—this is the envelope in which I put them—it is my handwriting—it is ad<lb></lb>dressed to "Miss Ebhart, Chelsea College, London"—I sealed it, and gave it to Thyrza Tar, the servant, to put into the post—my sister's names are Rhoda Mary Ebhart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in the General Post-office. The prisoner was letter-carrier there, in June last—on the morning of the 26th June, I was in attendance at the time of the arrival of the Exmouth bag, which was between half-past five and seven o'clock—I opened the bag, and deposited the letters on the table—in the course of business they would be carried from that table to another, to be stamped—it was part of the prisoner's duty to take them to the stamper's table to be stamped—we opened twenty-six bags at that table—five persons were employed to carry the letters—the prisoner was one of them—he was on duty that morning—I saw him employed in carrying letters to the stamping-table.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the constables attending the General Post<lb></lb>office. On Friday morning, the 26th June, I was standing at the basement of the building, to see what was going on in the water-closets; this model properly represents the arch, within which the water-closets are, except that these round holes are a narrow wire grating, so that nobody can see that anybody</p>

               <p>is looking through—a gas-light throws a light over the whole of the water<lb></lb>closets, and I could see everything that was going on—Peak was at the other grating—I had been on the watch for an hour and a half, ever since half-past six, and about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner come to the second closet di<lb></lb>rectly opposite me—the room was perfectly light, I could see everything—I saw him enter the closet, undo his things, and sit on the seat—he remained there a short time, and then put his hands behind him into his coat-pocket—he drew from his coat pocket a small piece of writing-paper, which he dropped in front of him down the hole, between his legs, without making any use of it—he placed his hands into his coat pocket again, kept feeling there some little time, as if feeling for something, and then he brought in front of him a piece of white paper rolled up small, in the shape of coin, he unfolded the rolls several times—I saw it was very fine paper—I then gave a signal to Peak—he took my position, and I went round to the prisoner, who was then in the act of putting his things up—I laid hold of him, and asked what he had put dots the watercloset—he said, "Nothing but what I have been using"—I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket found 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a few loose coppers in his trowsers pocket, and a sovereign loose in his left hand breast coat pocket—I found a small canvass bag in his left hand trowsers pocket, tied up closely, containing a sovereign, and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—a plumber was sent for, the water<lb></lb>closet was opened, and I saw him take from the closet, from the seat from which the prisoner rose, this piece of tissue-paper, from the basement, and also this letter from the same place—there were no marks of use on them—one has the appearance of having been used—it was in halves, but they are put together—part of the half seems to have been used—he certainly did not use the part that he put down in front of him—the tissue-paper was in one strip at the time it was found, but it has got split—I told the plumber when he came, to look for a fine piece of tissue-paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, employed by the General Post-office. On the morning of the 26th of June I was called to examine the water-closet—it acts of itself—the moment the weight of a person sits era it, the seat jumps one inch, opens a valve, and water flows into the box at the bottom of the cistern, and when the person rises from the seat, the water rushes into the basin—I examined the water-closet in question, and found two portions of a letter, an envelope, and a small piece of tissue-paper on the surface of the water—the basin does not contain water, but the trap under neath contains about three quarts—there is no bottom to the basin—I took the papers out, and handed them to the officer—there were several pieces of brown paper besides in the trap.</p>

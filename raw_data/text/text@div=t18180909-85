            . I am cashier in Messrs. Spooners' hanking-house. I was standing at Messrs. Coutt's door, in the Strand about half past twelve o'clock; I saw the prisoner pass and repass two or three times. I then saw Mr. Currey come by and the prisoner close upon him, and a young man behind the prisoner. Just as the prosecutor came to Norfolk-street the prisoner quickened his pace, got close up to him, and got the pocket-book out of his pocket; his companion joined him in Norfolk-street, and they turned into Howard-street. I informed Mr. Currey, we pursued and overtook them in Howard-street. I collared the prisoner, and told him he had something that did not belong to him, he strongly denied it, I said it was useless, for I would swear that I saw him do it. I took him to the watch-house, and sent for a constable, he then took the pocket-book from under his waistcoat, put it on a table, fell on his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>JAMES FLETCHER. I had the prisoner in custody; he escaped from me, and ran down Swan-yard, while I was pursuing him somebody got the pocket-book out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. CURREY re-examined. The pocket-book produced by the prisoner at the watch-house, I am certain, was that which I had lost.</p>

On the evening of the 3d of September I called at the Coach and Horses, King-street, Westminster; there I drank gin and water with three or four friends; from there we went to Charles-street, Westminster; there we had punch; we waited till half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get drunk there. - A. No. Then I proceeded home to Pimlico. I met with the prisoner, I went home with her to <placeName id="t18070916-86-crimeloc449">Perkin's Rents, Westminster</placeName>

               <p>- SKINNER. I am an officer of Queen-square. I apprehended the prisoner in Parker's Rents; I understood afterwards it was not her room. I searched in her pockets, I found a one pound note, two seven shilling pieces, twenty-four shillings and a sixpence in silver; I stripped her, and two twenty pound bank of England notes dropped on the floor, and a ten pound note. I asked her what she had done with the other ten pound note, she said she knew nothing about it, nor did she know how she came by these notes.</p>

            . When the woman was apprehended she said she had fetched her things out of pawn out of part of the serjeant's notes. I found a quantity of wearing apparel in her apartment, bundled up; she said she brought them from Mr. Sherrinan's, a pawnbroker in Stretton Ground.</p>

When we came home he gave me a shilling to get something to drink; it was too late then to get something; in the morning, as soon as I could, I went out, about half past four, and when I returned the prosecutor was gone; he gave me a two pound note for being with me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you give her a two pound note. A. No; I do not believe I had one; I received all the money at Messrs. Drummonds.</p>

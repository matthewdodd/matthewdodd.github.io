            . I am between seventeen and eighteen years old. About nine o'clock in the evening of the 28th of September last, I was returning from Charing-cross, where I had been to send a parcel of printed papers for my master by the stage coach to Tunbridge, which they would not take in without my paying twopence, and which I had not got to pay. On my return in <placeName id="t17731020-6-crimeloc31">Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields</placeName>

I said I have nothing, only a few printed papers; he said he must have them; I said he should not; he said he would, and took hold of the parcel with both his hands; he pulled and I pulled, but he pulling too tight I let them go; upon which the man ran away with them; he used an oath when he said he must have them; I cannot remember what the oath was; he ran into Lincoln's-inn-fields, and up the side of the fields towards Queen-street; I saw him just turn the corner; then I ran and cried stop thief! I saw him about thirty yards before me; when I came to that corner, he was stopped by one Paterson, who was at the upper end of the field with some chairs upon his back. He was dressed in white breeches, a white waistcoat, and a scarlet coat: it was a darkish night, nevertheless I saw his face, so that I know his face; I saw no other person with a scarlet coat on; I saw his face distinctly; I know him to be the man.</p>

            . About half after nine at night, the 28th of September, I was coming from Queen-street with some chairs upon my back; I heard a cry of stop thief! I put down the chairs and saw a man in a soldier's dress running towards me; about ten yards before he came to me he threw away the bundle; I stopped him; he had a red coat and white waistcoat on; (looks at the prisoner); I am sure he is the man I took. There was a gentleman that I desired to take up the bundle, which he did, and delivered to me; I have had it ever since; this is it; (producing it); the boy immediately came up.</p>

I came to town in September, on a Sunday night, by the steam-packet; and on the next Thursday I wanted to go to St. George's in the East, but being a stranger, I did not know the way - I met with the prisoner about three o'clock in the afternoon, as I was looking in at a window; she came, and asked me to give her a glass of porter; I said I would, on condition of her showing me the way to St. George's in the East - she said she was going that way, and we walked on for two or three hundred yards; she then said, "Stop, I have to call in here;" she went to a house, and told me to come in; I went in, and then she asked me for her glass of porter; I gave her some - when we had drank it, there was a knocking at the door; the prisoner got up, and said, "For shame of yourself," and she went out of the door - I went to go out, but I found I was fastened in the house; I pulled the door, and with difficulty I got out, but the prisoner was gone; there were two women standing in the yard; they asked what I wanted - I said I came with a lady, who was going to show me the way; one of them said, "I think she has fleeced you;" I felt for my pocket-book, which had 1100l. in it; that was safe; but I missed thirty sovereigns out of my pocket, all but one half-sovereign - I gave information, and she was taken the following morning; I had taken out all my money to give her sixpence to get the beer - I had only one sixpence; the rest was sovereigns and half-sovereigns - she saw what I had; there was a bed in the room, and we sat upon it - I was there probably a quarter of an hour; I had been anxious to go, and she was anxious to keep me; I did not perceive her hand in my pocket; I had been tipsy in the course of the day, but I was a great deal better then - I am quite sure my gold was safe when I took out the money, and gave her the sixpence.</p>

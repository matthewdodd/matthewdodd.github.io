            . I am a Police-constable. I came up to the prosecutor at the corner of White Horse-yard; he said he had lost all the money out of his pocket - I took the prisoner, and searched her at the station-house; I found a half-crown and 4 1/2d. on her - the prosecutor gave me this half-crown, but no halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man wished me to go up a court - I refused; he attempted to force me - I resisted; he then said he had been robbed, and I was taken - the money taken from me was my own; he took half a crown from his own pocket, and put it into the Policeman's hand.</p>

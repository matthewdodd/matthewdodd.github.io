            . I live in Coleman-street. The beadle, and one Chapman, came to me upon the 3d of July, to know if I would take any goods into my warehouse; they said, it was for Pixley, who was standing by them; he said, the goods were to stay a few days to sell them. I told him, I could not spare the warehouse for more than a day or two. They were taken out of my warehouse by virtue of a search warrant.</p>

               <p>- Thorpe. I am a coach-harness-maker. Last Monday was a week, the 3d of July, I was in Fleet-market, Mr. Pixley came and spoke to me; he said, there was a woman in Moorfields, had given him a bill of sale, he wanted two people to witness it, and he would give them half a guinea a-piece; he said, the woman was gone away, there was two indictments against her, and he was afraid people were going to take the goods away; he asked if I would witness it; I told him, yes; we went to the Bull and Garter; there was another man, who would not sign it; we came to the door, out of the house, and Reeves came up to us; after some little time, he asked him if he would sign it; he then asked me, if I would; he agreed to witness it; it was signed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120026"></xptr>

I asked him, if it was Mrs. Carter's writing, he said, no; she is gone away, and will never come again, I want to secure myself, to put the bill of sale in force; he said, if you will go with me, I will treat you with a coach to put this bill of sale in force; he called in a street, and took two constables to keep the peace. I saw them all in the house together; I was not there when they entered; I heard the daughter say, it was a bad affair, and it was not their mother's writing.

            . I am a constable. Mr. Pixley was a customer of mine. About the middle of March, I was talking with him at a public house; he said, he was under misfortunes; then he said, he had been arrested upon a false debt on Mrs. Carter's account; he wanted me to be bail; I did not care to do it; he said, the debt was small, and his father was to be one bail, and that he had a bill of sale upon her goods; the debt was six pounds or upwards. I was bail with his father on account of his having the bill of sale, to prevent us coming into trouble. After being his bail, the action was removed to the court of King's bench, and back again. I talked to him about it; he said, he had the bill of sale to indemnify us all; I kept myself easy till the 3d of July, then he came to a public-house in my neighbourhood, and desired me, as a constable, to keep the peace, while the bill of sale was put in execution. I told him, not to be in too great a hurry; he said, he heard she was moving her goods, and they would be gone by Thursday. I declin'd, as I was concerned, and desired my brother constable to go; he said, he had got two people at the top of Great Bell-alley, who were the prisoners, Reeves and Thorpe. We came to Mrs. Carter's, Mr. Pixley knocked at the door, one of the daughters opened it: he stood at the door to keep the door open; I came in after Pixley, then the rest of the people who were with us: we went into the parlour; the daughter asked what was the matter; Pixley replied, matter enough, he would not go to jail for her mother. The daughter seemed much flurried; I told her to be quiet, he was come in upon a bill of sale. I asked Pixley where the bill of sale was; and saw it was witnessed by Reeves, and it was signed

            . I had it to peruse; I suspected it was a forged bill, when the children made such work about it. After the bill of sale was read, Pixley went out, and brought in Mr. Swaine, the broker; when he did that, the daughters resisted, and said, it was a forged bill of sale, it was not their mother's hand-writing. Mr. Swaine asked me if I knew the mother; I said, I had seen her. but had no particular acquaintance with her; he asked if there was any particular acquaintance between Pixley and the mother; I told him, I laboured under an execution through their affairs: he then proceeded to take an inventory of no more goods than the value in the bill of sale. Mr. Pixley would not consent; afterwards he did consent to it; and after that, it was to be for the whole. I then told him, if he took more, he would commit a felony; then again, they agreed to take to the bill of sale.</p>

               <p>I think I have been acquainted with Mrs. Carter near a year and half, or two years, during which time when she had been in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120027"></xptr> trouble, she has sent for me, and I have assisted her with money several times when she was in custody and indicted; I bailed her out of Wood-street Counter: then she was indicted for keeping a disorderly house, I paid the money in court; I then took a house for her in Aldermanbury; I paid seven guineas for the earnest of that house for six months: she could not stay there long, for the house was such a great nuisance, that the neighbours all complained, and the girls made such an uproar they could not stay; she then applied to me to look out for another house: I did and got her one in Sommerset street, Whitechapel; she did not stay there above a quarter, before I was arrested for the rent; she then desired me to get her another house, which I did. The house she came from in Moorfields, I took it, and paid six guineas; I then told her, I was a good deal uneasy, that I had advanced so much money for her and had no security; she said, she would give me any security I could desire, that I was the greatest friend she ever had in the world; My wife was in company with her, and said, it was odd, she did not give me security; she came in two days after and gave me this bill of sale, though I had no design to put it in execution; she signed the bill of sale the 12th of March last, it was not witnessed when she wrote it.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of July, about ten or eleven o'clock, I went into the Bull and Garter, in Fleet Market, I met Mr. Thorpe and Mr. Pixley; I never saw him before, he said he had got a bill of sale; he asked me if I would go in; Thorpe, I, and he, went together to Moorfields; I stayed there till the goods were all taken away.</p>

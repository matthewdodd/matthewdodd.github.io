               <p>Q. When did you hear of them - A. Some few days afterwards. I saw them afterwards, in Worship-street office. They were then dead; and the pigs that I saw at the police office were the sow-pigs that I lost from my field. I am sure of it. I have no doubt upon it.</p>

            . I am a labourer to Mr. Ashton.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know these two sow-pigs of Mr. Ashton - A. I did. I fed them from the time they were pigged and reared up, and lost. On Saturday, the 18th of December, I saw them about ten o'clock. They were feeding upon turnips with the beasts. They afterwards were ordered to be turned out into the Spa-fields. The Spa-fields is the place they usually used to be in. There were three. About twelve o'clock one of the sows came home wild. I thought somebody might have been dogging her, as they often do, in the field. On Sunday I went in search of the two sows. I did not find them. On the Monday I went with Bishop, and found them at the Basing-house, in Kingsland-road. The two sows were killed, and hanged up. I knew the sows again by the marks in the skin. The marks in the skin remained.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had they been killed then - A. Yes, and the bristles scalded off. The marks remained across the shoulders. I knew they were Mr. Ashton's property. I brought them up from their birth. I assisted the officer, and we brought them to the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You bred three - A. Yes, They came from three different sows.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular marks were they - A. The water does not take the marks out, but the marks were across the shoulder, and down the legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Must every pig that had that mark be your master's pigs - A. No. I would not swear that. I knew they were my master's pigs. I can swear that very well. I knew them by the features, and by the four feet that were not scalded; and the ring was not cut out of the sow's nose; and if it had I should have known the sow. One of the sows was knock-knee'd; and I knew it by the features.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the features - A. There is a difference in that, as well as a man. The large sow I knew by the toes, as well as the knock-knee. The four feet were all white.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you examined upon the trial of Rayston - A. Yes. I spoke to them upon that occasion.</p>
               <p>SHEDRAOH JACKSON. Q. You were examined upon the trial of Rayson - A. Yes. I was ostler then at the Basing-house in Kingsland-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Kelly - A. Yes. He has a slaughtering-house in the Basing-yard. He rented it of my master.</p>
               <p>Q.What is Kelly - A. A carcase, and retail Dutcher.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the Basing-house on Saturday the 18th of December, 1810 - A. I stood against the gate. I saw two sow-pigs drove into Mr. Kelly's stable. There were no other pigs with them at the time. They were driven in by Rayson, who was convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Rayson before with Kelly - A. Once before; about a fortnight before. On the same evening they were killed. Dexter and Kelly was killing them.</p>
               <p>Q.Having seen this did you communicate it to your master - A. Yes, directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the police-office - A. No. Mr. Armstrong sent to me from his house. I communicated to him what I had seen, and on Monday, Bishop took me with him to Mr. Aston's. I then told him what I had seen. I asked him, whether he had lost any pigs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Ashton describe to you the marks of his pigs - A. Yes. He said, they were black and white.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that the marks that Mr. Ashton described, corresponded with the marks of the pigs you had seen - A. Yes, I did. Then Dexter was taken to the office, and the pigs likewise, and Mr. Ashton spoke to his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pigs at the office afterwards - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were they the same pigs that you saw taken into the yard alive - A. They were the same pigs, and they were the same pigs that I saw hang up, in the slaughter-house, dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there the same marks that you saw upon the pigs at the office, as upon those that were drove into the yard - A. They were similar the same. The black mark was visible then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Kelly after that day - A. No; not after the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Kelly ever come back to the slaughterhouse - A. No, not as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue at the Basing-house after the Saturday - A. I left it last Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, from the Saturday that you have been speaking of until last Christmas, did you ever see Kelly - A. No.</p>
               <p>- DEXTER. I am a butcher. I live just by the Basing-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Rayson - A. Never before that time. I never spoke to him in my life before. On Saturday, the 18th of December, I saw him about two o'clock in the afternoon. I was coming down Kingsland-road. I was employed by old Mr. Kelly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for - A. I saw Rayson drive the two sow-pigs into the Basing-yard. He employed me to kill them, the same as you or any other gentleman did. I cannot say any more about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was young Kelly at the time - A. I suppose about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he in the yard - A. He came down Kingsland-road along with me. I do not know whether he did not go to his father.</p>
               <p>Q. Who dressed the pigs - A. I dressed the pigs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010066"></xptr> Mr. Kelly and I killed them both together, and afterwards we dressed them together. Mr. Kelly knocked it down to a certainty, and I stuck it.</p>
               <p>Q. How dare you to prevaricate in that way - A. That is the truth.</p>
               <p>COURT. I expect you to tell the whole truth - A. That is the whole truth that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not. Now, sir, tell the whole truth that you know - A. Please you, my lord, there is so many people come into a common slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you do not know whether Kelly was present when the pigs were dressed - A. He was, to be sure. I told you so. I asked him to assist me. Nobody employed me but the man that is convicted. I know nothing about the pigs, no more than you. Kelly knocked down one of them. I asked him to lend me a hand. That is all I know He knew about them to my certain knowledge, as I stand here.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bought them - A. Who bought them!</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Who bought them - A. I cannot tell who bought them, because every thing was taken out of the slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, they were driven into the yard. Who bought them before they were put into the slaughter-house. Who paid you for killing them - A. I said to the man, leave the money with Mrs. Kelly, in case you be absent when I have killed them. Mrs. Kelly gave the money to my wife. I received no money. I was not there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you present when the money was delivered - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You never saw Rayson before that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him he was driving some pigs down Kingsland-road - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which he drove into this place, which is a common slaughter-house - A. I did not see him drive them into the slaughter-house. I saw him drive them into that yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did other butchers come there, and butcher in a small way - A. Yes, as I have.</p>
               <p>Q. When the pigs were driven into the yard, you say, young Kelly was not there - A. I know that he was coming down Kingsland-road along with me. I had been at work for his father ever since three o'clock in the morning. I was employed by Rayson, and nobody else. I was in the habit of assisting Kelly, and he me, when we were employed in any business whatever. It was by my desire that he knocked down one of the pigs. Rayson employed me to kill the pigs, and nobody else. I said, I would not dress them, unless I was paid for it. This I said in the open street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing done about selling these pigs at all - A. Not a word at all from Rayson to Kelly. I never heard one single syllable about buying in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Kelly - A. Ever since he was a child. Twenty years, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. You kill for his father - A. Yes. I had been killing for his father that day. I had worked for his father a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the young man was in embarassed circumstances at that time - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was out of the way sometime before, on account of debt - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he absent himself then on account of debt - A. He came home again shortly. His father settled his debts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he has been at home since the time that Rayson brought these pigs - A. When he lived over the water, the second time, I know nothing about.</p>
               <p>Q.You do not know when he ceased to appear there - A. No, I do not, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, about this money that was left with Mrs. Kelly, did you see that money - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed from Rayson to Mrs. Kelly, or from Mrs. Kelly, to your wife, you know nothing of - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that you told Mrs. Kelly to pay your wife - A. I did. I told Rayson to leave the money with Mrs. Kelly, provided he should be out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you slaughter the pigs - A. It might be four o'clock in the afternoon. I cannot tell what time it might be when I had done.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you kill a pig for a man he takes it away, does not he - A. It is left there, until a proper time to take them away. I did not know whether the man would come, and take them away.</p>
               <p>Q.When you kill for another man, does he leave it there or take it away - A. He comes and takes it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Rayson call for this - A. Not as I know of. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q.When was Rayson taken - A. I think the Tuesday night following the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q.Then the pigs were not fetched away - A. They were taken away by Mr. Bishop and Mason.</p>
               <p>Q. When did young Kelly leave the place - A. I cannot tell you that. I saw him on the Sunday, as the pigs were killed on the Saturday. I have not seen him until lately since.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been upon the spot since - A. I never saw him since, until last Saturday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he hold any conversation with you before he went away - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call upon him - A. No.</p>

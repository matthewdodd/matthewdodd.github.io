            . On the sixth of Feb. instant, between the' hours of eight and nine at night, I was putting a letter into the post-office, in the <placeName id="t17590228-17-crimeloc133">Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He was near the coffee-house door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body between you and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No: I saw him take a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket; upon that I held out my arm to take hold of him; he seeing that, endeavoured to escape me, and got down the Fleet-market, and at the same time flung down the handkerchief towards the foot way; I laid hold of him and held him fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at that time what sort of a handkerchief it was.</p>
               <p>Johnson. That was impossible for me to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it appear like?</p>
               <p>Johnson. It appeared as a thing like a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in his hand?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I did, and saw him fling it out of his hand; I called to the gentleman who was just by, and said, Sir, you have had your pocket picked; he instantly turned about, immediately a woman stooped down and took up the handkerchief; the gentleman with an oath, said, it is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He is a recruiting officer belonging to the army. A handkerchief produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the same handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Johnson. It appears to be the same as far as I can say: it was produced before the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He asked me what I meant, when I laid hold on him; and when we came into the Watch-house, there he denied the taking of it, and was very saucy with his tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever own it?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No: he continually denied it while I was with him.</p>

            . Mr. Johnson, that has given his evidence, came with one Captain Daniel to the Watch-house with the prisoner; there Mr. Johnson charged him with taking a handkerchief out of Captain Daniel's pocket; Captain Daniel came before my Lord-Mayor the next day, and swore to this handkerchief, that is here produced, to be his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Captain Daniel?</p>
               <p>Cusbee. He is gone to the West of England, a recruiting.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Are you sure you saw the prisoner's hand in the Captain's pocket?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I am certain of it, as I am that I now see your Lordship; and saw him take something out and fling it on the ground; which I have all the reason in the world to believe to be the handkerchief, which the Captain swore to before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had made half a holiday, and had been over the water to drink along with a friend; I was at the top of Ludgate-hill, coming down towards the New-market; there came a parcel of people and said, I had picked a gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief and threw it down: I never touched the gentleman.</p>

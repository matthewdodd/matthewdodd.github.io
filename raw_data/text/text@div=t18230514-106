The handkerchief was taken in a moment; I could not see by which of them, but saw it come from the child's neck all at once, and saw it in possession of Rooney, took him five or six yards from the child, and found the handkerchief in his bosom. Thompson and Goodhall secured the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Rooney was not with them at first - A. No. I am sure the handkerchief was never thrown down. I saw him put it in his bosom.</p>

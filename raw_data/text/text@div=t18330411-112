Kipping informed me he had lost this bale about a quarter to eleven o'clock; I was at work in Jewin-crescent, saw the prisoner run into a yard, and flag down the bale behind a gate, and then he tried to pull the gate too - he went and beckoned to a person dressed like a gentleman, and said, "Come along with it," and he (the prisoner) took it away; I went across the street and told my master I was sure they had not come by it honestly - I was not present when the prisoner was secured; I saw him in custody the same day.</p>

In Consequence of information I followed the prisoner till he got into Monkwell-street; there was another man, more of a gentleman than himself; I think he suspected we were following him, and turned short round a corner - the prisoner popped into a public-house with the truss, and the other we lost in a moment; I went in and took the prisoner - I heard the truss fall on the floor of the public-house before I got in; I asked him where he got the truss - he said he found it; I went out to look for the other, but lost him - when I came back the prisoner said the gentleman put it on his back and wanted him to carry it, and told him to go into the public-house and have some beer; he said he was to carry it with the gentleman - he did not say where.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I put it on the table, and told you I was ordered to carry it by a gentleman, who was just gone down the street. Witness. I swear it was on the taproom floor.</p>

I went to St. Luke's workhouse at a quarter to eleven o'clock, to take my wife some tea and sugar, and as I came round Jewin-crescent, to inquire at Mr. Warner's for work, a gentleman said, "Will you carry this parcel for me?" I wished to earn a shilling, and said Yes - he said, "Take it up that gateway for a few minutes, till I come to you;" which I did - he then came, and said "Bring it along;" and in Monkwell-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110057"></xptr>he said, "Go and get a pint of beer and I will follow you;" in two minutes the Policeman came and took me.</p>

            . I am the keeper of the Bengal warehouse at the East India House.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of this warehouse?</p>
               <p>Corbet. It is solely appropriated for the reception of prohibited goods, because the crown does not suffer any other goods to be mixed with them. By prohibited goods are understood all goods that are painted or stained, and wrought silks; they are received into the warehouse, are shewn there to any buyers, and when sold are delivered to the buyers; from thence they are sold by auction, which all the companies goods are, which by act of parliament are sold at the East India House, by inch of candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the kind of warehouse that all buyers have access to at proper hours?</p>
               <p>Corbet. Yes; from eight in the morning till two at noon; buyers or not buyers have access there; it is a common public show; samples are shewn of some goods; indeed all these particular goods are shewn open in chests; but these that were stole never had been shewn. The warehouses are open during the times of sale, which are in March and September, but are constantly open for reception from the ships and delivery to the buyers. I was informed on the 29th of December, that this warehouse had been broke open; upon examination I found that in the chest of bandannos, which are spotted handkerchiefs; under the No. 19 was invoiced 200; they were all gone. In No. 6, the same kind of goods, invoiced 138 pieces, 46 lost; of silk lungee romalls, which are a check handkerchief, No. 8, invoiced 200 pieces, lost 198; new o malls, they are a check handkerchief, a new fabrick, No. 17, invoiced 200, lost 184; in the whole 628 pieces lost; there were invoiced upon the whole 738; there are 110 remaining, that brings the loss to make up the full account of the invoice.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of the pieces?</p>
               <p>Corbet. 246 pieces of bandanno which run about 1700 yards, the value of them at 20 s. a piece (they sold at the company's sales from 20 s. to 28 s.); the romalls I value at 30 s. they sold at the company's sale at 34 s. 6 d. the value in the whole is about 800 l. The company's resident at Bengal puts a ticket into the chest, of the contents of the chest; these two tickets (producing them) were found in the warehouse; they exactly correspond with the invoice of those chests.</p>

            . I am a king's officer, and attend at the warehouse in the India-house; the warehouse goes all round the leather market at Leadenhall. I left the warehouse on the 24th of December, about a quarter after two o'clock; we never attend in an afternoon: there is a stair case goes up into the warehouse from Leadenhall-street; there is a lock of the company's at the bottom of the stairs; there is a door on the middle of the stairs, of which the Company has a lock and the king a lock; there is a door at the top of the stairs, which has the company's lock, and there are two locks more before you can come to where the goods were taken from; I saw the outside locks fastened; the folding doors on the outside had not been unlocked some time; they are only open to receive goods from shipping; the buyers go up stairs at another door; there are two other doors besides; we generally look at them before we leave the warehouse; on the 24th I locked the doors, and tried them and found them safe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to the warehouse again?</p>
               <p>Mason. On the 29th at eight o'clock as usual. I saw the gunnies of these chests cut, and the boards wrenched off; gunnies are a coarse cloth put over the chest; I put my hand into one chest, and there were but two lungee romalls remaining; I saw the ticket that is put into the chest at India; the next chest had nothing in it; the next had I think about twelve or thirteen pieces of new romalls; the fourth was a chest of bandannoes; there seemed to be a good many out of it, I cannot justly tell how much might be taken out of it. I found one ticket in one of the chests and I left it there. All the goods in this warehouse are exported by certificate, and one of us is obliged to go down to the waterside with them.</p>

            . I am one of the king's lockers. We leave this warehouse generally at two o'clock; I had been to the keys on the 24th of December; I returned before two; I fastened the outer door which comes down to Leadenhall-street, the door we go in at, that goes to the staircase; I went round the warehouse and looked at every one of the doors; the king's locks and the company's locks were on; the goods were all very safe then. On the 29th an alarm was given, while I was there, that the warehouse had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177301130024"></xptr> been robbed; I went down and saw the padlock was broke off the door, and the other lock wrenched; I found one chest open; a little further I saw another chest with the gunnies cut, and the boards were broke off; most of the contents of that chest were gone; I cannot be particular how many pieces were remaining; I found, a ticket a little further on the ground which agreed with the marks on the gunney; a little further I saw the third chest which was broke open, and most of the contents were gone; and upon the left hand coming back there was another chest broke open, about one half of the contents of which were gone. I found the king's lock on the outside the warehouse safe, except these folding doors to the inner market; the company's and king's locks were both on; I went round and put the king's key to them and the lock was safe, but the inside fastenings of these two doors, two bolts, were broke off; the padlock was broke off, and the other lock strained and bent. There was a piece, I think it was of bandanno, upon the ground; I believe also there was a piece of bandanno between the door and this chest.</p>

I said, no; he said it is the East India Company's warehouse; I said did you ever rob the India warehouse; he said yes, last year of some black tea; I said did you ever rob the bale warehouses; he said no; do you know which are the bale warehouses? I said I believed I did; they asked me to shew them I shewed them the warehouses that goes in at the great gate; I told him I saw a cart with bales, which I imagined to be muslins unload there: that is the warehouse that was broke open: George looked at them, then he came to me and said it shall be done; there were two locks on them; one with a broad R, one not; after that we had a pot of beer at the Woolpack, in Michael's-alley; then George said he had robbed the warehouse in that alley; and they said if they did this they would make me a present; I said I do not want any thing, only take care of yourselves: I take this to be about the beginning of November.

I saw two or three men at a distance when he went away; I was not near enough to know them; I asked him who they were; he said I had no occasion to be afraid, it was his brother and Cotterell; he came next night and brought me two dozen and one piece of striped handkerchiefs; I did not agree for them but he left them. On Tuesday morning he came and asked me if I had got any money for him; I said I had not; I had nine dozen and one piece in all; he came to me again on Saturday and wanted me to take a 100 pieces more; he said they had quarrelled and had parted the pieces among them; I told them I did not chuse to have any more.</p>

            . About six on Saturday evening the 2d instant, I went with Mr. Bond to the Frying-pan, I believe in Brick-lane; after waiting some time Gray called Mr. Bond out; we got into a coach and went to a public house in Spitalfields; Mr. Senhouse came there, and gave notice to Mr. Bond that the prisoners were at the public house; we went to the house; there we saw the youngest of the Armstrong's and Cotterell; we secured them; we found these six pieces of handkerchiefs ( producing them) in the box by Cotterell and Armstrong; they were all three singing when we went in. I searched them, and found six pistol bullets in Armstrong's pocket (producing them.)</p>
               <p>The apron containing ten pieces produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Corbet. These are bandannoes and romalls; there are the Company's marks upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke. Mrs. Cole shewed us the house from whence Mr. Armstrong brought the handkerchiefs; we went there and broke the door open. We found five bags foil of handkerchiefs, containing I believe 360 odd pieces; we gave directions to Mr. Smith to search Mrs. Armstrong for the key of the padlock; we went to Shurbut's house on Monday night by his direction, and brought away 79 pieces more.</p>

I told him I wanted to buy some articles to wear, he had this bundle; says he, perhaps I may deal with you as cheap as any man in Rosemary-lane; I told him I had as leave buy from him as in Rosemary-lane, as I wanted to get on my journey in the morning; accordingly we went into a public-house, and had a pot of beer, he shewed me the cloaths, and I asked him what he would have for them, he asked a guinea and an half, I told him, I could not afford no such money; with that, he asked me what I would give him; I told him I would give him eighteen shillings for what he had of them, and he gave them to me for nineteen shillings, and I bought them of him; with that, I returned back again and went to Pat Dunn's. I called in at his house, as I was going into the country, and he and I walked out, and had a couple of pots of beer, and went to the chapel, and when we came back, these gentlemen were in the house; I did not attempt to hide them, I had no suspicion they were stolen at all. I had my witnesses here two or three days ago, but as I was arraigned two or three days ago, I thought I should have no occasion for them to-day.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do when you missed your goods?</p>
               <p>Dean. I heard she was in Chick-lane; upon that I went to find her; at last, while I was at the Jolly Sailor, she came in, and there I secured her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with robbing her lodgings?</p>
               <p>Dean. Yes, and sometimes she denied, and then owned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you any directions where to find the things you had lost?</p>
               <p>Dean. Not directly. I heard her mention the name of Nichols once or twice, and I went there and found them.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I went to Mr. Spratt's, shoemaker, No. 9, if my memory assists me right, where I lived very retired; I went there in the name of Smith, coming to a long law-suit I had; I lodged at Mr. Anderson's; I went to be retired intirely till I had sold my estate, which is in America, General Wade is my brother; I told them I was a person come from the country; and had ten pounds a year, and would do some needle work; one night at Mr. Spratt's I was met by an elderly gentleman, I had a few sprats in my hand, I was very ill at that time with St. Anthony's fire in my face, that no person who saw me then could know me again; the gentleman came and spoke to me, and said, my dear, will you have a glass of wine? I knocked at the door, I never was at Mr. Spratt's from Easter Saturday till the day I was taken with this gentleman; I sat down on Monday morning and made a little frock, I thought I would go to Mr. Spratt's, and tell him the alteration of my name; I every day attended Mr. Plowden, who was going to sell my estate, and I thought I; might be met with at Mr. Spratt's; I know nothing or the gowns, I was going to Mr. Spratt's, I was never there before; I left this gentleman in the street; he says to me; will you go and drink a glass of wine? I do not drink any wine, Sir, says I; I have no business with you; he followed me; when we got to Long-lane, he took hold of my hand; I have been ill since I have been in Newgate, I have sent to my friends; Sir

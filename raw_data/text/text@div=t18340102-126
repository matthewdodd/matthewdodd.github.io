               <p>RICHARD BESCOBY. I am clerk in Messrs. Barnett's banking-house, No. 62, Lombard-street - I cashed this cheque on account of a country bank - it is an order to pay Moses and Son the money - I have no recollection of the person who received it.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER BROOKFIELD. I am an officer of Cheap Ward - I apprehended the prisoner on the 9th of December in Lawrence-lane - I named to him the affair of Mr. Moses - he said he had been truly unhappy ever since; for it was not an affair of his own - I asked him what he had done with the cheque - I had heard of the circumstance from Mr. Moses - I asked him what he had done with the goods - he said it was not an act of his own - he had trusted them to another man - it was his duty to deliver them himself, but he did not do it - I said, "Why, you were trusted with a cheque the next day" - he said, "That likewise was an act of the same person's" - I said, "You never returned with it" - he said no, he was ashamed - he did not say he had received the money, nor that he had not - he mentioned the person's name; and I knew him perfectly well, the same as Roe does - I knew the prisoner two years before, he lived in King-street, at Dewhey, Farmer, &amp; Co.; and at that time this man used to be at the corner of Guildhall-yard getting different jobs; but he was known to be a bad character; and I think the prisoner must have known he had left his place for some dishonesty - it was well known he was a man who could not get a constant situation - the prisoner did not say who got the cheque cashed - he said it was an act the same as the other - he did not say what became of the cheque, nor who had the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never knew he was discharged for dishonesty - I had it in my power to give him a job, and gave him one - it is quite correct what the constable states.</p>

               <p>Jeffery. I was going the 30th of December over London-Bridge; opposite to the new Building upon the Bridge, I was forced to put up in a Door Way, to get out of the Way of the Coaches: I had no sooner got up in the Door-way, but a couple of Fellows rush'd, the one behind and the other to one Side of me; I striv'd to get into the House, the Prisoner kept me from going back, and the other from going forward. They took an Opportunity, one of them, to pick my Pocket of 20 l. When the Coach was gone they went off. I had the Presence of Mind to clap my Hand to my Pocket, and I found my Money was gone. I cried out Stop Thief. In running I fell down, but got up again. This Williamson, the Prisoner, makes into a Pinmaker's Shop at some Distance; as soon as I cry'd out Stop Thief, I saw a couple run; and one, that is the Prisoner, went into the Pinmaker's Shop. He endeavour'd there to pull his Coat off, I suppose to disguise him-self: He ask'd to buy some Pins. Asking to buy some Pins, the little Boy calls to the young Man: But he did not want any: But the young Man seiz'd him: And when I came up, I said, you Rogue, you have robb'd me, where is my Money? Says he, I have not robb'd you, but you have, says I: Look down there says he, there is your Money. One of my Witnesses pick'd it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your Money, in a Bag or Purse?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. It was in this Bag. The Bag was produced in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. And the Money that lay at his Feet in the Bag, was the Money you lost out of your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing more?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. We carry'd him into the Haberdasher's House, and we charg'd a Constable with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Talk with him afterwards about it.</p>
               <p>Jeffery. He sent People to get me to be favourable to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken by Slight or by Force?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. By Slight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me about your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. To the best of my Knowledge you are the Man.</p>

            . Please you, my Lord, I live with Mess. Hood and Dale on London-Bridge. On the 30th of December, about Five in the Afternoon, all of a Sudden, I heard a Noise of Stop Thief; upon hearing which I run out of our Warehouse: I catch'd the Prisoner at the Bar by the Collar, and turn'd him on one Side of the Door Post; I held him a few Minutes before the Gentleman that lost his Money came up. You Rogue, says he, you have robb'd me of 20 l. I look'd very sharp at him, but had not the Wit to search him. The Prisoner said he had not got the Money; but before these Words were out of his Mouth I catch'd the Bag between the Spar of the Post and my Foot; upon which I directly call'd to Mr. Jefferies, and said, here is your Money, and gave it into both his Hands and bid him hold it fast. I held the Prisoner still fast by the Collar; and Mess. Hood and Dale were both at Home, and I call'd my Master out of the Compting-House into the Shop. My Master came up; I bid Mr. Jeffery take the Money, and they told it over and it was exactly 20 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (to Payne.) Did you see me drop the Purse?</p>
               <p>Payne. Before the Words you express'd to Mr. Jeffery, There is your Money, were out of your Mouth, I catch'd it between the Spar of the Post and my Foot.</p>

               <p>Powel. All that I known of the good Man is, that he used to deal in the Country. He used to sell cloth, and deal in all manner of pedsing Things.</p>
               <p>To this Evidence a Gentleman in Court objected, That an Evidence own Character ought to be enquir'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170036"></xptr> into, as he was a Person that kept a disorderly House.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Court mov'd, That if he attempted to give the Character of the Evidence, he must be sworn.</p>

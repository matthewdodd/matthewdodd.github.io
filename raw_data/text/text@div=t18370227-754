                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at No. 2, Shoe-lane. Between six and seven o'clock on Wednesday evening, the 8th of February, the pri<lb></lb>soner brought this small bundle of paper to my shop, with some other—he said, would I buy any waste paper—I weighed it, and gave him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a 1b. for it—there was a lot of printed paper outside this, and when I came to undo it I found these four or five quires of white paper—I put this away into my desk, and there it remained till the next evening, when he came again with this other quantity of paper on his shoulder, and put it into the scale—I turned it over, and said, "I shan't buy this; You certainly stole it"—he said, if I would not buy it somebody else would—he took it on his shoul<lb></lb>der, and went out—I followed, and saw him going into a cheesemonger's shop—I took the paper off his shoulder, and said, "You shan't take this any further till I know where you got it"—he urged me to give it up—I said I should not—he said he would fetch a man who would prove he got it honestly—he went away, and never returned—I went about and inquired, and the next night I went to the prosecutor's and the prisoner came down as the warehouseman—I said, "You are the man I want; I looked for you all last evening and this evening."</p>

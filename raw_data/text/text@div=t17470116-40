            , the Owner of this Coat, left this Coat at my House the last Day of the last Month; I live at the Sign of the George at Ilford, it was wrapped up in a clean Table cloth, I saw it given to the Waggoner that it might be left safe ; afterwards I saw the Prisoner get into the Waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Coat was delivered?</p>
               <p>Peen . I am sure it was; I gave him a special Charge of it, because it was a new one, and the Waggoner throwed the Tilt on and went off; the Waggon went off the First Day of this Month at Night, about Six o'Clock, from my House. On the Fifth, the Waggoner came to me, to desire to know if I could swear to the Coat; I said I was sure I could, because I delivered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Peen. In the Country. I says to the Prisoner, Don't you remember being at the George at Ilford such a Night? Do you know me? he said no: Don't you remember I went to the Waggoner and desire him to be careful of this Coat? and he said he did: I said he was sadly to blame he did not pull off the Coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose Coat was it?</p>
               <p>Peen. James Seuter's .</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of the Watch?</p>
               <p>Peen . I know nothing of the Watch; when it was asked what was o'Clock, he pulled out a Watch seeing the Fellow very indifferently dressed, we wondered to see such a Fellow pull out a Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to Seuter. Look at that Coat.</p>
               <p>Seuter. My Lord, 'tis my Coat; I left it at the George at Ilford the last Day of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps that House?</p>

               <p>Start He asked the Carrier's Servant if he could swear to that Watch; he said he would go to a Watchmaker that could swear to the Owner of the Watch, and the Maker's Name; Mr Brown's Servant came and owned the Watch, it was what was sent down to a Country Chap.</p>

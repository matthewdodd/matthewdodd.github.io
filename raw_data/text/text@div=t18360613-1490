                  </hi>. I am single, and am twenty-two years old. I have known the prisoner upwards of five years—he has lately paid his addresses to me—I became acquainted with him at Mr. Pitt's, a linen dra<lb></lb>per's, where I was employed—I have recently taken a tobacconist's shop for myself in the Hackney-road—the prisoner did not know that till he came there—I lost a trunk from there containing a necklace, a fan, a looking-glass, and other articles. At the latter end of February, I left my shop in the care of Elizabeth Waling—I cannot tell exactly when I missed the trunk—the prisoner had no authority from me to go to the shop and take it—he never applied to me for it—I never gave him permission to take it, or its contents—on my return home I saw Waling, and missed the trunk and its contents—I saw the prisoner about a fortnight or three weeks after—he came to the shop, and I charged him with having taken the things—he said "For God's sake do not say any thing about it, I know I have been a base wicked wretch to you"—he then asked for forgiveness—I told him no, I could not forgive him—he then said he would have his revenge on me and went away—I did not give him into custody because I had no certainty, though I suspected he had taken the property—I gave information to an officer—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—I saw the trunk and articles at Worship-street.</p>

               <p>"Sir,—Having been kindly favoured with your name by my friend the Secretary to Lloyd's here, I take the liberty of addressing you, and will feel extremely obliged by your doing your utmost to get the following information; and whatever expense may be incurred, on your advising me to whom I shall pay the amount, it shall be immediately done. On the 7th of September, last year, the brig <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, Captain Loose, sailed from Liverpool to Santa Cruz, in Cuba, with a cargo of plantation stores—on the 10th of November, same year, was totally lost fifteen miles to the eastward of Cape Cruz. The captain noted his protest in the town of Falmouth, Jamaica, on the 16th of November; and the letter to the owner of the same date stated that very little, if any, of the cargo would be saved. However, on the 5th ultimo, a report appeared in the "Shipping Gazette," published in this city, that part of the cargo was saved; consequently the insurance company have refused to settle a total loss until a specification of what goods saved is produced; or if none saved, a letter to that effect. Now having an interest in some part of the cargo, I should feel greatly obliged, as I said before, for such information as may enable me to come to a final settlement with the parties here; and, if possible, please let me I have your reply by return packet; but at any rate without delay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Lyndall, as ship-brokers, in Leadenhall-street. This policy marked "S" was effected through my agency in the Neptune for 687<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by order of the prisoner—the order was in writing, merely on a slip of paper—I have not got the paper I received from him—I made out my slip to take to the Neptune from the paper that was handed to me—this, marked "Q Q Q," is it—I did not make it out my<lb></lb>self—the clerk at the office did from my instructions—I signed it when the policy was prepared—I afterwards made a claim on the Neptune in re<lb></lb>spect of that policy for a total loss, by the prisoner's directions—(<hi rend="italic">These were the instructions for the policy, marked "S"</hi>)—the day after effecting that insurance, I effected another for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the Indemnity Mutual Marine Insurance Company, by Michael Wallace's directions—I also claimed on that insurance for a total loss by the prisoner's directions—he brought the protest—this bill of lading marked "T" was produced to me by the prisoner at the time I was instructed to make the claim—that bill of lading refers to the Neptune. On the 29th of January I received this letter marked "D D"—I believe it to be Michael's writing.—(<hi rend="italic">This was a letter from Michael Wallace to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I was clerk to Zulueta and Co. I entered their em<lb></lb>ploy in 1831—they carry on business in Liverpool, and also in London—I belonged to the establishment at Liverpool upwards of nine years—they are exporters of goods to Cuba—I recollect their freighting the brig <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> in the summer of 1839—there were, I believe, about four clerks in the Liverpool establishment of Zulueta and Co.—I was the shipping clerk, and also managing clerk—the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> was lying in the George's-dock, at Liverpool—I saw her—I know Captain Loose by sight—I became ac<lb></lb>quainted with him as master of this vessel—I recognized him as such—he came to our counting-house several times in the way of business, and I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, from time to time, during her loading—I knew Mi<lb></lb>chael Wallace as the owner of the vessel—I saw him at Liverpool while the vessel was loading—the vessel began to load some time in August, I think—I cannot say that I saw Michael Wallace on board the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>—I had no conversation with him, only relative to the dispatching of the vessel—the only conversation I remember was his requesting me to dispatch the vessel—I saw him two or three times at Liverpool, at intervals of a day or two, perhaps—the ship was advertised for Cuba—no goods offered for her besides Zulueta's goods—I saw the goods that Zulueta and Co. sent, going on board—this is the bill of lading for the goods (marked "I I"—the body of it is the hand-writing of a young man, a shipping clerk, who was under my directions at the time—he was in Zulueta's house—it was made out according to my directions—this bill of lading contains the whole of the goods that were shipped by Zulueta and Co. on board the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>—to the best of my recollection, about a week was taken in putting them on board—the ship was lying close to the quay—she had not what we call a quay berth—part of the goods were sent in carts, and others in barges, which we call flats, (they are called lighters in London,) and there they were put on board—I believe they were all on board on the 5th of Sep<lb></lb>tember—I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> after they had all been shipped—there were no other goods on board besides those shipped by Zulueta and Co., that I know of—if there had been on board 30 tierces of beef, 43 bar<lb></lb>rels of pork, 35 firkins of butter, 50 crates of earthen-ware, 6 cases of flannel, 2 cases of cloth, each containing 10 pieces, 2 cases of prints, each containing 50 pieces, 39 tierces of beef, 52 barrels of pork, 38 firkins of butter, and 25 crates of earthen-ware, and I might have seen them—I did not see any other goods besides those mentioned in the bill of lading of Zulueta and Co.—the last time 1 was on board was a day or two before she sailed—at that time I did not see any goods on board besides those belong<lb></lb>ing</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Therefore, if any party wished to ship good on board, so as to avoid the just payment to your employers of the freight, they would do it clan<lb></lb>destinely? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> True—there are what are called dock-berths at Liverpool—Captain Loose did not take a dock-berth—she had what we term a stage-berth—she must be approached by boats on one side, and from the other side you could get to her from the quay—there was not access to her from the open river—the lighters which were putting the crates of earthen-ware, on board lay alongside of her during the night—I was down in the bold of the vessel last while they were taking in the salt—she bad things put into the hold after I was there, as a matter of course—it is customary occasionally to ship earthenware to the place to which she was going—it might have been five or six days before she sailed that I was down in the hold, or it might be a week, it could not have been ten days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not customary at Liverpool sometimes to ship goods on board ships in fraud of the persons who have chartered her, so as to smuggle them without paying freight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has never come to my knowledge—it may have been done, but I do not know it—if I did know it, it would, of coarse, be my duty to prevent it—it would not be to the interest of the person committing the fraud to let me know—I saw Michael Wallace two or three times while the vessel was lading—I cannot exactly say the number of times—I could not swear I did not see him half a dozen times—I may have seen him half a dozen times, not a dozen—I will swear that—I never saw him on board—I saw him twice with Captain Loose—property might have been put on board clandestinely after the bills of lad<lb></lb>ing were made out, without my knowledge—there are ten keg of paint in the bill of lading, I believe—if any other kegs of paint were put on board, it must have been without my knowledge—I did not put any on board that are not contained in the bill of lading—I swear that positively—I think ten kegs of paint were sent down to the vessel afterwards, which are in the bill of lading—there was no new entry for that in the declaration—it was ten or fifteen kegs of paint—it is in the bill of lading—I have been examined before on this business—I believe there were fifteen kegs of paint,</p>

In 1839, I was master of the <hi rend="italic">Bencoolen</hi>, bound for Cape Hayti; on the 23rd of October 1839, we were off the harbour at Cape Hayti—my vessel was 402 tons—a pilot-boat came on board with three pilots in it, and all came on board—there is a reef of rocks about two and a half or three miles from where the pilots boarded us—I observed a brig to the eastward of us which turned out to be the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, Captain Loose—she was eastward of us, and going right stem on the reef—this reef laid down on the chart produced, is well known to mariners—here is what is called the "Silver Bank"—he was going on the reefs right off the harbour's mouth—they form the outside part of the harbour, and extend about fifteen miles down to the eastward—the direc<lb></lb>tion the brig was taking was the subject of remark—we waited some time to see if she would alter her course, but she did not—the pilot on board made a remark to me—seeing she did not alter her course, I fired a gun as a signal to her—she paid no attention to that, but still went on—as she did not alter her course, I ordered the pilot on board to go away in his boat directly on board the brig as quick as he could, as I thought she was in danger—the pilot pulled away and boarded her—she did not alter her course till he had boarded, but was still steering right in the direction of the reefs—the wind was blowing very little indeed from the west—it was a very little westerly wind, I believe, but am not very confident of that—she was being carried in that direction by the wind—she could have avoided it—when the pilot went on board she altered her course, and then came up into the harbour—I after<lb></lb>wards saw Loose on shore—he said something to me. about the Silver Bank—I observed that his rudder had unshipped, and a jury rudder was made—she carried away her jury rudder and iron—a day or two after, I was required to attend a survey on board the vessel—a gentleman there officiated as Lloyd's agent—the brig was surveyed and repairs ordered—I remained there seven or eight weeks—Loose remained thereabout a fortnight—I saw him during that time almost daily, and conversed with him about the brig, where she had been and what had happened to her—I saw him during the survey—I</p>

                  </hi>. I sailed as first mate of the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, on a voyage from Liverpool, bound to Santa Cruz—Captain Loose engaged me in Liverpool, on the 4th of September, 1839, on board the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>, to go this voyage from Liverpool to Santa Cruz, from there to St. Jago de Cuba, and from there to Swansea, that was my understanding when I engaged—I have been brought up to the sea, and have commanded a ship in the South American trade—I have often crossed the Atlantic, and have been to the West Indies—I am acquainted with the navigation of those seas—I was in the hold of the ship on the 4th of September, the day I joined her—we took in a few cases of hardware, and a few kegs of paint—that was all the cargo that came after I joined her, and they came by Zulueta's bills—I signed bills for them as mate—it is customary for two notes to come down with goods to the ship, one the mate signs, and that goes back, and the other is kept—from the time I joined the ship, on the 4th, till she sailed, no goods were received, except those from Zulueta's—I am quite confident of that—I locked the ship up every night before I left her—I saw her again in the morning—when the lading was completed, one-third of the ship remained unfilled—I am sure eighty crates of earthen-ware were not loaded on board after the 4th—there were none, nor any cases of flannel, cloth, or prints, nor any tierces of beef, barrels of pork, or firkins of butter, only for the ship's use, and they were on board previous to the 4th—I saw the hold every day from the time I joined the ship till the ship sailed—I am quite sure no goods, except those I have mentioned,</p>

               <p>were brought on board after that time, only the kegs of paint and cases of hardware, that is all—she was ready for sea previous to that, but it was found out her foremast was bad, it was taken out that day, and we put a new foremast in that day, we had two tierces of beef, and four barrels of pork on board for the ship's use—that was a scanty quantity to carry us on the outward voyage—I have always seen, for the last fifteen years, that a ship on that voyage is provisioned out and home both—I am sure she had not provisions for the homeward voyage—we went out of the dock on the 6th, and entered the river, and sailed on the 7th—we had ten hands on board, all hands included—in going round Ireland, we went through the North Channel—we fetched Carlingford light on the Irish coast—I be<lb></lb>lieve it is not unusual to go by the North Channel, according to the wind—Captain Loose directed me to get tackles rove and coiled in the long-boat, so that if we wanted her, she would be the quicker put into the water—we had no logline when we sailed—I endeavoured to replace it by making one of spunyarn, but I found it quite insufficient for the purpose, it was too heavy—we had no proper logline during the voyage, while I remained on board—I found the larboard pump was choked the first time I endeavoured to sound it—a short time after we were at sea, I can<lb></lb>not say the exact time, I tried to clear it out, but was not able to do so—I told Captain Loose of it—he said nothing particular—the boy was in the cabin, and came on deck to me—the larboard pump was never made to sock—I believe there was a chronometer on board, but I never saw it, I was told of it—I made an application to the captain to be allowed to make use of the chronometer, which would have allowed me to know the longitude of the ship—he would not allow me to see it—we pursued our course to the West Indian seas—I had never been to santa Cruz before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what was the proper course to be pursued in crossing the Atlantic, and going to Santa Cruz? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is generally one track laid down on charts as a guidance—Captain Loose followed the track part of the way—he deviated from that track about longitude 59 west, or thereabouts—he steered to the northward—we first made land in the West Indies at Virgin Gorda—I saw the land there—this is Virgin Gorda, (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on the chart</hi>)—it is laid down here with a V. and Gorda only—I told the captain I had seen the land—he came on deck—he re<lb></lb>mained on deck about five minutes, and then went below again—he said nothing—shortly afterwards I observed breakers ahead, and low land—the breakers denoted a reef, and the low land was the main land of Anegada—we were probably about five miles from the breakers when I first discovered them ahead, or four or five miles, I cannot exactly say the distance—I went down and told the captain—I found him in bed—it was between six and seven o'clock in the morning (I had seen the land just at day-break) Benjamin Shultz was at the helm—I told the captain I could see breakers a-head, and low land—he jumped out of bed, and followed me on deck shortly after—I told Shultz to put the helm down, and let the ship come round to keep her off the breakers—the captain ran to the wheel, and hove the helm up again, that had the effect of keeping the ship direct on for the breaker a—he took the wheel himself, and remained at it a short time only—the crew complained—Thomas Hunter and Henry Simpson, two of the seamen, came into the waist, and said if the captain did not put her round, they would take charge, and put her round them<lb></lb>selves, they were not going to be lost through him—the captain on that</p>

               <p>left the wheel—Benjamin Shultz, the carpenter, again took the wheel—he put the helm down again, and the ship came round.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near had you got to the breakers when Shultz put down the helm the second time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The ship just cleared the breakers, and nothing more—a few minutes, and she would have been on shore—after she was round, the captain mentioned to me, that he did not think she was so near—when he first came on deck, and took the wheel from Shultz, and told me to mind my own d—d business, and to take the studding-sails in—after the ship was brought round, he said he would have me tried for mutiny, for taking charge of the ship from him—this was on the 17th of October—we then proceeded on our voyage—on the 19th we were on the Silver Keys, (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on the chart</hi>)—in some charts it is called "keys," and in others "bank"—it is to the north of the island of St. Domingo.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Ought he to have gone to the south or north of St. Domingo to reach Santa Cruz? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider the south passage, between Antigua and Guadaloupe, is the way—I have crossed those seas—that would bring us to the south of St. Domingo, and make the island of Jamaica in passing—that is the usual way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a ship were to go to the north side of St. Domingo, ought she to have come on the Silver Keys? should she come so near the shore? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She ought to have been higher the shore to have avoided it—the Silver Keys is laid down on all the charts that I have ever seen of that part—the first thing that attracted my attention on the Silver Keys, on the 19th of October, was a rock on the larboard bow, about 300 fathoms off, more or less—I cannot swear to the exact distance—it was about half-past six o'clock in the morning, or between that and seven—I immediately men<lb></lb>tioned it to the captain—he was below—he came on deck—I pointed out the rock to him—it was easily to be discerned—the captain said he could not see it—I saw it with my naked eye—the captain had his telescope in his hand—the water ahead was discoloured, which indicates a shoal in those seas—soon after that one of the crew from the fore-yard called out "Rocks under her fore-foot"—the fore-foot is the bow of the vessel—I ran for<lb></lb>ward, and likewise the captain—I looked over the bow, and saw the rocks—the captain said, "Oh, we are lost! we are lost! we are all lost!"—im<lb></lb>mediately after the ship struck—she remained fast for the space of from fifteen to twenty minutes—we cleared away the boats—the captain ordered the jolly-boat to be hove overboard—we put her on deck, and got the tackle up ready to put the long-boat over to save ourselves—after about twenty minutes the vessel dragged off the rock, the sails being all set, and the breeze increasing—she had suffered no perceptible injury at that time—she was making no water—she went on a short distance, until she struck another rock—she remained fast on that only a few minutes—she dragged past that—the captain was in the cabin during this time—he was putting a life-preserver on part of the time—when she dragged off the second rock, our rudder was disabled—two pintles were injured, which caused the rudder to unship—we trimmed the sails, to keep her before the wind—I proposed to make a temporary rudder, and applied to the cap<lb></lb>tain, having no spare topmast on board, for the main boom, for some pieces of oar and the sprit-sail yard, to make a temporary rudder, which he refused, there being no spare spars on board—he said we were in a nice predicament; a ship at sea without a rudder; it would have been better if we had been all asleep a day or two previous, and let her go</p>

               <p>ashore at Anegada—Shultz made a temporary rudder from the stud<lb></lb>ding-sail booms, the long-boat's oars, and some spare pieces of plank—it was an assistance in steering her—on the 20th we made the harbour of Port-o-Plata, on the coast of St. Domingo—from the 20th to the 22nd, we proceeded close along the land—in my judgment it would have been better to have had a better offing—we were sometimes so near as to be almost among the breakers—it seemed to me there was danger of getting ashore there—the men had all their clothes ready packed up, if they should get ashore—on the afternoon of the 22nd of October we were close in with a reef that lies off the harbour of Cape Hayti—the jury-rudder unshipped, and we trimmed the sails, to keep her before the wind out to sea again—the captain gave those orders—he asked me what 1 thought was best to be done—I told him there was no danger to run into the harbour; the wind was fair for that—the captain told me to go forward and call David Davis, who was acting as second mate, and Benjamin Shultz the carpenter, to see what their opinion was—I did so—they came on the quarter-deck, and said the harbour was before us, and they thought we might get in—the captain said he would not, he had no pilot on board, and if any thing happened to the vessel, he should lose the insurance—I told him the only plan then was to keep her out to sea that night, we could replace the jury-rudder very soon, to get in in the morning, and get a pilot, by the time the sea-breeze set in—the captain went to bed about eight—about nine I saw a sail on our larboard quarter, I mentioned it to the captain—he came upon deck—I said she looked like a large ship, probably a man-of-war, and could give us assistance, if we were to run down to her—we could easily have done so, we could have gone down before the wind to her—we did not do so, the captain would not allow us—he said he wanted nothing with her—he went to bed again, and told me to call him at twelve—at day-break we were at the south-east of the entrance of Cape Hayti—when the day dawned, I saw a ship a little to the northward of the entrance of the port—we were steering towards the reef—I could see the breakers ahead, probably two miles off—the captain came on deck about seven—at that time we were steering towards the reef—she was steering the course that he ordered when he left the deck previous—I cannot say what time it was that he gave those orders, for I was in bed—he gave the orders to the second mate—when he was on deck, about seven, we were steering towards the reef—no signal was made from the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi>—the ship we saw to the northward fired a gun and hoisted an ensign—I afterwards learnt she was the <hi rend="italic">Bencoolen</hi>, commanded by Captain Tate—I understood the meaning of the firing of that gun, it was to warn us we were running into danger—she had likewise the Union-jack flying at the fore, as a signal for a pilot—we were not allowed to hoist one—I pro<lb></lb>posed to hoist one—the captain said, if they were too lazy to come off without a signal, let them stop where they were—we kept on the same course till a pilot came on board—it was almost a calm—she was going very little through the water—I went below, and told the captain the ship to northward had fired a gun and hoisted a signal—he said that was nothing to him—he said nothing more, and I left the cabin—the pilot came on board about eleven in the forenoon—the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> had not altered her course up to that time—the captain called the pilot aft, and showed him our jury-rudder, and asked if he would take charge of the vessel—he said he would; if the crew would work the ship in he would take her in—we</p>

               <p>custody or in confinement—I swear that—I remember the examination on the 12th of November, but I was not in custody, I was on bail—there was an officer present before I was bailed—he did not mention to me that I was in his charge—I was willing to go with him wherever he chose—I did not try to go away—probably I was in his charge for a minute or two, if he bad taken on himself to have taken me in charge—bail was offered before it was asked for—bail was offered for my appearance—I do not forget having been a little merry at the Mansion-house one day before Sir Peter Laurie—I was not drunk—I was taken off to a place of confinement for it—I staid there all night—I had a good room—it was in the Compter—I cannot say whether it is a prison—I am a stranger in London—I have been coming to and going from London for the last fifteen or sixteen year at times—you say the Compter is a prison—I have no doubt of it, after you have told me so—I had the power of going out of the room, not into the street—I was aware it was some place of confinement—I do not know whether the captain is alive or dead—my belief would be that he is alive, from what I have been told—I have heard he was dead several times—there is a captain of the port at Hayti, and a colonel of the port also—the <hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> remained at Hayti under repairs two or three weeks probably, but I had left her then—she was to be seen—when the captain called out, "We are lost, we are lost, we are all lost," he called out to clear away the boats, to heave the jolly-boat overboard—the jolly-boat was at that time turned bottom upwards on the long boat—there was no tackle in the long boat at that time—we had to get the tackle—I told the captain I could soon get a jury-rudder made that would take us into port—we were about two hun<lb></lb>dred miles from Cape Hayti at that time—I cannot exactly say the distance—I told the captain that Hayti was the best port for us to go to—the captain said, if the carpenter could make any thing of the studding-sail booms we might take either of them, and the carpenter accordingly made the rudder of the studding-sail booms, some spare planks, and pieces of oars—the straps of the jury rudder gave way on the 22nd, off Cape Hayti—it was not through that that we drifted on close to the reef—we were close to the reef when the jury-rudder straps gave way—the captain ordered us to trim the sails, keep her off, and get her head to sea—we were then about four miles from the entrance of the port—we did not hoist a signal for a pilot on board our ship—next morning the <hi rend="italic">Bencoolen</hi> had a signal flying for a pilot, but I was not allowed to hoist one—I never, to my re<lb></lb>collection, said that we steered in for the harbour, having a signal hoisted for a pilot—if I ever did say so it was not true, but I do not recollect ever saying such a thing—I do not think I ever did say it—we had no signal flying—when the pilot came on board, he said if the crew would work the sails to his order he would pilot us in—I thought our having only a jury-rudder was a sufficient reason to justify the pilot in saying so—I thought it quite right the crew should be under his orders to get us into port, in con<lb></lb>sequence of the imperfect state of the ship—we were taken into port the same afternoon, the crew obeying the pilot's orders—at the time the two pilots went to the <hi rend="italic">Bencoolen</hi> we were drifting slowly towards the reef—we could be seen from the harbour—we were about four miles from the harbour—the <hi rend="italic">Bencoolen</hi> was nearer—she was at the entrance of the harbour, and we were not—she was probably about the same distance, as we were taking the angles of the harbour, but we had to go down in a direction for her before we could get into the harbour—it was nearly a calm when the</p>

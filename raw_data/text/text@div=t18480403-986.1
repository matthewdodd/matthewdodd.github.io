                  </hi> I live at New-Year's-green, in the parish of Harefield. On Thursday night, 2nd March, I went to bed about ten o'clock—I fastened up all the doors, windows, and shutters—there were no shutters to one window—a lad who lived in the house went to bed at the same time—I had two flitches of bacon in the dairy, which is part of the house, and a copper plate and two snuff-boxes on the mantel-shelf, and a large hog-knife on the kitchen table—I got up next morning at a quarter-past six-the front door was open; the window, which had no shutter, broken; and an iron bar pulled out—there were shoe-marks under the window—I looked into the dairy, and missed rather more then half of each flitch of bacon also the knife, the snuff-boxed, and some cloths to cover the bacon—I have seen the things since—they are mine—Brill is my brother's son—he had lived at Harefield but was not much acquainted with me—he has lived in London lately—I do not know Stare.</p>

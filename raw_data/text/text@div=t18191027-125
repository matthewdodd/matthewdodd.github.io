He said he could not take it to Mr. Chadwell before six o'clock in the evening, but that he would be sure to take it by that time - he was to take it there from the warehouse. About eleven o'clock that night two officers came and informed me that it had been stolen. I saw it next morning at Worship-street; the tea had then been emptied into a bag, and weighed 5 lbs. short.

               <p>"You had better step up to the broker, and see if he has cleared the chest." He went out of the yard, returned in about five or six minutes with a piece of paper, with the number of the chest on it - it was the proper paper. He said,</p>
               <p>"Is this number down for delivery?" I found one of that number, and delivered it to him, and he took it out of the yard on his knot - he was alone. I saw the same chest next day at the office, where both the prisoners were in custody.</p>

I said I would have nothing to do with it - this was about three or four o'clock; they both went out, but I do not know whether they both left exactly together. I afterwards went to look for Dunn, and found him at No. 1, Crown-court, Grub-street - Ellington was not with him; Dunn quarelled with me, and I left him. When I returned I found Ellington at my house; Dunn came in very much in liquor - they were both in liquor, and I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you allow them to run up a score at your house for eating and drinking - A. About 8 s. I lent Dunn 1 l. before the tea was mentioned.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you calculate what the whole would come to - A. No; I said something about 17 l. I informed the officers myself about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not complain of an assault - A. I might. I told the officers I suspected they had stolen the tea, and shewed them where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know where it was - A. I heard them say it was in the house in Crown-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say what you thought the tea worth - A. I do not recollect - A. I might have said it was worth 3 s. or 4 s., 10 s. 6 d., or a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the officer had got sound of it, and say,</p>

On the 28th of September Molloy came and gave me information about the tea; I found the prisoners at his house between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and took them to the watch-house. On Ellington I found a permit for the tea, the same number as that on the chest; on Dunn I found about half an ounce of tea, which appeared to be the same sort as that in the chest. Next morning I and Bee went to No. 1, Crown-court, in consequence of information from Molloy, and there found 80 lbs. of tea sewed up in a sack in the one-pair room - I found the chest broken up in different parts of the room; I put it together; it was not quite entire, but the number was perfect, and corresponded with the permit - it was No. 13,804. Lane keeps the house. The prisoners were both drunk, particularly Ellington.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 1, Crown-court, in the first floor; I have known Dunn many years. On the 28th of September, between one and two o'clock, he brought a chest of tea covered over with a sack, Ellington was with him - it was in the shape of a chest; they put it in the sack. The constable fetched it away next morning. The prisoners had half a pint of gin, I had a glass with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Molloy did not come to the lodging, and have a glass himself - A. Yes, and paid for it himself - I do not know that he saw the tea. Ellington had sewed it up in a sack before he came.</p>
               <p>ELLINGTON'S Defence. Molloy told the Magistrate that I pitched the chest on a block, went to get a pint of beer, and in the mean time it was stolen. I was very tipsey, and could not carry it. He advanced me 1 l., and said,</p>
               <p>"That is for the chest."</p>
               <p>DUNN'S Defence. The men called on me in the morning; Molloy called me, I got up and let them both in - I afterwards found Ellington in the tap-room, and he went to the warehouse for the chest. I met him in Moorfields, he said he must trouble me to carry it, I assisted him with it to Crown-court; we both went to Molloy, he agreed to give 17 l. 5 s. for the tea, and 1 l. was paid to Ellington towards it; I had no dealings with it. As to the sample which was found on me, I bought it in Holborn on the Saturday before.</p>

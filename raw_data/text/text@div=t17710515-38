In the morning, about four o'clock, two of my fellow servants called me up; I went to the door to speak to them; when I came back I saw my breeches pulled from under my head; my little girl was in my bed; I charged the prisoner with it; there was my wife's cloathes under her bed's head, on a little table; I had not seen them before for three months; I seldom went to the box; I found the box locked; I had the key, and my cloathes were in it; the stays were under the foot of the bed where I lay. I went into the yard, there was the bag, and six guineas and three shillings. I asked her if she knew any thing of that; she said she did not; she wanted the keys of my drawer; I opened the drawers and box, where my wife's rings were; they were not in it. I took hold of her hand, and she had the gold rings, and had put two brass ones in the box. She had pawned all my wife's apparel. ( the rings produced.) I found no money upon her.</p>

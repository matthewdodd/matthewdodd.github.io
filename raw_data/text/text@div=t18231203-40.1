            . I am agent to H. Cooper and Co. paper-makers, Dover. I live in Broadway, Blackfriars. On the 24th of October, I received thirty reams of middle yellow post from them, numbered from 128 to 157. I wrote an order to Chester-quay, for four reams to be delivered to Wright, with other paper; it was all deposited at Barker and Smith's warehouse, at the quay; there were four reams in a bundle - I have since seen twenty-five of them at Wright's.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and observed a hackney chariot, it turned up Devonshire-street, into Devonshire-square, and drove to the archway, leading to Cutler-street and Still-alley, and stopped there - the first man who got out of the chariot looked at me, and ran away. I put my hand into the chariot, felt something in the bottom, and saw another person sitting in the chariot - got in, and seized him; it was the prisoner. I found these four reams of paper in the chariot, and ordered the coachman to drive to the Mansion House. The prisoner resisted, which made us get out of the chariot, but I got him in again - he said he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What made you suspect anything wrong - A. It leads to a bad neighbourhood, and there was nobody on the coach-box, except the driver - the prisoner resisted, and I tied his hands together. I am sure he did not come from the coach-box, and then into the coach.</p>
               <p>MR. BARNES. This is the paper, and has the Excise mark, No. 132. 157. 158. and 156.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hired this coach - a man was riding on the box, who ran away. I did not know the paper was in the coach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to John Knowles and Co.—there are other persons in the firm—they are silk brokers. I went on the 4th of July to clear some bales of silk at the warehouse, No. 3, London Docks—there were fourteen bales put in a van, and the remainder in a cart—the van was to take the silk home to 26, Throgmorton-street—while I was loading the other cart with the remainder, the van that had the fourteen bales drew away—the prisoner drove it—I had ordered the van, and he came down with it—he is servant to Mary Vesters, who is a town carrier—when I had nearly loaded my cart, the prisoner was brought up to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060101"></xptr>
               <p>by a policeman, who said there was a bag of coffee found on the van, and he believed my bales had been plundered—I saw the silk taken out of his nose bag up at the gate of the dock—it was in the nose-bag of his horses belonging to the van—he was not present at that time—one of the bales had been torn open at one end, and one at the side, and they were deficient in weight—I have the dock weight, which was put down in weighing them, and I kept a strict look out after the van till we got home—I was with it all the time—I never for a moment had my eye off it, and when we got home we took the bales out, and weighed them separately—one was one pound short, and the other was two pounds short.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at the silk floor of the London Docks, No. 3 warehouse—I delivered fourteen bales to Vester's van—I saw them out of the loop-hole into the van—I believe they were all sound and good, and there was no rip in them to my knowledge—if there had been a little rent in a bag, the silk would not have moved out by itself—it must have been drawn out—the skeins of silk are tied in bundles—I was not aware that they were plundered till the Monday morning—I did not see them after that—one of them weighed when they were put in 1cwt 3qr. 23lbs.—the other 1cwt. 3qr. 241bs.—one was numbered "R S 835," and the other "R S 870."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk broker, and am one of the firm of John Knowles and others.

I had occasion to search the prisoner's van on account of finding a bag of coffee, and concealed under some straw in the van I found a horse's nose bag with a cloth over it—I took, it out and found seven skeins of silk at the bottom of the nose bag, and a cloth stuffed over it—this silk could not have got out of the bales and got into the nose bag by itself—the prisoner was the driver of the van and had the care of it—I asked him, and he said he was the driver.</p>

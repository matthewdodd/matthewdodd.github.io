               <p>Q. Had you observed Rutter sufficiently to know he was the same man when he was brought back? - A. Yes, I had spoke to him on the steps of the printing-office door about ten minutes before; I asked him what he wanted there; he told me he wanted no person in particular, and walked away; I am sure he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if there was any body in your office at the time? - A. Yes, but not in the room where the paper was.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOUGHTON sworn. - I am a carpenter: On the 29th of March last, about half past one o'clock, I saw the two prisoners at the bar come out of Mr. Whittingham's warehouse with the paper on their shoulders; they came out at the front door; I first thought they were two of Mr. Whittingham's men; I turned to the right, and went down Dean-street; when they had got about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280031"></xptr>twenty yards down, I saw Mr. Whittingham cross the way; he collared the first, which was Watson, and asked him where he got that paper from; he threw down the paper upon Mr. Whittingham's arm, and Mr. Whittingham lost hold of him; he then turned round, and ran up Dean-street; then Mr. Whittingham called out stop thief; one of them turned to the right, and the other to the left, into Fetter-lane; then they were taken in Fetter-lane, and brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the people that you saw running were the same that were brought back? - A. Yes; we sent for Mr. Fletcher, the constable, and they were delivered to him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FLETCHER sworn. - On Monday, the 29th of March, about half past one o'clock, I was standing within my own door, and saw a person run very furious past the door; I then heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately opened the door, and ran out; the prisoner, Rutter, was then stopped by being thrown down; his heels were kicked up; I immediately took him into custody; I had information that Mr. Whittingham was robbed; I then took him to the corner of Dean-street, and by that time the other prisoner was taken. I called for assistance, and took them both to the Compter; the paper was delivered to me by Mr. Whittingham, and I have had it ever since; (produceit.)</p>
               <p>Whittingham. This is my paper; it is part of a quantity of paper that came in on the preceding Saturday; there were twenty-six bundles of it; I went into the room just before the robbery, for I had a suspicion of the prisoner Rutter; the paper was there then; when I came back, I looked at the room, and missed two bundles; the number on the paper is 620; I believe the Exciseman's name is

                  </hi>. I am mate of the brig <hi rend="italic">Speed</hi>, which laid in the London Docks on the 1st of August. Mr. Huckins is the master—there is an opening from the dock into the port, out into the river—Mr. Clapp is a merchant, and is owner of the vessel—she had discharged her cargo on the other side of the dock, and had taken in another cargo, and was outward bound—we had a wooden case on board, marked N. A., No. 1, which was represented to contain silver plate—it was placed in the captain's state-room—the prisoner was a custom-house officer, and was in charge of the vessel for six or seven days—he slept in the state-room—no one else slept there—the case came on board in the morning of the 1st of August—the prisoner was on board when it came, and knew what was represented as the contents—he took an account of it as an officer—it would be mentioned in the cocket—he had a box on board, containing his own clothes, which was kept on the quarter-deck—on the Saturday after the 1st of August,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183708140006"></xptr>
               <p>between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the case in the state room, apparently safe as it was when originally placed there—I afterwards went on shore, leaving Lee, the steward, the prisoner, and five or six men on board—I returned in about an hour, when, in consequence of what Lee told me, I went down to the state-room—there was no one there—I saw the wooden case broken open, and a silver tea-pot lying out on the cabin floor—I let it lay there, and said nothing to any one—the prisoner was on the quarter-deck when I came on board—the captain came on board about nine o'clock next morning, and I told him what I had seen—I went down with an officer, and the captain and steward, and saw the case and tea-pot just as I had seen them before.</p>

I am matter of the <hi rend="italic">Speed</hi>—I was ashore on the 5th of August, and returned on board about nine o'clock on toe 6th—Williams, the mate, made a communication to me—I was in the cabin adjoining the state-room at the time—I looked into the state-room, and then went myself for an officer who came afterwards—I saw the case, which stood under tome others, protruded out no far that I could see it had been opened—when the officer came, the prisoner was called down into the cabin, and the officer asked him if he knew any thing of the box containing the silver plate—he pointed the box out to him is it stood on the transom with the lid forced off—he said, no, he knew nothing about it—Lee, who was present, was then asked if he knew who had broken the box open, and he said that he came into the cabin after I had left the ship on Saturday night, and saw the prisoner near the box with a knife in his hand and part of the lid off; and as Boon at he taw him he took some cases which stood on my chest, and put on it, and said, "I must take care of this," and then turned to him and said, "If you have a mind I will put you in the way of making four or five pounds for yourself"—the prisoner replied, "You did not"—the police officer searched the cabin and state room, and other places, and found tome paper which appeared to have contained plate, under my mattress in the state-room—we came to the prisoner's box on the quarter-deck—it was locked, and the officer asked him to open it—he said he had lost the key—the policeman asked him to break it open—he said he would not, nor should any other person—he said the lock cost him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it was a new one, and he did not want to spoil it—he was at that time in custody charged with stealing these things—he sat down on his box, and requested the officer to search the forecastle—that was done, but nothing was found—the officer then took him and his box on shore—I accompanied them, and saw the box broken open, and the silver coffee-pot was found in it, wrapped up as it is now, in a towel belonging to me, and a handkerchief which I do not know—the towel generally hung on the bulk-head near the state-room—when the case was opened we found a silver sugar-basin in it—when the prisoner lifted the lid of his box, he said, "I see somebody has been playing me a trick; that steward has put this into my box, stolen my key, and locked my box, and thrown the key overboard"—Lee has been about fifteen months on board the vessel—I did not know him before—he still belongs to the ship—the vessel laid in the Port of London.</p>

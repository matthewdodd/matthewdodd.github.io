I live in the house, and no part of it is occupied by any other person—the property that was stolen was mine—the prisoner Thomas had been an apprentice of mine, but had left me about two years—I do not know that I ever saw the others—on the night of the 31st of December my house was perfectly secure—the doors and windows were closed—we all went to bed at one time—my mother-in-law always pays attention to the doors and windows—we retired to bed about a quar<lb></lb>ter before eleven o'clock—about six the next morning, I found the kitchen was very much ransacked, the drawers taken out of the table and dresser, and different sorts of linen strewed about the floor—I then ex<lb></lb>amined the back kitchen window, and found two upright iron bars had been forced out, with a part of the window-frame—such an opening had been made as a person could get in at—I tried that by my appentice—I missed two pairs of boots out of a cupboard, and a pair of shoes, and my mother-in-law gave me a statement of some other things that were lost—I had seen my boots and shoes a day or two before—I lost six silk hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs, and a case of razors—the spectacles and shoe-brushes were missed the following day—I had a canary bird and a cage—the bird was taken—the bird and boots and shoes are found—the other things were gone—I cannot tell how the things went, or when—I only know that the clock in the kitchen was stopped at five minutes to one—the weights had not gone down—I thought it might have been stopped by putting the cage on a chair near the pendulum, where we found it standing.</p>

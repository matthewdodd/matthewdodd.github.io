               <p>I belong to Mr. Calvert's brewhouse in Whitecross-street, on the 16th of April, Mr. Fletcher, one of our coopers, was going up Holborn, and he saw a man cradleing a butt into a private house; I saw the butt afterwards, and it is Messrs. Calvert's; the other butt is Mr. Whitbread's by the mark; we took the prisoner on the 16th of April, and he confessed, that he took the butt from a house that we had served.</p>
               <p>Court. What conversation passed that introduced that confession? - After I had seen the butt I returned home, and took a Mr. Vaughan, where we were told he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300046"></xptr> bought it; I got two of the men from Litchfield-street, and the man who bought the butt pitched upon the prisoner; Vaughan is not here, we went back to the office, when we came there, Vaughan was examined, and I believe would have been committed, had not Mr. Barnfathen gone away.</p>
               <p>How was the confession introduced, was it before the Justice or in your compting house? - It was both, he confessed it immediately that he sold them there, as a perquisite to one of our coopers, which was an intire falsehood.</p>
               <p>Was that as soon as he was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then when he was taken, I take it for granted he was charged with this theft? Yes.</p>
               <p>And he said, he sold it as a perquisite? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner attend your brewery at all? - He has been off and on.</p>
               <p>Court. But there is no such perquisite? Not as he reported, there is a perquisite which publicans have frequently, on application to the brewery for water butts.</p>
               <p>There had been no such order in this? Never any such application, these were very good butts, they were fit for use in the brewery.</p>

               <p>I happened to be at home the day the agreement was made for these butts, an agreement with the prisoner at the bar, and two others.</p>
               <p>Who are these others? - I cannot say, but I believe the prisoner at the bar to be one; the agreement was, that the person in the top room should ask Mr. Vaughan, whether he could assist him to get a water butt, and Vaughan said, it did not belong to him, it belonged to the porter brewery; then the prisoner, or one of the others spoke, and said, you are in right time, for our cooper can assist you with one: Now Mr. Vaughan asked the price, and was answered five shillings, I am sure the prisoner was one of the persons, Mr. Vaughan said, give my compliments to Mr. Stockall the cooper, of Mr. Calvert's brewhouse, and desire him to send me two; Mr. Vaughan tuned to me, and said, if I am not in the way Mr. Hall, you be so kind to pay for them; and I made answer yes, that was all that passed.</p>

               <p>Court. Who was it that said that? - I cannot certainly say it was the prisoner; I turned about and said, you help me to one, do you sell water butts? he said no master, I do not deal in them, but our cooper has got some old butts to sell, he mentioned the cooper's name, Stockall, I told him he was an utter stranger to me, nor would I buy a butt of him, I would have no concerns with him; Mr. Vaughan, immediately applies to him, did not you say, Mr. Stockall has got some by him to sell; he said, yes, at five shillings a piece, and Mr.

             I desired him he would order him a couple, as he wanted one himself; about four days after this Mr. Hall informed me the two butts were come, I said, I would have one, and I saw Mr. Vaughan, and he said, you may pay Mr. Hall, for he paid for them, and I sent for a cooper to cradle it for me, and he did not: I paid five shillings, and had the butt delivered into my yard; about two o'clock Mr. Foster came and told me the butt was stolen, and I told him I bought it, and shewed him where the other was.</p>

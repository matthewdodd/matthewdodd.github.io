            " - I always paid the prisoner Mr. Younger's bills, and he always gave me receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discontinue Mr. Younger as a baker? - A. At the time I paid that bill; I told the prisoner not to bring any more bread.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You, like all good wives, live at home with your husband? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended that the 2d and 3d Counts were inoperative, and that the first should have stated the money to have been received of the husband by the hands of the wife.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the 1st Count, I am clearly of opinion that it is quite sufficient to state that the money was received on account of the master; as to the other two, the question is merely whether they are necessary or not; it has been said, the 2d Count is bad, because it does not state from whom it was received; but suppose a prisoner, charged with a crime of this sort, does not chuse to confess from whom he received it, although he confesses he has received a large sum of money on account of his master, I think it would be very good evidence against him, though the sum is not ascertained. Under all these circumstances I am of opinion that this indictment is good; as to the Common Law Count, I have always entertained an opinion that it was not good.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHARPE sworn. - I have known the prisoner five years; he has always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Have you not been for the purpose of settling this with the prosecutor? - A.Not since he has been taken; I went at the desire of the young man; he said he owed Mr. Younger some money, and he wished to pay it in the couse of a month.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that? - A. I cannot say, it was since he left Mr. Younger; Mr. Younger would have taken it, if I would have paid it down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. This was before the man was indicted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Younger. Mr. Sharpe came two or three days after the prisoner left me, and told me he wanted his clothes; he said, the prisoner had given him an account of about five pounds that he had taken of my money, and he wished to pay it for the prisoner; I told him I would not take the money from him, for I should prosecute him; there was no money tendered, and I refused to take any.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you, or not, offer to take the money if it was paid down? - A. I did not; there was no money presented to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or not, offer to take it if the money was paid down? - A.Not that I know of; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200065"></xptr>never could agree about the sum, for he had more than ten pounds of my money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Upon the oath you have taken, would you not have received the money from the hands of Mr. Sharpe, if he had given it to you? - A. If he had paid me the whole sum, I might.</p>

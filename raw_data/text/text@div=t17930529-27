                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290049"></xptr>Q. How was the window left? - Fastened by a latch and screw. When I came back I found the shutter open, the screw had fell down; when I went out the inside shutter was shut; when I returned the inside shutter was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this window from the ground? - Between two and three feet, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark of feet about the window? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there room for a man's body to pass through the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a man with tolerable ease get in and out? - Yes, by making a little effort and spring on the outside. On searching my drawers I missed several things.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the room on your return? - In the same state I left it, except these drawers which had been opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these drawers locked when you left them? - The keys were in the drawers. I missed a watch and a pair of buckles and some spoons; there was some linen taken out of the drawers but not taken away; I missed all in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of all the articles you missed? - About five or six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner with this? - He took the things to different pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the things in the hands of the pawnbrokers yourself? - Yes, the pawnbrokers are here; one pair of silver buckles I recovered on the afternoon of that day; I received the rest about five or six days afterward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What day do you say this was? - On the first of May.</p>
               <p>Q. You had left your chambers as early as ten o'clock, therefore at what precise time these chambers were robbed you cannot tell? - Only by information.</p>
               <p>Q. Of your own knowledge you cannot say when this robbery was effected, except between ten in the morning and two or three in the afternoon. Have you a laundress? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. The laundress of course has a key to have access to them? - She has.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether she had been or not, of course we can know only from her.</p>
               <p>Q. She is not here? - She is not.</p>
               <p>Q. For ought you know the window might have been left open by her? - It is not very likely.</p>
               <p>Q. She had a power so to have left it? - She never goes into our chambers between the hours of ten and three.</p>
               <p>Q. She had access at any time if she chose it, and whether she did that day or not you cannot say? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. She might incautiously have left the chamber door or window open? - I never knew her guilty of that action.</p>

            . The first of this person's coming was between twelve and one; I think it was either Monday or Tuesday, he told me, after a little conversation, that he had no money, and told me to call up my servant, and ask my servant to go and pledge the buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come to you? - I think it was between twelve and one; he came about a quarter after twelve. The buckles had little knobs about them. (shewn the buckles produced by Brown.) They are the buckles he pawned first, I think they are the same buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of his desire call up your servant to pawn these buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she took them to pawn or not? - She told me Mr. Gardiner's son was below, she was very busy washing, she went down and came up directly, and said she had sent them by Gardiner, but I did not see Gardiner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing produced, as the produce of pawning these buckles? - She brought up the ticket and fifteen shillings, the pawnbroker's duplicate.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was that ticket and duplicate given? - To the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - Yes, two or three times, but I don't know his name, or any thing of him besides.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had got this fifteen shillings and the ticket, the produce of these buckles, what became of him? - Then he told me he was going a little way on business, and he would return in half an hour; he returned and told me he had not money enough for what he was going to do, therefore he pulled out the watch from his pocket, and a pair of buckles out of his shoes, he proposed having them likewise to be pledged as he did the other; I applied to the servant again to pledge them, I called her up, she told me as before that she would send Mr. Gardiner's son, the young man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they produced? - One pound sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produced the one pound sixteen shillings? - The same servant as before, and it was given to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen that person since? - No, never since.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290052"></xptr>Q. I don't know whether you have seen the second pair of buckles and the watch? - (shewn them) I think it is the same buckles, and I think the same watch, but I had them so short a time in possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stop long after he got the produce of these buckles and watch? - About half an hour or three quarters.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know what business the prisoner follows? - I believe it is a carpenter; his father is a carpenter and joiner.</p>
               <p>Q. Your servant was busy washing that day, who let this gentleman in? - The servant she let the gentleman in, and he came up stairs to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the servant let him out too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe when these things were to be pawned you sent for the servant? - I called her up; she came into the room, and the gentleman gave her the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the gentleman in boots or shoes? - I don't know whether the gentleman was in boots.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know that! The gentleman was in boots, was not he? - No, he was not, he was in shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his hair powdered, or did he wear a wig? - His hair was not powdered at all, nor did he wear a wig, it was his own hair tied behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Cocked hat or a round hat? - It was a round hat I am pretty sure.</p>

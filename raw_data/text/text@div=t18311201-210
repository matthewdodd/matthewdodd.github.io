On the 29th of October, about seven o'clock, I received two half-crowns and fifteen shillings, for my wages - I met with a fellow-workman, and saw the prisoner and another girl in Whitechapel-road; I was quite sober - they accosted us, and we treated them with rum at a public-house, and when we got into the air, I became stupified and drunk - I am sure I had 12s. or 16s. when in the public-house in my left-hand pocket, and the two half-crowns were among them; I went no where with her, nor did I intend - when I came to myself, I found I was in the station-house; my money and a key were gone from the same pocket - the officer produced two half-crowns, 6s. 6d 1/2., and a key; I had some copper.</p>

               <p>JAMES SPELLER. This is my key.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence, stating that the Policeman had been drinking with her, and was quite intoxicated - that the prosecutor had stated he was so drunk that he did not know whether he had lost any money or not.</p>

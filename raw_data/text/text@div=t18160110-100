The prisoner came into my master's shop. between one and two, on the 11th January, in company with another woman. I was in the shop, and a lad with me. The female in company with the prisoner asked for some French cambrick. The prisoner kept her distance. I shewed the woman some cambrick. While she was looking at it, the prisoner stood about two yards off, and did no ask for any thing. The other woman bought half a quarter of a yard of the cambrick, the price of which was one shilling and nine pence. She gave me a three shilling piece, and I gave her the change. They both went out together; I looked over the cambrick, and missed a piece. In consequence of that, I went about seven doors off, and found the prisoner in another linen-draper's shop. I charged her with being concerned in this transaction. She denied it, and an officer was sent for, and she was taken up stairs. I am confident it was the piece which I have missed.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TURNER. I am an officer of Worship-street. I took charge of the prisoner at the linen-draper's shop. I asked her, if she had any thing of the kind about her, and she said, she had not. She was taken up stairs, and searched by a young woman belonging to the house, who went with me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100053"></xptr>three yards of cambric were found on her. She then said, she had bought it at the West End of the Town; but she afterwards said that the woman who had been with her, had given it to her.</p>

            . I was desired to search the prisoner. She took off her shawl, and then pulled the cambric from underneath her stays. I mean the cambric which was afterwards claimed by Platford. She first said, she had bought it, and afterwards she said; that the other woman had given it to her, and at the same time, she wished she had never seen her.</p>

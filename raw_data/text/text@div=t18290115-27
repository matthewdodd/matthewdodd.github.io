On the 18th of December, about a quarter before five o'clock, I was standing in my parlour, and saw an arm take something from the door - I ran across the shop, and missed a painting; I looked to the left, and saw the prisoner and no other person - he ran, and I pursued him, and took him in John-street, Golden-quare; I accused him of stealing my painting - he said he had not, and asked me if I had got it; I said, No; he said if I would forgive him he would tell me where it was - I said I would not; I took him back, and he said he would tell me, that it was in the private door of the next house - I went there, found it, and sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>JOHN JOHNSON. On Sunday the 1st of February, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my warehouse, in <placeName id="t18180401-8-crimeloc45">Scotland-yard</placeName>

I called to him, and he ran away. I got on the roof and said I would shoot him if he ran, he then surrendered. I gave him in charge. I had lost lead before, which made me watch. The lead was fixed to the building.</p>

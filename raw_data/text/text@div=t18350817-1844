I said went up to see Greenwich-hill—it was not for the sake of the sovereign that I told my master—I do not want it—I would have it if it was offered me—I never did anything wrong when I first went into master's employment; before that a boy took a hat gave it to me, and I was caught and fully committed at Hick's Hall.—I was put into the House of correction a day and a half, after I came out of Hick's Hall—I stayed there three months—I had slept out all night in Bishop Bonner's-fields—that was before I went to the house of correction at all—I know I stole four odd pattens—I have been in a pawnbroker's shop with my mother's things, but not without her knowledge; I did not remember that I have—a boy stole the pattens in Charles-street, Bethnal-green, and gave them to me to take to Brick-lane, and they caught me—I cannot recollect how much I was get—I believe I was promised something.</p>

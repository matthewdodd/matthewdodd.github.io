            . I live in Brewer's-court, Bedfordbury; the prisoner lodged in my house. On the 7th of July, about half-past eleven o'clock, I received thirty-nine sovereigns fourteen shillings and eleven-pence, at the Bank - Mary Knaven was with me. After receiving my money it rained, and we went into the Mansion-house, public-house, and had a pot of ale; I was in her company about two hours and a half, and parted with her in Fleet-street. I had drank three glasses of liquor and part of a pot of ale; when I parted from her, she asked if my money was safe, I felt and found it so. I went home about three o'clock, and went to bed in one of my lodger's rooms, it was the prisoner's room. I cannot say whether my money was then safe, I continued in bed from three to five o'clock; I had carried my money loose in my trowsers pocket; the last time I felt, it was in Fleet-street. I met nobody in the way home, nor did I stay anywhere that I recollect. I awoke at five o'clock, and my money was gone; I saw the prisoner at eleven that night, and saw him again next day, and he shewed me eleven sovereigns in a pocket book; I asked how he came by them, he said he had them from a young woman who he kept company with, and who had taken them from a foreigner overnight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERCAST. Q. Do not you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100113"></xptr>know that he was acquainted with a young woman - A. He knew a servant at Newton's hotel, St. Martin's-street, which is a house for the reception of foreigners; he said the woman had robbed the foreigner of it - I suspected that it was mine. I am sure it was safe when I left Knaven; I did not charge her with taking it. She was examined at Guildhall, on the 10th or 11th of July, for being in company with me; I could not then recollect when I had the money; it came to my memory next evening; she was two days in custody. I called at Knaven's house; I was not drunk when I went there - I carried her child home; she then came on to Fleet-street with me; I fell down on her stairs, as my foot slipped. I took the prisoner up three weeks after, he had not absconded, but lodged with me all the time. I never consulted a fortune-teller about it.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. You fell down at Knaven's house - A. Yes; my money was safe after that. I went to her house to ask about it, that occasioned words between me and her husband. I was taken before the Magistrate, and she was brought up by the Magistrate's desire.</p>

             - my husband is the prosecutor's first cousin; he is a bricklayer. I went to the Bank with him - he was sober. He received a great many sovereigns at the Bank, and put them into his breeches pocket; this was past twelve o'clock. He went to a public-house with me, and then went to my house; he drank some liquor, in Bow-lane; he had a pot of ale at a public-house, also three half quarterns of rum, and a quartern of gin - he was tipsy. I went as far as St. Paul's with him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got your money safe?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! Yes," said he, slipping his hand in his pocket, and I heard his money jingle. I parted with him at St. Paul's. I live in Great Trinity-lane - he went home with me before I parted with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you in custody - A. He came in the afternoon; the constable took me - I was discharged the same day.

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner lodged with us. On the morning of the robbery he wanted to borrow 2 s. 6 d. of me, to go to a raffle at night; I did not lend it him, and he got me to send my girl to pawn a pair of breeches, for 2 s. 6 d.; she went and brought me the half-crown, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and he never came to me for it. My husband came home after three o'clock, and went up and slept in the prisoner's room, till five o'clock. He came into the house while my husband was up stairs; I do not know whether he went up, for I went out, leaving him there. A woman, who lived with the prisoner, as his wife (but not in our house) was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I suppose she went into the prisoner's room whenever she came to the house - A. Yes; she and the prisoner had plenty of opportunities of going there - she was in the house between three and five o'clock, and the prisoner was there with her. He owed me 1 l. 15 s. 4 d. for rent, and paid me next morning, and said he got the money from a young woman who robbed a foreigner of it. He shewed me ten or eleven sovereigns in a pocket-book, and said he was to get 20 l. as a fortune with the young woman who he married; he married her two or three days after, and told me he was married by licence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you see the prisoner at the house - A. About a quarter after three o'clock; I was sitting in my room, and told him my husband had come home. The woman was in my room at the time, both before and after the prisoner came in. The prisoner's room is on the second floor; I went out, leaving them together - I was not absent a quarter of an hour.</p>

             re-examined. I came home about five o'clock - I do not know where the prisoner was then - he went to watch in Faby's place; I went into the room, and Faby was dressing himself.</p>

            . I knew the prisoner in Ireland and in England. I saw him with forty-seven sovereigns at the time Faby was robbed; he counted them twice at the raffle, and said he found them between Whitcomb-street and the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Are you sure it was on the day of the raffle - A. Yes; on the day before; it was at the Fortune of War, East-street.</p>

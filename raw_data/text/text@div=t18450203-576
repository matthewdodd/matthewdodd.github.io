I live in Carlisle-street, Lambeth, and am a labourer—I met the prisoner about one o'clock in the morning, on the 20th Jan., just by the Horns, at Kennington—it was a very wet night, and I had an umbrella—the prisoner appeared intoxicated, and she asked to come under the umbrella—I told her she had better go home, but she persevered, and came under my umbrella—she had not gone far before I found her hand in my pocket—I suspected my watch might go, and I put the chain inside—I took hold of her hand, and kept it—I saw the police<lb></lb>man, and I gave her to him, and I told him she had robbed me—he took her, and gave me his light to walk behind them—I saw her drop a six<lb></lb>pence and some coppers, and soon after a half-crown and some more coppers—I had had one half-crown, two shillings, a sixpence, and four<lb></lb>pence, which was perfectly safe when I left a friend at Brixton—it had taken me about an hour to walk from there to Kennington—I had felt outside my pocket several times on the road.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. He told you he was an ornamental painter? A. He did - I am a servant to the London Dock Company - I think it was about four o'clock I was disturbed - the clock struck after I got out of bed - I was in great confusion - my wife went up, and peeped through the key-hole into his bed-room, and saw him get into bed, going from the drawers - she was all in a tremble when she came down-stairs - my wife went up stairs after he was gone, to look into her drawers - she never said it was all right - the public-house I saw him at afterwards was near Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when she came down from looking at the drawer? A. She said she could not tell what was lost till she looked - but we went to bed after that, and I went to work when I got up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she give you to understand he had robbed her drawer? A. She said she had seen him at the drawer, and he jumped into bed.</p>

            . My husband was not at home when the lodgings were taken - the prisoner came with an old man, about ten o'clock in the morning - he said he had seen my husband over-night, and he wished to take the apartment - I took him and the old man up-stairs, showed them I had a good bed, and everything good belonging to it - they looked one at the other - the prisoner said,"What is it a week?" - I said 2s. 6d. - he said he should only want it to sleep in - I said, "Then you shall have it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200078"></xptr>for 2s. a week" - he gave 1s. earnest, and came at night, and always came home between nine and ten o'clock - on Wednesday, at four o'clock in the morning, I thought I heard my drawer open in the room he slept in - two of the drawers were unlocked, and one had the lock off - I heard him open the two little drawers - I ran up stairs, and he was shutting the one which was unlocked - I said, "What are you doing at my drawers, Sir?" - he never answered - I asked again, and he never answered - I took the handle of the door in my hand, and asked him again - he jumped into bed, and said, "Ah, Ma'am, me at your drawer? you had better come in and see" - I said I would, as soon as I could get admittance - I ran down and put some clothes on, and told Wilson, and we were both up together in the room - I had a petticoat over my shoulder, and went into the room - he said, "You had better look at your drawer;" but I had not power to see - he came down dressed, and said, "I owe you 1s., I will call and pay you," and went away at four o'clock in the morning - I looked into my drawer afterwards, and my lace-net was gone - I had it in my hand on Sunday, going to put it on, and I left it in the drawer which was unlocked - there were other things in the drawer - I did not miss anything else - that had been at the top of the drawer - nobody else had ever been in the room for six months before - the room had been empty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was not there in the day-time? A. No; he only came in once, to speak to my husband - I had seen the lace-net on the Sunday - on Wednesday he came, and on Wednesday-week I caught him at the drawer - I saw it on the Sunday before he came - my husband went down and put his clothes on - I looked to see what was gone, but was so confused - I had put the net at the top of the drawer - the prisoner said when I went up,"You had better look and see whether I have been stealing anything;" and I looked, but could not see then - I just opened the drawer and shut it again - I did not say it was all right - I missed it the very same day that he went - I never said it was a week before I missed it - I never mentioned a week - I have a top room furnished, which I let to a man and his wife - they were in the house, but I always kept the room the prisoner slept in locked - I always locked the door when he went out in the morning, and unlocked it ready for him at night - he never went out till eight o'clock - I was always up before him - I have not seen my black net since - there was a quantity of veils, clothes, and other things in the drawers - the net cost me 30s. - the veils did not lay in the same place - he never called afterwards to pay the shilling - he called on he Saturday following with a man, as my lodger infomed me, but I was not at home, and he knew that - but he did not come into the house.</p>

            . I am a policeman - on Thursday, the 26th of December, I received the prisoner in custody from two Thames police-officers - I went to his lodgings, and received from Mrs. Wilson two skeleton keys and other implements - I apprehended him in Backchurch-lane.</p>
               <p>MRS. WILSON. I found these implements under the grate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to lodge at the prosecutor's about the 20th of June - on Wednesday morning, about half-past four o'clock, the prosecutrix came up to my room and said I was at her drawers; I got out of bed, opened the door, and said she was mistaken - I came down stairs, dressed myself, and told her to go up stairs and see if she missed anything - she did so, and came down before I left the house, and said all was right, but she was certain she saw me at her drawer - I said it was not so - she said she had not seen the articles since the Sunday week before - I presume there is nothing to implicate me in the robbery, as she had other lodgers, and was often out in the day-time.</p>

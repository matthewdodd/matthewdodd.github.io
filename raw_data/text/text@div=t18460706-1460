R. H. on the silver, and G. H. on the ring—I asked where he got them—he said from Mr. Daniels', the Pantheon dining-rooms, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> Oxford-street, in which place he had lately lived—I asked how he got them out—he said in his dirty linen—he said he had wrenched the back hinges off a box that had been left in Mr. Daniels' care, but we found when dent to Mr. Daniel's that the top of the lock had been wrenched off—Rose had been out, but she returned during part of this conversation—the aid, yes, it was all right, they had tumbled over a good booty, it would be a good lift for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Randall, Freemantle, and Co., we carry on business as brewers in Hampstead-road. On 14th Oct. I saw the prisoner Gerhardt, he gave the name of John Henry Garrett, by word of mouth—it was in our counting-house I saw him—I think I had seen him before, about the beginning of the month—On 14th Oct. he said he had taken a house in Bath-place, New-road—he was fitting it up as a beer shop, and he wished to deal with us—he said he was a painter by trade, and he had recently come from Devonshire—he said he had laid out about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his house, and he stated that he had a lease of the house for twenty, one years, and he had paid a premium—we asked if he wanted credit—he said he did, and we asked for a reference—he said he had not been long in town, and he scarcely knew any one in London, but he could refer us to one, a respectable man, Mr. William Smith, of No. 8, College-place, Camden-town—he said Mr. Smith was a tailor, and he had known him for many years—I went and looked at the house in Bath-place, to see where it was situated, and I went to No. 8, College-place, Camden-town—I went in the course of the next day or two—at the house in College-place, Camden-town, I saw the prisoner Smithers—I mentioned that Garrett had referred to him, and asked him what he knew about him—I mentioned Garrett as a beer shop keeper, and that he had referred to him for his general character and respectability—on my so explaining to him, Smith said he had known Garrett for some time, and knew him to be an exceedingly honest and industrious man—he said he knew he had some little money, but not much, but he knew he was a very honest man—I think Smith did not say anything about the premises—he said that Garrett had come from the country—I believe I mentioned Devonshire myself—on that occasion Smith was dressed much as he is now—he had not any mark of his trade at that time—the next time I saw him was at his own house, about the 21st Oct.—that was after the first goods had been delivered—it was before any money had been advanced—the goods were delivered on the 14th, 22nd, and 23rd of Oct; this is the account of the goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had first seen Smith before any goods were sent—I had seen him before the first lot had been delivered, and a second time before the two last lots were delivered, and before the money was advanced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you have sent the goods if you had not heard from Smith the character he had given of Gerhardt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I would not have given credit unless I had had that character—I would not have given Gerhardt credit if I had known his name was Gerhardt—certainly not, because that name was well known to me, as having appeared frequently before me in the <hi rend="italic">Trade Protection Circular</hi>, in the Swindler's List—on the second interview with Smith he had a tape measure round his neck, over his shoulders—the first lot of goods that was sent to Gerhardt was four barrels of ale, one barrel of stout, and four barrels of porter—that was on 14th Oct—on 21st or 22nd</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310077"></xptr>
               <p>Oct. we supplied half a barrel of ale and some bottled beer, and some on the 23rd—the amount of the whole supplied was about 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we received a delivery ticket each time—this is one signed, "J. H. Garrett," on 14th Oct.—this other ticket is for the half-barrel, signed by the same party; and there is one other signed, but not by the prisoner—I have seen Gerhardt write on two occasions, and I believe these signatures to be his handwriting—our drayman is in Court, who saw him sign them—about 18th Oct. I saw Gerhardt again—he came to our counting-house, and said he had been pressed for payment by the party who was fitting up the house, and he could not open till the house was completed, and he had been disappointed of some money from the country—he wanted to borrow 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he offered, as security for it, to sign a bill of sale, or a deposit of his lease, or agreement for his house—we said that on advances of that kind we were usually satisfied with a joint note—he said he did not know who to go to, and I believe I suggested that perhaps Mr. Smith would be joined with him—(I bad seen Mr. Smith previously)—Gerhardt said he did not know whether be would, but he would ask him—he went away, and be came back to the brewery, I think on the 20th, and said Mr. Smith would be a security for him—on his saying that, I went and saw Mr. Smith on the 21st, at his own house, in College-place—I told him for what purpose I came; I said Garrett wanted an advance, and he had mentioned that he was willing to become security for him, and I asked if that was the case—he said he was not in the habit of doing such things, he did not like to put his hand to a bill, and he should not like his wife to know anything about it—I said we should make the advance entirely on the good character that he had given him; and if Garrett did not pay it, we should look to him—he said he hoped we should keep Garrett up to the mark, and get payment as soon as possible, to release him from his responsibility—upon that I drew a promissory note, and I saw Smith sign it—this is the note, signed by Smith, and signed afterwards by Garrett; and on Garrett's signing it, I gave him a check, which he indorsed, and we cashed it in our own counting-house—(<hi rend="italic">the promissory note being read, was dated October</hi> 21,1852,<hi rend="italic">for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable on demand, and signed William Smith and J, H. Garrett; the check was for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and indorsed, "J, H, Garrett</hi>")—this indorsement on it would merely show that he had received it—we have not received any payment, either for the goods or the note—we have received no payment at all—the goods were to be paid for a fortnight after he commenced business, as drawn; that is, such portion as he had sold was to be paid for—he would pay at the end of the fortnight for all that was drawn—it not having been paid, I wrote to Smith, and he called on us—that was about 14th Nov., about a month after the first supply of goods—I saw him when he called—he said he was sorry they had not been paid for, but he would go and see Garrett, and induce him to come round and make some arrangement—I said we should expect to have the amount paid, and the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. also—he said if the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid within a fortnight, he would pay it himself—I did not see him at the end of the fortnight—he did not call, and I wrote again to the same address; and that letter was returned by the post—I did not see either Garrett or Smith afterwards, till they were taken into custody—at the Police-office Smith gave the name of John Smith,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you said Garrett spoke by word of mouth, and did not write his name at the first interview? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not write his name—I went to the house where he represented he was carrying on a beer shop—it was in Bath-place, New-road, the corner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310078"></xptr>
               <p>of Tottenham-court-road, I found such a house as Garrett represented—it was apparently fitting up for a person who was going to carry on the beer business—it was being fitted up—a new front had been put in—I did not go inside—I did not see any other alteration outside—when Garrett first came to me he said he wanted some beer, he was going to start a new shop—I asked if he required credit, and he said, "Yes"—really I cannot say whether I was the first that mentioned about credit—I advanced the money for the purpose, as I understood, of paying the man who was fitting up the place—he applied for that purpose—brewers frequently advance money to publicans—I believe they do that to insure the custom of the men—I believe they do not do it to get the men a little in their debt—I do not frequently advance money—I object to it—I believe the large brewers do it—I advanced this money for a specific object—I had never known this man before—I would not have advanced the money to any other person, on a man's merely asking it—I would not have advanced this man 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the person who might have been pressing him, if he had not been a publican—it was in hopes of keeping the custom of the house—that was the motive that induced me to part with the money—I myself suggested Smith's name to be on the note—when I suggested it, Gerhardt did not readily and at once adopt it—certainly not—he said he must go and see Smith—I believe he came back to me on the subject of the note in the course of the next day, possibly the same day—he said he was a painter by trade—at that time he was a beer shop keeper—but he said he was a painter by trade, and he should be able to paint our sign boards—I believe he did not paint the front of his own house—I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that when you went to Smith he said that as far as he knew, Garrett had some money—not much—not a great deal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and he had known him many years as an industrious hard working honest man—Gerhardt told me he came from Devonshire—no part of the money has been paid, either for the note or the goods—Gerhardt gave me permission to dispose of the lease of the house—that was as soon as the first payment became due at the end of the first fortnight, or within a few days afterwards—we instructed the broker to find a customer for the house if possible—when he said he could not meet the first instalment, he said we might take the lease and dispose of it, and we did all in our power to dispose of the lease—we brought an action for this money against Gerhardt, and the action was stopped as soon as we knew what his character was—we took proceedings after we stopped the action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You first gave instructions for an action, and when you ascertained what character he was you stopped the action? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did—I certainly would not have advanced the money on this promissory note if I had not believed Gerhardt to be deserving of the character given him by Smith—I would not have supplied him with any portion of the goods if I had not believed him deserving of that character—it was after he had received all the goods that he instructed us to dispose of the house, about the beginning of November—we did not receive a farthing of money on the lease, or any agreement for a lease—we never had possession of the lease or agreement—after Gerhardt had made this representation to us, he never placed the lease or agreement in our hands—I did not call at the beershop myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>, I live at Grove-end Villa; I am landlord of the house No. 13, Jeffrey-terrace. I let that house to Gerhardt, under the name of Gerhardt—he did not spell or write it—I let it him about the beginning of Sept.—he remained one quarter; no, I am wrong, it was at the Midsummer quarter I let it him, on 25th June; he remained till the end of that quarter—he did not pay any rent—he gave me a reference to a cornchandler and potato shop in Park-street—I do not know the number—I went there, and received a good character—when be left, he did not give me up the keys—every key was gone from all the locks, and the front iron gate too—when I found he was gone, I employed a smith to make keys—I went to the place in Park-street, and that man was gone also.</p>

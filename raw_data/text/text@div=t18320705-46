On the 25th of May I invited a friend, named Briton, to dinner - he brought the prisoner with him, as a friend of his; I had seen him once or twice before with Briton - we all dined together at the stable, where I am on board wages; I had a watch hanging up in my window - it was safe at twenty-five minutes after two o'clock; the prisoner looked at it, and observed it was that time - I went out at half-past, and the prisoner and Briton went down with me; I did not miss the watch till the evening - I suspected the prisoner, and spoke to the officer; we went to where the prisoner lived, and the watch was found in a box, which the prisoner produced the key of; he was in bed at the time.</p>

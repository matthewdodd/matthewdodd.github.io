               <p>Q. You saw him two days after, and was honest enough to tell him you had received two pounds for it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What repairs did you do? - A.There was a new lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you scratch the maker's name off? - A. No.</p>

On Wednesday morning I went to my box for something, and found my box broke open; it was in the garret where I slept; out of the box I lost the different articles mentioned in the indictment; in the afternoon, I went round to several pawnbrokers, and found most of the property at Mr. Dobree's, the corner of Charlotte-street, Rathbone-place; behind the box I found a chopper, which I suppose it was broke open with; it has my master's name on it, it was taken from the area where we kill the sheep.</p>

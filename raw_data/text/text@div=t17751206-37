               <p>On the 6th of November I had a trunk from Mr. Bedder's to carry to Islington: I did not examine the contents; it was not locked, but secured with a cord. I stopt at the Flower-Pot, in Threadneedle-street, where I always take in parcels; somebody came and called out to me,</p>
               <p>"you have lost all the things out</p>
               <p>"of your cart." I went out and met a carman bringing the trunk in upon his back; there was no direction upon it; I always carried it once a month, it was that trunk which I had from Mr. Bedder's.</p>

            . On the 6th of November, about seven at night, as I was coming from my work, just as I passed the Flower-Pot, alehouse, I saw two men carrying a trunk upon their shoulders from the cart then standing at the door; they crossed the street into a court, and I followed them; the prisoner then lifted it up on the other man's head; I thought it was not their property, so shook the man who carried it on his head by the shoulder: Miller walked as close as he could to the man, who threw it down from the right side of his head, with an intent, as I thought, to let it fall on me. I then cried out stop thief; the other man ran away, and a butcher pursued him. Miller turned back and walked behind the cart; I took him, but the other man is not yet taken.</p>
               <p>Did Miller make any resistance? - No; he said he was not guilty. I brought the prisoner in my hand, and a hackney coachman brought the box into the alehouse: I did not know what was in the box till next morning, when we went before alderman Wilkes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner had one end of the box on his shoulder? - Yes, I am sure he had.</p>

               <p>As I was coming along the street, on the left hand side of the way, I heard a man cry out stop thief; he said here is one of them, and took me into the alehouse; they looked at me several times. Certainly, if I had been the man who had taken it, I should have ran away. I <rs id="t17751206-37-deflabel157" type="occupation">sell apples and pears about the streets</rs>

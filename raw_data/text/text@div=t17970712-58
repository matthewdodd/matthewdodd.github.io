            , ESQ. sworn. - I live in Effex-street, the prisoner was cook in my house, upwards of a twelvemonth; I lost a vast variety of articles, those in the indictment are the only ones that I have been able to trace; she left my house, or rather eloped about a quarter before twelve; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120048"></xptr>had been ordered to deliver what plate she had in her custody, to her mistress before she went away; I was in my study, and she told me she had delivered all, except a desert-spoon, which she said she was going out into the yard to look for, that some of the children had had it out in the morning at breakfast; she was gone a great while, I went to look for her, and concluded she had got over the wall to my next door neighbour, Mr. Richardson's; I immediately knocked at their door, and was informed that she had been let into their house by their servant two or three minutes before, and in great agitation, had gone through the house, and run into the street; I immediately charged the watch with having observed her going out, the watchman stands next to our door, and he denied that he had seen her the whole of the evening, when a quarter of an hour before that he had received her box, and which he then had in his watch-box; I roused several of my neighbours, and between three and four in the morning she was apprehended coming to the watch-box for her trunk; she was brought to my house and examined, in the presence of seven or eight different persons; upon her person was found these two forks, and the duplicates, by means of which we have treaced some of the property, which is in the hands of the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no promises made her of any kind, were there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those forks? - A. They are my property, I can swear to them, they have the crest of the person from whom I had them.</p>

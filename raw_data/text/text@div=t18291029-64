The prisoner came to my house on Friday night, and engaged a bed for his father and himself; they slept there that night, and on Saturday - the prisoner was about the house all the morning, reading a book of his own; he went away about noon, and about half-past nine o'clock in the evening I missed a watch and stand from the mantel-piece of the room he slept in - he had returned two or three hours before; I charged him with it - he denied knowing any thing about it: I sent for an officer, and gave him in charge - a knife and comb, but no money, were found on him; he, wanted to speak to me privately - the officer would not allow it; he said if we would give him back what we had taken from him, he would tell us where the watch was, he would shew us the pond they were in; he tucked up his sleeve, and pulled the bottom of the stand out of the pond - the watch was found afterwards in the same place; he said he had put them there, seeing a woman coming up the hill - he thought it was my wife pursuing him. having missed the property: I believe I said if he told where they were I would let him go.</p>

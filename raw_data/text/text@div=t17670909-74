            . I was at the Swan tavern on Fish-street-hill on the 27th of July, between nine and ten in the evening, the prisoner offered some ribbon to the cook and the bar maid to sell; I said, I doubted he stole it; he said his father was a ribbon-weaver, and he gave him a piece-of ribbon every day to sell; I took it out of his hand, and asked him what he was; he appeared by his clothes like a bricklayer's labourer; he said he was a bad-boy; I asked him who he worked for; he said, for a person in Abchurch-lane, whom I knew; I sent for him, but he was gone to bed; the maid told me, if I would go to the George in East-cheap, there were some of his servants; I went; they said he had worked there, but they had turned him away for being a bad boy; then I charged the constable with him, and sealed the ribbon up in a paper, and gave it to him; then the prisoner told me he stole it in the <placeName id="t17670909-74-crimeloc440">Borough</placeName>

               <p>Mrs. Tullett. The prisoner very frequently came to our shop in the Borough, and asked to see some ribbons; he has bought some several times; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090067"></xptr> shewed him two boxes, on the 27th of July in the evening; when he went away, the shop was shut up immediately, and we did not miss any thing that night; this gentleman, Mr. Taylor, came in the morning with a piece he had cut off and asked if we had any to match that; we looked, but could not find it; (the ribbon produced in court;) this ribbon and another piece were taken out of the box over night, it is our property.</p>

            . On the 31st of December last I was crossing Holywell-street, Shoreditch, opposite of Mr. Clark's house, and just as I got upon the curb-stone I saw the prisoner take the pelisse from the door. He ran away with it under his left arm. I called out, stop thief, and pursued him; a man named Constable stopped him. The prisoner threw down the pelisse. I picked it up, and seized hold of the prisoner. I saw him throw it down, and with assistance I brought him back to Mr. Clark's shop, and while a constable was gone for, the prisoner tried to make his escape out of the shop, but the mob being at the door he could not get out. I marked the pelisse with a needle and thread, and then I delivered it

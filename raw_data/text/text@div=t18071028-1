I asked him how he came by the clock, he said his wife's father gave it her twelve years ago; I told him it was a long way to bring this clock for a guinea and a half; he did not know the value of it; he persisted that it was his, and he wanted the clock back; I told him I should not part with him nor the clock unless he could refer me to some respectable person in town. I asked him whether he knew the name on the clock, he said no, he knew the number. The name on the clock is Bellamy. He told me the number was 185; it is 183. I took him to Marlborough-street office, and have kept the clock ever since.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 15th of October the last witness brought the prisoner and the clock to the office; I went to Mr. Bellamy in Pall Mall, I found it belonged to Mr. Casanager; the prisoner said it was his for the last twelve years, and it had been in his family for thirty years. The prisoner confessed to Mr. Casanager that he got in at the window on the night of the 14th of October, and took out the clock.</p>

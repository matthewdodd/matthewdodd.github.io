               <p>I am the patrol of St. John's and St. Margaret's; on the morning of the robbery, which was the 9th of June, I saw the prisoners about a quarter before three, they were both very near together, the prisoner Willis had a bundle, we saw them run across Strutton Ground, and we pursued them down Pye-street.</p>
               <p>Did they see you pursue them? - I cannot be sure, but they run, we pursued them near a quarter of a mile, and took Willis, and he was endeavouring to throw this bundle over a pair of high gates after the other prisoner Hinton; Hinton had got very near the gates; after I came up to them, one was upon the gate and the other was throwing the bundle after him, I attempted to stop Willis, but he made a short turn and got from me. I took the bundle and made the alarm of stop thief! and the watchman stopped Willis in New Peter-street.</p>

               <p>How do you know he was the same man? - I knew him before, and I saw him getting over the gates.</p>

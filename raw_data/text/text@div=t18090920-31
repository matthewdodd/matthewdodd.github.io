            . I searched the prisoner on the night of the 14th. I found two duplicates in his small clothes pocket, in his right hand coat pocket I found this one pound note, the duplicate of the watch was found in his hat by my brother officer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning as I went out to work, I heard of his missing his small clothes and his watch. I went out to work, when I came home at night two officers were in the little parlour, the man that lost his watch, and two or three more were sitting in the tap-room he said, Thomas we have had two men searched, we should like you to be searched, I said I had no objection; Stanton took off my hat, and put my things by, that I could not get at them, he found two duplicates and a one pound note in my pocket, he said you must come along with me, I said I had no mind of going as I had nothing to do with it my hands were tied. I was cock found the piece of paper in my hat, the landlord and the men were there. The pawnbroker thinks fit to swear to me, I know nothing of the watch. I sent to the prosecutor he came to me in my imprisonment. I offered him four guineas for the watch although I was innocent of it, he said the officers would not let him do any thing of the kind.</p>

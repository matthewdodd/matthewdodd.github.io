            ; on the 17th of October, I was returning home about a quarter after six; I live in Berwick-street; I was in a coach; and when I came to the <placeName id="t17861025-77-crimeloc446">New church in the Strand</placeName>

               <p>Could you see what pulled it? - No, I did not see any body then; my attention was fixed on the bundle; then I had a second pull, by that pull I was obliged to let go to save myself from falling out of the coach; then I saw my bundle on a man's back by the side of the coach; I got up, and cried out stop thief.</p>
               <p>How large is this bundle? - Here it is; (a large bundle) the man was a little man, in a dark coat, and a flapped hat; nobody came to my assistance, but I called out, and the people called out; I saw the man turn up a turning; the coach was going on all the time, upon that the coach stopped, and the man made his escape with the bundle.</p>

               <p>How far was he from the coach when you saw him? - I suppose it might be ten or fifteen yards; I am not sure it was the same man I saw behind the coach; then Mrs. Brown called out stop thief; and I went up to the coach, and she said she had been robbed of a bundle; the man turned up the New-buildings by the church; I am sure the prisoner is the man that had the bundle on his back.</p>

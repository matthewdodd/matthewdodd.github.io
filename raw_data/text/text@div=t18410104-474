                  </hi>. I keep a cigar-shop in Serle-place, Old-street-road. About eight o'clock, in the evening of the 27th of December, I was in the parlour—I saw the prisoner in the shop, leaning over, and taking some<lb></lb>thing—he went out—I went after him, and met him coming towards the shop—I accused him of leaving my shop abruptly—he denied that he had been there—he then came in, and had some tobacco—I had not missed the box of cigars, and did not miss them till he had left the shop again—when he went away I found that the box of cigars had been stolen exactly from the part where he had been leaning over—I have not seen them since.</p>

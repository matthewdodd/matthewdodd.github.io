D. Hill."—I had sent the spirits on the Tuesday—I asked him to walk into the counting-house, and called Hill's man forwards, who said the prisoner was employed within a few doors of his master's—he wrote me down his name, "J. Watkins"—I took him to Vauxhall in a cab—he said, "I will go in and ask master to go with you to Mr. Hill's"—he then went into his ma<lb></lb>ter's—we went and searched his master's premises, but could not find him—we found wet foot-marks on the window—he had escaped over the houses.</p>

On the 26th of March, I received a letter from the prisoner, to take to Mr. Fearon, about three o'clock—he said he would wait in Farringdon-street, till I came back with the goods—I delivered the letter to Perritt, who walked out—I went out and met the prisoner standing outside the door—I said, "There is the man that gave me the note"—when he engaged me, he told me to take the goods to the Post-office.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH CRADDOCK. On the morning of the 23rd of December, about two o'clock, I went through <placeName id="t18320105-93-crimeloc535">Newcastle-court</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. You had used the house before; you sat down in a chair, and threw 1s. on the table, and said,"Landlady, fetch some gin." Witness. No, I never was in the house in my life before; I merely went there to give her some refreshment.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was called in, and received charge of the prisoner; there was another woman in the room - I searched them both, but found nothing; the landlady came into the room, but I did not search her, as the prosecutor said she had not been there when he lost his purse.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prosecutor sober; he had been drinking, but was sober enough to tell what had happened - he stated at Bow-street the same as he has here; the landlady stood on the opposite side of the room; she went in when I did.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH CRADDOCK. I had been drinking freely, but was not tipsy; I might have been a little elevated, but I am certain her hand was in my pocket - the landlady said the next day, "Your nine sovereigns are not worth a brass candlestick; part of it shall go to pay a good counsel to defend her."</p>

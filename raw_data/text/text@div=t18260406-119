On the 18th of March I had some staves at Limehouse-hole, which came to my house in carts; I heard some had been stolen and counted them over, when I missed eighteen out of nine thousand; I have seen them since - I believe these are mine - they were exactly of this appearance.</p>

               <p>Prisoner PEARCE. You did, and they were taken away in carts, and when they were nearly all carted you sent a truck with your two sons to get them, and I helped to push it. Witness. I never employed him in my life; I saw him dancing on a board, and then I saw him pushing the truck - I should have given him something, but I had no change about me.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Hill, of Limehouse-hole. I saw a barge laden with staves on the 18th of March; they were landed close by our counting-house, and I saw the two prisoners assisting to unload them; I saw Pearce assist to put them into the cart, and in the course of the day I saw him take some and hide them behind a chain cable; I then saw Scott take a long stave and lay it on the ground, and stretch himself upon it; he had before that taken some and laid them behind an enginepipe; I afterwards heard them talking about the division of the staves - one said "You shall not have ten and me eight;" Pearce said "I stole them," and the other said "I watched, and I have as much right to them;" there was then about one truck load to go away, and Mr. Biggs' two little boys were there; the prisoners used to send<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060055"></xptr>them away while they took them; I saw Scott take nine staves which I stopped him with; I then saw Pearce go down to the river at low water, and get up some long and short staves from the mud.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PEARCE. Q. Why did you not report to the owner when you saw me take them? A. I did not know but that he was employed by Mr. Briggs, and I knew they would come back to take them from the place, where they had hidden them.</p>

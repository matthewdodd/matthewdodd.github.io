                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Auty, gateman at the City Canal-gate, Blackwall, in the Parish of Poplar. On Saturday, the 25th of August, I was awoke by Meek early in the morning, and in consequence of what he said I looked at the window of the back parlour—a piece of canvas which had been nailed to the window, to secure it, was broken in two between the nails—the window had been fastened down for a long time previous—the prisoner had lodged in the house, and left on the Mon<lb></lb>day before—he had no right in my house on the night in question—I found a pair of stockings belonging to a young woman next door in my house after the alarm—I lost two penny-pieces out of my pocket at the head of the cradle on the ground floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the prosecutrix's house—I sleep in the front room, first floor. About two o'clock in the morning I was awoke by a basket opening, which stood at the foot of my bed, containing my clothes and my brother's—I alarmed Mrs. Auty, called for a light, and told her I believed there was somebody in my room, as I heard the basket lifted up—I jumped out of bed the second time, and on searching my room found the prisoner concealed under my bed—I pulled him out, and charged him with stealing a jacket which I had lost since he left the house on the Mon<lb></lb>day—he denied the charge, and said he came for a night's lodging—Mrs. Auty afterwards shewed me a pair of stockings.</p>

I met a woman of the town upon Ludgate-hill, the prisoner, I believe; I think it is she, I am not sure; I was a little in liquor. I come from North Wales. I went to a tavern with her, and we had a glass of wine. I had my watch in my pocket then; I missed it before I went out; I called the waiter up when I missed it, and bid him fetch the watchman. I asked her if she had got my watch, she said, No. When the watchman came, we searched her, and found it upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any money from you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No.</p>

               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Whether he did not give me the watch?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I cannot tell; I pulled it out of my breeches pocket, and put it in my waistcoat pocket, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the watch?</p>
               <p>Thomas. In the inside.</p>

            . I am a constable. I attended at Bride's watch-house the night this happened. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing his watch; he said he had searched her, but could not find it. I examined him very strictly; he said, when he went to do with her, he pulled it out of his breeches, and put it into his waistcoat pocket. She denied it: I was obliged at last to make use of force to search her. Two watchmen threw her on the table, and opened her legs, and I took it out of her inside, out of her private parts. The chain, and every thing, was concealed.</p>

I asked him for a present; he said, he had but a shilling: he said, he would make me a present of four shillings, if I would stop; I would not: then he said, he would give me his watch to hold till he gave me the money; afterwards he insisted upon having his watch again; I concealed it, that he should not have it till he paid me the money.</p>

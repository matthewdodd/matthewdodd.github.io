                  </hi> I am twelve years old, and live with my father and mother, at Homerton.

I went into Lee-fields to play with William and John Guy, and two little girls—the prisoner came there, and said, "Will you go to Temple-mills with me?"—he said so to all of us—William Guy said, "No"—he asked me and Eliza to go—William said, "Eliza, don't you go," and to me, "Elizabeth, don't you go, he will drown you"—I came away—he took Eliza by the hand, and led her away—we all fol<lb></lb>lowed—he went over a bridge with Eliza—that was not Temple-mills-bridge—we all crossed the bridge—he sat on the grass, put Eliza on his lap, and put his hand up her petticoats—she screamed—I said to him, "Will you let that little girl come away?"—he did not let her go—William went up to help her—the prisoner then put his hand into his right pocket, took two farthings out, gave one to Eliza, and one to John—he had given me a half<lb></lb>penny before, when he first wanted me to go—the prisoner ran across Temple-mills-filed, towards Temple-mills—we all went home as fast as we could—Eliza walked home—she cried—I saw the blood running down her legs—when I got home I told Mrs. Guy—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man—I saw him again the same evening, and pointed him out.</p>

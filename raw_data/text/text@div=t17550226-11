The prisoner asked me to go along with him to the prosecutor's house at Ponder's-end, knowing nobody lived in it then, we went; he broke the lower hinge of the back-door, and I the other, about ten o'clock at night; then we went and looked about, and took away a warming-pan, a five-pint pewter tankard, a brass pot with a lid to it, a copper saucepan with a lid, two brass clock-weights, we carried them to Norton-falgate, and the prisoner sold them to a brasier in his shop, but I don't know his name.

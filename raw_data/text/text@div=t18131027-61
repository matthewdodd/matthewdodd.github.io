I employed him to do a job for me, one in Bishopsgate-street, the other into Thames-street; he came back; for one I paid him nine pence, and the other three pence. He then asked me whether I had another job. I told him no, not at present. After that, I went to the public-house and had half a pint of beer. I went back to the warehouse. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards I was coming down stairs; I met the prisoner three parts of the way up stairs. As I was coming out he ran down stairs. I ran after him. He began to throw some dirt about that lay at the bottom of the stairs, and said what time in the morning shall I come to you to see if you have any thing for me to do; he said, about twelve o'clock? I said, yes, he might. He said he should not go home directly; he should go to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270045"></xptr>wharf to see if he could get a job there. I saw no more of him after that. This was about half after five. I went to the door the next morning; I found the warehouse door open. This was about nine o'clock in the morning. I went to the desk, I found ten pound was gone; nine pound in notes, and about a pound in silver and copper. I went over to Mr. Kempster's young man, and told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what notes they were - A. Yes, a five pound note and four ones.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, and took him to the Compter. I then went to his lodgings, with the officer of the Compter with me, and in searching we found in the cover of a tureen forty-one shillings, seven three-shilling pieces, five eighteen-pieces, and twelve shillings and sixpence in silver. In a cartouch box we found three one-pound notes. We then went to the Compter, and asked the prisoner what he had done with the five-pound note. He told us that he had bought a pair of shoes, and had given eight shillings and two pence for them, and changed the five-pound note with the shoemaker to pay for them. We went to the shoemaker; he had paid it away. We traced the note until we got it.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Jeffery Smith. I remember forty-eight sacks of potatoes being put into the prisoner's waggon - I helped to load them; the prisoner was not near at the time, but I saw him drive the waggon away, after it had stood there about three hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is Mr. Smith's name? A. Jeffery; I have seen his name on the waggon - I was not at the wharf all the time; after the waggon was loaded I was backwards and forwards - there were a great many people in the wharf, perhaps a hundred, doing their work; I recollect the prisoner having two hundred and five cheeses booked to him, and he delivered two hundred and fourteen- I cannot say whether there were forty-eight sacks in the waggon when it went away.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Palmer. On the night in question the prisoner brought the potatoes to my master's; I assisted to unload them - when I had got eight or ten sacks out of the waggon, the prisoner said "I have an empty sack and I will put it into the mouth of your sack, to make all right," I said, I should not do any such thing - I carried in that sack of potatoes, came back, and the empty sack was in the mouth of the next whole sack I was to carry in; he said "You must do it now - you can do it if you like; I will give you a drop of gin to make it all right," I said I should do no such thing, but he must take the sack out, put it in the bottom of the waggon, and I should see if the full number were delivered, when the sacks were counted; as the sacks were emptied they were placed against the counter in the shop; I carried one or two more sacks in - the prisoner again said, "You must do it," and there was the empty sack in the month of another; I said, I should do no such thing - he took the sack out with his left hand, and threw it down into the bottom of the waggon; when the sacks were all taken out, I did not go back to the waggon - there were only forty-seven sacks carried in and emptied.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether any person might have emptied a sack of potatoes on the wharf you cannot tell? A. No.</p>

            . I am clerk to a gentleman in Tooley-street. I saw forty-eight sacks of potatoes in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there when the waggon was loading? A. Yes; that was between one and two o'clock; the waggon left about five - I did not stay by it, I went away; I did not see the prisoner come to it, nor see it go away; I believe there was a tarpauling over it when it stood in the yard in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How were the sacks placed? A. Four rows of nine in each, and twelve laid at the top of them; they were not tied on the top.</p>

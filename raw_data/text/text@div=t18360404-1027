On the 5th of April I met the prisoner as near two o'clock as I can recollect—I was the worse for liquor, and hardly recollect any thing about the matter, but I know I had the money in my pocket when I met the prisoner in Bow-street—I went with her to a house, No 8, Charles-street, Drury-lane—I had then three so<lb></lb>vereigns, and a little other money, but I cannot recollect what—I laid down on the bed—I had not given the prisoner any money—I was awoke about four o'clock by the mater of the house—the prisoner was then gone, and my money also—the master of the house had given me change for a so<lb></lb>vereign.</p>

I remember the pri<lb></lb>soner coming there, with the witness, about two o'clock on Tuesday morning—the prisoner had lodged there about six months—she took the prosecutor to her room, and as they were passing the passage, the prosecu<lb></lb>tor asked if I would give him change for a sovereign—I gave him three half-crowns, and the rest in small silver—I did not see that he had any other sovereigns—he then went up-stairs, and in the course of an hour after. wards (I had fastened the street door) I heard somebody coming down stairs—I opened my door, and saw the prisoner coming down, with her shoes in her hand—I asked where she was going—she said to get some gin—I said she should not go out till I saw that her friend was all right, knowing that he had had change of me—I then double-locked the door, went up-stairs, and tried to awake the prosecutor, but I could not—he was in bed, and I saw his clothes—he had no money left—I came down, and accused the prisoner, who was by the door, of robbing him of the change of a sovereign—she said he gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was all the money she had—I sent for an officer, but previous to the officer coming, she said she did not want to rob him, and sooner than I should give her in charge, she would give me a bag containing 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a silk handkerchief—the officer then came, and took hold of her throat, and two sovereigns came from her mouth into his hand.</p>

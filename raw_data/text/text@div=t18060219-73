On Saturday, the 12th of October, 1805, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was standing behind the counter, I perceived a person taking a cheese out of the shop, I pursued him, and took him with the cheese on his shoulder, I asked him where he had got the cheese from, he told me that two men gave it to him; I immediately gave him to a watchman; he was taken to St. Ann's watch-house, and the cheese likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cheese standing in the shop. - A. Yes, about a quarter of a yard from the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish him to say whether it was me or no, I have been to sea six months, and the charge that is laid against me is not above four months ago.</p>
               <p>Court. (to witness) How came you to keep him so long in goal. - A. He broke out of the watchhouse, and made his escape.</p>
               <p>Jury. You do not say that he took it out of the shop after all. - A. Yes, I followed him, and took him with the cheese, he was never out of my sight.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable and watchhouse keeper. On the 12th of October last, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner was brought to the watchhouse by the prosecutor, I took charge of him for stealing this cheese; I locked him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man. - A. I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had known him before. - A. I had seen him many times before; the cheese has been in my possession ever since; he broke out of the watchhouse on Sunday, when me and my wife were at dinner; I happened to hear that he was in Bridewell, I lodged a detainer against him; I found him in Bridewell; I produce the cheese.</p>
               <p>Lamb. I am sure it is my master's cheese, and I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That gentleman came to the goal where I was sent to by the lord mayor for a month, he brought a watchman with him, he asked that man if I was the young man that he had in custody; he told the man he did not think I was the man.</p>
               <p>Hawthorn. I had no watchman with me, I had only another constable with me, that came to lodge a detainer against him.</p>

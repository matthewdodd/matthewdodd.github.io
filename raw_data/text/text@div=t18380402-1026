                  </hi>. I live in Old Bond-street—I am a perfumer, and have one partner. There was a fire on my premises on the evening of the 6th of February, and such goods as could be saved were removed to the premises of Mr. Lonsdale, opposite—the prisoner was his servant, and was very active in carrying the goods over—a great deal was saved—we missed the articles enumerated in the indictment when our attention was called to them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—here is a liquor-flask, two brushes, a looking-glass, a razor-strop, a scent-bottle, twelve pairs of gloves, and other things—they are the property of myself and partner—I can swear to them—the paper round the gloves has our mark on it—they were safe on the pre<lb></lb>mises on the night of the fire.</p>

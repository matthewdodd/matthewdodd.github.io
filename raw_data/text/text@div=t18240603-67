On the 28th April, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, locked my sitting-room up, and latched the outer door after me. I have no lodgers. The street door could be opened from the outside. I returned in three quarters of an hour, and found it wide open; hearing somebody on the stairs, I called out,</p>

               <p>"Is any one on the stairs?" no answer was made. I went up three stairs, and found some one was coming down - the stairs being narrow and dark, I stepped out into the street, and the prisoner came down with a large bundle and an umbrella in his hand. I let him pass me for several yards, and when he had got to the light, I saw my gown and cloak sticking out of his bundle. I stepped up, and caught hold of him, saying,</p>
               <p>"My friend, this is mine." He said, it was no such a thing. I said,</p>
               <p>"I insist upon having it." He threw the bundle at me, saying,</p>
               <p>"Take it." I took it up, and called Stop thief! He was brought back in four or five minutes. I am sure of his person - the bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment, which were all in my room on that day - they are worth about 44 s. He had wrapped them in his own apron.</p>

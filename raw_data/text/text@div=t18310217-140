            . I am a Police-constable. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prosecutor and prisoner standing together opposite each other, near the Cumberland's Head, public-house - I saw them separate; the prisoner crossed the road, and joined a party consisting of three women and a man; I waited, saw the prosecutor come by some rails, cross, and take the prisoner - he came about six or seven yards before he crossed; I had seen her join the party, and separate from them - I heard him ask her for his money, and she said, "What money?" I crossed the road, and asked what was the matter; the prosecutor said, "She has robbed me of eight half-crowns," and I took her to the station-house - there was only a pocket-piece found on her; she had not staid with the party more than two or three minutes, when she left them and crossed to meet the prosecutor - she had stood close to the party, and had opportunity of passing the money to those persons if she had been so minded; both she and the prosecutor were sober.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor, and asked him to give me something to drink - he refused; I saw the officer coming, and I crossed to go home - the prosecutor then came, and asked me for money; I said I had had none that night.</p>
               <p>JURY to ZACHARIAH HILL. Q. Had you any other money besides the half-crowns? A. Not any - I am quite sure they were safe within less than half a minute of her joining me; I do not know what had induced me to feel it, but I did feel it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was you in the same street when you felt it? A. Yes, not ten yards before - I had put the eight half-crowns into my pocket about two o'clock that day, and had not spent any part of it; I am quite sure it was all in my pocket- my coat was not buttoned.</p>

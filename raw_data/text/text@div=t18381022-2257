                  </hi>. I live in Nicholas-lane, King William-street, and am an apprentice to Mr. Dennis Hickey. On the 20th of September the two prisoners came to my master's shop about two o'clock, and Smithers wanted to be measured for a waistcoat—I said my master was not in, and they had better call at four o'clock—they came at half-past five o'clock and my master was not in—I put down the name on the board, and saw the prisoner Atkins put a pair of trowsers into his bag, and the things in the window were thrown about—no one stood near the window but Smithers and the window was in order when he came in—one pair of trowsers were thrown from one part of the window to the other—I locked the door, and called my master—I came in with the officer, and the trowsen were not found on Atkins—they were thrown on the table again—the pair they had was worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other pair that was moved was worth 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smithers</hi>. I asked to see some patterns—he asked me my name, and began to write it down—he said, "Stop, I will go and get the pen and ink"—he went, and called his master and the officer—he seized Atkins and said, "You d—d rascal, put the trowsers out of the bag," and he had</p>

I saw Atkins take one pair of trowsers, and put them into the bag, he then came and stood by the side of Smithers—Smithers said that Mr. Hickey had made him a coat before.</p>

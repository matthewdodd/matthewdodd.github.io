            . Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, I lodge at No. 6, Charles-street, in a one pair of stairs back room. On the 5th of October, in the morning, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came to light his pipe; he had this white handled fork that laid upon the table; I am sure it is the same fork, the prongs are broke now; they were not then.</p>

Going along the street, I met two girls carrying two bundles; these girls asked me if I would take care of them bundles till the morning. I did; I left them at Mrs. Price's till I called for them. These girls brought the things into Mrs. Price's, where they were two hours.</p>

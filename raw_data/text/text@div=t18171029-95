            . I keep the Red Lion, at Brentford. On the 24th of October, Kilsby was moving his goods which he had left with me; I set the prisoner, Humphries, who is my hostler, to mind them; while Kilsby was gone with one load I ran into the yard to send him out, and saw him, and Baker, at the box; the moment they heard me coming, they shut the box; I drew back, and returned through the gateway into the yard, and secreted myself to watch them; I saw Humphries take a pelilsse out of the box, and run from the coach-house into the stable where I was-it being dark, he did not see me; while he was gone, Baker took a white gown out-on his return, Baker said he should have it, as it would make him some handkerchiefs; Baker put his hand in, and pulled out a gown and waistcoat-my sister came out and asked them if I was there - They said I was not; they hustled up the things that she should not se them - She went in, and they ran into the stable and placed the things with the others; Baker put the gown in the corn-bin. On their return to the coach-house, the cart came back, and took the other things away; I came out and told the prisoners to load the cart; Humphries went and took the things which he had taken, and put them in the hay-loft among the straw, locked the door, and came into the yard. I told him to take out the beer-when he returned, I got the things out of the stable, from behind the straw, and the gown from the corn-bin, and brought them into the kitchen, and asked Humphries if he knew anything of the property - He said he picked them up in the coach-house; I said, "You are a pretty fellow," he said they were not worth more than 1s., altogether. I sent for the prosecutor - he claimed the property; the prisoner said Baker took the gown - We sent for him and he acknowledged it. I gave them both in charge.</p>

He was brought home about three o'clock, by Gray, an officer, without any of the property.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SANDLAND. I am thirteen years old. My master sent me out at twelve o'clock, with some silver to be flatted, and five sovereigns to get 20 ozs. of sterling silver. I got the silver from Collings, in Jewin-street; I had then 27 ozs. in my bag, and was taking it home; the prisoner came up to me in <placeName id="t18261026-13-crimeloc70">Little Moorfields</placeName>

I was to go about thirty yards down the street; I gave him the bag to hold, and went a little way, then looked back, and saw he was gone; I returned without going to the house, but could not find him - I have never found the silver; I am certain of his person; I saw him again about a fortnight ago, in a court in Wood-street, as I was going to Goldsmith's-hall. He came up to me and said, "I think I know you." I said, "Yes, and I know you; it was you who stole my silver." He was then sneaking off, and said to two boys, "Hold him while I run away;" - they struck me, and almost knocked me down, but I pursued, calling Stop thief! and he was stopped. I am quite sure he is the person.</p>

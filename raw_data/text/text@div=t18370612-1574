                  </hi>. I am an under-gardener, and live at Denham. On Monday, the 12th of June, I was at Uxbridge, about eleven o'clock at night—I was sober—I saw the prisoner at the Gardeners' Arms, where I was—I had seen her before—we got into conversation, and went up the yard together—my watch was then in my fob, and my handkerchief in my hat—I paid her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we were there a very little while—my hat fell off, but I did not miss my handkerchief then, but missed my watch—I stepped back and charged her with robbing me—she denied it, and I told the watchman—this is my handkerchief—I know it by its having a piece on it of a dif<lb></lb>ferent colour—I have never seen the watch since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Uxbridge. The prosecutor complained to me of being robbed of his watch and handkerchief about twelve o'clock on Monday night—he described the woman to me, and in consequence I apprehended the prisoner next morning—I told her the charge, and found this handkerchief on her—she said she took it out of his hat—she said she had not got the watch, that a person who went with a man named Gowl had got it, and was gone to the races, and if I went there I should find it—I said I was bound to be here next morning and could not go.</p>

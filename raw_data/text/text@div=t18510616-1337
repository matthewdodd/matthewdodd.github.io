                  </hi>. I reside in High-street, Kensington. On the night of 20th May, I was in Piccadilly, about 12 o'clock—a woman came to me, and I walked to near the bottom of Half-Moon-street with her—we stopped at a door, and at that moment some one came behind me, and said, "What are you doing with my wife?"—be took hold of me by the shoulders from behind—I turned, and it was the prisoner Hammond—the moment I turned my head, the woman took my watch, and was running away with it—Hammond had got me fast, and I could not release myself—we had a tremendous struggle, and I struck him a blow on the nose; he went down, and I with him—when we were both down, Corbyn came up—he tried to get me away from Ham<lb></lb>mond—he laid hold of my shoulders, and said, "Loose the man"—I collared Corbyn with my right-hand, and Hammond with my left, and called out "Police!"—the police arrived shortly—I had never loosed the prisoners; they might have used violence on me, but they had not half a chance; I was too strong for them—I said, "I give them in custody"—Hammond said something about giving me in custody for striking him—Corbyn tried to get away.</p>

               <p>Shepherd's-market. About 12 o'clock, I heard cry of "Police!" several times; I went to Half-moon-street, and saw Shepherd holding the prisoners, one in each hand—he gave them in charge—Hammond said, "I think I ought to give him in custody for the blow I have received on the nose"—his nose was bleeding profusely—I believe he used the word "think" more than once; Shepherd said, "I give them in custody for robbing me of my watch; where is the woman?"—I said, "I have not seen the woman"—he said, "The woman has got my watch"—each of the prisoners said, "I don't know anything about it;" Shepherd was excited, and had been drinking—he was quite firm in the statement he gave to me at the time, and also at the station-house—he was quite determined—I had great difficulty in making him release his hold of the prisoners.</p>

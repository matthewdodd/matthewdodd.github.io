             sworn. - At half past eleven o'clock I was calling the hour, and hearing the cry of stop thief, I turned round, and went up the lane a little way, and there was the prosecutor and the prisoner, one of them on the ground, and the other getting up, and he said, watch, I charge you with the prisoner, he has picked my pocket of this handkerchief; he gave me the handkerchief; I secured the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house.(The handkerchief produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming along Long-lane, and saw a parcel of people contending about a handkerchief; I picked this handkerchief up in the kennel, and before I could say is this the handkerchief, the gentleman laid hold of me; since that the prosecutor has been with my friends, and demanded two guineas to make it up, and then he came down to a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Prescutor. Here are two witnesses here to what passed in the public-house; there came a person to me begging me to make it up; I said, I could not do any such thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

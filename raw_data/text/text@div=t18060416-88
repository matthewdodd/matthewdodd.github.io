             sworn. I am a smith, I live at Islington. On the 7th of March I was standing at the shop door where I work, I saw the prisoner coming with that iron bar on his shoulder, I supposed by his appearance he had stole it, I followed him to Panton-street, I asked him if he had got a bar to sell, he told me no, he was going to carry it home to paint for a gentleman at Islington; I let him go on, and followed him to a field adjoining Sadler's Wells, he went up to one side of the field and there he got a stone, and was in the act of breaking it to pieces, I saw him bend it backwards and forwards several times; when I got up to him he put it on his shoulder and walked away, I followed him and delivered him into the hands of Mr. Hancock the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find every thing in the indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these all the things that you had missed? - No, I only put in the indictment what I found on her; we sent for a constable, and had her taken before a justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take one or both to that justice? - The constable would have both, finding the property in the elder one's premises; the sauce pan was on the fire; she denied it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that was your sauce pan; I think I did, and one of them said it was not mine? - I saw some tea cups and saucers on the shelf, which I said were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110079"></xptr>mine also; they said they were not; I cannot say which said it, the witness may:</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mrs. Silk, I understand that the youngest prisoner had been your servant, she left your service on the Tuesday; then until the Sunday after you heard nothing about the property, nor never missed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps during the course of that time, you had never seen your property, from the Tuesday unto the Sunday; therefore whether any body had taken it to the house, and brought it to the prisoner, from Tuesday to the Sunday you don't know? - I have nobody in the house to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, if she left your service on Tuesday, and you never found the things till Sunday, any body might have taken them? you found them on Sunday? - I missed them on Sunday, but I found my gown and coat on her back, the 24th of October, a week and four days; she owned at the justice's what she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken in writing? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And so whatever she did say, was said at the time she was under the examination at the justice's? - It was; she said nothing more than that she pledged a curtain at Mr. Wright's, at the Hamborough, the fellow of this is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to take on yourself to say that it was not taken down in writing? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. However it was a week and four days after this property was found? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The mother was at home? - I did not know that this was her mother, the eldest was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Which house was it? - I do not know whose house it was, it was full of lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this house? - Orchard-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. You understand it to be a house full of lodgers? - When I came down they said so it was; the gown was on her back, and some new muslin was cut up in caps; I missed the muslin the week she was with me.</p>

               <p>Q. From whose room? - I do not know who rented it, but these two women were in the room at the same time; I have kept the things from that time to this; Mrs. Silk said, that if the young woman would give up her property, she would go no further in it; Mrs. Silk said, she had lost a great many articles, and that the young woman had lived with her one week; I supposed she had robbed her of these articles? - the young woman came immediately with Mrs. Silk, and we went about and looked for these articles, and she gave them up to Mrs. Silk.</p>
               <p>Q. When these things were in the room, were they open about the room? - Yes, a great number of them, there is a part of the sheet that was in a deal box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the old woman say any thing, the elder of the two? - The elder one said that she had just come into town, she knew nothing of these things being brought there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said unto whom they belonged, by either of these women? - Mrs. Silk said it was her property; they did not say it was not her's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of these women say whether it was the lady's or not? - They did not say they were her's, but they went and delivered them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say they were not her's? - To the best of my recollection they did not say so.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Silk. The gown and coat is mine, this sheet was whole when she took it; she owned she cut it, but she could not find the pieces; in this gown and coat there have been some moth holes, that have been darned in it; they are things that I wore some time ago, when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110081"></xptr>was in mourning; here is a stain of red wine in the middle of the apron.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I have no doubt but what it is your property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Simpson, the younger. I went to this lady's in October, and she had me there a little while, and she said she would look me up a few old things, to make me tidy, and she gave me the gown, and I wore it with her a good while; I agreed for a sortnight's warning, and the place was so bad I could not stay in it, she would not allow me fire in the kitchen, nor victuals to eat; I told her I should leave her, and she said I should pay her a fortnight's wages; on Tuesday night I brought away my boxes, and she told me she would make me pay a fortnight's wages, and I put my hand in my pocket, and she said she would not take the fortnight, but she would keep the wages; she said she would make me repent of it, before the winter was out. The cups and saucers, and saucepan, were my aunt's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Simpson, the elder. When the lady came to the room, she came to ask for the black gown, that she had given to her, to lend to a person that was going to a burying; the child said, they were the things about the room; she asked her for other things; I can bring witnesses to prove that the saucepan was my own, and the cup and the saucer.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether Mrs. Silk had sworn the saucepan? - Yes, I can swear to it.</p>

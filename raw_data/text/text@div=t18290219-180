Curtis' - he said something about some sovereigns - he was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came back, was any thing said about the dressing-case? A.

            . I am principal clerk to Mr. Gandolfe. The prisoner was in our counting-house; I had sent for him twice, because Mr. Gandolfe had mentioned what he had lost; I asked him to let me look at a watch, which he had shown me before - he said he had not got it; it was at home: I requested him to go and fetch it, as Mr. Gandolfe was in town, and wished to see it - he said he could not, he was going after a situation; I said it was of great consequence, and as he would not I sent for the officer - the officer went with him, and brought him back with the watch, the chain, and seal; the prisoner said he had bought the watch of a school-fellow: I said it was Mr. Gandolfe's chain and seal, which he had exchanged in Whitechapel; he denied it, but afterwards admitted it; I charged him with taking the other things; he denied that, but afterwards admitted it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that with respect to the whole of them? A. Yes; he said he had got them out of a writing-desk, with a key, which he had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have stated that he several times denied it? A. Yes; I said, "Tell me the truth, the truth will always support you, and carry you through;" I said, in the first instance, with regard to the dressing-case, that he had better tell the truth - that was before he had made any confession to Mr. Gandolfe; Mr. Gandolfe had discovered the case in his room, and I told him he had better tell the truth; I said, "I will intercede with Mr. Gandolfe, and I dare say he will not take any measures with you - tell me the truth." I said nothing in referrence to any other article.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had been dismissed did you see him again? A. Yes. before he made any confession; I told him a watch and various things were missing - nothing but the dressingcase had been found then; I said, "With regard to the watch, tell me the truth - have you had that watch, or do you know any thing about it or the medicine-chest?" he said he did not; I will swear I said nothing to him but charging him to tell the truth, and not to give me trouble by telling me falsehoods; I am certain I did not hold out a promise, perhaps I might have said it would be better.</p>
               <p>MR. GANDOLFE re-examined. Q. Had you missed the watch while he was in your service? A. Yes.</p>

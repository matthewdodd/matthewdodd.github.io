On Wednesday the 12th of November, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I went into Long Acre after some work, I returned about a quarter past twelve; the person that occupied the kitchen in the same house called me, I went to her and I stopped about ten minutes, I returned up the back stairs which lead into the passage, and on getting to the end of the passage I saw the prisoner come down my stairs; my own dog came to the street door and barked violently at the prisoner. I noticed the prisoner, and I saw that she had something bulky under her petticoats, I noticed her the second time, I then saw something white dragging upon her legs, I thought she looked very suspicious. I immediately went to my own door, and upon trying the latch I found the door had been unlocked by a key; I had left my door double locked when I went out. On entering the room I perceived that my bed clothes were taken off the bed, I immediately missed my sheets, they had been taken off the bed. I pursued the woman that I had met in the passage, and when I came to the street door I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030015"></xptr> her turn the corner of Monmouth street to go into Great St. Andrew street. I took hold of her right arm, and I said my good woman what have you got concealed under your petticoats, I took the corner of her apron on one side, and I perceived a new cotton gown of mine pinned round her waist. I brought her back to the door myself, I met my landlady, I begged her to assist me, we went into my landlady's shop, I asked her where my sheets were; my landlady took hold of her by her right arm till such times she had shuffled the sheets off, which were concealed round her two thighs; during the time that my landlady had hold of the prisoner's arm, there came a key out of her bosom, which key I tried, and it opens my door. I sent for a constable and had her taken before a magistrate. I produce the things, I have had them ever since; the gown is mine, and the sheets they are marked by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Now just state what is the value of the gown and the sheets. - A. Eighteen shillings; and the sheets twenty-four shillings; the sheets cost me thirty-six shillings and eight pence, and they have been washed twice.</p>
               <p>Q. The life of the woman depends upon the value of the things taken from you, therefore be particular. - A. I can swear to the value of the gown being worth eighteen shillings, and the sheets are worth twenty four shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you stand there and say that you saw me upon the stairs. - A. I saw you come down the stairs and go into the passage.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure that she is the person upon whom you found the things. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. Your husband is the owner of this house. - A. Yes, his name is James.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar at the time the last witness has spoken off. - A. Yes, between twelve and one o'clock Mrs. Ennis brought her in by the arm, and bid me take hold of her arm; till she got assistance, and while I had hold of her arm, this key tumbled against my hand, it was just in the act of falling from her bosom, I gave the key to Mrs. Ennis, she said it opened her door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the things that were taken from her. - A. While I had hold of her arm Mrs. Ennis said that was the gown that was round her waist, I knew it to be Mrs. Ennis's gown; a person called to me, they said Mrs. Button, there are some keys laying on the floor, and these scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give for such a gown as that. - A. I should give ten or twelve shillings for it; I would not give above twelve shillings for a pair of sheets that are second hand.</p>

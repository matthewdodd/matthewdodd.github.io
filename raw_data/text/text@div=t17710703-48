I went away, in obedience to my master's orders, to watch what he would do: he went into the compting-house, and opened the counter (that is, the top that lifts up at the counter) and took out a purse: he took the money out of it (that is, poured all out) he took what he chose, and put the rest in again. As soon as he was gone from the counter, and had shut it down again, I immediately laid hold of his collar, and said: You rascal, I have now catched you. He had the money then in one of his hands; upon my taking hold of him, he laid the money out of his hand, upon another counter that was there, and said to me, God bless you, don't say any thing against me: I came here for a sheet of paper. I called assistance, and told them he had put the money upon the counter. The prisoner said, You may have put it there yourself.</p>

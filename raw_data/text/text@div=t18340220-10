            . I am a gardener - on Saturday, the 18th of January, I was near Mr. Newsom's shop, and saw Ware and Elliott - when I first saw them they were about eight yards from Newsom's shop - I looked after them, and saw Ware with his two thumbs pressing against the glass of the window - Elliott stood about three yards from him - it is a great thoroughfare about there - I was about eight yards from them - they saw me looking at them, and went away - I then saw the prisoner, Hall, come out of Castleton's beer-shop - I had not seen him with the other two - he crossed the road, and made a sign with his hand - Elliott and Ware had just turned the corner - they might have been in his sight but not in mine - I then saw him walk on the road, about twenty yards away from Mr. Newsom's towards London - he then came across the road, and went as far as the beer-shop door again, that is opposite Newsom's - I then went and rang Newsom's Bell - I had not seen anybody else go to the shop - Newsom's shopman(Fletcher) came out to me - he called Newsom up, and I told him what I had seen - Newsom went over to the beershop in consequence of what I told him - there was a hole made in the window when the two boys went away - I had not seen anything of the prosecutor at the time - I think the boy was pressing his thumbs a little lower than where I saw the hole - I should think about six inches below - I did not see him put his hand in it at all, and never saw him (Hall) with the other two - nor did I see Blake with them.</p>
               <p>MR. NEWSOM re-examined. I went over to the beershop, and saw Blake and Hall there, but not the others - in consequence of something - I told them I suspected they had cut my shop window - Blake said he was a very respectable young man, and a dealer in hare skins, and was quite above any such thing - Hall said he knew nothing at all about the transaction, and that they had never seen each other before - they had a pint of ale drinking together - I gave them into custody.</p>

            . I went in pursuit of the two younger prisoners - I was on duty on Stamford-hill - I saw them walking together on the further side of Clapton-common - they heard me call my brother officer to me - they both looked round and then both ran away - Elliott jumped over a fence into a gentleman's pleasure ground, and hid himself behind a heap of dirt, where I apprehended him - my brother officer took Ware.</p>

               <p>Blake's Defence. All I can say is, I am not guilty - I get my living by buying skins - I went to Tottenham for that purpose, and called at two or three places there and at Edmonton.</p>
               <p>Hall's Defence. I was going to Enfield at the time, and went with a young man who sells currycombs. I got up to Newsom's shop, and the young man was about selling some currycombs - he told me to go to the beer-shop, and he would come in a few minutes - I went, but he did not come, and I went out to look for him, returned, and in came the officers and took us.</p>

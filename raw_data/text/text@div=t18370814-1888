                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Mark Gotts, a farmer, at Bulpham, in Essex. On Saturday, the 10th of June, I saw a brindled cow of his safe, between eight and nine o'clock at night, in a mead called the Kitchen Mead, at Bulpham-natczh—I hasped the gate of the field myself when I left it—it was not locked—on the Sunday morning, between four and five o'clock, I went to the mead again, and it was gone—I had known the cow ten or eleven years—I had taken care of her and milked her for six or seven years—she had two very large teats before, and two white spots on her back, one against the shoulder, and the other on the loin—she was in calf, and had about six weeks or two months to go, I think—she gave milk to two calves—I have since seen a skin and horns, which I know to be those of my master's cow.</p>

I saw the prisoner four or five weeks before I was at Lambeth street, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning, driving a cow towards Whitechapel very fast—it was a brindled cow, with a white spot or two on her back, and her two front dugs were a good deal larger than the hind ones—I went with him from the King Harry, Mile-end-road, to Globe-lane, nearly a quarter of a mile—I asked him if he was going after any more cows—he said, "No, not particular"—I asked him if he was going to Whitechapel—he said, "Not particular"—he said, "Put her</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in High-street, Aldgate. I know the prisoner—I have had dealings with him for cows on two occasions before this, the first on the 5th of May, and the other on the 12th—he told me he was a jobber and dealer, as I asked him when I bought the first cow—he is a hay-dealer besides—he came to me on Sunday morning, the 11th of June, about ten minutes past eight o'clock, with a very dark brindled cow, nearly a black—it was in a poor state—it was not in calf that I know of—he said he had brought another cow, if I would buy it—I asked him how much—he said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not give him so much—it was worth no such money, and I would not buy it, but I told him, "As to morrow is Smithfield market, you may put it into my shed, and give it some hay; and if you cannot sell it to-morrow, I will buy it of you"—he put it into my place, and I went over to a coffee-shop—he came there to me, and I agreed to give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, which was more than it was worth—he said be should lose a good deal by it, it cost him a good deal more than that—I told him he must buy them better, or else I could not buy any more of him—he asked me if I would give him something to drink, and I gave him some gin—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I had the cow killed the same morning, and the hide was sent to market on Monday or Tuesday, I do not know which, but it was sold on Tuesday.</p>

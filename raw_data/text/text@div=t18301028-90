            . I saw Lynes last Tuesday week, in the evening, between Ratcliff-cross and Cock-hill - she asked me to go home with her; I said I would not, and would have no connection with her; she walked all the way up the highway, and asked me to give her something to drink - I said, to get rid of her, I would give her a pot of ale or porter; I went with her to a private house, went up stairs, took out my money, and gave her a shilling - she called another girl to go and fetch the porter or ale- she then said the girl stopped a long while, and she would go to look for her; when she was gone, I missed a 10l. note, and seven sovereigns, which were wrapped up in it; they had been in my purse, in which was some small silver in a separate department - I know I had it safe when I saw her, because I took the purse out, put it on the table, and gave her the shilling out of it; the purse was in my left-hand breeches pocket - I missed the purse and all, but I found that was returned into the side pocket of my coat; I did not perceive it taken from me - I had had two glasses of grog with a gentleman, at Limehouse; I was in the room about a quarter of an hour - it was about ten o'clock at night, I think; I did not change the state of my dress at all - I am sure of that; I went down, and called the Policeman - when I called a second time he answered, and came to me; he told me to remain there, and sent another to me, who observed the number of the house, and took me to the night-officer.</p>

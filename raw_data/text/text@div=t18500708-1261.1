                  </hi>. I am single. On 17th June, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening I met the two prisoners—they asked me to direct them to the British Museum—I turned round to direct them, and Ellis turned round very quickly, and came to my right side—while I was speaking to them, a young man stared at me—when I turned again, Ellis moved her shawl very quickly—we separated; and in consequence of her coming so close to me, I put my hand into my pocket the moment I left them, and my purse was gone—there was one sovereign and seven shillings in it—I had it safe about three minutes before—I had only come from No. 4 to No. 6, and had walked straight along—I went back—the prisoners were both together, and a young man was speaking to them—Ellis was looking after me—I did not go up to them—they stood there a minute or two, and went across the road—I followed them—they went down Chandos-street, and down Queen Ann's-mews—the man went in an opposite direction—I followed the prisoners—they ran up the steps of a house in the mews—I gave them into custody—the man was five or six yards from me.</p>

On Monday evening, 17th June, I was sitting at my front window, about a quarter-past eight o'clock—I saw the prisoners run into the Mews—the man took an opposite direction—the prisoners came up the steps to my room, and Sheehan asked me to let her go to the closet—I did not, for we have not one—we were putting the prisoners down the steps when Jerrell came—we gave the pri<lb></lb>soners in charges.</p>

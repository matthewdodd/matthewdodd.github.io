                  </hi> I am a carman, and live on Dowgate-hill.

               <p>Gly's, (about half-past two,) and found it had been paid—I then went to the alamode-beef house, and there obtained Mr. Barrymore's card, with the address, at Mr. Allsups, No. 16, St. Paul's Churchyard—I pro<lb></lb>ceeded to Mr. Allsup's, and there saw Mr. Barrymore, who acknowledged finding the cheque, and told me what he had done with it—the prisoner Walters was not there—I have seen the cheque since—I cannot swear to it—I had had it in my possession three or four hours—I was per<lb></lb>fectly sober—I had it in my pocket when I went into the house—I had no other money—I had to pay some money at Christ's Hospital, and was going there—I had some paper in my pocket, with the cheque, and pulled the paper out in the shop, to show a friend.</p>

                  </hi>, I am clerk to Mr. Allsup, who lives is St. Paul's-churchyard. I know Walters, by his being in our employ from Saturday at twelve o'clock till Tuesday at dinner-time—on Tuesday, the 12th of January, I went to the alamode-beef house in Butcherhall-lane, with Mr. Allsup, junior, and Walters—it might be about ten minutes after one o'clock—I picked up a soft piece of paper from the ground, which I afterwards discovered to be a cheque, and passed it to some gentlemen on the right of me sitting in the room—they asked to look at it, and examined it—there were several gentlemen in the room—one advised me one thing and another the other—at last they said it would be better for me to leave my address with the parties in the house, and keep it in my possession—I left my card at the bar, and brought the cheque away—after leaving the eating-house, I went back again to St. Paul's-church yard—I became un<lb></lb>comfortable at having the cheque, and Mr. Allsup persuaded me to send or take it back—Walters said, "If you will give it to me I will take it back, I will not be five minutes"—I gave it to him to take back to the alamode beef-house, and leave it there, and bring me my card back—I did not au<lb></lb>thorize him to take it to the bankers and receive the money, I had not the least idea of that—I understand he returned in about a quarter of an hour, but I saw no more of him myself till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Walters. Q.</hi> Did any body in the eating-house make a remark about advertising at in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my recollection—I believe Allsup told me to cross my card—the gentleman on my right advised me to leave my card—my name was printed on the card, and I wrote my address in pencil—I believe I found the cheque before the dinner was brought in—we were in the house half an hour or more—it was said by some gentle<lb></lb>man, that it was as well as know who was the drawer of the cheque, and we went out there was no name on the cheque to whom it was payable—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010041"></xptr>
               <p>had a number—we all went in the direction of the bankers—I went in my<lb></lb>self and learned the address of the drawer—I did not give notice to the clerks that I had found a cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not show the cheque to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I considered it to be more honourable to return it to the parties who drew it—I did not consider it right to show it to the clerks—I merely inquired the residence of the drawer, and got it, but I did not know whether it was on this side of the water or the other, and we all returned to St. Paul's-churchyard—I gave it to you to take back to the eating-house—I did not go to the drawer, I gave it into your custody, trusting to your honesty, as you seemed so anxious about my having it, and knowing your father was a most respect<lb></lb>able man in out employ till he died; and you were taken into the concern out of respect to your father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not take the cheque back yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You seemed so anxious to take it—I had no doubt Mr. Allsup would trust you with money—Mr. Allsup depended on you as well as I did—the coat you have on now I be<lb></lb>lieve was lent to you when you went to dinner, to appear respectable to go with as—the cheque was given to you before we went into Mr. Allsup's house, and you ran off in the direction of Newgate-street—Mr. Allsup and myself went into the premises—I made no remark about your hat—I did not give you my hat, because yours had a bard on it, or authorize you to take it off my desk—I know nothing about a disguise.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why convey your coat to me out at the back-door your father's premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I always come out at the back-door—I brought out that coat for you to go in, to make you respectable to go to dinner—you have torn the skirts off—I did not propose a disguise—I did not tell you to say, you wanted plaster of Paris—he was coming down the counting-house stairs as I went up, and he asked me for money for plaster of Paris, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> did you not propose that subterfuge to me, to avoid further sus<lb></lb>picion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not if a man wants to go out he can always go with my permission—I did not give you a green handkerchief—you asked me what you were to get the plaster in, and I said, "There is a basin, take it"—I did not tell you to leave the coat with Mrs. Brown, in Carter-lane—I did not go with you to a public-house, in Carter-lane.</p>

               <p>shop, and Barrymore gave it to him to do so—I do not know who first mentioned about taking it back—Walters said, he was rather anixious at our having it in out possession, that our time would be of more consequence than his, and he would take it back, and we trusted it to him—the party on his left hand in the alamode-beef shop showed it to him; but whether he had it in his hand, I cannot say—Walters accompanied us to the bankers to inquire about the drawer; but he did not go in.</p>

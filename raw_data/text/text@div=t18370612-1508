He went to bed about a quarter past eleven o'clock—he was quite collected—I went to bed about half past twelve o'clock, and saw his trowsers lying in the middle of the room, as if they had been thrown down, and the pockets empty—one pocket was turned inside out—I awoke him—the prisoner slept in the attic—he went to bed after my husband, but before me—he would pass our bed<lb></lb>room door to go to bed—I had noticed the day before that he had a rag about his finger, having a whitlow—I am confident this it the rag I saw him with the day before—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.) <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD NEELD</hi>. I am a policeman.

            . The Prisoner Lewis and I, committed this Fact. He pulled up one of the Bars with his Hand, and with that Bar he wrenched up the others; and then I standing to watch, he went in and brought out the Tankards. We went with them first to Mrs. Pritchard's at the Brill, but it being so soon in the Morning, she would not let us in, and so we carried them to Mrs. Morris, in Eagle Court in the Strand, and knocked her up about two in the Morning. Her Husband let us in. At first she seem'd scrupulous of dealing with us, for she said she had been in trouble on the like Account. * Lewis had been recommended to her, but she said she did not know that I went abroad (that is a Thieving.) though she knew something of me when I was Apprentice to a Glass Blower in the Strand. We told her she need fear no harm from us, for no body was concerned in it but our selves. About eight the same (Saturday) Morning, her Son fetched some Charcoal to melt the Plate. We melted it below Stairs while she was above, and then we carried it up to her. She weighed it with old Leaden Weights, and said there was forty six Ounces in all, and reckoning it at four Shillings an Ounce it came to nine Pound odd. She gave us five Guineas then, and the Remainder on the Thursday following - I made my Information seven or eight Weeks ago before Justice Deveil.</p>

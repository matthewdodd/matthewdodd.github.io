On the 6th of June, about seven or eight in the evening, the two prisoners came into my house; they came through the tap room into the parlour; they called for a pint of beer and sat down, and staid till the other company were gone. The silver mug stood behind them; my wife moved it a-cross the room; the prisoners sat down by it; then they laid their heads together and whispered; I did not see my wife move the mug, but I saw it after it was removed; after some time Wallis went away; then George gave my wife a shilling; there was some squabble about the shilling; while they were disputing about the shilling, there was an alarm that the mug was gone. I suspect that the dispute about the shilling was an artifice, to give the other man time to get off. I stopt George; he told me the other man had got the mug, and confessed, that they were both concerned in it, and he gave me a direction where to find the other man; I went to a court according to his direction, I met Wallis there; I took him before the Justice; in the way, he took the mug out of the lining of his coat, and gave it me; (produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. from Wallis. Was not I in liquor?</p>
               <p>Pye. I did not perceive they were either of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150004"></xptr> them in liquor; after Wallis gave me the mug, he said, George put in his pocket.</p>

            . I and my wife and family went to bed on the night of the day in the indictment between twelve and one, and in the morning discovered the articles in the indictment to have been stolen. The way I suppose the entrance was made was by the flap of the cellar window, which was not fastened. I do not know whether it was shut or not, before I went to bed, and there was nothing to prevent a person from going in if it were open. I was awakened in the morning by the watchman, and it was then light enough for me to see what o'clock it was by my watch.</p>

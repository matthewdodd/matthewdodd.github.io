                  </hi> I am foreman of the goods department at the New Cross station. On 28th Jan. I received information from Groves, which induced me to go in search of the package—I went in the direction of the Old Kent-road, as far as the Lord Wellington—I there found two carts—I got into the smaller cart, and found this chest now produced, with two mats and a tarpaulin over it—there was nothing else in the cart—it appeared as though the greater portion of the direction had been torn off—there was enough to enable me to see what it was—I inquired for the carman—the ostler went and brought in the prisoner—I asked him if he was the carman belonging to those carts—he said he belonged to the large one, not the small one—I asked him where his mate was—he said he had gone on the road, to look after the party who had put the chest in his cart—I first mentioned the chest to him—I asked him what he was doing with that chest in his cart—he said he knew nothing of it—I told him I had been watching him—he said if the chest belonged to me I had better take it, but not ake his master's carte to the green-yard—he then told me that after leaving the station a party had put this chest into his mate's (James Smith's) cart, and he had gone in search of the party—I waited some time—he did not come, and I gave the prisoner into custody—the lid of the chest had been broken open when I found it.</p>

On 27th Jan., between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the small cart drove to our door—I do not know the man who drove it—I do not know that I had seen him before—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes the prisoner came with a large cart—I went out in front of the house, and saw them removing some<lb></lb>thing from the large cart into the smaller one—the carmen were each in their own cart—I could not give a description of what it was—it was past, six o'clock, and rather dark—it appeared to be something bulky, about the size of the chest found in the cart—there was nothing else found in the cart but the mats and tarpaulin—when I saw the men moving it, I asked them if they wanted any assistance—they said, "No"—the prisoner then came into the tap-room and had some bread and cheese—Mr. Corrall and Mr. Hudson came, and I told them what I had seen—there was nothing found in the large cart—the smaller cart had come empty to our door.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; I apprehended the prisoner at a breeches-maker's, in Swallow-street; he was sitting on a pair of breeches, and these breeches were lying by him; he said they were his; we took him to the Office.</p>
               <p>JOHN COZENS sworn. - I am a shoemaker; I live at No. 4, Ogle-street; I have a coat and waistcoat I bought of the prisoner; I cannot justly say whether it was on Christmas-eve, or the day before; I sold him a pair of boots for 10s. I gave him the boots and 4s. for them.</p>
               <p>Crichton. These are my property; the breeches I cannot so positively swear to as the coat and waistcoat; he had not wore them, I suppose, more than five or six times; there was also a laced hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any other cloaths? - A.Very few; I believe there was a jacket and waistcoat he left behind, very old; he went off in such great haste, he had not time to arrange his matters.</p>

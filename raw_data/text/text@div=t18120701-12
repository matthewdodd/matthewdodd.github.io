               <p>Q. Had you a chest that you kept these goods in that you charge to be stolen - A. Yes; I packed them up about the 15th of February, all the articles, thirty-one dozen of braces. On the 26th of May, I found it opened, and only one pair of braces was in it, instead of thirty-one dozen. It must have been forced open, because, I had fastened it with nails. The nails had been drawed, and the braces taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any other of your master's property - A. Yes, 120 knives and 28 razors; they were in the custody and care of Mr. Andrews.</p>
               <p>Q. The chest remained in your master's accompting house, to be sent to Mr. Shoer of Birmingham - A. Yes; I acquainted my master of the loss. I offered to my master to come and search my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the braces, knives, and razors, produced to you any where - A. Yes: and they were my master's property that I had missed.</p>
               <p>JOHN ANDREWS. I am an insurance broker and agent. I had the care of these things for Mr. Shoer, of Birmingham. I told the prisoner and Berkey, that the goods were missing; they could not go without hands, and that it laid between them; that they had better acknowledge the fact; it was the only means to let me know what became of the goods. The prisoner denied that he knew any thing of the goods. Berkey voluntary offered to have his lodgings searched. I went to the prisoner's house, with an officer, in May. Vickrey, the officer, searched the prisoner's premises: he did not find any thing. He desired the prisoner to go with us to Purse's, London-wall. The prisoner there acknowledged that he had taken the property. I went to Mr. Purse's, before we took the prisoner there, and there I found the things. It was in consequence of that I took the warrant out against him.</p>

I was present when the prisoner unlocked her box with a key which she pulled out of her pocket - these duplicates, this handkerchief, and this napkin, were found in it; there was no duplicate found in the kitchen - she said she got the duplicates from a woman, instead of some money, and the towel and handkerchief, she said came there by washing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the housemaid had been inquiring the value of the spoon, that the duplicate of it was sold to her, by a woman who came to the house to buy old clothes.</p>
               <p>MR. CHITTY. My other servant is here, and has been with me a long time - I am positive the duplicate was in her box; she came to me with a false written character - I have ascertained she is a labourer's wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 6, George-street, Mile-end New Town, in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney. On the evening of the 2nd of Feb. I left the windows shut and the house generally shut up, and everything safe about twenty minutes before eight o'clock—I locked the dour and took the key away with me—I returned about a quarter after eight—I noticed some people about the door—I attempted to unlock the street door, but it pushed open—it was closed but not locked as I had left it—the catch was on, but the least touch in the world would open it—I missed an unfinished coat from my bed-room, a carpet from my parlour, and some cbioa ornaments from my mantel-piece—I went to the station-house and found the prisoner already in custody—the articles I missed were at the station.</p>

I was returning from work on the 2nd of Feb.—I saw the prisoner attempt to force open with his hand the door of the house No. 6, George-street, Mile-end, where Maney lives—he forced the door open with his foot, then walked about, and entered the house—he came out in a minute, and walked across the road—he went in again, and remained two or three minutes—the third time when he came out I saw him with a bundle in front of him—he closed the door after him—I followed him round the corner of the Collingwood public-house—I did not lose sight of him—I came up to him in Chicksand-street, and seized him—he dropped the bundle directly, and said, "Let me go"—after we had had two or three struggles across the road, I got assistance—I saw him throw a china ornament away as we took him along—it was broken—the pieces were picked up, and handed to the policeman.</p>

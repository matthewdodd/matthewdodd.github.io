O my God, what have I done!"—she sent for some brandy, and tried to give <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> some; but he was not able to swallow it—when she found he could not swallow it, she said to me, "Don't say anything or I shall be hung;" she then, wrapped him up, and took him to the hospital.</p>

               <p>(the prisoner always went by the name of Cooper)—her husband came in and went up stairs, and the little girl went into the yard, and I saw bruises on her face—she met her father at the foot of the stairs, as he was coming down, and I heard him speak to her—I afterwards heard the prisoner say to her, "Where were you when your father was in the house?"—she said she was in the yard—Mrs. Seago said, "It is a lie, the b—y serf, in the shape of a man"—I then went into the back yard—I was going into the other room to put my things on to go to chapel, and heard the prisoner say, "My God, what have I done! why should I put myself in a passion and ill use the children! O my God, give me strength to go through it!"—before I heard those words I heard a faint noise in the room, the same as before, but not so much as before—I met <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi> in the passage with the brandy; he went up stairs, and I heard him cry, and his mother cry, and just after<lb></lb>wards she went out of the house—I looked out of the window, and saw her pass with the child in her arms, with something over it—she said the child was convulsed, and had got the rattle in its throat, but I did not speak to her—she went towards the hospital.</p>

I recollect the child being brought there by the prisoner, I saw it directly—it was dead—(it was as near as possible 6 o'clock in the afternoon)—it had a horizontal wound about two and a half inches long, and three quarters of an inch wide, directly across the forehead; the bone was exposed by the wound—there was also a severe contusion on the head, about two inches above the ear; the upper lip was much contused and swollen, and there were bruises about the face and the body generally, but not serious ones; and various scratches—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination; on removing the scalp I found contusions almost all over the head, both the sides and the posterior part—on removing the skull cap I found extensive extravasation and blood on the surface, and in the membranes of the brain; particularly on the left side, and about an ounce of blood effused on the posterior part immediately, behind the head—the ventricles of the brain were full of bloody serum, but in other respects the brain was healthy, and the other organs of the body were generally healthy; the heart was quite healthy—some of the mesenteric glands were enlarged, and the liver was enlarged—I attribute death to concussion of the brain, with extravasation of blood—they were such injuries as would be produced by a child being thrown on the floor or against anything.</p>

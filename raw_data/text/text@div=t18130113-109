On the 3d of December last, the prisoner came to my house; he represented himself as the Stretham carrier. He called, he said, for a parcel for Mrs. Cater. I had previously received a letter from a person calling herself Mrs. Cater, on the morning of the same day.</p>
               <p>(The letter read.)</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Cater will be obliged to Mrs. Ord to send her on Thursday by the carrier, six yards of twilled sarsenet, and the widest you have. I think I paid you for the last I had seven shillings per yard. I wish to have it of the same quality, and a bill of the same, and the carrier shall bring you the money on his return; also will thank you to send me two or three skeins of purple silk. Stretham, December 3, 1812. Addressed to Mr. Ord, St. Paul's churchyard."</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Ord. You had no such customer - A. No; that excited my suspicion. I gave orders to my people that if the carrier should call, the goods should not be sent. They were to state to the carrier if he called, that the lady was not known to me. About five in the evening, the prisoner called as the carrier. He said, he was the Stretham carrier, that he called for Mrs. Cater's parcel. I went to the prisoner from curiosity. I asked him what Mrs. Cater was. He said, she was a lady of great respectability, and kept her carriage. He had been her carrier for four years. I asked him where he went from in London. He said, the Old Bailey, Bishopsgate-street, and the Borough. He held in his hand a pocket-book; it appeared to contain letters, as carriers commonly have directions and orders and patterns of goods that he had got to match. I was determined to risk it. I thought she might have been a lady that came to my shop. I was present when the goods were delivered, six yards of sarsenett, at eight shilings a yard, and three skeins of purple silk at ten-pence a skein. They were put up in a paper parcel, by a young person who is in court, directed to Mrs. Cater, Stretham.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your property, and you expected to be paid for them, did not you - A. I did. I have not receive the remittance as promised. I did not receive the money on the following day. I became suspicious that the carrier or Mrs. Cater had deceived me. I waited a reasonable time for the money to arrive, I sent a young man down to Stretham, to ascertain the fact. They ascertained that there was no Mrs. Cater, at Stretham.</p>
               <p>Q. You never received the money or had the goods returned - A. No.</p>

            . I assist Mr. Ord. I was in the shop at the time that Mr. Ord described, that the prisoner came in. The prisoner came in, and asked for the parcel for Mrs. Cater. I went and told Mr. Ord that the carrier had come for the parcel for Mrs. Cater. Mr. Ord came to the prisoner; he asked him whether he knew Mrs. Cater. He said, yes, he knew her perfectly well; he said, she was a lady that kept her carriage, and that he had carried parcels for her for four years. Mr. Ord then went and cut off the sarsenet, and gave it me to pack up. I packed it, and enclosed a note with a bill of parcels. I directed it to Mrs. Cater, Stretham; and while he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130060"></xptr>was at the counter he pulled out his pocket-book, and in his pocket-book there were several papers; on one was a bit of muslin. He said, it would be eleven o'clock before he got home. Then I gave him the parcel. He asked for a pint of beer. He never returned the next day. On the 21st, I went with the officer for the purpose of taking the prisoner. He was taken at the Dog and Bear public-house, in the Borough, at half after ten at night. The moment I saw him I knew him. I have no doubt he is the same person.</p>

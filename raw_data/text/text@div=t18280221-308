I received information and took the prisoner that evening in Water-lane, in a public-house; he is a coal-heaver; I told him I wanted to speak to him; I then saw him endeavouring to hand something to another coal-heaver who sat by him; I desired that man to come away, which he did; I then told the prisoner to come out; he said he would not; he stooped down; I heard something drop, which I took up; it was this box; I then took him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

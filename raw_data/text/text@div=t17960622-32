I told him if he would return me the watch I would not hurt him; he said, he had not a farthing in his pocket, he had paid it all away to where he owed it; I found it at a pawnbroker's in Holborn; I sent for a constable to Bow-street, and when he got to the Brown Bear, the constable asked him if he had got any money, and he said, yes; and he told out 25s. and a knife with two blades out of his pocket, and he gave me the duplicate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 79, St. George's-street, opposite the London Docks. On Saturday night, 18th Dec., I had been at my brother's house in Mile End-road—I left there about half past 12 o'clock—in returning home I had to go down Neptune-street—when I passed right opposite the Cock and Neptune public house, I saw Carr, Chesney, and several others—Carr <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me with his arm, which caused me to go off the pavement into the road—he did not push me off, I went off of my own accord—on turning round, I do not live above six doors round the corner, when within three doors of my own house, Carr and Chesney came after me—Chesney threw his arm round my neck, and another one from behind put his arm tightly round my throat, and pressed my windpipe—I could not scream, I was obliged to <hi rend="italic">haw</hi>—they pressed me in that way that they almost took my breath—while this was doing, Chesney was hitting me in the eye with his fist, and every blow that he took fire flew from my eye—I suppose he struck me half a dozen times—with that they must have been disturbed—I had my hand on my watch, which was in my right hand waistcoat pocket, to hold it with both my hands—they tore the guard chain from my watch—they held my head up in this way, and one of them pinched my hand with his nails, it is scarcely better yet—they were disturbed, or probably they might have rifled my pockets—they threw me in the mud, and ran away and left me—they took nothing from me but my guard chain—I saved my watch by pressing my hands against the pocket—they tore the chain off the swivel—it was a swivel chain round my throat—here is the swivel to the watch now—I did not know either of these men before—I saw Carr and Chesney at the public house door—it was Carr that had his arm round my neck at the time of the robbery.</p>

I recollect the night of 18th Dec.—I recollect being in Neptune-street, round the square, near the Cock and Neptune—I saw the last witness there, and Carr and Chesney came one on each side of him, and looked at him—I knew him before by going to his house—I asked Carr and Chesney to buy a box of lucifers of me—there were 500 in a box—they told me to run away home, or they would give me in charge of a policeman—there was a policeman near the Sailor's Home, and then seeing him, they let the old gentleman pass them by—I went to a pair of large doors and hid myself—it was before he passed the Cock and Neptune that these men went and looked at him—it was up in the square, a lonesome place, very dark—I hid myself and watched, and I saw Carr put his arm round his neck to choke him, and Chesney hit him in the eye—I saw Swanton there—he took hold of Mr. Jewill's coat to pull him back—a gentleman and lady were coming down the street, and they disturbed</p>

               <p>these men, and they chucked the old gentleman down on the ground and ran away—before they threw him down there were four men, and I saw the fourth man putting his arm round Mr. Jewill's neck, and he pulled the guard up—it was a gold guard—I should know that fourth man if I were to see him—he succeeded in getting the chain—he pulled it up, the man who is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But how can you fix on that particular night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I am speaking the truth—He that sent me into the world gave me the truth to tell—I know that Carr lived with a woman of the town—Swanton lives with nobody that I know of—I knew that Catharine M'Carthy was a prostitute—Swanton slept in a bed up stairs by himself, no one with him—he went to bed a few minutes after 10 o'clock—he did not come out till the next morning, between 10 and 11 o'clock—he had no breakfast—I went to bed about 11 o'clock; I slept down in the front room along with my wife—I know he did not go out, because I always lock the door at 12 o'clock—he went to bed at five minutes past 10 o'clock—he did not go out—I went in his bedroom three or four times to see if everything was right—I did not expect anything wrong, but I always go upstairs—I went up first about half past 10 o'clock, the second time about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I do not know what made me go up—I went up the third time, just before twelve o'clock—I left my warm bed, and went upstairs to see if every thing was right—I did not go a fourth time—when I went the first time he was asleep, the second time he was asleep, and the third time he was asleep—I cannot say that he was snoring—I went three times between five minutes past 10 o'clock, and a little before 12 o'clock, and found him asleep each time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who locked the door that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Myself; I went to bed at 11 o'clock, but I got up again, and locked the door—my house is a lodging house, no one slept in the room with Swanton, but there might be lodgers come in; I have four rooms beside my own—there was only a young girl lodged there that night, who was in the next room to him—she went to bed a little before 12 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came Carr to be supping at your house that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Being a neighbour—he is not a companion of Swanton's to my knowledge—they came together that night—the girl was not there when we had supper—I do not know how old the girl is—I do not know her name—that was the only night she lodged there; I let her myself—I do not know who she was.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Gower's-row, Whitechapel. The last witness is a lodger of mine—he goes by the name of Robert; I do not know his other name—I know Chesney—I know he was taken up—I know he came to my house on the night before, on the night of the 18th, and went up to bed before the clock struck 12—I observed he was just in time—I cannot say that I saw him in the morning—he sleeps in the one pair room with four other men, five altogether—I sleep down-stairs myself, so that no one can come in or go out without my seeing them—there is not a passage; the door comes in the room from the street—they go through the room in which I live, the lower room—if he had gone out after I went to bed he must have come through my room—I never let any one out after I go to bed—I put the key in my pocket—I am the first up in the morning—I unlock the door—I did so that morning—the door was locked when I unlocked it in the morning—I unlocked them both—there is a kitchen at the bottom of the garden—my room does not open into any other room—there are steps from the stairs that go out in the yard.</p>

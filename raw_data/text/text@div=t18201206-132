I instantly turned in a direction for Charles-street, and perceived a stout man in dark clothes retreating from me. I called Stop thief! and called out Furzeman's name, knowing he was an officer. In a few seconds the man was stopped, it was Hall - he was taken to the watch-house. I lost three seals, a key, and part of my chain at the time I felt the grasp - Hall is the man who made the grasp - I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I live in Drury-lane, and am a watch spring-maker. I stood at my door at eight o'clock on the 14th of November, I saw the prisoner going towards Queen-street, and saw the prosecutor coming along, and the prisoners close behind him. I am sure of their persons. At the corner of Charles-street, Hall made a snatch at his watch-chain - he put his hand behind him and gave it to Clark, and they all ran down Charles-street, one on the left and the other on the right. The gentleman called watch, and so did I. The watchman took Hall - he tried to get away, and the other two came up as if to see what was the matter - they came across and went down Charles-street - I did not interfere - I had seen them five or six times that night, which made me notice them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. How far were you from Charles-street - A.About six doors - I was close behind them when they did it - I followed them - I saw

            . I am a watchman.

Justice Fielding sent for me some time after. I went [my pocket book lay before him] he asked me if I knew any of the prisoners that were there; I said I never saw them in my life. He asked me if I would swear to the pocket book; I said I would. He ask'd the prisoner what they had done with the coat? Blunt own'd that he went into my kitchen and took it out. They had pawn'd it; and Cole the evidence said Blunt pawn'd it for 5 s. I never saw it after this.</p>

Then Pottle went in again, and brought out a pocket-book, and gave it to Blunt; after that, Pottle hid it; and when we were taken up, I was admitted evidence, and I went and brought it. They had all share of the money for which this coat was pawn'd, which was 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. from Pottle. Whether Blunt pawn'd it, or me?</p>
               <p>Cole. Blunt pawn'd it. But Appleby and Pottle were cast at Hick's Hall this sessions, and they want to get Blunt off.</p>
               <p>Pottle's defence. I went into the prosecutor's house and took out a great coat; and in the pocket was that book. I gave them to Banks.</p>

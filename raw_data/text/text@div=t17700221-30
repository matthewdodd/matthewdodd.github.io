               <p>Mr. Gandle. I am constable. On the 18th of January I was in the play-house passage before the doors were open. There being a great croud, I had an order from Mr. Garrick to attend the house this being the Queen's birth-day. I saw the prisoner by the side of this lady, and, to my apprehension, he took something out of her pocket. I saw a box in his hand which was thrown down and trod-upon. (The snuff box produced; he takes it in his hand). I cannot say this is the same. I called Mr. Rogers, and we apprehended him. I took this box up by the side of the prisoner; then we took him into the lobby. He was not willing to be searched in the play house. We took him before Sir

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take any thing from the ground?</p>
               <p>Gandle. No, I did not. I saw him stoop, and I saw his hand towards the lady. I had a suspicion he was about her pocket.</p>

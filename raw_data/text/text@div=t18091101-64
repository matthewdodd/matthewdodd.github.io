On the 12th of October between eleven and twelve in the evening, I was going home, I slipped off the curb, the prisoner came to assist me up; I was rather intoxicated, I felt, that she had got her hand in my pocket, I immediately took hold of her and accused her of robbing me. I called the watchman and he conveyed her the watch house; the constable searched her; he asked me if I could swear to my property; he found six one pound notes, I lost ten and my watch. I have never found my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You never let go of her did you - A. No, I took hold of her immediately.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Castle-Baynard Ward; I was going down the Old-Change, Mr. Hudson called, watchman, he said, you take charge of this woman, she has robbed me of ten one pound notes, he said he did not know what he had lost, I conveyed her to the watch-house, the constable searched her, he found a one pound note in her hand, 6 s. 6 d. in her pocket, and on searching further, he found five one pound notes on her person.</p>
               <p>Mr. WYAT. I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, the prosecutor said she had robbed him of ten one pound notes, I asked her if she had got them, she said she had not, I saw that she had something in her hand, as if she intended to burn it, I caught hold of her hand and took a one pound note out of it I found 6 s. 6 d. in her pocket. I told her to pull off her gown, she did, and flannel round her middle, there was nothing there, she sat herself down again; she said do you think it was concealed before me. I laid her across my lap, and took five one pound notes from her person, the prosecutor said he was robbed of his watch as well as the money. I said the girl has not the watch, I have made a proper search, he said the number of the notes were from 31 m. 9 to 31 m. 22, the one that she had in her hand was 31 m. 9, and the last of the numbers that I looked at was 31 m. 22.</p>
               <p>Jury Q. to Prosecutor. You stated that where you were robbed was in the Old Jewry, the watchman states that it was in the Old Change. - A. I know no more than what I understood the watchman to say. I was intoxicated, I find I am wrong: I was going into St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was just come out of the Borough, as I was crossing over the way, this gentleman was laying down, he holloed out for me to come over, as I came over I picked up the papers, not knowing what they were. I kept them, as any other person might have done; he was in a very indecent manner, he hollowed out for the watchman. I said, what I have picked up, I will not give you. You may rely on that is the truth, if I was to die this moment.</p>

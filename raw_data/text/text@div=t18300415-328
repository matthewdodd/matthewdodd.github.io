I keep poultry in a large out-house, which is enclosed with my garden and dwelling-house, by a wall seven or eight feet high. On Tuesday evening, the 16th of March, about eight o'clock, the fowls were all locked up safe: I went to feed them next morning, and found the tiles taken off, and part of the grape-vine which goes over it down the windowframes were broken, and on the wall were marks of the prisoner's toes having scraped down; they had got in by breaking the window-frames out - I missed all my fowls, two geese, one duck, and twenty-four eggs, which I had marked with a cross in ink on each side.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 17th of March, the prosecutor informed me of this robbery, and about four o'clock that afternoon I was going to a house on Bow-common, and met the prisoner with two men named Wilson and McEwen on the side of the Regent's-canal, about half a mile from the prosecutor's; one of the men, not in custody, was carrying a bag across his shoulder: I stopped him, and asked him what he had got - he said he did not know; at that time the prisoner and Wilson walked on - I asked the man how he got it: he said he was employed by one of those men who had walked on; I told Mr. Prendergast to go after them - he went, and hearing somebody behind, they immediately took to their heels and ran - I caught hold of the man who had the bag; we struggled; he knocked me down and got away - I took the bag, opened it, and in it were seven hens, a cock just killed (it was quite warm), a duck, and two live geese: I proceeded on to the house on Bowcommon, having been informed that Wilson lived there - I found a great quantity of property there; I had been there about fifteen minutes, and while I was in the kitchen the prisoner and Wilson came in, and opened the door; seeing me in the kitchen, they immediately ran out of the house - I pursued them over a bridge, and they got away; in the house I found two of the prosecutor's hens, sitting on twenty-four eggs, which he identified - they were marked with a cross; next morning about six o'clock I apprehended the prisoner in bed, at a lodging-house at Stratford, and asked how he came to run away with Wilson the day before - he denied it, and said he had not seen Wilson for a month; he was taken to the office, and stated to the Magistrate that he had seen Wilson.</p>
               <p>GRIFFIN. I work at the East India-dock warehouse, and live next door to the prosecutor. About two o'clock in the morning I heard a noise like fowls and geese going in; I had heard some persons go out, but could not see them - I heard a noise two nights.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

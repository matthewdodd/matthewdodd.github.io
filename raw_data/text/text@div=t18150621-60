The prisoner was taken into custody on the 22nd of April; she was in my house four months, all but one day. She had not been with me more than one month, before I missed a broach with hair in it, and a five pound Bank note, they were taken out of a drawer in the two pair of stairs back room; I had missed considerable sums of money out of my drawers from time to time, but did not know whom to suspect; after she had been some time with me, I was informed she was without money, and I gave her two guineas I told her several times that I missed my property, but she always declared her innocence, and I had not the slightest suspicion of her, because I received a most excellent character of her. I was sitting one morning in my parlour, about eleven o'clock, when the other prisoner, who was accustomed to come and talk to her at the door, though I had forbidden male followers, came and asked for her. In a short time afterwards she went by the window with a white linen bag and a small pair of drawing-room bellows; from that moment I took the alarm; I am in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210031"></xptr>habit of leaving my, money on the and of the side board, while I dress myself and have missed it several times; I went to the house of the other prisoner in company with an officer; in consequence of my having had some conversation with Mr. Fielding, the magistrate, he the prisoner and another man were weaving in the room, I saw my property. There was the white bag tied up, just as it had passed my window, and a variety of things on the mantle piece, and about the room. We asked him how he came by the different things, and he made a full confession that

             had given him the whole of the things; and that the morning when I saw the white bag go by the window, he was in the neighbourhood with a cart to take away her boxes and things. He confessed also that she had given him eleven pounds in notes; with that money he had bought a loom, and was working as a weaver. The prisoner Collins was not at that time dismissed from my service. He said she had given him the wine that was in the bottle; the officer found the broach; the silver bottle lables were taken off my bottles; he confessed that all the things that were there of my property he had received of her. We then put the things into a hackney coach, stepped in, and drove home; she opened the door, the officer came into the house, and told her she was his prisoner. The articles were produced to her seperately, and she said at first to each, she had not taken it; and then afterwards confessed she had; and one by one, she confessed the whole.</p>

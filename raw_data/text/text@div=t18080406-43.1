At nine o'clock, the usual time of shutting up the shop, I expected the men would come out; I procured a constable and placed him on one side of Newgate street, and I stood at the corner of Panyer alley, just against my own door;

            . I am Mr. Winter's shop-man. On the 26th of February, I heard the prisoner taking the coffee out of a bag at the further part of the shop; we sent him out upon his business; after a length of time, I found a parcel in a cask covered over; I desired Mr. Winter to be informed of it; I afterwards shewed Mr. 
               <persName id="t18080406-43-person427">Winter</persName>
             the parcel; I marked the sack, and wrote upon a bit of paper, and put the writing inside of the parcel, and laid it exact in the exact same place. I went with Mr. Winter to the place, where we had watched the prisoner to in Gunpowder alley; there we found tea, sugar and a great number of articles, with a pair of small clothes, which are mine; I saw the constable take the coffee out of his small clothes.</p>

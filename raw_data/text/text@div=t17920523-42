               <p>I am sixteen years old. I am the son of the prosecutor. I was in a little parlour adjoining to the bar on the 20th of April; I heard the rattling of money; I went into the bar, and I saw the prisoner standing before the till; he was trying to shove in the till, but it was stiff, and would not go in; it was not locked when I had left it last, but it was shut close to; the prisoner told me he went in for a glass of pepper-mint; I told him to take it; the drawer where the money was was half open and half shut; I examined the drawer, and found the gold and silver were taken out of it; I do not know what money was in it before; I know there were above twenty-three shillings in it in shillings, and a great quantity of sixpences; there is always gold and silver mixed together; he left three sixpences and one shilling: I had not been out of the bar five minutes when I heard the money rattle; I saw him push the till drawer; I called Daly, and told him that John had taken all the money out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before the justice did not you swear there was not any gold kept in the bar? - I did not. The prisoner was our waiter.</p>

On the 7th of August the prisoner came to the house, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and said he wanted a tooth extracted - I asked him into the parlour, and went into the kitchen to tell Mrs. Harris; there was a musical-box in a case in the parlour window - I heard the case door open, and went up; the prisoner was then going out - he said,"What would it be to have the tooth drawn?" - I said I did not know, but Mrs. Harris would be there in a minute; he said he would go and ask his aunt - I took hold of his arm, but he got out and went away; Mrs. Harris came up and missed the box, and I ran after the prisoner, who was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When had you seen it? A. About a quarter of an hour before - Mrs. Harris is married, I believe; her husband is at sea - I have not seen him at all; the prisoner had no box when he was stopped - I saw him stopped, and was almost close to him; no other person had been to have a tooth drawn that afternoon; I think no one had been there at all that day.</p>

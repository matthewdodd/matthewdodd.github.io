            . I am a constable of Billingsgate. On the 7th of November, about eight o'clock at night, I and Mackey having information, went in pursuit of a man - the prisoner was stopped by somebody and given into our charge; we took him to a public-house, and found a coat on him. We sent for Mr. Telfor, who claimed the shirt on his back; also a handkerchief, and flannel bandage, which he had on. He said his mother gave him the shirt, that she had made it, and he had the fellow at home - I asked if it had any mark; he said, No; we found it marked G.T. He said there was a blue mark on the flannel bandage, and Mr. Telfor also claimed it by that mark - he denied knowing anything of the papers or trunk for two or three days, but afterwards said voluntarily that there was another man in the robbery - that he gave him the things which he had, out of the trunk, and the cannister containing the ship's papers, and finding them of no use to him, he threw them into the Tower-ditch. He took us to the spot; but we cannot find them.</p>

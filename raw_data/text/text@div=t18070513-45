            . I am a watchman of Marybone parish. On the 14th of April, when the serjeant of the night came to me in the division I belong to, he told me to beware of the thieves that night, they were out. I was ordered by the serjeant of the night to leave my lanthorn in the box; I went my rounds as regular as if I were to call the hours. At the hour of one o'clock I was talking to No. 49 watchman, that stands in New Cavendish-street; I left him and turned into Harley-street, Cavendish-square; I come down a good bit of Harley-street, and took Queen-Ann-street, West; hearing the noise of the people coming from Cavendish-street up Harley-street I stopped; I saw three men come across Queen-Ann-street, West; I kneeled down quite close to the railing, the night being dark; and took notice of three persons standing in the street; they stopped on the foot way on the same side with me; I saw them plainly, two of them turned into the door way, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130028"></xptr> one stood with his back to the house on the pavement, the tall man stood on the pavement, he said to the other men, d - n your eyes, you will not have such success to night as you had last night; they had gained a great quantity of lead from the off side of the street the night before. I took of my shoes and went up on my knees and hands, close to the ground where they stood, as close as I could without their seeing of me; I turned into New Cavendish-street, out of Harley-street, and then I stood upright.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the men were in Harley-street were they. - A. I went to No. 49, watchman, and told him that the lead merchants were in <placeName id="t18070513-45-crimeloc276">Harley-street</placeName>

Accordingly Hobbs seeing us, he gave a double small cough, which was a signal to the two men; the two men threw themselves down off the railing at the time Hobbs coughed; they crossed Harley-street; and went on the darkest side; they went into Great Mary-bone-street; they all three walked very gently till they came to the end of Great Mary-bone-street, my fellow watchman darted after them; I catched hold of Hobbs, he ran a few yards before I laid a hand upon him; the two other darted up Great Mary-bone-street; No. 49, watchman followed them, and sprang his rattle; I secured Hobbs, he was getting very resolute to get out of my hands; I sprang my rattle for assistance, the serjeant of the night came to my assistance; and then he came quietly to the watchhouse. My partner took the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time of your seeing them till the time you took them, how long was it. - A. About five or six minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. You were put upon the alarm by the serjeant of the night. - A. Yes, he told us the thieves were out; my partner came to me in New Cavendish-street, and told me they were at work in Harley-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it. - A. Between one and two o'clock, it was very dark; in consequence of that, I went with him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take your lanthorn with you. - A. No, I went into Harley-street, and both of us stooped down; I saw one upon No. 19, he was lifting the lead off, and the other upon No. 21; the third man stood with his back towards the door of No. 20.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which man that was. - A. That was Hobbs, he was the tallest of the three; the other two were standing on the rails, taking the lead off the pediment of the door. One of the three men saw us, he made a cough, who it was I cannot tell. Upon this coughing, they immediately jumped off the railing, they crossed Harley-street, and went down towards Mary-bone-street; I and the other watchman walked after them; Henwright took hold of Hobbs; I saw him seize the tall man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is one of the three men that you saw together. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lose sight of them when they turned the corner. - A. We were as close to them as six or seven yards; we did not lose sight of them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When Henwright seized Hobbs, what became of the other two. - A. The two started, I followed them both, and sprang my rattle; one took to the right and the other to the left; I followed to the left, down Welbeck-street, into Mary-bone-lane; there I seized Guppy; I brought him to the watchhouse; going along I saw Hobbs in custody of the other watchman, and the serjeant of the night.</p>


               <p>Hobbs (to witness). Did you see me stand on the pavement. - A. Yes, it is a fact.</p>
               <p>Court. When you saw him in custody of Henwright, did you or did you not know him to be the man that stood on the pavement. - A. Certainly, he never went out of my sight till Henwright seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to swear that you followed Hobbs, Guppy, and the other man, till they turned into Mary-bone-street, and you hardly lost sight of them for a moment. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Henwright) Are you perfectly clear that the prisoner Hobbs, is the same man that you saw standing with his back to No. 20. - A. The very same man; I never lost sight of him from the time I saw him, till I laid my hand upon him; he was beginning to start when we came upon him.</p>

            . I am serjeant of the night. On the 14th of April, at eleven o'clock at night, I saw the man they call captain, that is Hobbs, in High-street, Mary-bone, I knew him very well; he was coming out of a public house. I went round my division, and acquainted them that the captain was out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any body with him at that time. - A. No; the night before we lost upwards of fifty pounds worth of lead, out of Harley-street. I came to Henwright's assistance; when he sprang the rattle, he had hold of Hobbs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hobbs appear to make any resistance. - A. He did; and I told him that if he did make any resistance and was not peaceable, I would blow his brains out with the blunderbuss. Then Henwright took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose in your way you met M'Killock with the other man. - A. Yes; after we had secured the prisoners we went back to look at the houses, to see if there was any lead lost; I looked at No. 21 and 19, the lead was torn off, and ripped from the boarding of the pediment over the door, ready to take away; a few minutes more they would have took it completely away; both the places were in the same situation.</p>
               <p>Hobbs. I never was on the premises, I made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Hart. He did make resistance, he would have got away from Henwright if I had not come up. When we took him to the watchhouse, the constable of the night knew him; he asked him how long had he been out of prison, he said on Friday last.</p>

The watchman sat the dog upon me, and by the dog following of me I ran to make haste home to my lodgings; the man took hold of me in Mary-bone-lane, he said I want you, you must come to the watchhouse. The other watchman, when we came up to him, said I was along with this man; I said I was not, no more I was not.</p>

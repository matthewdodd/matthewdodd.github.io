I am eighteen years old—I was taken up for this robbery on the morning of the 25th of May, and have come from prison—when I was taken up I lived in No. 1, Pheasant-court, Gray's Inn-lane, in the back-parlour—I could see Mr. Reeve's back premises from that house—I knew Clark, Smith, and Liddiard before—they all three lived up in the top garret, and Williams lived with me—the night before I was taken up, when I left home, about ten o'clock, I saw the three male pri<lb></lb>soners in our room, sitting down—I returned home about two o'clock—I had been walking the street all that time—when I came home I found them all in my room, playing at cards, and Williams was playing with them—shortly after Clark got up, and said he was going out, but where I did not know then—they all three went out together, and returned in about a minute, and said there was a policeman—Clark asked Williams for a piece of candle, and the young girl who lived with Williams, and who she called her sister, said to Williams, "They are gone over to Mr. Reeve's back premises"—they had gone out with the candle then—I noticed that Liddiard had a lucifer in his hand before they went out—I did not see where he got it from—Williams gave him the candle—it was not lighted then—I went out again—I was not out a minute—I came back, and sat at my door—I afterwards went to Hoi born-hill, and came back again with the girl who lived with Williams—her name is Sarah—when I came back I saw Smith standing, looking at the other two prisoners, who were over the wall leading to Mr. Reeve's back premises—Williams was not there then—I next saw Liddiard coming over the wall, with a bundle of things, which he handed to Smith in the yard—at that time Williams was in bed—she slipped on her petticoats, and came into the passage just as they were getting over the wall—I am quite sure I saw Liddiard, Smith, and Clark there—Clark and Liddiard were over the wall, and Smith and Williams were in the court—when they came over the wall, Liddiard said to Smith, "I have done it"—Smith came into the room with a bundle of things, and went up to his own room with them—we all went up into his room to<lb></lb>gether, and he opened the bundle on the bed—there were several watches, a lot of silver spoons and gold rings, and gold pins and things—the rings were all on cards—they were taken off the cards, and the cards torn up and burnt with the candle, and put on the side of the fire-place—Smith said he had better take the cards off the rings and burn them, or he should get found out with them—the things were then all tied up in two hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant I went to No. 1, Phea<lb></lb>sant-court, after Gilbert made a statement at Worship-street Office—in the front attic there, behind a stove, I found a piece of card, two duplicates, a small screw-driver, and the blade of a knife—I have the piece of card here—I found particles of paper which had been recently burnt in the grate—it was more substantial than paper, it is rather card.</p>

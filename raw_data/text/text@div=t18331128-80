               <p>Ironmonger. Q. Did I not do all I could to keep peace with all parties? A. You certainly insinuated that Gale was a fighting man; and that it was dangerous for either party to have anything to do with him.</p>

             (police-sergeant G 6). Allin came to me - I went and took Gale - I found on him four shillings, one sixpence, four pence, three halfpence, and one farthing; 5s., all but a farthing.</p>
               <p>Ironmonger's Defence. I am innocent. I was drinking with all parties. I did my uttermost to keep peace and quietness. I called Baldock out, with a view to keep peace. When I went in again they seemed to wish to have words. I went away to the Two Brewers, where I smoked my pipe till I was taken. I never saw Gale again, till at the station-house.</p>
               <p>Gale's Defence. I have worked for my present employer for the last five years, who, I expected, would have attended, or sent his foreman. The money found on me was my own.</p>

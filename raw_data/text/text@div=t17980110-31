I went into the shop, and saw a man's hand come through the glass, I did not hear the glass break; I saw it whole about ten minutes before, I am sure it was not broke then, because there were some flannels in the window that I had moved further from the glass; I holloaed out, thieves! and ran out at the door, I saw Waring and another man standing close to the window, my coat brushed his as I was running out at the door; Waring run as far as Tabernacle-row, about ten yards, and then he and his companion made a full stop; Waring run into the road, and I after him; my father then came out, and I said, that is one of the men, and I would pursue the other; my father got Waring by the collar; I then saw his companion standing in the middle of the road; I went up to him, and he said, my boy, I will shew you where the people are gone; he said, they were gone down the road; I said, no, they went up the road; I came with him just by our door, then he tried to run away, and I caught him by the collar; he made a blow at me, I slipped on one side, and he threw the piece of calico away; I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there any body standing near besides those two men? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think it was so light, that if there had been no lamps, you could have discovered the features of a man's face? - A. Yes. The other man then got away. (Produces the calico).</p>

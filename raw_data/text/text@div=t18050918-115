               <p>Q. How long has this young woman lived in Mr. Ireson's service? - A. Seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any tea-spoons or any tablecloths? - A. Yes, a great many, that I had seen after she came into Mr. Ireson's service. In consequence of suspicion that I had, I searched the prisoner's apartment on the 8th of August, she was present; I opened the drawer where her things were put, she put her hand into the drawer, and took out a piece of paper, and said I might have all the rest; I told her I would have that; she said she had thrown it into the fire, and I might get it out, but I saw she had thrown it under the drawers; a lad picked it up, and gave it to me; I saw it was the same she threw down, she struggled for it very much.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the paper contain when it was picked up? - A. Four duplicates for five tablecloths and two tea-spoons; the five table-cloths were brought to Queen-square, and the two teaspoons, as the produce of the duplicates; I know the table-cloths to be Mr. Ireson's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am a poor servant unfortunately brought into trouble unthinkingly; when my master and mistress first accused me, they promised me both protection and liberty, and moreover agreed, that if I would pay for the things that were missing, or state the truth without even paying for them, they would forgive me, and not prosecute me. The hope of liberty, and the dread and fear of confinement, induced me to criminate myself; I hope the merciful Judge and Jury will take my case into consideration, and be as favourable as they can, as it is my first offence; thus, on my bended knees, I implore for mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you up or in bed when you missed it?</p>

               <p>Wellings. I remember I put it in my pocket about five minutes before nine, just before I went out, and I had not above 20 yards to walk. I searched her in my room, but could not find it; I kept her in the house all day till three o'clock; then I took her to a Justice's house at Mousewell-hill, he was not at home; then I took her to a public-house, and stripped her, but could not find it; then I let her go: this was on the Tuesday about four o'clock.</p>

I sent for a constable, and they were both taken to the Counter; the prisoner said, she found it fifteen miles on this side Leicester.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Zachariah Longman. On the 22nd of March last we lived in Britannia-street, city-road—we occupied the two parlours—the prisoner lodge in the same house, in the second floor front room—on the 22nd of March last, about twelve o'clock at night, I was with my husband in the back parlour—the prisoner came there, and had some talk about the landlord—we sent for some ale—the prisoner drank one glass, my husband and I parktook of it, and the remainder was put into a bottle, and was drank the second time the prisoner came—he went into his own room, and my husband went to light him up—the prisoner came down shortly afterwards to my back door—he asked for his dog—I was making the</p>

                  </hi> I was house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hos<lb></lb>pital on the 23rd of March, between one two o'clock in the morning, when Longman was brought there—he was in a very exhausted state from loss of blood—there was a wound on the left side of his head and face, about four inches long—the centre was deep, the ends were superficial—it cut through one of the branches of the temporal artery—he was bleeding very profusely—there was a wound on the forehead, just above the nose, about two inches in length, extending to the bone, a superficial wound on the left eye-brow, and three or four smaller wounds of a slight character about the head and face—he was in the greatest danger, from loss of blood from the wound which dividend the temporal artery, and from that over the nose—such an instrument as this razor would inflict the wounds—I should conclude that the wound on the face was about the length of the razor-blade—it is quite healed, but you can see where it was, very plainly—the razor has a very long shaft or holder—it could be held so as to inflict this wound without a man's cutting his own hand, or without its giving way.</p>

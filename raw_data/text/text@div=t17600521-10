               <p>Q. How do you know them to be your property?</p>
               <p>Gregory. Some of them had my father's mark upon them; the screen had, they had shav'd one of the ladders all over, but I know that by my often using it: three of the scaffolding boards were mark'd with J. G. my father's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the justice's on the examination of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gregory. I was; and was told by a labourer, that he had seen the prisoner take the things out of that cellar, and carry them to the broker's; then I went with a constable and found the things; then I went to the justice's again; the prisoner denied it a great while. Mr. Welsh ask'd him how he cou'd so stiffly deny it, seeing it was so plainly made out against him; then he held down his head, and said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gregory. He was my servant, but I had discharg'd him about 6 weeks before; he is a bricklayer.</p>

            . I live in Wild- street, Bloomsbury, Mr. Gregory rents a room of me to keep his ladders and things in. About a fortnight ago last friday, the prisoner at the bar put out 2 ladders, a screen, and some scaffolding boards from that room. I said to him, what was Mr. Gregory going to do a small jobb.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Riley. This was about 11 o'clock in the day, he said he put them out by Mr. Gregory's order.</p>
               <p>Q. How many scaffolding boards were there?</p>
               <p>Riley. I think there were six; he carry'd them away, and as I found afterwards sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think they were at Graham's?</p>

            . I live in the Broad-way, St. Giles's; the prisoner at the bar brought 2 ladders, a screen, and some boards; I cannot tell how many, to my house, and I bought them of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Graham. I can't tell the day of the week, nor month neither. The prosecutor came, and he claimed more boards than were his own; and that ladder that I shaved, I had it from about a week or fortnight after Easter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give the prisoner for the whole of what he brought?</p>
               <p>Graham. I compute it at about 11 shillings, he brought them all at one time, and I made no scruple but they were his own property; he ask'd me if I wou'd buy such things, saying, they were his own, he had been in business for himself, but was reduc'd.</p>

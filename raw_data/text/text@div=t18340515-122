The prisoner lived in my service for about fifteen months, and left about a fortnight or three weeks before the 26th of March - I had a middling-sized clothes box in which I kept my clothes - he had seen me go to that box for money - I kept it in my back parlour - there is a door from the back parlour into the yard - on the night of the 25th of March, I latched that door, but did not fasten it in any other way - I can be certain there were ninety sovereigns and more in sovereigns and half-sovereigns in that box that night - I had seen the money three or four days before - I got up next morning about half-past five o'clock, and found the back door latched as before - I found the box out in the yard broken open, and all my money gone - I am sure the night before I had latched the back door, and the box was then safe in the parlour - I saw the prisoner that night about half-past nine o'clock in front of my premises, and I saw him at the back as well - he lives about three hundred yards from me - I missed a bowl which the policeman brought to me next morning - the prisoner lives in Angel-square - I observed traces on the dung which led to a search.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who did you leave up in your house when you went to bed? A. Nobody - I have no servant - I latched the door myself - I tried it before I went to bed - I forgot to bolt it - I generally bolt it the last thing before I go to bed - I am quite certain I tried it, and that it was latched - my back premises are very much exposed.</p>

            , jun. I am assistant clerk at Worship-street office. I remember the examination of the prisoner, when Taylor was under examination, repeating his evidence - the prisoner interrupted him - he was stating that the prisoner had said he got over the wall - I was taking the deposition at the time. (Here the witness read the evidence of Taylor given before the magistrate) - when he stated that the prisoner had said he had brought the box into the yard, the prisoner said, "I did do it in that way, and not as the policeman has said, by getting over the dung."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot be mistaken in that observation? A. I am quite positive - I believe I made a memorandum of it at the time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No doubt you thought all this was honest, or you would not have taken the money? A. I would not - I thought it quite honest - I have had presents of 10l. before from my friends - he was not a friend of mine - I suspected it was dishonest when he was taken up- I was taken up two or three weeks after - we were taken up together - he had been taken up and discharged first - that was on this charge - I forgot to go to Mr. Williams and tell him the prisoner had given me the money - the prisoner did not say at the office that I had broken the door open - I was not in the yard at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does it not appear that they are worn out instead of being torn out? A. They may be worn out - it is a very old jacket - I never saw Taylor at our premises in my life.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was present at the prisoner's examination - he said he lived in Angel-square, Bishopsgate - I went there, and found this jacket - one of the pockets appears to have been torn out, and the other worn out.</p>

               <p>MR. HERITAGE.

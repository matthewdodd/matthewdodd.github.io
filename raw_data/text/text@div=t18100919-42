I went up to my bed he came up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190026"></xptr>with a pot of beer; that was between seven and eight o'clock, the day light had not gone out of the sky; that was the first time I lodged there, he lodged there before. He came up with a pot of beer; he said, sailor, will not you drink; I took a hearty drink, and said, here is money to get a pot of beer for yourself; he brought spirits next, I drank a little spirits with him and bid him good night. The woman was with him all the time, they went out of my room then.</p>

               <p>Had you any thing in your pocket besides - A. I had two duplicates in the same pocket with the notes, the silver was four pound twelve shillings in dollars and half crowns all, only a sixpence and some halfpence in my left hand pocket.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 14th of August, I saw the two prisoners at the wine vaults, at the top of Gray's-inn lane, they were in a hackney coach, stopping to have something to drink. Blackman got into the coach and searched it; I was there, he found nothing; the coach went on with them in it. We went after the coach, from some information, Blackman and Mantz got into the coach, and I got on the box, and we drove to the watchhouse. I searched Crouch, I found on him, eight dollars, six half crowns, five shillings in silver, and some halfpence, and these two duplicates; one duplicate is a coat and pantaloons, the other is a watch.</p>

            . We came up to the coach at the wine vaults, the corner of Middle-row, Holborn, they called for something to drink, Blackman knew them, he examined the coach and found nothing; the coach then went away. We went and stopped the coach, I opened the coach door, and took eight one pound notes out of Crouch's hand, he was trying to put them under the seat of the coach; I found a one pound note underneath where the woman had been setting in the coach. I was ordered by the magistrate to give the notes up to the prosecutor.</p>

            . On the 14th, I saw the prisoners come up to the wine vaults at the bottom of Gray's-inn-lane, in a coach, I knew him; I got into the coach to secure the prisoner, hearing that he had been throwing the notes about the street. He knowing me, he chucked the notes out of the coach; I held him by the hand that he should not destroy the notes, Mantz took the notes from Crouch; and at the watchhouse the coach was searched, and Mantz found a one pound note. The next morning there came an information, that this wooden legged man had robbed this sailor. Mantz left a jacket in the coach, we took the number of the coach, and two days afterwards I found that jacket in the same coach. It proved to be the sailor's jacket that lost his money.</p>
               <p>Mantz. I did see a jacket in the coach that belonged to the sailor, we went and got it.</p>

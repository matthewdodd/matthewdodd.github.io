            . I am a policeman - I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday, the 23rd of January, in the North and South American Coffee-house, in the City - I searched him, and among his papers was a bill of Mr. De Lolme's; and underneath it there was written, "Left against a cheque of £10."</p>

               <p>MR. DE LOLME. re-examined. This is the bill I gave him, and this is the cheque the prisoner gave me - I sent my man to Green wood's with it - he brought it back to me- I got no money for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Is there any mark on it of yours? A. No; but I inspected the writing very closely - I made no copy of it - I swear to it being the cheque he gave me - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Greenwood and Cox - they have no person named John Weston, who purports to draw this cheque, dealing with them - I remember the cheque being presented to us - my answer was, "No such person known" - I have seen the prisoner at Cox and Greenwood's - I think he was clerk to a commissarygeneral, who returned from Sidney some time ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your department in the house? A. I am in the half-pay department - we have some banking accounts with officers who have sold out, and perhaps have left a balance in account - there are nine clerks in the office I am in - I do not know every body who has authority to draw on the house; but I went round to every clerk who keeps an account in the house, and asked them, and they said "No" - I say we have no such account in our room - I made no mark on the paper presented to me; but it was in the same words as this - I swear it is the same paper.(Cheque read.)</p>

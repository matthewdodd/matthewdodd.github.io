I told her, I took her on a charge of robbing her ready-furnished lodgings—that was not this charge—I took her to the station-house, and found twenty-seven duplicates upon her—I took Wright about half-past two o'clock the next morning at the same place—I then found fifty-seven duplicates lying on the table, Wright was in the room where the prisoner lodged—I saw Mrs. Pain, the landlady, and I got twenty-four more duplicates from her, and received three more duplicates from Benwell the next morning—I received one hundred and eleven duplicates in all—I have traced all the property—part of it has been claimed by the prosecutor—sixty-six duplicates relate to property which has not been claimed.</p>

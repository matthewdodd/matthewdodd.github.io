                  </hi> s. I live in West Smithfield, and am the wife to Thomas Williams. On the 20th of May, the prisoner came to the shop—I was in the small room adjoining, and observed him standing at the glass-case—I went into the shop, and he left—I went to the door, saw him walking away very deliberately he put his hands behind him—I had knocked for some men to come to my assistance—the prisoner ran when he saw some person pursuing him—he then ran violently—he was taken in about an hour—I am sure this is the same person—three or four papers contain<lb></lb>ing about six dozen knives, were missing—they had been all safe within five minutes before—I have not seen any of them since—I could not see any thing in his hands—he had them before him first, and then opened them and put them behind him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was taken a quarter before seven o'clock—she said she lost them about two o'clock, before she said it was about four o'clock—the policeman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183506150012"></xptr>
               <p>asked me where I was—I said at Kensington till past four o'clock; I then came home, and went to a coffee-shop, and had my tea—is it likely that I should go to that neighbourhood where I had done a robbery? or is it likely I could put six dozen knives into my pocket? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. The policeman found he bad no knives, but very deep pockets in his trowsers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Why did you not halloo, "Stop thief?" <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Because he was walking deliberately away—there was no one about—I had four men at work—they came to my assistance, but he ran so quickly then.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 36.) I took the prisoner an hour after this in King-street, two or three hundred yards from the shop—he had been described to me by the witness—he had sufficiently deep pockets to carry the knives—I did not see the knives, but those I saw in the shop were small clasp-knives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About nine o'clock, on the night of the 6th of April, I was on duty at Stepney—on crossing a field at the back of Jubilee-place, I found the prisoner on his knees, with a box, taking this property out of it—he said, "I have found a prize here"—I said, "I passed here a few minutes before, and this box was not here then;" (that was the case)—I asked him where he lived; he said, "In Silver-street"—I said, "You don't live there, tell me where you life"—he said, "I am not bound to tell you"—at last, he said he lived at No. 5, Westover-street, Stepney—I said I should take him to the station-house—I sprang my rattle, my comrade came up, I gave the prisoner in charge, tad took the box to the station-house—I went to No. 5, Westover-street, and found he did not live there—I at last found out the prosecutor—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner about half a mile from the prosecutor's house—this is the box which I found in his custody—it contains the articles stated in the in<lb></lb>dictment.</p>

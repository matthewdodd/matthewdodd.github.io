            , of East-lane, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington, Surrey, coal-merchant;" I also wrote the jurat, except the date - I then delivered to him the power of attorney and affidavit annexed; I have seen Wormersley write - I cannot say that the signature, 
               <persName id="t18300916-155-person1354">H. </persName>
            Lowry, to the power, is Wormersley's handwriting; there is a similarity of style - I should be very loath to say I believed it to be his; if asked whether I believed it to be his. I should say, to satisfy myself, I do not; here is "6th August" in the jurat of the affidavit - I believe that to be his hand-writing; I never saw the papers after he took them away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If asked distinctly whether you could form a belief of the hand-writing, and you were forced to say, you would say you did not believe it to be Wormersley's? A. Yes, I do not undertake to say that is the power he took away - the affidavit is only pinned to it, and could be transferred to any other power; a person having the affidavit could easily fill up the power the same as this, if they obtained the form from the office - I had known Wormersley a few months, and knew his residence; he was not taken up for two years after the transcation; I continued to know him down to the latter end of 1829, and did business for him - I could have read the order on which the affidavit was made if I had chosen, out did not; he was about publicly, and I understand was apprehended at his own factory - I knew him at his own house, which is a short distance from the factory; he was accessible to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Wormersley's father was in some manner concerned in the suit in Chancery? A. I understood so, but we were not engaged in that suit in any way; I have been sixteen years with Mr. Kiss, but never saw Willis till he was at Bow-street on this charge - I never inquired whether Wormersley had given me a true description of Willis, the attesting witness; I have frequently attested deeds - nothing is more common than for a person to be called in to witness the signature to a paper by the party purporting to be the person signing it; I have had letters from persons stating themselves to be the parties, and have then witnessed their signatures - I should certainly ask them if they knew the nature of the business.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Should you, in such a case, take care to ascertain whether the party was the person he represented himself to be? A. Certainly - I delivered the same affidavit and paper to Wormersley as were delivered to me at the Accountant-General's office, by Mr. Giles, the clerk.</p>
               <p>MR. KISS re-examined. On the 15th of August the prisoner Wormersley called on me again; he said he called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160076"></xptr>to request me to accompany him to the Accountant-General's office to identify him, and to receive the cheques - I was to identify him as the attorney named in the power of attorney, which he said he had had from my office, and which he told me was then in the Accountant-General's office; I accompanied him to the Accountant-General's office, in Chancery-lane, Middlesex - he inquired of Mr. Parkinson, the clerk, for the cheques, in the matter of Lowry and Gatland, in the cause Detillin and Gale; he appeared perfectly acquainted with the business of the office - I said, "This is Mr. Wormersley, he is the person named in the power of attorney;" the cheques were then given to him or to me, in his presence, and for his use - one cheque was for 103l. 5s. 1d.; he signed his name in the book, and I attested his signature - (looking at the book). I saw him sign this; it is his hand-writing, and here is my attestation (receipt read) - the power of attorney was on Mr. Parkinson's desk at the time; the prisoner signed the receipt, and received the cheques - perhaps I should be more correct if I said a power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. A. power of attorney, under which he professed to receive? A. Yes - we then went to another office, and had the cheque entered; it is payable at the Bank of England - he and I separated at the door; he took the cheque away - I did not accompany him to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Nothing is more usual than that part of the transaction you performed? A. Certainly, it was perfectly regular; it is very common for creditors in the country to transmit a power of attorney to receive money, when a decree is made, but the papers must be obtained from the office - the Accountant-General has the profit, not the solicitor; it is stated in the order that Mr. Lowry was dead - at the time I identified the prisoner at the office I knew nothing of Mr. Lowry, whether he was dead or alive, or I should have known the power to be forged; if the clerk, who prepared the power, had referred to the decree, he must necessarily have discovered that he was doing wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner, if acting criminally, must have known he was going to the very place of all others where he must necessarily have been discovered? A. He must- the order is dated the 7th of August, 1827, twelve months before the occurrence in question; he must have known the very instrument which would discover this would he laid on their table; I must state that he only turned to that part of the order which does not describe Lowry as deceased - the clerks knew where to look for both parts of the order.</p>

            . Esq. is the Accountant-General. On the 16th of July, 1828, application was made to Mr. Giles, who is next to me in the office, for a power of attorney, in the cause of Detillin and Gale- Mr. Giles prepared this power (looking at it) - it is Mr. Giles' hand-writing; I had nothing to do with preparing the power or affidavit - they were after wards produced to me personally, by the prisoner Wormersley, both the power and affidavit annexed; I cannot say when they were brought - I examined the power as to the execution of it- it appeared duly executed, and the affidavit duly sworn - I marked the affidavit at the back R. B. Fo. C. L. O., it being the outside, and I have marked the power with my initials, so that I know them to be the same; to the best of my recollection Wormersley was alone when he produced the order for the purpose of getting the cheques prepared; on the 15th of August he came for the cheque - Mr. Kiss came with him to identify him as the person to whom the power of attorney belonged; I had it in my possession at that time, in my drawer in the office, it having been previously examined; after I had numbered it, and filled up the receipt. I put the number of the power in the margin of the receipt; Wormersley signed the receipt in Mr. Kiss' presence, who added his name and address there to- the cheque was for 103l. 5s. 1d. on the Bank of England; he took the order of Court, directing the payment, and the cheque away - (cheque produced) this is the cheque in question (read); I put his name to the back of it, to give the Bank knowledge that he was attorney - the first "Wormersley" on the cheque is written by me, and here is another, which is his signature, written at the Bank, acknowledging the receipt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have seen this order, I suppose? A. It was an office copy of the order under which I acted; I had examined the power and affidavit - I had examined the order carefully: I beg pardon for saying so much, but it is my business to look at the ordering part of the order, and if you will read that part you will perceive that where persons are dead it says "To the representatives" of those persons, and here the order says,"Pay to

            Lowry;" my duty is only to read that part - if I was to read all the recitals no man could do the business of the office; there was nothing to prevent my reading the whole - whether Wormersley omitted to read that part I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he was conversant with the business of the office, would he know that according to the course of business, you never read the whole order? A. Certainly - the power of attorney satisfied the ordering part.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Accountant General's office. In July, 1828, I received instructions for a power of attorney, in the cause Detillin and Gale; I believe I received them by, or on behalf of Mr. Kiss - I have them here.</p>
               <p>MR. KISS. These instructions are in Wormersly's handwriting. (read.)</p>
               <p>The order was for two powers of attorney, one from Henry Lowry, of Brentwood, auctioneer, for 103l. 5s. 1d., in the cause of Detillin and Gale, to John Wormersley, as before described.</p>
               <p>MR. GILES. In consequence of these instructions, I prepared that power, it was a printed form; I filled in all the manuscript part except the date and the names of the executing party and witnesses - I inserted the name of the attorney in the body, and prepared the affidavit affixed, except the names of the deponent and witnesses- they were prepared in the office according to the usual course of business - I cannot say to whom I delivered them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. For the purpose of complying with the instructions, I suppose you referred to the order in Court? A. Either to that or the office copy, which would contain the whole order - but I should not look at the recital; that would contain the name of Lowry as deceased - I might refer to it if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160077"></xptr>chosen; I do not know that I ever saw the power after I issued it.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL WELLSDON. I am a clerk in the Bank of England. I paid this cheque on the 15th of August, 1828 - the person signed his name on the back as John Wormesley; he appeared to act as attorney for some person.</p>
               <p>MR. KISS. The endorsement on this cheque is Womersley's hand-writing.</p>

             were the real signatures of the attesting witnesses.</p>
               <p>Wormersley's Defence(written). - My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury - My father was a creditor of the estate of a person named Detillan, the effects of which were administered under the anspices of the Court of Chancery; the debt due to him was large, and deeply interested on his account, I called very frequently upon the solicitors to the estate - this produced a degree of intimacy between myself and the parties in the office, and when, after a great length of time, it was ascertained there was a probability that the debts would be paid in full, it was suggested to me by a clerk in the office that I might derive some advantage from purchasing up such of the debts as were still outstanding as claims upon the estate: I never read the order, and if those whose immediate business it was, did not read it, I could hardly be expected to do so: the first I purchased was a trifling one from a Mr. New, of Aldgate, and finding that the business would occupy more of my time than I could spare from my own pursuits, I employed an acquaintance, a supposed friend, namely, Henry Campbell, to negociate for the sum due to a Mr. Lowry, of Brentwood - the amount of his debt was 103l. 5s. 1d.; Campbell undertook the business of arranging for my purchase of it, and went, as he said, to Brentwood, for that purpose - this is proved by the evidence of Mrs. Wallace, who says that some person (but neither myself nor Mr. Willis was that person) came to inquire whether she would sell the debt due to her father, but that she refused to listen to any such proposition; this refusal Campbell did not communicate to me, on the contrary, he returned to town, and stated that he had concluded the negotiation; and on the faith of his representation being correct, I gave him 60l. for the purpose of purchasing this debt of 103l. 5s. 1d., and furnished him with the blank warrant of attorney to get it properly executed, and conclude the business in the ordinary way; Campbell took the money and the blank warrant of attorney, and soon afterwards returned with it, apparently executed by Henry Lowry, but the office at which the money was to be paid, requiring a further attestation of the signature, Mr. Campbell proposed to introduce Mr. Lowry to affix his signature, in order to obtain the attestation of Mr. Willis to the signature - this was done; Campbell introduced a person to me as Mr. Lowry; I appointed a time, when Lowry, as I supposed, was to attend to affix his signature with that of the attesting witness, besides Willis. The persons representing Lowry, and the witness Deering came to my house, and Mr. Willis met them there; they affixed the signatures, and Mr. Willis made the affidavit of attestation in consequence. I had no suspicion that Campbell was dealing falsely with me; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160078"></xptr>had known him for years, and would almost have trusted him with my life, for that as well as my character has been on the verge of sacrifice through his duplicity, and the ungenerous stratagem by which he has reduced me to the situation in which I stand. The business being completed, and as I thought in a correct way, I obtained the money, and as it appears, entered in my cash book, as an ordinary occurrence. My housekeeper was present when I paid the money to Campbell, which she believes was about 60l., and that I had some conversation with her on the business, from which she gathered that it was for the purchase of a debt, on the execution of a warrant of attorney; but the time that has elapsed, nearly two years, and the improbability that her attention would ever he recalled to the circumstances, has tended to destroy that distinctness of recollection which I could wish had been preserved. Another person was present when I paid the 60l. to Campbell, but I have not been able to produce him as a witness from certain embarrassments of his own, but I have a memorandum in Campbell's own hand-writing of the receipt of the 60l., and this hand-writing will be produced and proved, which is all I can now do, Campbell not being able to be found, for had I the power of producing Campbell, his own life would be the forfeit of his appearance in this Court; he has, as the Court may well suppose, consulted his own safety; for nearly two years he has not been seen by any of his old acquaintances, or in the places of his previous resort - in fact, soon after the date of this transaction he absconded, and has not since been seen in London.</p>

               <p>Willis' Defence (written.) Being prevented by an impediment in my speech from addressing you, I beg leave to submit to writing the following facts: - In the latter end of July, 1828, John Womersley called on me at my lodgings, in East-lane, Old Kent-road, and said that he had purchased a debt, and wished me to call the next morning at his house in Lant-street, Borough, to witness a power of attorney, authorising him to receive the money; I called the next morning at his house, and was there introduced by him, for the first time in my life, to a person who he represented as a Mr. Lowry; the power of attorney was then placed on the table, and I saw Mr. Lowry write his name, "Henry Lowry" on the power of attorney, which I witnessed, as also did another gentleman then present, and afterwards made an affidavit of the same, at an office in Southampton-buildings, for doing which I never received any remuneration, either directly or indirectly, but did it to oblige him, having known him for some time, and being a distant relation - after that I never saw

            . I live in Rochester-terrace, Vauxhall-road. In 1828, I was housekeeper to the prisoner Wormersley, and have seen Campbell several times at his house; about the latter end of July, 1828, I remember Wormersley paying him 60l. - Wormersley then gave him a power of attorney, as I understood; it was a paper - I think it was like the one produced; I understood Campbell was to pay the 60l. to purchase the debt - he was to get the paper properly affixed and filled up as a power of attorney; I saw Campbell again a few days after, and then two or three weeks after, but have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. How often had you seen him before? A. Three or four times; I never saw him any where but at my master's - he left his name once as Campbell; I am positive this happened in July - I cannot give any reason; I cannot say when I was first asked if I remembered this; it was not till after my master was taken up - I have been with him down to the time of his being taken up; he is not married.</p>

            ? A. To the best of my belief, I should say it was; I have received notes from him, and judge that it is - I have not seen him for the last eighteen months or more.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was he? A. I understood he had been an officer in the army - I believe he was on half-pay when I knew him; I was a good deal acquainted with him - he lodged at No. 9, Hampden-street, Walworth, with a Mrs. Whittle; I think I called on him there about 1824 - I think he left there about 1824, or the beginning of 1825; I do not know where he lived in 1827 or 1828 - I have not seen him myself since 1825.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you live in London? A. I did; I left about twelve months ago, but I left London also in 1824.</p>

            . I live at No. 39, Bishopsgate-street without. I know Wormersley, and I knew Campbell, an acquaintance of his; I remember his visiting at Wormersley's house, when he lived in the New Kent-road, about 1823 and 1824, for about a year and a half - the last time I saw him was in the early part of 1828 in Cranbourn-alley.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. You knew him about 1824 and till 1828? A. No - he was generally at Wormersley's on a Sunday, up to 1824; I was not in the habit of being there after that - I did not see him between 1824 and 1828; I always heard him called Major Campbell.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you cease visiting the prisoner in 1824? A. No, but was not in the habit of visiting him so frequently.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to meet him in Cranbourn-alley? A. I met him by accident, and was determined to see if it was him.</p>

I have known Willis seven years; in 1828 he lived at No. 9, East-lane, Walworth - I lent his wife some money to go out of town with in 1828, on the 12th of May: they were then in very distressed circumstances, and continued so in July, August, and September- I found them food, or they would not have had it; there was no appearance indicating they had suddenly become possessed of a large sum while I knew them.</p>

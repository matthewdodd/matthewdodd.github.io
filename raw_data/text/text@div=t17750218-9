               <p>Loveman. Yes, he looked at the lodging then she went down into the kitchen and asked for a candle to see the wine vaults, I went up stairs to light the candle and as I was coming down again, I met him coming up, he desired I would not trouble myself, he would come again on the morrow; I went down into the kitchen and missed the spoons that are produced, he was gone out, I pursued him and called stop thief, and a coachman stopped him in Hanover-Street, about fifty yards from the house; when I cried stop thief, I saw him throw the spoons down Mrs. Needham's area, and run, Mrs. Needham's maid gave them to the footman and he gave them to me, he was never out of my sight till he was stopped.</p>

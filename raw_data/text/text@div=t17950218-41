               <p>Q. Then he was detained? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who you sold the rabbit plane to? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. To Armitage. You said you had it for two months; now there happens to be this man's hand writing on it, will you venture to swear that is your's? did you ever see that man's hand writing there? - I never took particular notice; I never saw that man's hand writing there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. One John Wilkins brought me the tools, and asked me to pawn them for him; he was in distress he said.</p>

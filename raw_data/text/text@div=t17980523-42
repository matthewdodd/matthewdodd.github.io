               <p>Prosecutor. This is my shirt, it is marked with my name; it is worth two shillings and sixpence or three shillings; the breeches I have not worn, but they have been worn since they were taken from me; I am a breeches maker by trade, if they had not been worn, they would have been sold for fourteen or fifteen shillings; this coat I believe to be mine, I have not wore it, it cost me two pounds nineteen shillings; it would fell now for two pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence, as read by Mr. Shelton. I have pleaded not guilty to this indictment, because I look upon it, when a man has once been discharged by the due course of Law, for an offence, he has no right to be apprehended again for it. In the latter end of January last, I was apprehended on suspicion of stealing a watch, and was taken before Serjeant Kirby, Esq. at the Police-office, Queen-square, and ordered for further examination; on Thursday, when I came there, there were all these people against me that are here now; and when I saw that, I told the Magistrate I should wish to speak to him in private; the Justice and I, and one of the officers, went up stairs into a room; I told the Justice if he would admit me an evidence for the Crown, and dismiss the business that I was there for then, together with the affair with which I am charged now, I would make a free confession of a great number of footpad robberies, and burglaries, and tell where they were to be found. Mr. Kirby told me if I really did that, and he should find that the account that I gave of burglaries and robberies done by myself, with two others, in Kent and Surry, was true, I should be admitted an evidence for the Crown. I was committed, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230038"></xptr>the two men were taken, and one was fully committed to the Kingston Assizes for a highway robbery, and another for a burglary, and I was admitted evidence for the Crown; these people now against me were dismissed by Mr. Kirby, who told them I had turned evidence against two other men, upon condition of my being pardoned for this; I was concerned alone in this. I remained in jail till I was taken down to Kingston, I gave evidence against them, I was discharged, and was at home with my friend for three weeks, till having occasion to go to Westminster, the constable came into the room and apprehended me for this robbery; he then told me I must go before a Magistrate, and though it was close to the office at Westminster he would not take me there, because he knew Mr. Kirby could not commit me for it; he took me to Sir

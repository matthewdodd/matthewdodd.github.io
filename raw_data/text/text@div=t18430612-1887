                  </hi>. I am salesman to Thomas Vesper, a pawnbroker, in the Commercial-road. On the evening of the 30th of May I was stand<lb></lb>ing outside the shop attending the sale of goods—the prisoner came up about seven o'clock with a child—she was looking at some goods, and I saw her take something from a pile of goods which were standing outside the door, which had been folded to be taken in doors—she took something from that, and placed it under the child's clothes, then put her other arm round the child, and went off—I went, found her up a court, and the child standing by her side—I had not lost sight of her—when I got to her she was rolling up this shawl and table-cloth—I said she must go back to the shop—she said, "Don't hurt me, I have no father"—I took her back to the shop—these are the articles.</p>

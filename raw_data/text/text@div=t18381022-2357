About a quarter past eight o'clock, on the evening of the 3rd of October, I was passing in the City-road, and saw the two prisoners—Mason took the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—he then went and joined the other—I went and told the prosecutor—we went after the two prisoners, and found them—Mason ran away—I followed him—he threw the hand<lb></lb>kerchief from him—I took it up, and took him.</p>

I never had it at all—he had nearly throttled me, and I ran away—I was passing, and the gentleman said that he saw me make an attempt at the gentleman's pocket, then make another attempt, take the handkerchief, and put it into my breeches' pocket—he then crossed, and asked if the gentleman had lost a handkerchief, and he said he had; he said, "I think they are the two that have got it," and I had no hand<lb></lb>kerchief in my possession.</p>

            . I am Headborough of St. George's. I saw the prisoner run by my shop, in Union-passage, Duke-street, about a quarter of a mile from the place where Mr. Briant was moving from, with the trunk under his arm - I heard the cry of Stop thief! and pursued him - I found the box on a fire, at No. 29, Albion-street; it had been broken to pieces, and the articles taken from it - the prisoner was then at the next house; he escaped from there, and was taken in Bedford-street - I have the pieces of the box now here - the articles were found in Albion-street, and have been identified by Mr. Briant - I saw the prisoner go into No. 29, Albion-street, with the box under his arm; he was taken about ten minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You had but a short opportunity of seeing the man who passed? A. No; but I had seen his face, and am certain of him, as I had seen him before that day.</p>

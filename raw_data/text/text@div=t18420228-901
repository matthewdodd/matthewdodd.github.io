                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at No. 54, York-street, Westminster. I had known the deceased nine years—her name was Mary Reed—on Monday, the 14th of February, about ten minutes before seven o'clock in the evening, she called on me, and asked whether my child was out—I saw the prisoner after that—he is a knife-grinder, I believe—when I first saw him he had a grindstone in his right hand, and two kettles in the left—he was then at the further end of the Crown pub<lb></lb>lic-house, in York-street, on the pavement—he was standing quarrelling with two women, using very bad language, making threats, and shoring them off the pavement—one of the women complained to me of his beha<lb></lb>viour—Mary Reed came by just afterwards, and the prisoner said, "Here is another b—old gin-drinker"—she had said nothing to him—she had no appearance of being in liquor—he then <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her several times, and as she went by my shop I said to him, "Don't use the poor old woman like that"—he was following her—she had not done any thing to him in the least—she said afterwards, "You would not serve me so if my husband was here"—there is a green-grocer's shop beyond mine in the way she was going to her home, and when she got opposite the window of that shop the prisoner <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her again—she had a pair of shoes in her hand, and she put up the shoes in his face—she hoisted them up in her hand in his face—I do not know whether it was to guard off the blow or not—I cannot swear whether they touched his face—he then struck her with the kettle on the hand in which she held the shoes—she directly ran into the Fortune of War beer-shop which is to the left of my place, and over which she lodges—it is next door to the green-grocer's—the Crown is next door to me, on the right, the green-grocer's on the left, and the Fortune of War next to that—after she had gone into the beer-shop I said to the prisoner, "Go on, that's a good fellow"—he said, "I will serve you in the same way"—he stood at the beer-shop door on the edge of the pavement—a young person then came up with his knife-grinder's barrow, I cannot say whether it was his daughter or who it was, and he told her to go on with it home—he said he would beat the old b—y b—brains out before he went away—he said that while he was waiting there—the deceased was an elderly woman—I should say she was in the beer-shop more than three minutes—there are two little folding-doors out of the beer-shop, and when she came out the prisoner took the grindstone, and struck her with it over the left side of her head—he had hold of the buff-end—there is a little wheel at one end, the buff, as it is called, on which they brighten the knife, and at the other end is the little stone—this now produced is it—he held it between the two wheels—this buff end is made of wood, and lined with leather—he struck her with the</p>

               <p>stone end, on the head, and she fell backwards right into the beer-shop—I sent a boy for a policeman—the prisoner was going to walk off, but the policeman came running across the road, and Mr. Reed, the deceased's husband, came down stairs, and he was taken into custody—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking, but was not to say drunk—the deceased was perfectly sober—she was fifty-five years of age.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 1, York-terrace, York-street, Westminster; I am a lacemaker, and keep a stall. On the night of the 14th of February I saw the prisoner in York-street—my attention was first drawn to him by his using very improper language to two females, who were passing by—after those women had passed by, I saw Mrs. Reed, and he said the same language to Mrs. Reed as he had to the others—he called her an old b—, and asked if she was going to the gin-shop—she said, "Go along"—she was against a side door of the beer-shop, where she goes up stairs—she lives over the beer-shop—the side door is in the main street, not in the alley—after using this improper language to her, he kept still standing with her—she wanted to try to get away from him—she was going the opposite way from her own home, up the street, with a pair of shoes in her hand—she was coming out of her home when I saw her first, walking towards Mr. Crow's, and when the prisoner spoke of her in this insulting manner, and followed her, she turned round to go home again—he turned round to follow her, and stood in the doorway of the private door of the beer-shop, where she lived, so that she could not get in either one way or other—there is a public door to the beer-shop, for the people to go in at, and a private door for the lodgers—both doors are in the main street—she strove to get past him, he would not let her pass, and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with the saucepans which he had in his left hand, and struck her a blow on the left hand—Mrs. Reed then turned, and went into the beer-shop—the prisoner said, "You need not go in there for protection, I will wait for <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> till <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> comes out, be as long as <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> like"—he said nothing more that I heard—she staid in the beer-shop about three minutes, or it might be four—he had this grindstone in one hand, and the saucepans in the other—as she came out of the beer-shop door, he lifted up his right hand, and struck her with the grindstone, as she was coming out at the door—she had not said or done any thing to him at that time—it occurred as soon as Mrs. Reed appeared—it was the stone part that struck her head—she fell back into the shop—while she was in the beer-shop the prisoner waited outside—he was not grinding or doing any thing, but merely waiting at the door, and he said he would give her a <hi rend="italic">topper</hi> whenever she came out, I did not hear him say any thing after—I did not know him before—he was rather in liquor, but not to say very much intoxicated—he had been drinking.</p>

               <p>each band, said something to him again, and hit him on the breast, or upper part of the body with one shoe after the other—up to that time the prisoner had not struck her any blow at all—after she had struck him on the breast with the shoes, she ran into the Fortune-of-War—he said some<lb></lb>thing to her, I cannot say the words, and followed her to the door—she remained in the beer-shop about a minute, or it might be a little longer, but I think it was about a minute—I saw the blow struck—the prisoner appeared very much excited after he had been struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, and work for Mr. Eyres. Chandler lodges with my mother—I came with him on the evening in question down Castle-lane into York-street—he left me at the Stag pub<lb></lb>lic-house, Castle-lane, to go to a place of convenience, and he crossed the road to me afterwards—I waited for him on the curb on the opposite side of the road—as Chandler was crossing the road towards me I turned my head to go where we were going to have a drop of beer together, and I saw the deceased and the prisoner in contact together—I had never seen either of them before—he had two large saucepans in hit left hand, and a grind<lb></lb>stone in his right—by what I could see, I think they were both going one way—they were close together, with the exception of the saucepans being between them—I did not see any blow struck with the saucepans—he was swinging them about carelessly, <hi rend="italic">singing,</hi> out, "Old tin kettles to mend," in a jovial sort of way—the saucepans rubbed against her as she passed, and the went into a little bit of a court between, a greengrocer's shop and the beer shop—before that she struck him on the left arm with a pair of shoes which she had in her hand—I cannot say to within two or three inches of where she hit him, but it was somewhere about there—they were <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> each other, talking very loud—she struck him once before she went into the passage, and twice after she came out—she could not have gone far up the passage—there is a bright light at the entrance of the passage—she</p>

               <p>came down with a shoe in each hand, and kept <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> the prisoner—they kept <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> each other all the time—she struck the prisoner with the shoes about the arm or shoulder, and once on the breast, and they both called each other names—after striking him she ran into the beer-shop—she was not in there above a minute or a little more, I cannot exactly judge, and when she came out the blow was struck by the prisoner—I should think he was a little <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—he had had a little, but not knowing his ways I could not exactly tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a chandler's shop in Upper Edmund-street, St. Pancras. On Sunday evening, the 24th of January, I went out with my wife, about half-past six o'clock, leaving nobody in the house—I left the house locked up safe, and returned at half-past eight, and found the keyhole of the door plugged with a piece of wood, so that I could not put the key into it—I climbed on the top of a coal shed, at the back of the house, and entered a door leading on to the staircase—I found my house had been entered by a skeleton key, I suppose, as I found no marks of violence on the door—I lost the articles stated—the watch had been on the mantel<lb></lb>piece in the front sitting-room, first floor—some of the other things were</p>

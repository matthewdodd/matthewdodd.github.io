                  </hi>. I keep the Four Swans, in Bishopsgate-street Eli<lb></lb>zabeth Starkie lived in my service about five weeks—I suspected her during that time, and on Saturday, the 17th of March, I detected her in stealing some money—she left that evening, and I watched her down to London-bridge, to Tower-street, Leadenhall-market, and various other places—I believe she saw me—I at last traced her to a house in Black<lb></lb>smith's Arms-place, Whitechapel—I did not see her go into the house—I obtained information there, which led me to No. 8, Lower Chapman-street—I watched that house for several days, day and night, with assistance—on the Thursday I received information, and went and watched there, and in a short time the prisoner came home, he went into the house, came out again, and walked up and down the street twice—he then went into the house again, and brought out two wheels of a truck—he afterwards brought out the rest, and made up the truck—he then sent, his boy on with the truck into Anthony-street, which is just by—he followed the boy there, told him to take the truck up a lane, and while he did so, the prisoner went into No. 5, Anthony-street—he remained in there about five minutes; then came out, walked up and down the street two or three</p>

               <p>times; then beckoned the boy, and the truck was taken to No. 5, An<lb></lb>thony-street—the prisoner brought out two boxes, placed them on the truck—he then took away the truck himself, and went towards St. Ka<lb></lb>tharine's Docks—I spoke to Nicholas, a policeman, and we followed him to St. Katharine's wharf—I saw him take the boxes into the wharf, and he gave directions that they should be taken to Hull by the steam-boat—we asked him where he brought them from—he said, "Somewhere out of An<lb></lb>thony-street"—we asked him what number—he said he was not certain, but he thought it was No. 5 or 6—we asked who they belonged to—he said, "To a woman named Ann Cook"—I asked why there was no direc<lb></lb>tion on the boxes—he said the woman was following him down, and was going to direct them—they had no direction to them—I then gave him in charge, and the policeman took possession of the boxes—the prisoner said he did not know the woman; that he was merely engaged to bring down the trunks, and she would pay him when she came down—we went to No. 5, Anthony-street, and saw a woman named Chason there—I inquired there about Starkie, but did not find her by Chason's account—I saw her found in the privy of the adjoining house—I left her in charge of a policeman, and went to No. 2, Lower Chapman-street, from where I had seen the truck brought—I saw some property there belonging to a Mr. Browning—I there found a woman named Bell, who has been convicted—she passed as the prisoner's wife—I gave her into custody—the prisoner said that the house No. 2, Lower Chapman-street, was his—I missed a great variety of articles belonging to myself and my guests while Starkie was in my employ.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday afternoon, the 22nd of March, my attention was directed by the prosecutor to the truck which was drawn by the prisoner—I followed it to St. Katharine steam wharf—he was about taking the boxes out, and I asked Mm when he brought them from—he said from Anthony-street, either No. 5 or 6, he did not know which—I asked him why they were not directed—he said a young woman was fol<lb></lb>lowing him down to direct them, and they were going to Hull—he was then about telling the man on the wharf that a young woman was coming down, who was going by the Hull steamer—they were asking him about their not being directed—I asked if he knew her name—he said he believed her name was Ann Cook, he did not know any thing about her, he was only employed as porter—I then took him into custody, and took possession of the boxes—they were not locked, but corded together, and nailed down—I afterwards went to the house, No. 5, Anthony-street, and made inquiry of Mrs. Chason—she said she knew nothing about Starkie, but I found her in the privy of the adjoining yard; she could get to that from No. 5, as the palings between the two yards were broken down—I knocked at the privy door several times, but could get no answer—I forced it open, and took her—Sarah Bell was brought to the house, and we took her, Starkie, Chason, and the prisoner, to the station-house, together—I asked Starkie for the keys of the boxes—she said she had no keys to them—I asked if they were locked—she said they were not—she treated them as hers.</p>

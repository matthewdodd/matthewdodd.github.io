                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you speak indistinctly about Tuesday, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> clear about Wednesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have called it to our recollection on purpose—the young parties in the place, the lad particularly, recollects it—he is not here—I do not work in the room, but he passed out through the shop, and had a shilling as he went out, which he generally does, taking the balance on Saturday—nothing particular happened on Wednesday to call this to my recollection—he did not come on Thursday—Wednesday was the last time he came—I cannot say exactly <hi rend="italic">to</hi> a minute at what time he left—I can to five minutes—I did not look at any clock—I know it was after nine, because I went out myself—I know it was not a quarter past eight o'clock by the time of night—the gas had been lighted a good while, we generally lighted it about eight o'clock—we pay by piece-work—we keep an account of the number of cigars we make—the person who could tell the number we made that day is not here—I know nothing of Back ham's private character—I never saw Speed.</p>

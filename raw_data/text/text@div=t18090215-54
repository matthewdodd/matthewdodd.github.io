            . Q. Were you with Mr. Cooke on the 3d of February last - A. I was standing behind a place ready waiting for them, I saw Smith come in first, he tapped with his finger at the door three or four times, we could hardly hear him; then he walked up towards the parlour door, about ten or twelve feet; then Cole came in and handed the carpet down from the window and handed it to somebody else; I ran immediately across the shop and took him by the collar; Mr. Cooke took Smith in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Cole and Smith together before they came in the shop - A. No; I had but just come home from my work.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Had you seen Cole and Smith together before they came in your shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt about their persons have you - A. No doubt whatever; I had seen them several times about the street before they made the attempt in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time had elapsed since you saw them first, and the time they came into your shop - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them speak together at all - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Smith say what he wanted in your shop - A. No; when I seized him he never spoke a word.</p>
               <p>Cole's Defence. I never was in Mr. Cooke's shop in my life. I was going along Margaret street when the person laid hold of me; he said he saw me take it out of the shop; I said it was false.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was passing by Mr. Cooke's door a man observed to me that there were three or four people round the shop; he said it was a pity but that somebody would let them know it; I knocked at the door; nobody came; and then I walked in, and stamped with my foot; nobody made answer; then I immediately walked up to the parlour window; Mr. Cooke and Mr. Jones ran out immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it done in such a way as a person would do, if a person wanted to give a signal - A. By no means.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On Tuesday the 7th of February, about seven in the evening, I was in company with Ekelsoe and Deer in Holborn, at the corner of Kingsgate street; I had just before heard a whistle; I looked, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Kingsgate street, I knew him, I asked him what he was at there; I think he replied nothing. I laid hold of his hand, and desired my brother officer to lay hold of the other; I asked him what he had got, he said only some stockings. I took him into a liquor shop, and found these things in his bosom; I have had them in my custody ever since; he told me he found them things in Holborn, he picked them up. It was a dirty night, and the stockings were not muddy, they had no appearance of having been dropped in the dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Book's - A. Two or three hundred yards or more; Mr. Book is the corner of Dean street, and this is the corner of Kingsgate street.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of work; I went down to the Cross Keys, I got some work to do. I was coming home on Tuesday night along Holborn, I picked up these stockings; I saw three men running before me; I cannot say whether they dropped them or not; I was at the corner of Kingsgate street, I was going to the public house to get a pint of beer.</p>

I left them there safe about five in the afternoon of the 16th. Gilson went out on the 6th. I cannot say whether she carried any thing out with her.

Mrs. Perkins's is a back-room - her's was in front, on the same floor as Mrs. Perkins. Anything thrown out would fall into the street. As Gilson left, she said,</p>

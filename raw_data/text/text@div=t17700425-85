I am stated as noon-tender in the port of London; my duty is from one to three, while they go to dinner. On the 24th of April I had this box in charge; it being of great value, I sat by it on the key. I had also some wine under my care. I saw some men get round the wine. I went towards it; I turned round, and saw the prisoner taking this box away. I ran after him, and he was taken going out with it into Thames-street. There were in the box two pieces of flower'd sattin; had it been lost, I must have made it good; it belonged to the Russian ambassador. It was landed, and had been opened by the land-waiter.</p>

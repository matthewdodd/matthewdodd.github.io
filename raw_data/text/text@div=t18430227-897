                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Henry Samuels, a surgeon, living in Mansel-street, Whitechapel. On Saturday, the 25th of Feb., between eight and nine o'clock, I was going up stairs, and observed a man in the second floor front room, standing up in an arm-chair—the room-door was open, and the room was in a state of disorder—I saw some clothes scattered up at the further end of the room, by the wardrobe—the man was standing on the chair round the corner of the room—thinking it was the boy that used to clean our knives and go errands, I said, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, what a fool you are to frighten me"—he turned round, and said, "It is only me, ma'am, it is only me, ma'am"—I turned round and held a candle-shade up, which I had in my hand, and saw it was the prisoner—he rushed by me—I followed him down to the drawing-room, calling out, "Master! thieves!"—he made a kind of stop—I went to catch hold of him—he struck at me with his fist, and rushed down to the passage-door—I went to catch hold of him again—he kicked me, and rushed out of the house—I opened the door, and rushed out—my master came directly, but he was out of the house before my master could open the door—he was brought back by a constable in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I am sure he is the person that was in the room—I could see his features by the light I had—our street-door is kept open till between eight and nine o'clock, we then close it—there is a passage-door a little further in, that is the door the prisoner ran out at—it was shut about a quarter of an hour before, when I took some coals into the parlour, for the parlour-door is close to it, and I should have seen if it had been open—I can swear it was shut—it shuts with a latch-lock, which catches—I had not been in the bed-room since five—it was then in order, and every thing in its place—there were no clothes on the floor, they were in a drawer against the window—these clothes now produced are my master's and mistress's—this gown, pair of trowsers, and stays, were in the arm-chair at five, where I saw the prisoner standing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Levy, a watchmaker in Prescott-street. On Saturday evening I was passing Mr. Samuels' house, and saw the prisoner run out of it—I am sure it was him—I did not know him before—I can tell him by his dress—he ran down the same side of the way—Mr. Samuels came out, and hallooed, "Where is he?"—some young man said, "He is gone that way," pointing towards Whitechapel—Mr. Samuels went that way—I said, "He is not gone that way, he is gone towards Prescott-street"—Mr. Samuels ran across the road, towards Vinegar-alley, which was</p>

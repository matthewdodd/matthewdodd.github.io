               <p>Prisoner. Q.Were there not persons at work there who might have got into the pantry? A. Yes: the area gate was open, but the door was shut - I have known the door to be left open - I have no proof that you locked the door - the box was locked, and the key of it hung in the press - the bunch of keys hung up, but no one but you knew what they were - there was one workman in the pantry that day; but I went in with him, and came out with him - I saw him go out of the house - I will swear the press was then shut - the lock of the box was a common lock - I never tried it with any other key.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it usual to lock the pantry-door? A. Yes; if there was no man there - the key of the box could not be seen without opening the press.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you find the bunch of keys safe on your return? A. Yes; there were ten or twelve keys on it - the prisoner knew the key of the box, and no one else - he tied it on the truck himself - the bricklayer and labourer who were at work there that day are here.</p>
               <p>JOHN MITCHELL, jun., Esq. I live with my father in Charles-street, Berkeley-square - his name is John. On the 3rd of December there was some plate of mine in the plate-room, thirteen table-spoons, six table forks, two desert spoons, and two tea-spoons - they are all missing and were worth about 24l. - the house is my father's dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square - the prisoner was under-butler - I never authorized him to take away the plate, or the clothes - about 260l. worth of plate of my father's was taken away beside my own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe, Sir, you will own I received a good character? A. Yes, or you would not have been there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not possible that any person could have got into the pantry? A. I shut the house-door and it is constantly kept shut - the workmen generally come sooner than that.</p>
               <p>SARAH TURNER. I am housekeeper to Mr. Mitchell. on the 3rd of December I went out at five or ten minutes after three o'clock - I went into the pantry before I went out and saw the prisoner there, cleaning some plate at the dresser - he had something in his hand, which appeared to be loose, and rattled very much like plate, and he put it on the dresser behind the door - I returned at a quarter before five.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Will you swear there is a dresser in the pantry? A. Yes - what we call a dresser - it is not an old-fashioned dresser - but one proper for a plate pantry, because it has drawers to it - when you open the door the dresser is rather behind it - I cannot tell what you put down, but it rattled like spoons or forks.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The pantry-door is just opposite the servants'-hall door, you would have seen me go into the pantry. Witness. I did not see you go in there; I was taking in some fish which was brought into the kitchen.</p>

I said, "Well, as you lost your clothes, where did you get money to buy these clothes you have on?" - he said it was given him by a friend, who was a servant out of place; but he would rather be transported than tell his name - I saw he had this new hat on, and I took it off his head for the purpose of seeing the maker's name, and I saw this writing on the inside of it - he said, "I bought it of a Jew" - I was then called away, and I directed the gaoler to take the hat from the prisoner - I afterwards went to remove the prisoner to the House of Correction - he had a fur cap on, and he began to complain of having his hat taken from him - when he got outside he was very violent, he insisted upon it that they had no right to take his hat, and if he had known it he would have torn the b-y hat to pieces - he threw the cap down into the road, jumped upon it and kicked it - he said, the magistrate had no right to have the hat taken away to make evidence - nothing had been said then to cause him to think that it would be made evidence - he took his cap from me, and tore the lining out, and he said, "If I do not get my hat, I will throw no light upon it" - when we got to the gate of the office he was going to throw the cap away, and said, "I will not have this b-y thing on; if I do not get the hat I am dumb."</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was the door kept shut? Witness. It was opened for the tradesmen to come in, we shut it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got drunk and lost the livery - I went to a b-y-house, but whether in St. Giles's or Blackwall, I do not know - I went with a friend, who is a married man, and I promised not to tell his name - we got drunk, and he let me have the money to get my clothes - I did not take a single article of the plate.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the East India Company's service, at the tea warehouse in Cutler-street. On Saturday, the 18th of May, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and presented me a permit for four chests of tea, one of which was No. 8720 - he said he came from Mr. Goodey for a chest of tea, that he was his porter, and this one chest was wanted immediately to go into the country by a waggon, and that the carman was gone to the Docks, and would call for the other three on his return; I believed this account and delivered it to him; he took it away on his head. This was about half-past two o'clock. Goodey's carman called a quarter of an hour after, and wanted four chests; I told him one was delivered to their porter. I had told the prisoner to take the permit with him, to prevent its being seized - he said his order was to leave it with me. On Monday I saw him in custody. I am certain of his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not know Mr. Goodey - A. No. I should not have delivered it unless he had produced the permit. I knew Goodey by name. The permit is obtained at the Permit-office. There is never any other document brought to me.</p>

I saw him on the 18th of May, about a quarter before three o'clock, in Fenchurch-street, with one chest, as I was going to fetch four chests; I knew him before that; I said nothing to him, but went to the warehouse for a request note to go to the Excise-office for a permit for four chests of tea, and could not find the request note in the box - I was going out of the yard, and Walker called to me; I found he had the permit, and, in consequence of what he told me, I informed my master.</p>

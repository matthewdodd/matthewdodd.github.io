On Saturday night, the 13th of May, I slept in the same room with the prisoner - it is my own house; he boarded and lodged there for about three weeks; I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock - he was then in bed. I was awoke in the night by hearing him getting up; I asked where he was going - he said down stairs; I went to sleep, and did not awake till the morning, about six o'clock; I then missed the articles stated in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220039"></xptr>the indictment, which had been in a drawer in the room - I had not seen them for some time, as they were keepsakes - the drawer was not locked. I saw them at Marlborough-street about a week afterwards. The prisoner is no business - he has been at sea.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Joseph Farrance, in Broad-street, St. Giles'. On the 13th of May the prisoner came to look at some jackets, to which he objected; I then showed him a coat and some waistcoats, and in pulling off his coat to try them on he pulled out two watches and an eye-glass, and asked if we bought such things - I said No; he said he wished us to take his coat and the watches in exchange for the things he wanted; I said the coat was too large for him - he then said it was his father's coat; he left that and the watches, but took away the other articles.</p>

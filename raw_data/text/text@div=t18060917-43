               <p>Q. Was it in bank notes or in gold and silver. - A. In gold and silver, I had in my pocket twenty-three pounds in gold and silver, and I believe a one pound bank note; and when I had missed the money I had only eighteen pounds and some odd shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse the prisoner of taking it. A. She was my <rs id="t18060917-43-deflabel233" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Did she go into the room. - A. She went into the room to make the bed; she took it in the morning before I got up, I saw her in the bed room; when I missed the money, I asked her if she had taken any thing from under the bed, she told me that she had not; I told her I had lost a great deal of money, she said she was very sorry for it, she was very ill at the time, she went out in the afternoon, and when she came home she saw me a fretting, she stood and cried, she said she was going away, the air did not agree with her, she went away that evening, I saw no more of her; on Tuesday I went up stairs to put on a clean gown, I missed it, I lost a child's shirt, a pinafore, and a gold pin.</p>

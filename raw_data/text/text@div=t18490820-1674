                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bartholomew. Between ten and eleven o'clock, on 8th Aug., I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi>, off Woolwich—I felt the prisoner press against my side—having felt that, I turned, and saw him putting my pocket-handkerchief into his pocket—I said, "You have picked my pocket"—I felt my pocket, and missed my purse, which had one shilling in it, and a corkscrew—I said to my husband," That man has robbed me"—he went round the deck, and when he came to me again he had my purse and the corkscrew in his hand.</p>

               <p>Serjeant, and that they tied a rope to the prisoner's body, and threatened to throw him overboard—I had not been stooping down, I was looking at my boxes—the prisoner sat next to me—I begged him to move.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on board the vessel—in consequence of my wife speaking to me, and pointing out the prisoner, I watched him—I met him near the funnel—I charged him with picking my wife's pocket—he gave me this purse and corkscrew—he dropped a handkerchief just behind him, but I did not see him—he was ill-used—I told them not do so, and told him to go below.</p>

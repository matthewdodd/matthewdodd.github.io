            . I am of the firm of Lloyd and Hoskins. On the 20th of August, when I returned home, Collins told me of this order; and between five and six o'clock that evening, the prisoner Sheldrick called and expressed his surprise that the wine had not been sent down, which he ordered in the morning; I said he need not be surprised, as it was the custom of our house not to send wine or spirits to any one unless we knew them - he said, "I understood you knew Mr. Frost, he became security to you for 30l.;" I said, Yes, he did, but we should not trust him the more for that- he said, "He is a young man who employs twenty or thirty men, and if you send the wine down it will be paid for, as he has a party of friends coming, who have promised him a good order, and he wishes to have it;" the order was for two dozen of port, two dozen of sherry, and two gallons of brandy - I said, "On the understanding that the money will be ready, I will send it at seven o'clock, but you had better tell him to be prepared with the money, otherwise I shall tell the man to bring it back."</p>

               <persName id="t18320906-329-person2738">drew</persName>
             the cork of the brandy bottle with his teeth, and said, "What the devil is this?" they then went out at the back door, and waited some time - they then came in -Sheldrick left the shop, and Frost walked about, and said, "I have a little instrument here, called a crow-bar, and every man who enters my premises I will cut his liver out - and all that remain I will serve the same way;" I concluded by that he meant me; he still walked about, stamping the crow-bar about, and asked when I intended to leave the shop - I said I would lose my life before I would leave without the goods or the money - I still kept begging and praying of him to let me have the wine; and just at that time the Policemen came to the back door, which was then fast - I sung out, "You can't come in that way," and they came round to the front; Frost then said to me, "You may take the goods if you like" - I went on my knees into the counting-house, feeling for the wine and brandy; I got them into my basket just as the door was opened to the Police; and just at that time, a man came in, and said, he had been to Mr. Lloyd, and he was gone to Peckham; Frost said he would knock his b - y brains out; I do not know what became of the bottle of brandy which they took out at the back door; I missed that, and one bottle of wine, beside the one that was broken; I said I was two short - they said they knew nothing about it; I am sure it was correct when I delivered it - Sheldrick counted it, and found it so; I had not been put out of the premises - I was there about an hour and a half, or three-quarters; in the course of the time, Frost told me if I would sign a paper, I should have my goods; I said I would sign no paper, I would have my money or goods.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Frost tell you this before the brandy bottle was drawn? A. Yes, the bottle that was broken might have been an accident; at the time the brandy bottle was drawn, there was a mob round the house, and they were calling to me not to leave, as he was a bad character - Sheldrick said if they were to give them a glass of gin a-piece, they would turn on their side directly, and then they could soon clear the house altogether- I re-packed the bottles in the counting-house; I said at that time that I missed two bottles of sherry, and one of brandy, and to the best of my recollection, I told the Magistrate that I mentioned it then - Frost offered to go with me to Mr. Lloyd's; I said if I went, I should take the wine with me - I did not see the paper he wanted me to sign; Sheldrick unpacked the wine till he broke the bottle, and then I unpacked the rest; I never was struck with the crow-bar - it is such an articles as glaziers raise their lead with; I did not see Frost partake of any brandy - he took it out; I remained in the shop, and the wine was in the counting-house - I placed myself about the middle of the shop, facing the counting-house; the shop was shut, but I do not know whether it was done to preserve it from the violence of the mob - the mob collected when I was struck, and I think the shop was shut about eight o'clock; all the property, with the exception of the two bottles of sherry, and the one of brandy, are at the station-house; none of the mob came into the shop - I think only four persons came into the shop, and one they told me was a publican, who lived just by; I believe he was a man who kept a retail beer-shop - Sheldrick was gone before Frost told me I might take the goods back, but the bottle of brandy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060144"></xptr>had been drawn before then; I told them it was not their property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Tell us as near as you can, what was said at that time? A. Frost said he could not draw the cork, and Sheldrick said, "Let me draw it," and he drew it, and said, "What the devil is this? I can't tell," and he gave it to Frost, who took it out at the back door, and Sheldrick followed him; it was before that that Sheldrick had said if they gave them a glass of gin a-piece, they would turn on their side.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you give him permission to take out the brandy? A. No; I said they were doing very wrong, as it was my master's property.</p>

I went to Frost's house; when the door was open I saw Frost, but not Sheldrick - the mob was collected outside, who told me there was a wine-merchant's man who could not get his money, and they were afraid he would be ill-used; Frost said to me, "I want you to clear the mob away, and then you can go about your business;" I said, "I want to know what brought them together?" the carman then said, "I want you - he will neither let me take my wine away, nor yet give me my money;" I asked Frost the reason, and he said his master had got a bill of his for 30l.; the carman said he had not got a bill for thirty pence - the place was dark till I sent for a light; the man then missed two bottles of wine and one of brandy - I searched to find them, but could not; the carman then said, "I will give him into custody;" I took Frost, and on the day following I found Sheldrick in Hoxton; I asked him if he knew one Mr. Frost - he said, "What makes you ask the question?"

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. The prisoner was the cab-driver? A. Yes. I did not know the other two men - I knew the prisoner by his coming there of a night; it was the other man took the coat and went out, and the prisoner followed him - I had seen persons wink before - I have often heard persons say, when they were going, "I am off."</p>
               <p>Q.You say the prisoner turned his back to you, now be very careful, did he wink before he turned his back? A. Yes. I never said that he first turned his back - I did not tell the magistrate that he first turned his back and then winked - I have no doubt that the prisoner got into the cab.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner hear you charge the man with taking the coat, and call "Stop thief?" - A. Yes; they made no answer, but drove off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How far had the cab got before you stopped it? A. I suppose one hundred yards; it had not stopped till I stopped it - I can't tell whether there had been time for any one to jump out - I suppose the cab had not been half a minute in running the hundred yards; it drove at a pretty good pace - I saw no other man in the road - I heard the witness state that the other man got into the cab, but I saw no man - the policeman was at the head of the horse, but we were so close together that I can hardly tell who stopped the cab - the prisoner did not pull up; there was a cry of "Stop thief."</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear that the prisoner did not himself pull up? A. I was at the back of the cab; I could not see his hands - I will not swear that he did not pull up.</p>

             (police-constable G 114). I was on duty in Castle-street - I heard the cry of "Stop thief," about a quarter past eleven o'clock - I came in front of the cab, which I saw coming down - the moment I arrived at the horse's head, the prisoner, who drove it, pulled up; and before I knew what the charge was, he said, "I have not got the coat; search the cab;" Mr. Ashman and Engley came up; they had pursued the cab from the house - in consequence of me and my brother-officer coming up, I rather think the prisoner pulled up in a measure, but not sufficient to stop the horse - there was no man in it but the prisoner; it had got seventy or eighty yards, or more, from the house; the night was dark, and another man might have got out in the dark part of the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose if two men got into the cab at the public-house, and only one was in it when you stopped it, it is a direct inference that the other man must have jumped out? A. He was seen to jump out, but not by me - I searched the cab, but the coat was not in it; the prisoner stated the truth when he said he had not got it - I believe the prisoner pulled up, for the horse slackened his pace.</p>

               <p>How soon was it after that he came, when he looked out this assortment that you have mentioned to my Lord? - It was Monday when he looked out the tumblers, and he came again on the Saturday, and he looked out these things.</p>

When he tore the piece of paper off, and put it in his pocket, had he read it? - He took it off and read it; and he said, it is two pounds fourteen shillings and nine-pence, is the bill; no, says I, it is the memorandum, which I have made out for myself; I did not know he was going to take it, when he put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You said you had not made out a bill, it was a memorandum? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what does your memorandom, and your bill differ? - I always take a piece of paper, and make out a memorandum, and put it down to see what it comes to, then I book it; I always write a bill in a different way.</p>
               <p>How? - Because I take a quarter of a sheet of paper, and cut it a different way; I am more particular in making a bill.</p>
               <p>You do it more clerk-like; but is there any difference between your memorandum and your bill but the mode of writing it? - No, Sir.</p>

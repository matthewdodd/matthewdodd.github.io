               <p>I am a Silversmith, in Holborn. On Tuesday, the 20th of November, about eight o'clock at night, the prisoner at the bar called at my shop, and asked me if I would buy a diamond. I looked at it - he had got it between his fingers. - The diamond appeared rather greasy. I said, I don't think this is a diamond. Says he I am sure it is a diamond, from the place from which I had it. I asked him, what he asked for it. He said, 60 guineas. I then step'd out to Mr. Chandler's, the pawn-broker, and asked his opinion about it - and then I asked him who he lived with. He said he lived along with Mr. Goldsmid. I asked him how he came by this diamond. He said, he found it opposite the Royal Exchange. - but I should have observed, that he either said, he had given a diamond price, or it cost a diamond price - I cannot be certain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150021"></xptr>which of the expressions he used. At last he said, he found it at the Royal Exchange. I told him, I was afraid he did not find it there, but that he found it at his master's house. He then told me that the maids were out, and that he was 
sweeping the carpet; and underneath the carpet he found this diamond. I asked him how he could offer it to sell, he said his master had offered 10 l. reward for it. I took him to Bow-street, and have had the diamond ever since; and called at M. Goldsmid's the next morning (the diamond produced and deposed to).</p>

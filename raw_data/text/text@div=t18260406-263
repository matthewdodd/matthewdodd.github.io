             - she lives in Gee's-court - the prisoner was an acquaintance of hers. I am in the workhouse - I was at the public-house, and saw the prosecutor come in, and have some gin and water; he did not speak to the prisoner, but she took hold of his glass and drank out of it - my mother and I went home, leaving them there; when we had been at home about an hour, they came there together - the prosecutor sent me out for half a pint of rum, which they drank; they then sent for half a gallon of beer; I went out for another half pint of rum, and afterwards I saw the prisoner pull up her clothes, and dance before the prosecutor; my mother said she ought to be ashamed of herself, and then she sat upon his knee for a quarter of an hour; we had not much candle - the prosecutor then got up to go away, but he fell down on the floor, and soon afterwards the candle went out - I then went to bed - when I awoke in the morning the prisoner and my mother were laughing at the prosecutor; I then went and sat on the stairs - the prosecutor called the watchman - he could not open the door, and the watchman broke in - he got another watchman, and they searched, but could not find the money - they went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect any thing about a watch? A. Yes; the prisoner went up to the prosecutor, and pulout his watch - she said "By G-d he has got a good watch," and then put it in again - she then went to his other side, and took out a bag of sovereigns - he awoke, and said "What are you at?" he then pushed it into his pocket again, and she went and sat down on the bed - I then went to sleep, and did not see any more - the candle went out.</p>

               <p>Jury. I suppose a great many servants had access to these things? - I never locked them up; the servant gave some information and in consequence of that we got a search warrant, we examined the prisoner's house, and found half a dozen table knives and forks, I cannot say how many pair of silk stockings, there were some pairs and some odd ones; we found one pair loose at one side of the room, and others were found in a cupboard tied up in a diaper napkin, the knives and forks and stockings were all tied up in that towel, the prisoner was present, she said, she hoped I would be merciful to her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. You took good care I understand of your master's things, for you never locked them up? - Never but when he was out of town.</p>
               <p>All the servants had access to them? - Every one.</p>
               <p>One of them I think you said lodged with this prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner was employed to do any thing at your house? - I cannot say what.</p>
               <p>Nor whether this young woman or any of the maids took them you do not know? - No.</p>
               <p>All you know is finding them at her house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And one of the maids lodged at the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You and she did not perfectly agree before this time, she did not like you quite so well as you could wish? - I always behaved civil, I think she had no reason to dislike me.</p>
               <p>I know that you was kind but she was cruel; did the other servants visit her, or their other fellow servants? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Jury. Could you believe that a woman in her situation of life, or her husband, wore such things? - I did not know she was a washerwoman till now.</p>
               <p>What is her husband? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Hogg. Did not the laundry-maid and the chamber-maid take care of the stockings? - I believe they did.</p>

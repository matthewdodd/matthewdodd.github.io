                  </hi>. I am superintending president of the Twopenny Post-office. The prisoner was employed as an assistant letter-carrier in the En<lb></lb>field district—in consequence of something I heard on the 8th of June, I marked a sovereign, and enclosed it in a sheet of paper, sealed it, and directed my clerk to address it to Mr. Thomas Nicholson, George-street, Manchester, and saw him direct it—I delivered the letter that same day to Peek, the officer, and desired him to proceed to Ponder's-end next day and post the letter there, and to meet me at Enfield post-office a little before one o'clock on the 9th—I got to Enfield about a quarter to one on the 9th—it was the prisoner's duty to collect the letters at Ponder's-end, and he was provided with a pouch to put them in, and to take them to the post-office at Enfield, to be made up for the London bag—he collected at Ponder's-end about a quarter-past twelve—I waited at Enfield till the bag was brought out of the post-office, and delivered to the rider to put into his saddle-bag to bring to London—I pro<lb></lb>ceded immediately to the post-office at Enfield—Peek was also there—I got the bag from the rider—the prisoner was standing at the side of the horse—I took the bag into the sorting-office, cut it open and looked for this letter—I could not find it, and I said to the prisoner, "A letter is missing, are all the letters here that you have brought from the receiving houses?"—he said, "Yes"—I looked over the letters again, and said, "A letter is certainly missing, have you got any about you?"—he said, "No"—I then asked him if he had any objection to be searched—he hesitatingly said, "No"—I directed Peek to search him—when he was in the act of doing so, the prisoner got out of the chair where he was sitting, and said, "It is no use denying it," put his hand into his left-hand trowsers pocket, and pulled out the letter, crumpled up—it was the letter I had previously given Peek—this is it, it has not been opened yet—(<hi rend="italic">The witness here opened it</hi>)—it contains the same sovereign as I put in—the prisoner said, "I beg your pardon, I hope you will forgive me!"—he fell down in the chair, and laid his head across the back of it—I then gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the post-office receiving-house at Ponder's-end, and I assist him in doing the duties of the office—I know the prisoner—he came to the office on the 9th of June—this letter was then in the post-office—as I took the letters out of the box, and put them on the counter, I observed this letter, bearing a blue stamp, I took it up, and observed to the prisoner, that I thought it above weight, and that it contained coin, and by the sound of it a sovereign—I knocked it against the counter—the prisoner took it up, looked at it, and replied to the same effect, that it did contain coin—I then proceeded to sort them, and make up my bill, and gave all the letters to the prisoner—I laid this down among the rest—he had no bag—he went away with the letters to go to Enfield.</p>

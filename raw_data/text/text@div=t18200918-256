As the prisoner passed he snatched Mr. Carr's watch from his fob. They all ran off except one, who tried to hinder me from pursuing the prisoner, but I did, and saw him take his hat off. I ran about a hundred yards. He was not out of my sight while I followed. Stevenson pursued the same man and took him. I saw the prisoner full five minutes before he came up, remembered him, and can swear to him. Stevenson and others brought him back in a quarter of an hour. The watch was produced before that. Mr. Carr is eighty-seven years old, his sight is very bad, and he knows nothing about it.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at Bethnal-green. I was in the shop, and heard Body call Stop thief! She was pursuing the prisoner. I ran by her and met a gentleman who said</p>
               <p>"There he goes." He had turned round by the Greyhound. I saw him before he turned the corner. He was still running alone. I followed her to Green-street. He turned up North-place. I went a shorter way round, and met him at the end of North-place. He was then walking but very much heated and out of breath. I am sure he is the man. He said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got him?" I laid hold of him and said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have got him now." I did not exactly know what he had been doing, and as nobody came to my assistance I let him go. He turned short round and came back into Green-street as hard as he could. Before he had got to the bottom of North-place a person came up and said he had stolen a watch. I instantly followed him, he crossed Green-street, and I found him in custody in about five minutes. Some brick-makers had detained him till I came. I am certain he is the man. He strongly denied every thing, and said he ran because the people called stop thief. Directly Mrs. Body saw him, she said he was the man, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am an officer in the army. I was passing on the green when I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw Mrs. Body and four young men; one ran off and she pursued him. I followed and saw him take his hat off and wipe his face, and in putting it on again he threw his hand over the fore-court as if he threw something away. I lost sight of him. I went to the spot, and on the railing I found the watch; it had opened in falling. Wild took it up and delivered it to Body.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Duke-street, St. James's. I knew the prisoner—he gave me the name of Hawkes Nottidge, when I first saw him—I saw him on Monday, the 23rd of May—I had seen him three weeks before, when he called at my house to look at my apartment—on the 23rd of May, he asked me to allow him to go into a room to wait, because he had appointed to meet a person at my house from Ludgate-hill, who was to brings a gold watch and chain at two o'clockhe then said, he had come out in the morning with only 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him, and he had no more money left in his who had borrowed this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him, and he had no more money left in his pocket—that his young friend had promised to let him have it again in half an hour, but he had spent it at a gambling house, and h had no time to go into the City to get any more money from the bank that day—he asked me for pen, ink, and paper, which I gave him, and then he asked me if I would allow my servant to go into the neighbourhood to get a cheque cashed for him for £2 allowed her to go—he drew the cheque for £2 (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) that is it—I known it because it is the same date—it appears to be the same that h drew—I left it with the Magistrate when I was examined my servant took out the cheque—I read it before she took it—he handed it tome, and I gave it to my servant—she took it to Mr. Blockey, a wine merchant—She returned in about five minutes, and brought two sovereigns, which I gave to the prisoner—he then wrote another cheque for £20, (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) this is it—he gave it to me, and begged me to pay it away for the gold watch and chain, when the person brought them from Ludgate-hill, as he had not time to stay, and he would call the following morning for it, and I was to take a receipt—he then gave me his address, "Fendall's Hotel, Palace-yard, Westminster"—that was in own writing—this is the paper (looking at one)—his name is Hawkes Nottidge Calvert on this paper—he wrote that—the man did not call with the watch, and the cheque was never paid away—I went to Fendall's Hotel in the evening, having suspicion, and made inquiries—they did not know any such person as the prisoner there, but they knew the name—they had letters which they had taken in for him—I went to the bankers next morning.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I had no wish to proceed against him—I did not say, I was convinced he did not mean to defraud me, nor any thing of the sort—I did not know whether it was a forgery, or anything of the sort—I thought it would be a great trou<lb></lb>ble to prosecute him—he said his father would pay me the two sovereigns—I went there because I wished to get the money—I never said I did not belive he intended to defraud me—it must have been his intent to defraud, or he would not have drawn the cheque—I swear, to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge, that I did not say so—I never told him any thing of the sort—I did not say I was sure he did not intend to wrong me, or any thing of that sort—it is clear he did it to get the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked me to sent the cheque into the neighbourhood to get change—he told me his father would pay, and I went to his father to get the two sovereigns—I did not see him—I saw his wife—it was at No. 225, I think, Blackfriars-road—I saw a person named Harding there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell Harding you were sure the prisoner did not mean to defraud you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not, or any thing to that effect—I am quite sure of that I said if the father paid the money, I did not wish to pro<lb></lb>ceed against him—I had no wish to appear against him—that was after what I had read in the paper—I did not see the father, and did not get the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not call again—I said, if the two sovereigns were sent to me, I should not appear on the Tuesday following—I said that at the father's—it was on Saturday—I do not know the day of the month—I had not lodged any complaint against the prisoner then—I left my address with Mr. Harding and the mother, and not hearing, I went before the Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you have gone before the Magistrate on Tuesday if you had got your 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was forced upon me the last time that he was brought before the Magistrate at Bow-street, which was last Tues<lb></lb>day week, I think—it was Saturday week that the father came to my house do offer the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I appeared twice before the Magistrate before the father came—I did not sent any intimation to the father that I desired to have the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between the first and second times that I went before the Magis<lb></lb>trate—he came to my house on the Saturday week, offering it to me if I would give a note, addressing the Magistrate, and requesting to have the cheque back again, that I might give them to Mr. Nottidge as a receipt for the two sovereigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, when the father called on the Saturday week, ask him for part of the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I asked nobody for part of the money—I told Mr. Nottidge I could not think of giving him any writing to the Magis<lb></lb>trate, but I had no objection to go to my solicitor to ask whether I should do wrong in receiving the two sovereigns—I promised to meet him outside the solicitor's door—I told him, my solicitor said he thought I should not do wrong in talking the two sovereigns—the solicitor was not present—Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183606130164"></xptr>
               <p>Nottidge then wished me to go to his solicitor—in consequence of what my solicitor told me I received that two sovereigns for half an hour, I think—I received them into my hand—he forced them into my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you call forcing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After consulting my solicitor, I said I had no wish to take the two sovereigns, as I was fearful of doing wrong—my solicitor said I might receive it, but he said I should go to the Magistrate, and tell him what I had done—he forced it—I after<lb></lb>wards considered of it, and thought I had better not take it—I received it into my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is what you called being forced on you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said I was obliged to proceed, and the two sovereigns were to be taken back again—we separated very shorty after, and I went home—this happened in the street—I went to call on Mr. Blockey, and he went to the Magistrate's office with me—I had got the money with me in my glove—I put it there—it was not forced into my glove—Mr. Nottidge pressed me to take it, and put it into my hand—I do not think I put my hand out to take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As far as you were concerned, did you not intend to abandon all prosecution against the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if I could do so without any injury—it was partly out of felling for the father, and partly because I wished my money back—I did not ask the prisoner for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Tothill-fields. nor for any part—I said, if he paid me the whole I would not appear against him—I was not to part with the £20 cheque unless the man brought the watch and chain—nobody came, and I did not part with it—before I saw the Magistrate I went in pursuit of the father, to give the money back again, as I thought I had better not take it—the father refused it and I gave it to his clerk—I then went and told the Magistrate what I had done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the prisoner apprehended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know the day of the month—he did not mention what shop the watch was to come from—he said from Ludgate-hill—I was at home all day, until eight o'clock in the evening, when I went I went to Fendall's Hotel—he gave me the cheque about three o'clock—before that time I can undertake to say no<lb></lb>body called—there is no watchmaker from Ludgate-hill here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head waiter at Fendall's hotel, Palace-yard, Westminster. I know the prisoner by sight—I saw him first about five or six weeks from the time of my examination—he made several calls at our hotel—he inquired if a note or letter was left there for a gentleman of the name of Nottidge—I introduced him to the bar, and he received a letter so addressed—I never knew him by any name except Nottidge—he asked for the letters of that name and said they were for himself—he never lodged at the hotel or took any refreshment there, but one glass of wine, to my knowledge.</p>

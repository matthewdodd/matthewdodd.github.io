            . I am watchman of Shire-lane. I saw two men run from the prosecutor. He said he had been robbed of his watch - I pursued, and took the prisoner - the other man got away. As we were taking the prisoner to the watch-house, he whispered to the prosecutor. I said, "Speak out". Morris then said, that the prisoner said, if he would give him 5s. to drink, he would get his watch-the prisoner did not deny it. He afterwards said if he was let out he would find the watch.</p>

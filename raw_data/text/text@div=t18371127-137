                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Mansfield, and live is Rochester-row, in the parish of St. John, Westminster. I have been there about three months—I knew the prisoner before that—he came occasionally to our house to see my daughter, whom he courted—he slept there some<lb></lb>times, as my husband works out at night—on the 21st of August he asked me if I was' not going to Camberwell fair—I said I did not know whether I was going or not—he was out with me—he said there was plenty of time if we did go, but we came home—I had been to the Bazaar with him—I at last said I would not go to the fair—about tea time I asked for him, and he was not in the house—I had given him a sovereign that day to take care of in the Bazaar—my daughter went up stairs after tea and found him there—I went up between seven and eight o'clock and. found he was gone—I missed two towels, and on looking further I missed a watch off the mantel-piece—I could not find my keys, and got Mr. Smith to break open my box, and missed from it a silk shawl, and a silk handkerchief, and another box containing many articles, a £10 note, and about ten sovereigns and a half—I had seen the things safe that day, before I went out—the little box was gone with its contents—I gave information directly—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner again till he was at Queen-square, the day before yesterday—the small box and my pocket-book the officer has got—the note had been in the pocket-book—my silver watch is also here—I have looked at them, and know them to be what I lost at that time—the value of the goods is about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a superintendent of the police at Bath. Last Monday I received information, and went to Bristol—I met the prisoner in the street there, and took him—I told him he was charged with a robbery at No. 2, Rochester-row, Westminster—he made no answer—I asked if he knew Mrs. Mansfield—he said, "Yes"—I searched him, and found this pocket-book in his pocket and a duplicate of a silver watch, pawned for 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Skinner-street, and some keys—there was a young man with me—I asked him if he lodged at the same house as he did—he said, "Yes"—I and the young man went to that house and there found a box which the young man pointed out—one of the keys found on the prisoner unlocked that box—in it I found this rosewood box and a towel, which Mrs. Mansfield has examined.</p>

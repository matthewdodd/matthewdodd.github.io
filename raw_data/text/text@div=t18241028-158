            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday morning, the 25th of October, in Brown's-lane, Spitalfields, about a mile and a half from the prosecutrix's shop; he had the desk on his shoulder - another boy was with him who made his escape; seeing the desk about an inch open, I asked where he brought it from - he said from his father, who was a little broker at Bethnal-green, and the desk had been left with him to sell it. I enquired, but could not find his father; he said it was to be taken into the City, and he was to wait in Spitalfields-market for his father, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280062"></xptr>steps of a door. I took him into a house, examined the desk, and found some papers which led to the discovery; when I read the papers he began to cry, and said he was to have two-pence for carrying it for the other boy, and what he had said about his father was false; there were four shillings in it.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young chap in Brick-lane, and he said if I would carry this box, he would give me a few halfpence; while we were going along the officer stopped us, and he ran away; and said if any body said anything, I was to tell them I carried it for my father.</p>

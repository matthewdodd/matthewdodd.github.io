I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my pocket-book in his hand. I charged him with taking it, which he denied. I took him into a shop, and sent for a constable. I am certain he is the man. When I was in the shop I said I saw it in his hand - He then took another pocket-book out of his pocket, quite different from mine, and said that was the one I had seen, but it was not. While we were in the shop a footman brought my pocket-book in, and said he picked it up. There was a 1l. note in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was at the close of the poll. There was not half a dozen persons at the window. I am certain it was my book that I saw in the prisoner's hand. Mine was red morocco-the one he produced was brown russia.</p>

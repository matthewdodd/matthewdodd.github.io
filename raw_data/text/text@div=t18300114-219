               <p>JOSEPH GARDINER. I am now out of a situation. On the 20th of December I was dining in the servant's hall, at the Reverend Sir John Robinson's, <placeName id="t18300114-219-crimeloc1170">Albemarle-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18300114-219-crimeloc1170" type="placeName" value="Albemarle-street"></interp>

               <p>JOHN POULTON. I am servant to Sir John Robinson, and was dining in the servant's hall. I heard a noise in the area steps, and saw the prisoner going up; I ran out and saw her crossing the road, with this desk under her arm - I followed and took her with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give it to you and tell you I had seen a person drop it? No; I saw her going up the steps with it - she said it was a box of linen; I said No, it was a desk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor; I saw a person drop the desk down the area - I ran down and slipped; I took it up, and directly the man came up I gave it to him.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of this month, I was in my office and desired my clerk to carry a book up stairs, the door was open and there were several people on business there, and in carrying up the book he says, Lord, Sir, here is a man going up stairs without his shoes; I went immediately out on hearing that; I jumped up and caught the prisoner by the collar, at the bottom of the stairs; he had by this time slipped into his shoes; this was between twelve and one o'clock, I meant to have kicked him out of my house; I asked him what he was going up stairs for; he said, for his prize money; I said, you rascal, I will give you that in a minute; just as I had got him to the door a person said you had better examine him; he kept himself leaning against the wainscot: I thrust in my hand in his bosom, and pulled out a shirt wet, he was then examined, and between us we pulled out from him two shirts, and five neckcloths, they were wet; the girl came in and ran up stairs, and she came down again and said she had lost her buttons; we examined him, and out of his breeches we pulled out three handkerchiefs, and he put his hand into one pocket and pulled out one button, and we found the other; the things were put up together by themselves; I could not get any constable; I sent for a coach and I put them into the coach, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100154"></xptr> other witness and myself went away over to Guildhall, and then we gave the things to the clerk, and a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

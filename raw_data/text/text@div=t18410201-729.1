                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of Edwin Leaf, who has partners—they are wholesale haberdashers and warehousemen, The prisoner is a draper, living at Halifax, and has dealings with our house—he was indebted to us in September last—I produce a bill of exchange which I got from him on the 7th of September—ho owed the firm between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time—one of our own bills on him had been due on the 4th, and was dishonoured, and returned on the 5th, and on the 7th he came and said he could not pay any money on account of that draft—he produced this bill, and said he could pay us that bill on ac<lb></lb>count of the dishonoured draft—I took it up in my hand, looked at it, and said, "Mr. Latham, this is rather a large bill for a retail draper; who is Mr. Pearson who it was drawn on?"—he said, "Mr. Pearson is a regular cus<lb></lb>tomer of mine"—I said, "Does he owe you any thing besides this?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How much?"—he said, "Between 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. be<lb></lb>sides"—I said, "Why, Mr. Latham, this is a very large amount for you to trust a small tradesman in Sutton," as I supposed it to be—he said he bad traded with the man a long time, he had been regular in all his transactions with him, and it would be paid, he was certain, be bad no doubt about the account himself—I then took the bill, relying on it being duly paid when it became due—it was not paid—to the best of my belief, the handwriting on the bill is the prisoner's—I am well acquainted with his handwriting—I have seen it repeatedly—I do not know that I have seen him write—I have repeatedly received letters from him, and acted on them—I have not the slightest doubt of its being his, all but the acceptance, "Thomas Pearson"—that is quite a different character to the rest—I think the acceptance is his, with the exception of the signature—the bill was brought to me ready indorsed.</p>

               <p>C - Dawson. I live in Monmouth-street, the prisoner at the bar brought this coat to me with an intention to sell it. I had a suspicion he had stole it; he told me he had it made for him, and he gave 3 l. 12 s. 4 d. for it; he agreed to sell it me for 18 s. I told him if he'd fetch the taylor that made it, I'd buy it; he said he would not, but I might go with him. I stop'd the coat and advertis'd it, and Mr. Webb came and own'd it; after that the last witness came and said he made it.</p>

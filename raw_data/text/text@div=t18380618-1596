                  </hi>. I live within four doors of Mr. Goodman, the prosecutor. I attended the police-office on behalf of the prosecutor—I was at home on Sunday the 10th of June, with my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I keep three <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I saw some nun at Mr. Goodman's gate—he looked at me for about five or ten mi—nutes, and I at him—I turned and was doing my cab, and he went in, and was in there for about a quarter of an hour or more, and then came out—I took no more notice till the afternoon, when I went by Mrs. Farrow's door, and spoke to her—she told me about the robbery—the person who went into the premises is not the prisoner—I should know him from a hundred—he was dressed very genteelly—I think he had a brown coat and light trowsers—I attended the police-office after the com<lb></lb>munication with Mrs. Farrow—Mr. Goodman sent me a summoni, I think they call it, it was on paper—I attended, and the Magistrate exa<lb></lb>mined me—I was sworn, and my depositions were written down—I never saw the prisoner till I was at the office.</p>

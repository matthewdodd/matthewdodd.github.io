               <p>Had you missed that linen handkerchief, before you got into the coach? - I missed every thing that was in that pocket; for it was turned inside out; there was this linen handkerchief, a silk handkerchief, and a purse containing five shillings and sixpence, all in that pocket; this handkerchief is the only thing that was found; there is no mark, but it is torn at the corner, which I very well recollect was done some time before by playing with a dog.</p>

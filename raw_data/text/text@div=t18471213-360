                  </hi> I am the wife of Richard Young, of Clapham. On Thurs<lb></lb>day, 25th Nov., about a quarter to one o'clock in the day, I was in a street near Brick-lane—I had a bag in my hand—the string was twisted three times very tightly round my wrist, and the bag was tight in my hand—there were two purses in it—one was empty, and the other had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, four sovereigns, and between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in it—the prisoner came up to me, and wrenched the bag out of my hand—I am sure he is the man—I held it very tight—he tore it from me and hurt my hand—I ran after him, and called "stop thief!"—he ran down a street—I got very near him—he turned round twice and looked at me, and then went up some steps into a house—I saw no more of him—the reticule was mine, and the money my husband's—I did not follow him into the house, because such a mob came round me—I was very much frightened and alarmed.</p>

                  </hi> I am a bell-hanger. At this time I lived in Redman-row, Stepney—on 25th Nov., about one o'clock, I was standing in Thrall-street, about one door out of Brick-lane—it runs into Brick-lane—there were two girls of the town standing so as to eclipse Mrs. Young, but I saw her hands and arms and her bag—the prisoner came across the road—I saw him stoop, snatch the bag, run down Thrall-street, and put it into his hat—Mrs. Young ran so fast that I thought it was one of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>, one of the girls, till I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—when I got half-way down, the same two girls began to knock me about the face and head, and some men too, and I did not pursue him—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man—I picked him out of the cell from twelve or fourteen others—he was in a different dress.</p>

Q.</hi> You had never seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—I was not on the same side of the street as Mrs. Young—I was as far as the remote corner of this Court from her—he passed me about a couple of yards off—I saw the lady running before I heard the cry—I only saw what was snatched from her hand, and her hands and arms—I should have held the prisoner if I had not thought she was one of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>—I saw him next on the Monday about the middle of the day—a notice was left at my house that the person I saw was taken—two policemen and the gaoler took me into the yard—I saw a policeman before I went—I never said the prisoner had a blue cap on—I did not hear the lady say he had a hat, at the police-office—I saw him take a hat from his head—he wore cord trowsers and a sort of frock-coat, brown—I will not swear it was a frock-coat—at the station he had on cord trowsers, a brown cap, and a blouse.</p>

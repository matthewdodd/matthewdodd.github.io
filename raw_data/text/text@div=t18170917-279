On the 6th of September, I had some hay for sale in the Old Bailey (the fair being held in Smithfield), I sold the prisoner two loads, he agreed to give me 8l. 15s., for them - I did not know him before; he ordered it to be sent to Old Cock-lane, Shoreditch; I asked him for the money, he said he had not got it about him, but would give it to the man directly he got there with it; I sent Chilman and Crick with the hay about half-past two or three o'clock, I told them to take it to Old Cock-lane, and not to leave it without the money; he gave me the name of Gray, and said he was a gardener - They went off, I did not see them until nine o'clock, they brought the prisoner back with them-the carts were empty-Chilman said he had detained him about at several places, but he could not get the money from him, and he told him he would call on the Monday, this was on Saturday - I brought him into the counting-house, he said he had not got the money, and did not know when he could get it, he would pay me as soon as he could get it; I sent for an officer - He was searched, and 2l. found on him, and a paper was found in his hat which purported to be a promissory note drawn at five weeks after date, payable to Brown, (not signed). I gave him no credit.</p>

            . I am a carman to Mr. Brown. On the 6th of September, I set off with Crick, with two loads of hay, in two carts, to Mr. Gray, Old Cock-lane, Shoreditch, I was not to leave them without the money; the prisoner came up to me in Newgate-street and asked me where I was going, I told him to Old Cock-lane, Shoreditch; he told me to go on and he would overtake us in five minutes - He overtook us in Bishopsgate-street, and said my load was to go just by, and the other load was to go just by, I understood they were to go to different places; he directed me to take mine to Phoenix-street, Brick-lane, which I did, he went with me - He employed a boy to go with Crick to Hare-marsh; we first saw the boy in Bishopsgate-street - the prisoner told me to stop, I began to unload in Phoenix-street, and gave it off the cart to the prisoner, who took it into a house there, the name of"Fassey" was over the door; before I had unloaded all, Crick came back with his load, saying, the boy could not find the place; I unloaded-the prisoner went to a public-house opposite, a person who I had seen at Fassey's, followed him in-the man appeared to have some 1l. notes in his hand - We were following them in, but the prisoner brought us out a pot of beer to the door, we drank it - He brought us out another, he gave us three pots - We staid about a quarter of an hour there; from thence he took us to No. 31, Hare-marsh, Bethnall-green, he said he had not got the key, but would fetch it and return in about five minutes; the house was shut up; he returned in half an hour; before he returned, a stranger came and opened the door; Crick unloaded his cart and gave the hay to the prisoner, who put it in the house; we heard a man say to the prisoner, go to the White Hart, and I will come to you. The prisoner took us to the Ship, at the top of St. John-street, Brick-lane, and gave us a pot of beer; he then asked me for the bill of the hay, which I gave him, he said it was all correct, but he must go for his friend and would return in five minutes; I followed him to Haremarsh - I lost him there - I do not know whether he went to the same house or not; as I returned back I found Crick had stopped the prisoner in a street by St. John-street, in a different direction from where I saw him going, and in a different direction from the house he was to go to - He said he must go to the White Hart for his friend - I went with him, he asked if a man had been there enquiring for him, they said "yes, but he did not stop;" he pulled out a pocket-book containing bills - I saw no money. I told him I saw there was no money for us, and we wanted the money, that our master would be angry with us for waiting so long; it was then half-past six o'clock; we asked him to go with us to our master if he would not pay us, he seemed willing to go, but wanted to go to the Blue Ball in Old Cock-lane, to see if he could find his friend - We went there and had a pint of beer; we had left the carts at the Ship - He wanted us to go to the next house to see if his friend was there; we went, and was told he was gone to Hampstead, and they did not know when he would return; he then said if we would take a draft he would get us one - We told him no, for if he had a draft he could get cash, he said it was too late-it was then eight o'clock. We went back to our carts and took him with us - He went quietly.</p>

The prisoner was in my service for about a week; I missed a watch the latter end of July; and on Monday, the 1st of August, I had occasion to look over a looking-glass drawer in my bed-room, I took out two sovereigns, and left three there - the prisoner went out that day with my daughter, who gave me information; I went to the drawer that evening, and two out of the three sovereigns were gone; the drawer had been opened by a key - next morning, when the Policeman came by, I called him in; I then called the prisoner, and said, "How came you to open my drawer, and take two sovereigns?" she said,"How could I do so when mistress had the key?" I said,"How came you by the two sovereigns you spent yesterday?" she said she was married to a man who gave her one, and that her former master gave her another - she said,"You may search me, I have not a single shilling;" I took her to the station-house - a sovereign, 4s. 6d., and the duplicate of a watch were found on her - we asked where the young man she was married to lived; she never told us - we found in her box a gold seal, which I had missed, and a key which opened my drawer, also a pair of shoes of her mistress, and a street-door key - we found out the young man; I asked him for the watch Jane had given him; he gave me a watch; I had lost two watches, and about six sovereigns had been stolen.</p>

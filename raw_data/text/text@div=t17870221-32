               <p>Twydale. I went up to the gallery with them, and when I came out again, I gave them to the woman at the door to take care of till I came back; and this morning I asked her for them, and she said that two men last night about ten, came and asked for them in my name, and she gave them to them; I think her name is Mrs. Storey, the door-keeper.</p>

While I was in a crowd looking at a show, I felt the handker<lb></lb>chief at my feet—I took it up, looked at it, and put it into my pocket—the officer then came up in plain clothes, and I thought it was his—he took me to the gentleman, who was ten or twelve yards off—he said it was his—but he would not prosecute as I had not done him any injury.</p>

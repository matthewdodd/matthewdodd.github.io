               <p>How was it that a man who had made one confession should make another? - From the time he had made the first confession; I was always in company with three or four people.</p>

               <p>Do you say, what he afterwards said, was without any inducement, and that without any persuasion he made another confession? - To the best of my knowledge he did.</p>
               <p>Did he say, now, Mr. Justice, you are but a fool of a Justice, for I have been making one confession, and I have not told you all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the Justice say to him, now, Mr. Sumner, there is a great deal behind, and you had better tell the whole truth, was that the way? - Why Sir, as to that particular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130120"></xptr> way I know nothing about; it was nothing like that.</p>
               <p>What induced him to make a second confession? - I tell you once for all, I do not know; I did not hear any thing; but he said, he did it voluntarily; I did not see the second confession signed; I believe my name was to the first.</p>
               <p>What was the result of all this? - I know nothing at all about it.</p>

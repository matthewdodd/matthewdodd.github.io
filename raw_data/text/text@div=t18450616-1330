                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On Tuesday, the 10th of June, I arrived in London from Hull—I had left Hull on Monday, the 9th, at three o'clock—I brought with me a chest and a bag containing my hammock and bedding—I put the chest on board myself—I had lashed it up myself, but before that I had put two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes into a small box, and put that box into the chest—the chest was locked, and had a very good lock too—I saw the chest stowed away in the hold, and I saw a great quantity</p>

               <p>of luggage put above it—when I arrived in London I found my chest in the same state as when I put it into the hold, and quite secure—I do not think it could have been opened on the voyage—when I landed I saw the prisoner—he offered his services to me as a porter—I made some inquiries in his presence, of the City police-constable, No. 533—I hired the prisoner to take my chest and hammock to the Dundee Arms, which is a very well-known house—I have used it these ten years—it is about a mile from the wharf—I did not accompany him—I went to an eating-house—I after<lb></lb>wards went to the Dundee Arms, but did not find my property—I was looking for the prisoner all Tuesday evening, but I could not find him—I saw him the next day in Thames-street—I said, "Halloo, my hearty, you are the man I am looking for"—he said my things were at the station—I took him with me to the station—I there found my chest and hammock-my chest was not in the same state as it was when I gave it him—the lashing had been disturbed, and the lock had been forced—I opened the chest, and the small box and money were gone—I then examined the ham<lb></lb>mock, and missed an oil jacket and three flannel shirts—I told the pri<lb></lb>soner about the loss—he said he knew nothing about it—I went with the constable and a female to the prisoner's lodging, at No. 8, Norfolk-street, Southwark—I searched, and found my small box in a cupboard—when I opened it the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 569.) I was at Tower-street station on Wednesday, the 11th of June—the prosecutor and the pri<lb></lb>soner came there—there was a policeman some little distance behind—the chest had been brought there before, and was kept locked up in a cell—it was produced to the prosecutor, and he examined it in the prisoner's presence—he said the lashing had been disturbed—we asked him to look further—he undid the lashing, and found the lock had been forced—he examined it, and said he had lost a little dressing-case, and in it were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—he then examined his hammock, and said he had lost a jacket and three flannel shirts—he charged the prisoner, who said he knew nothing about it it might have been done on board the ship for what he knew—we asked the prisoner his name and address—he said, "No. 8, Norfolk-street, South-wark"—that is in the Southwark-bridge-road—we went in search of his wife, and found her—I did not know her before, bat have ascertained since that she is his wife—I went with her and the prosecutor to No. 8, Norfolk street—the prisoner's wife took me to the room—I searched it—the cup-board door was open, and this box was in the left-band corner of the cup-board—this jacket was concealed behind two boxes in the corner of the room—this spike-nail and a hammer were lying on the ashes in the fire-place—I took the hammer and nail and other things to the station-house—I compared the spike-nail with the marks on the chest—the black of the nail which was used as a poker is now on the chest—there are pretty dear marks that the chest must have been broken open by this and the ham<lb></lb>mer—there are plenty of marks on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

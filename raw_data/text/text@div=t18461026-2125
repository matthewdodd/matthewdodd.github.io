                  </hi>. I have not been in the gallery of the court during this trial—I have been outside, and heard nothing that transpired—I know Mr. Morgan's shop in Middle-row, Holborn—I recollect going there with the prisoner and another person who I have seen here—we went to the shop—the prisoner purchased half-a-dozen shirts, half-a-dozen pair of stockings, a silk handkerchief, a scarf, three pocket handkerchiefs, and a green coarse silk purse with two white rings to it—I believe the young man calls them composition—he called them so at the time he sold them—it was the last he had, I think, of the whole set—I had the purse in my hand, and think I should know it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Leadenhall-street. On the evening of the 11th of December, I was in Gracechurch-street—a gentle-man tapped me on the shoulder, and gave me information—I examined my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I had felt it safe a minute before—I followed the gentleman, who pursued and took the prisoner—my handkerchief has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Gracechurch-street about seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prosecutor walking about two yards before me—I saw the quick motion of hands which attracted my attention, and saw the prisoner and another, his companion—the prisoner, with his right-hand, took hold of the prosecutor's pocket and with his left drew the handkerchief—at the same moment I saw it pass to the hands of his companion—I tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and told him of his loss, and without waiting, I followed the prisoner, who had run off—when we got to the end of Finch-lane he was between me and the policeman—I intended to give him in charge, but he made back into Cornhill—I called the policeman, and ran after him myself—I overtook him at the bottom of Birchin-lane—I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

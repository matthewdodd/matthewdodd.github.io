On the 4th of November, three young men came into the shop one after the other - the prisoner was the last of them; they took no notice of each other - the first one wanted to look at some shoe-ribbon, the second at some silk handkerchiefs, and the prisoner asked to look at some riding-belts - while I was serving the second person, I saw the prisoner take some handkerchiefs, and put them into his hat; I kept him while I served the second, and then shewed him the belts; he selected one, left 1s. on it, and said he lived in Sydney's-alley; I let him go out, then pursued, and brought him back - I found fifteen handkerchiefs in his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did not you seize him directly you saw him take them? A. Because I had no one in the shop; there was a lad in the parlour who had served the shoe-ribbon, but he was in the parlour while the prisoner was being served - my master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040044"></xptr>is not here; I cannot tell whether it was one of the other men's hats the prisoner took, but he was the only one who pulled his hat off.</p>

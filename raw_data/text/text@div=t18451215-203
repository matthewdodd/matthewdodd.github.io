                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Matthew-street, Bloomsbury. On the morning of the 14th of Dec, I went into the Acorn public-house, at the corner of Acorn-street and Bishopsgate-street, about three o'clock in the morning—I am a vender of ham sandwiches—I went in there to sell my goods—Sweet and a few others were there—the prisoner was there—I sold all my sandwiches but four—I had a soot-bag <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> in my face, and felt a man's hand in my pocket—I caught the hand as it came out of my pocket—it was the prisoner's hand—I had in that pocket, as near as I can tell, three shillings, two sixpences, and two fourpenny pieces—I held his hand for a minute or two, but he got it away, and I saw him give my money to another.</p>

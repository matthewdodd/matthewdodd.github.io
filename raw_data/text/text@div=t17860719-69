               <p>Upon the oath that you have taken had you been sitting down in the park at all that night? - No, Sir; I had never opened my lips to any body breathing.</p>
               <p>I understand you have since found the centinel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You was along with a man, I was passing with a girl, ask him one question, whether I did not tell the men that are over him at St. James's the next day, that I saw him on duty, I accused him of it before my serjeant in the street, and told him every thing of it, and he denied he was there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not see him till a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Did he accuse you before the serjeant? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The next day that I saw him, on the 25th of June.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Did you charge him before the serjeant? - I said to my serjeant there is the man that I saw last night.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you see that man the next day? - I never saw him for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did he accuse you the next day?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I say the next time that I saw him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, my Lord, he said he saw no harm of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether when Lord Harrington's servants were walking with him, I told him of the things that he had done, and if he would come the next morning, there were three men that did accuse him of these things, that he had connections with him in the park, and when Lord Harrington's black servant heard it, he left him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did he charge you with indecency before Lord Harrington's servants? - He said he saw me with a man in the manner that he has now been saying, and before Lord Harrington's servants, when the other two ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not he take me up before that time? - I did not know him, I could not have known him if he had not attacked me the second time, nor I should not have known the other two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether that man that stands along with him at the front gate of the park did not say he would not stand with such a man unless he cleared himself up, for he was a man that was not sit to talk to a man? he only took me up for defence of his own character, he would not have taken me up, and said nothing at all to me if I had held my tongue.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Would you have me ask him that question.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to let me consider of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190109"></xptr> if you please to ask whether he was not sat down on one of the benches with a soldier, and whether I did not pass by with a girl? - I never was off my legs, nor saw any woman in company with any soldier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I dossed my shoes off my feet, and went and run up to the place to hear, I could not hear what passed, but as soon as they got off their seat, says the soldier, I will have something more to drink.</p>

               <p>I was sentry that night, on the 15th of June, from ten to twelve; about half after ten some soldiers and the prosecutor came up wrangling and jawing one another, and they began to use the gentleman very ill; the prisoner was not with them three soldiers; I took the gentleman from the soldiers and parted them; I said what have you been doing of? says one of the soldiers, I was making water up against a tree, just by Carleton-house, and this gentleman came and took hold of my private parts, and he desired me to keep the gentleman prisoner till I left the sentry, and then to take him to the guard-house; I told them I did not choose to do it, you are three of you, take the gentleman to the guardroom; says the gentleman, I am willing to go to the guard-room; then the prisoner came up to me, and said, I would take them all up if I was you, and that was all he spoke.</p>
               <p>He is in the same regiment with you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you know the other two men? - I did not, they were strangers to me; I think two of them belonged to the Cold-stream, and the other to the third regiment, I do not know that I ever saw them before in my life.</p>
               <p>What regimentals had they on? - Two of them had two Coldstream coats on, that is the second regiment, and one of them had the third regiment; two of them were grenadiers, and one was a hatman.</p>
               <p>Of what regiment is the prisoner? - The first, he was on duty at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was on duty there.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner on duty? - Not in the park, he belonged to the king's guard that night, he went off to his guard that night; the prisoner belonged to that guard that marched off the parade that morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What business had he in the park at that time of night? - He might be walking through to see his wife safe home.</p>
               <p>But his business did not require him to be in the park? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. He was obliged to be near? - Yes; but he had liberty to go any where in the park, or assist any sentry.</p>
               <p>Where is the guard room? - Just by the park.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I did not ask him if I was the man, before Lord Harrington's servants, and he said no?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said he was the man that first demanded the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor then said to Lord Harrington's servants that I was not one of them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was only three soldiers in all, and the prisoner was the first man that made the expression of money; this was the man that said damn my eyes he must give us some money.</p>

King said he did; says the prisoner, I understand you give it out that we wanted to rob you, I was one that had hold of your collar, and we had a strong tussle together, but you was too strong for me and got away; we did not want to rob you, what we wanted was some money to drink; we asked him what his name was, and his other two confederates; he immediately replied, and said he did not know the men, and did not know their names; but they belonged to the first regiment, only they had the second regiment's clothes on that night; he said he must confess he saw no harm between them; with that Mr. King swore, and asked him what he wanted, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190110"></xptr> what he meant; the prisoner said he did not want to expose him in the street; that was all that passed while I was present.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him whether the marshal man at the gate did not accuse the prosecutor, and say he was such and such a man, and that they would not stand with him unless he cleared himself? - I do not know a syllable of that; here is one of the marshalmen here in court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to examine that marshalman, but that is not the marshalman.</p>
               <p>Court. How many marshalman are there? - Six, and here are three.</p>

             called in again.</p>
               <p>Court. How many soldiers were there besides the prisoner? - The prisoner was not there; there were three soldiers; the prisoner was not there when the other three soldiers were there; the prisoner came on my post just as the other three walked off; the three soldiers and the prosecutor came from Carleton house to my post; the prisoner did not come up till after they were walking off to the guard-house, then the prisoner came to me and said, if I was you, I would take them all prisoners, then he walked off to his guard; he was not interfering with them any more than I was; he was not nigh them; the prisoner at the bar never spoke to the gentleman, only said to me, if I was you I would take them all prisoners; he walked off to his guard directly, and they went off my post, I had nothing more to do with them then.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How many soldiers were there? - Three, the prisoner and two more; there were only three in all, and the prisoner was the first that collared me opposite Marlborough-wall, and the first man that demanded my money; I am sure that it was the prisoner; I was worse used by the prisoner than by any of the others; he swore he would have money; I swear to him from the recollection of his voice when he spoke to me the second time, and from the threatening expressions he made use of.</p>
               <p>Jury. I understand that Mr. King said that the reason that he did not take him up before was that he did not know him? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any other witnesses to examine? - I came and told the serjeant in the guard-room that night; I told it the next day to the Marshalman, and the prosecutor might have come down to St. James's, and have taken me up any day; he knew I was on guard every fifth day; and if he could have sworn to my voice, why did not he come the next day, or the day after? it was three weeks before he took me up.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a serjeant; on the 15th of June, about eleven at night, the prisoner came to the guard-room, and accused a gentleman, one of the marshalmen (he did not mention his name) with sitting with a soldier in the park, upon one of the benches, with one arm round the soldier's neck, and the other hand in his breeches; I heard no more of it; on the 25th of June, that was ten days afterwards, I saw the prisoner speaking to the prosecutor in St. James's street, fronting St. James's coffee-house; I did not hear what passed; I was standing in front of St. James's gate; I saw them talking together in the middle of the street for about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was you before the magistrate when this man was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say this at that time? - I was only asked to the soldier's character, I did not mention this.</p>
               <p>How came you not? - I was not asked that question.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190112"></xptr>Court to Prisoner. Have you any witnesses to your character? - I have nobody in London that knows me; I came lately out of Derbyshire.</p>
               <p>Court to Serjeant. What has been his general character? - He never was taken up for any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>What has been his general character as a man? - I know no other of him than I know he lived with a woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Did he bear a good character as an honest man? - I never heard to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you was asked as to his character before the magistrate? - Yes, as a <rs id="t17860719-69-deflabel341" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>What character did you give him before the magistrate? - All that I said was, that he now and then neglected duty, and came dirty to duty at times; I was not asked whether he was an honest or dishonest man.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I ask you now what has been his general character? - I never knew him dishonest.</p>
               <p>What has been his general character, men have characters, I do not ask you to particular acts? in what reputation has he generally been for his honesty in the regiment? - He has never behaved amiss any farther than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>That is not an answer. - I never heard him accused of any dishonesty.</p>
               <p>Then he has had a general good character? - Yes, as an honest man, I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you of the same regiment with that man? - Yes, Sir, of the same company; I have been in the company seven years.</p>

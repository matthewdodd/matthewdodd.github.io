The prosecutrix is my sister; I keep Powis-wells, and heard my sister and Mrs. Arnold scream out; my sister came running, and said the man had a pistol in his hand; I followed him, and seeing some gentleman coming along, I cried out, Stop him. Then Mr. Story offered to make a blow at him; the prisoner fell down, and Mr. Story took hold of him. We searched him, and found in his right-side pocket, a pistol loaded and cock'd.</p>

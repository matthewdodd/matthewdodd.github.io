               <p>Q. How long had he liv'd with you?</p>
               <p>Young. He lived with me between three and four months; the silver watch was hanging in the kitchen, and it was missing when he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Young. I am a <rs id="t17590912-10-viclabel68" type="occupation">breeches-maker</rs>

               <p>Q. How old is he?</p>
               <p>Young. His father says he is sixteen years of age. (The movement and part of the dial-plate produced in court) This is all I have got of it; I had it from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

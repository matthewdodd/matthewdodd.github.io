I had left it there, and happened to be at about a hundred yards distance from the quay. A person came up to me, and asked me if there was any thing lying on the quay that I could lose; I said no, nothing but a cask of pewter; he said he saw a man come away with something in his apron. I then went to the quay with my servant, and I saw Burley. We followed him; and he threw some pewter out of his apron; my man pursued him; I picked it up, and carried it back to the quay; by the time I had picked it up, they took two more men. I picked up five dishes.</p>

               <p>I am a lighterman. On the 24th of December, I had loaded some butter at the alley near to Temple-stairs, which is near to Dice-quay. I was watching my butter, and I saw the three prisoners, and some others, lurking about. After my people had brought the butter to the top of the alley, I saw two of the prisoners, and another man, who is not with them, come up the alley with something in their aprons; when they saw me, they were shy, and turned back again, and came down the gateway of Dice-ally. I followed them, and I caught one of them by the skirt of his jacket; he dropped three dishes, and run away. The prisoner, Howard, crept under a cart-tail; and I began to hollow out, and he dropped three dishes. A man followed him, and took him; after that, Benson came with some in his apron, which he dropped, and he was taken.</p>

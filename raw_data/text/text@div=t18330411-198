On Thursday, the 14th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop; I did not know him before - he had my address in his hand, and asked if that was my name; I said Yes - I showed him some teas: he ordered 2lbs. of three different kinds, which came to 1l. 12s. 4d.; he gave me a 10l. note - I refused to give him change, and said I did not know a good note from a bad one; he said no one could refuse a Bank of England note, and told me to try to get it changed; I then took it to the public-house next door, and showed it to

               <p>Q. Did you not say when you met him, "You have given me a bad note," and want your money back? A. No, I did not - he proposed to pay me first; I said he had given me a bad 10l. note; he did not say he was sorry it was a bad one - he said so before the Lord Mayor; I had a load of 18lbs. of tea on my back - I lost sight of him after he ran away first, but not after I took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this man of having stolen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170075"></xptr>it. - A. He brought me a saw to sharpen, he left it, he came again for it, it was not done, he came again for it and it was done; he did not take it away. He came again one morning between eight and nine o'clock, and paid me for it. I was called down to breakfast, we went down together, the prisoner going first; there is a passage goes along to my door, he pretended going along that passage, he watched me going down another flight of stairs to breakfast, I went down them stairs, he returned back again in about three minutes after he came down. We did not see him go up, we heard him come down a few of the stairs; my wife says to me, there is a man going in our house. Then we saw him come from the steps by the kitchen window; I pursued after him, but having my slippers on, I could make no ground, I returned back again, went up stairs and missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it before you went down to breakfast. - A. Yes, it hung before me.</p>

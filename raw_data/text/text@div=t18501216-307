                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Joseph Christmas Folkard, a pawnbroker, New Bridge-street, Vauxhall. On 3rd Dec. I received information about half-past eleven in the morning, and went about seven doors down Harleyford-road, and came up with the prisoner Gardner—I said, "You will excuse me, Madam, but you have got something that does not belong to you"—she said she had not—I lifted her shawl on one side, and took from under her right arm this shawl: it is my master's; I know it by the pattern, and there is a private mark on it—I had told a person the price of it half an hour before—it was then hanging across a rail which goes along the door, inside the shop—I took her back to the shop—she begged I would not give her in charge, and cried a good deal—she said she did not take it, and begged I would forgive her—Rawson was brought back by one of our young men.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Vauxhall. I was outside Mr. Folkard's window—the prisoners were both there together, looking in at the window—I saw Rawson pull the shawl from the rail a little way, so that it touched the ground—he then left it, and went and spoke to Gardner—I went on to the next window, and saw Rawson pull the shawl down in the doorway, and throw it to Gardner, who put it under her arm and went down Harley-ford-road—Rawson went towards South Lambeth—I have no doubt he is the man and Gardner is the woman—I went into the shop directly, and gave information.</p>

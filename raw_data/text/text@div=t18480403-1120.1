                  </hi> I live at Farnham Royal, near Slough Bucks. I know the prisoner—I first employed him to negociate bills for me, I think, in 1843—after having employed him for some time my affairs were put in the bands of Messrs. Gray and Berry, my father's solicitors—that is rather better than two years ago—I have employed the prisoner on one occasion since that—I never gave him authority to sign my name to paper—(<hi rend="italic">three bills were here produced by Mr. Martin</hi>)—this 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, dated Oct.26, 1847, purports to be drawn by me—the signature is not mine—I was not employing the prisoner at that time—I did not give him any authority to sign my name to it—I have not derived any benefit whatever from it—I did not endorse this bill for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 1st Oct., 1847—I was not em<lb></lb>ploying the prisoner then—I did not authorise him or any one else to endorse it—I know nothing whatever about it—the acceptance to this bill for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated Oct. 13, is not mine—I gave the prisoner no authority to accept that bill—I believed I had not been in communication with him, on the subject of bills, about that time—from having been sued on one or more of these bills I obtained the means of examining them—On 16th Feb, last I was at the Rainbow tavern; that was on the day I inspected the bills, after consulting my solicitors on the subject—I think I examined the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on that day—I had seen it before—Mr. Butler, the holder, had come down to my house with them, and showed them to me, on 7th Jan., I think—that was first knowledge I had that these bills were out against me—the prisoner came into the Rainbow after I was there—I called him over, and said I had a very serious charge against him for forgery—Mr. Gray was with me—the prisoner said, "I confess to it all"—Mr. Gray said to him that he did not wish to take an undue advantage of him, as he had no professional adviser—the pri<lb></lb>soner knew Mr. Gray—he said he confessed to it all; that the two bills for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., were forgeries; that the bill for 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was my genuine acceptance, but he had altered the date of the year from 1845 to 1847—the 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was not produced at that time.</p>

Gray, who are also my father's solicitors—that settlement related to the bills that the prisoner had got discounted for me at various times—there are memorandums of the bills produced in Court—I did not keep what is termed a bill-book; I kept a memorandum book—I cannot tell how many bills the prisoner got discounted for me from 1843 to 1846—there were not as many as a thousand or fifteen hundred—I have no idea how many—sometimes I did not get a bill discounted once in a month—the amount my father paid for me in 1846 and 1847 was, I suppose between 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that does not include all the prisoner's transactions—there is only one of his unsettled now—there was an annuity paid off, which was included in that—I have not accepted as many as twenty bills at a time, and sent them up to the prisoner—there may have been as many as three or four, but I think not more—perhaps that has not happened once in a month, and it may have been once a week—I cannot tell whether the prisoner had means of his own for discounting bills—I know that he got the bills discounted elsewhere—I paid him for the discount whenever there was an account—he never kept a correct account, and I cannot say that I did, there was so much put down, perhaps 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I presume he used to have that for his trouble—I dare say you have an account—there were no stated payments to him—I did not order wine through him—I did on one occasion; it was an acceptance of a party who became bankrupt, and he agreed to pay half in wine and half on an acceptance—I never got the accept<lb></lb>ance, and the wine was very bad—I do not know that I employed the pri<lb></lb>soner to transact any other business for me in London—I never saw Mr. Carruthers—the wine came from him—I know Mr. Wells, a wine-merchant—I believe I had two dozen of wine from him, through the prisoner, not twelve dozen—I do not think the prisoner ever hired a servant for me—I am not fond of the sports of the field—the prisoner purchased a fowling-piece out of the monies he had in hand—I did not order him to buy it for me—I never had it—I was never in the habit of using a gun for sports—I have not frequently sent blank acceptances to the prisoner—the month and year were always included, and my signature and the amount—the actual day was not always put in—I was not generally in the habit of leaving it to the prisoner—there may have been one or two such instances, never five or six at one time—I was not in the habit of sending the prisoner post-dated checks to cash for me, that I am aware of—I do not think I ever did that—I will not aware it, but to the beat of my recollection I did not—the check-book will show, it is here—I do not know that the prisoner obtained money from Mr. Wells on my account on checks—I have paid the prisoner checks to take up bills—I believe those checks were not dated—I will not positively swear it—I think I have not frequently drawn checks on my bankers, and sent them up to the prisoner, when I was not in funds at the bankers, to meet them—my bankers' book is in Court—I do not remember without that—I do not know that I have done so—my father did not have the bills that were given up—they were given into the hands of Messrs.

By "a list for May," I meant a list of bills due in May—I do not know what has become of that 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—it may be in the prisoner's possession, for he did not return me the bills regularly, I have produced all his papers that I have—from 1843 to 1846, while these bill transactions were going on—I was very anxious to keep the matter from my father—he has expressed displea<lb></lb>sure at my conduct, and I was afraid of his anger—he now known that I have since been attempting to discount bills with the prisoner—I was once a candidate for the auditorship of a union—I was not successful—I had arranged with the prisoner, that if I succeeded, he was to transact all the accounts for me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a number of letters</hi>)—these are my writing, except one—I did not enclose that to the prisoner—I never saw it before—(<hi rend="italic">These letters, twenty-eight in number, at dates from Jan</hi>, 1844 <hi rend="italic">to March</hi> 1846, <hi rend="italic">were here read; they disclosed, on the part of Mr. Hall, a great variety of bill transac<lb></lb>tions with different parties, requesting the prisoner to transmit him bills for acceptance, pressing him to settle with the holders of some over due, and to remit him money, of the want of which he frequently complains.</hi>)—The pri<lb></lb>soner was to satisfy the demands made upon him, by getting the bills dis<lb></lb>counted—I used sometimes, perhaps, to send him a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had always a balance in hand—he has the accounts—I did not keep accounts in two or three instances—I sent them to him, and was to have had them back, but never could get them; and that threw me all behind—these letters are mine—(<hi rend="italic">These were dated</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st June</hi>, 1847; 20<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 3<hi rend="italic">rd and</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th Sept.</hi>, 16<hi rend="italic">th Nov., and</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th Oct.; in the first, the witness requests the prisoner to get money from their old friends the usurers, &amp;c.; and in the last, presses him to render the ac<lb></lb>count so long promised.</hi>)—This letter is my writing (<hi rend="italic">dated July</hi> 9, 1845, <hi rend="italic">return<lb></lb>ing three bills of</hi> 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 115<hi rend="italic">l. and</hi>, 120<hi rend="italic">l., accepted, and requesting an account of the same</hi>)—my father has expressed to me the strongest disapprobation of my again discounting bills after the settlement of 1846—I bank at the Union Bank—I do not know that it is their custom to balance their customers ac<lb></lb>counts daily—mine was balanced twice a year—the prisoner has mentioned to me that he obtained the use of other persons' names to my bills—I have seen those names on the bills when they have been returned—several of them were perfect strangers to me—I believe he told me that my bills were so <hi rend="italic">stale</hi> in the market, that it was necessary to freshen them up a bit with new names; and I believe that was the fact—I occasionally came to town to see the prisoner—I was not in the habit of meeting him in out-of-the-way places for fear of my creditors—I think only in one instance—I generally met him at Mr. Flint's, where he was employed—he left there somewhere about Aug., 1846.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not the prisoner frequently represented to you the pressure he was under to meet your bills; and have not you authorised him to use your name under circumstances of great pressure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not—that I swear—it was between three and four when I met him at the Rainbow—it was not then proposed that the he should go to my father's to explain what matters were still out—I swear that—Mr. Gray was present during the whole of the interview, until I had the prisoner removed into a private room out of the coffee-room—I was with him in that room about half an hour—I did not,</p>

                  </hi> I am a member of the firm of Gray and Berry, soli<lb></lb>citors. I was employed by Mr. Hall and his son to settle some bills due by the son—I paid several bills for him—a very few were paid personally by me, they were paid by our firm—on 16th Feb. I went to Mr. Abrahams' office to inspect the bills, and afterwards went to the Rainbow tavern to lunch—the prisoner came in, Mr. Hall beckoned him to come across to the box were we were, and said, "Mayhew, I have a serious charge against you"—Mayhew said he would confess all—Mr. Hall said, "Do you know I have had two actions brought against me," or "I have been sued in two actions, one by Fisher, and another by Smith"—the prisoner then said, "I confess your names were forges to Fisher's bills, but your signature to Mr. Smith's bill is a genuine signature, but I altered the date from 1845 to 1847"—Mr. Hall then produced a paper which I had given him, being an account extracted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184804030105"></xptr>
               <p>from the declarations in the action commenced against him by Miss Fisher, on two bills of exchange, and Mr. Hall said, "Tringham's and Lacom's accep<lb></lb>tances"—the prisoner said, "I forged them"—Mr. Hall asked if there were any other forgeries—Mayhew said there were not—Hall then said, "But Gingell holds some bills of mine which are forgeries"—he said he had seen Gingell, and Mr. Hall would not be troubled on bills that Gingell had—Mr. Hall asked if be would give an account in writing of the bills he had forged, and took out his pocket-book—the priosner seened disposed to give an ac<lb></lb>count, and I said, "Mr. Mayhew, you know I am Mr. Hall's solicitor, and I do not wish to take an undue advantage of anything you may do," that was as the pencil and paper were produced—Mayhew said he had done Mr. Hall a great injury, and he supposed a policeman would be sent for, or that he would be given in charge, and requested that his wife might be informed—they went into a private room, and I went to consult the Counsel for the prosecutor—on my return he was given into custody by Mr. Hall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go to old Mr. Hall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor did I propose to go, to the best of my recollection—I think I have a tolerably accurate recollection of what passed—I did not say, "You know Mr. Mayhew we would not hurt a hair of your head"—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I attended all four of the examinations—I dine at the Rainbow frequently, and have taken lunch there—Mr. Hall never furnished me with an account of the bills that were to be paid—he furnished some account, it was an imperfect statement—he said he did not know what his liabilities were—he gave me the names of parties who held bills of his—I paid all bills that were brought to me which I believed were his acceptance, or which had his name to them, except one or two, which are yet unpaid—I have not seen a bill for 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the hands of Mr. Keen which is yet unpaid—I know Mr. Hall stated to me that he had two acceptance coming due in this year—Mr. Hall is being sued on some of these bills now in question—we are his st<lb></lb>torneys—we are defending three actions for him, two of them on bills now in question, and one for rent under a lease of an estate; not of Farnham, that is Mr. Hall's private property, but it is mortgaged—I have no recollection of defending any other actions for him, but I do not attend to the common law—I never practised at criminal law, mine is the conveyancing department prin<lb></lb>cipally—I employ Mr. Sleap here as my agent—I have had a good many claims sent in against Mr. Hall since Feb. 1846, but I cannot give you the dates—his father has paid from 4 to 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid a bill for 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated 9th Feb., 1846—I was not aware it was a forgery—I had not shown it to Mr. Hall, or had any communication with him about it—I had no idea when I paid the bills that any of them were forgeries, or I should not have done so—I had barely any communication with him throughout the whole trans<lb></lb>action.</p>

                  </hi> I am an ironmonger in the Edgeware-road, and am acquainted with Mr. Hall. This bill for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and also this for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I received from the prisoner within three days of the time they are dated—<hi rend="italic">the dates were Oct.</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st, and Oct.</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1847)—the endorsement, Cuthbert Collingwood Hall, was on them, both when they were first brought—I held two other bills; one I hold now, but the other for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I passed to Miss Fisher, of 66, Cambridge-terrace.</p>

               <p>Gingell there—he produced billa before the Magistrate and the prosecutor, and I heard he was not required to attend any more—his bills turned out to be genuine, and they were handed back to him—I gave the bill of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Abrahams, and I think he produced it at the Police-court—I saw it put into Mr. Hall's hand—I had seen Mr. Hall before then, I think it was on 24th Oct., 1847, I then showed him these three bills and another one—he inspected them.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And she is the Plaintiff on these bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I went to Mr. Hall, at Slough, on 24th Oct., that was a day or two before the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill became due—I knew the one for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not be due till Jan., but I saw him about that one—I saw him on the four—I think itt was about 27th or 29th Dec.,—I was wrong when I said 24th Oct.—I think it was before the bills became due—I swear it was not 7th Jan., because it was about the time the bill was coming due—it was on or about 27th Dec.—I think I showed him this bill of 26th Oct. before it came due—I went down because I was told they were not Mr. Hall's acceptances, and I took them in my pocket to ask him the question—he said the bill for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not his acceptance—the bill for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he thought was his acceptance, but afterwards he said it was not—the bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said was his acceptance—that his been since paid—he said the bill for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not his acceptance—I should not like to swear that I went down to Mr. Hall before the bills were due, but I think it was—I heard they were supposed to be forged the evening before I went down—Captain Tringham called on me and told me something—I had the bill in my possession at the time it became due, Miss Fisher had given it me—I had it more than two days—I always present them when they are due—I think they were not due when I went to Slough—I think they had not then been presented.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Surely you must know whether you had found any obstrue<lb></lb>tion to its being paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not, that was one reason for thinking it was not forged—they were presented as a matter of course—I am not con<lb></lb>fident of the day I presented them, I think it was before they became due—I certainly presented them after having been down to Mr. Hall, that I swear—I had but the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill at that time to present—I presented that to Mr. Hall, at Mayhew's house—I did not see Mr. Hall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How were the bills renewed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With fresh ones—the prisoner sent them down to me, two or three at a time, for my acceptance—my letters show no acknowledgment that I had received them from him—I never gave him any authority to sign a bill—he has never found funds for the purpose of bills—he always had a very large balance in hand, but I never could get an account from him.</p>
               <p>(William Kensitt, collector of Poor's-rates for the parish of Marylebone; John Loveridge, Esq., 11, Grove-place, Lisson-grove; Thomas Studd, auctioneer, 28, New Church-street, Edgeware-road; John Kempsall, Star and Garter, Edgeware-road; George William Mellership, 13, Paddington<lb></lb>green, omnibus proprietor; James Lennine, 2, Harcourt-street; and Charles Allen, 10, Upper York-street, Bryanston-square, upholsterer, all gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

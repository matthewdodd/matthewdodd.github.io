            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty in the Green-lanes a little after ten o'clock - I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner close by the waggon; I heard the prosecutor claim his hat; I took it off the prisoner's head, and found this handkerchief and this cap in it - the prisoner said the hat was his; he was not the driver of the waggon, but a sort of cad - I told him I should take him, and the driver got into the waggon, gave the prisoner a very old hat, and said that was his; he said he would stand a quartern of gin if we would mix it up and settle the business - I said I did not do business in that way.</p>

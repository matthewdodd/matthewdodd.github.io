               <p>Q. What money was it? - A. I do not think it was any thing but copper; sometimes the prisoner has been by herself, and sometimes the boy has been by himself; I had seen the prisoner taking tobacco out of the casks, and putting it into her pocket, loose, and sometimes putting it into her apron loose, and carrying paper bags from behind the counter, rolling them up, and putting them in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her take the tobacco? - A. She has had it several times; she took some the night before the boy and she went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what she did with the tobacco? - A. She took it up into the nursery, it was shag-tobacco, and she parcelled it up; the next morning she took it down in the kitchen, and called the boy up, and she took the box; he refused to take it, because, he said, the shopman will know the box; she then said, she would take the box to the top of Old Bedlam, and he should take the tobacco; they both went down stairs together, and when she came back, she said, she had taken the box to the top of Old-Bedlam.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. As to the tobacco, when she took it, it was leaf tobacco, without any covering? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Then you told your master of it the next day? - A. No, I did not; my master went to York, and was there three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell of it before you were taken up? - A. No, I intended all along to tell my master of it.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were taken up, you told this story about the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Healey. I know this to be my box; the tobacco I can speak to, I had such tobacco in my shop; the direction upon this parcel of tobacco I know to be the boy's hand-writing.</p>

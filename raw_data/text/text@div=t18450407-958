                  </hi>, jun. I am the son of William Cooper, a piano-forte maker, No. 24, William-street, Hampstead-road, in the parish of St. Pan<lb></lb>cras—it is his dwelling-house—I reside with him—the prisoner used to come as a charwoman, and was discharged last July—after she left I missed the key of our street door—on the night of the 7th April, about a quarter past nine o'clock, my brother Thomas went out—I saw him leave the house, and am confident he shut the street door after him—I did not see him do so, but I was on the stairs and distinctly heard the door shut—it has a peculiar sound when it shuts—there is no getting in at the window, the area is wide—the windows were all down, and I believe fastened—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I was in the kitchen and distinctly heard a key put in the street door, the door opened, and then shut to—after that I heard a noise in the parlour like a person tumbling over the chain—I came up from the kitchen and went into the passage with a light—I listened for a minute, then went to open the door, and it was put to directly—in half a minute it opened and the prisoner came out with the tea-chest on her arm—I pushed her back into the parlonr, locked the door, and locked her in—I fetched a constable and she was taken—when I went in, the tea-chest was in its usual place on the sideboard—when I returned from the station in about twenty minutes, I examined and found the books and papers and ink-stand thrown on the sofa, and the ink spilled on the sofa, and the table-cover all bundled up in a heap on the table—under the sofa I saw the policeman find this key—it is the key of the street door which we had lost—I know it by its being bro<lb></lb>ken—this tea-chest and sugar-basin are mine, the tongs are my father's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant S</hi> 124.) On the 7th of April, about half-past nine at night, I was called to Mr. Cooper's—I found the prisoner in the parlour—she was given ipto my custody—she said nothing—I took her to the station—she was Searched there by a female who gave me this key—this other key I picked up under the soil—it opens the prosecutor's street door—the other will not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On Saturday I saw Mr. Cooper, sen., and asked him to lend me two shillings; he said he had not got it in his pocket, but if I would see him at the corner of William-street on Monday sight he would give it me; I went and walked as far as the door; it was ajar; I looked in to the parlour, and the prosecutor ran to the door and shut me in; I never saw the caddy till I was at the office; Mr. Cooper, sen., has often been to my house and given me money as a friend.</p>

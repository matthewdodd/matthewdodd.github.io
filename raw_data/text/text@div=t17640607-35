Last Friday morning, I had word sent me, that some of my goods were stopped in the hands of the prisoner, and I was desired to attend the Justices at Whitechapel: when I came there, this glass was shewed me; (producing one): but before I went, I went into my warehouse, and missed eight such glasses, that were tied up, four in a bundle, ready to be packed in cases, for New York; this is one of them; the prisoner confessed to the taking of four, and said he had sold three of them at the Peacock, in the Back-lane, Rag-fair; and that he took them away the day before, and carried them to the Ship alehouse.</p>

            . On the last day of May, about half an hour after ten o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, on Saltpetre-bank, and asked my maid if she wanted a glass; he asked 3 s. 6 d. for it: I said, h came you by it? he said, he took it of his master, because he could not pay him his wages: he said he had sold five of them. I said he should not sell this; so I sent for an officer, and charged him. When before the Justice, he said he could not tell how he came by it.</p>

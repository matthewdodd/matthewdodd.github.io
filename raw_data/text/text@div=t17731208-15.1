            . I never saw the prisoner till the night he was taken. I bought ten bantam fowls of Mr. Row in the market; I received a notice of Mr. Row that they were stole from Mr. Seymour, and I informed Mr. Seymour of it.</p>
               <p>Joseph Row. On Friday the 19th of November, about eight or nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me in Newgate-market, and said he had some fowls to sell, and desired me to lend him a basket; I did, and he brought ten bantam fowls in it, and two bags with three pullets, and three hens; about eleven o'clock Goff came and saw the bantams, and bought them of me, and took them away. The prisoner bred fowls himself, and lived somewhere about Battersea. I agreed to give him 17 s. for the sixteen fowls; I paid him half a guinea, and he was to call for the rest; I received a notice at night and sent to Goff.</p>

On the 25th of February, about nine o'clock in the evening, in consequence of what my wife said, I went into the passage, and shut the private door, which I found open - it is usually kept shut; my wife keeps a chandler's-shop. I immediately went up, and found the prisoner in the first floor room; I asked what he was doing there - he said he came to look for one Atkins - no such person lived in my house - I saw a bundle at his feet; I collared him, and called down Shaw, a lodger, who was then beadle, and gave him in charge, with the bundle - there were other things on the floor; there were two new suits of children's clothes, two children's hats, and other things, which are worth 5l. together. I was in the passage a quarter of an hour before - the door was shut then.</p>

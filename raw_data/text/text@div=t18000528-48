               <p>- WHITE sworn. - I am a patrol of the parish of St. Sepulchre: On Saturday, the 3d of this month, at eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in a croud in <placeName id="t18000528-48-crimeloc269">Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had no handkerchief in my hand; what he has sworn is as false as it is true that there is a God in heaven; one handkerchief was full of holes, and the other I had a clean shirt wrapped up in it.</p>

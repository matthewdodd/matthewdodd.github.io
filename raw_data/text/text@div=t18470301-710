                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MACMILLAN</hi>. I left the vessel off Deal—I merely boarded her for a few minutes and then left her—she arrived in London somewhere about the 23rd of Jan.—on the 25th of Jan. I left London with Forrester, the officer, to go to Dover—I subsequently accompanied him to Boulogne, in search of prisoner—we went to Montreuil, which is about thirty miles from Boulogne, I think—we went to an hotel there—we did not find the prisoner there, but we waited for him, and he came there—when he came in said, "Oh, are you there, Mr. Macmillan?"—we were in the commercial or dining room—Forrester sug<lb></lb>gested that we should go into my room—we did so, with the prisoner—For<lb></lb>rester then asked the prisoner what he had done with the property, or words to that effect—the prisoner produced a bag out of his pocket, containing gold, and said, "That is all I have got, I have been robbed of the rest"—it contained eighty-for sovereigns, I think—he said he imagined he had been robbed coming down in the railway carriage to Folkestone from London, that a gentleman had been in the carriage with him, who went out at Ashford station, he himself went out there to get some refreshment, and immediately missed his train-ticket and money, and he supposed this person might have taken it—he was searched by Forrester in a slight manner, but not particularly—we afterwands dined—I asked him to take his dinner and make</p>

               <p>himself comfortable—I said, "you must have been very unhappy for a long time, do endeavour to be comfortable to-night, and take your dinner"—he expressed great regret—he said, "If the other owners had been as kind to me as you have been, this would not have taken place," and he cried—after that he said, "Mr. Macmillan, I want to speak to you"—I said, "Very well, you had better retire again to my private room"—he and I went there alone—when we got there he sat down, and said, 'Will you assist me off with my boot?"—I said, "Yes"—I did so—he put his hand into his boot, produced a roll of notes, and said, "take you that"—I said, "How much have you got there, Capt. Kerr?"—he said, "200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I counted the notes in his presence, and found it to be so—after that, in expressing his contrition, he said, "I sup<lb></lb>pose I shall be transported fro this"—we then went down stairs and finished our dinner—I found forrester there, and handed the notes to him the first opportunity—I do not think Forrester said anything to the prisoner about the money after that—I rather think he declined treating on the subject at all—he wanted to conciliate and smooth him down, I think—the prisoner told me he had gone to a public-house called the Albion, at Wapping, where he had been in the habit of going some time previous, that he had not found the same party there that had been there formerly, that the same landlord that he had known was not there then; he said he had been taking a little grog and went to bed, that in the morning he was getting his coat brushed, and that, in order to have it properly brushed, he was obliged to take certain parcels out of his pocket, that he laid two parcels on the table, and that either Mr. Foreman or Mr. Hoare, (he did not know which,) said, "What have you got there, Capt. Kerr?" and that he said, "These are diamond;" and he remarked, "Can you sell the smaller parcel of the two for me?"—that the party replied they had no doubt they could, but if he added the larger parcel, they could more readily effect a sale by combining both parcels, and that re authorized the sale of both parcels; which I believe was effected—that was his narrative to me on the passage—he did me that a lady put about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank of England notes into his pocket at the public-house—I understood him to refer to Mr. Foreman, the landlady—I think he said he had got about 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—after our dinner at Montreuil, he said to me that he had slept at a coffee-house opposite the railway station, and that in the morning he discovered that his money was gone—that was in the steam-packet coming from Boulogne, I think—I think it was on our return from Montreuil—it was on our journey from France, I cannot say wheter it was on the steam-pocket or in the tarin—on the Tues<lb></lb>day morning we went on board the steamer at Boulogne—when he told me he had been robbed he said a person of the name of Foreman was with him constantly—he said he told Mr. foreman he had been robbed, that Mr. Fore<lb></lb>man replied, "That is very unfortunate; you my suspect I am the person because I have been in your company, and I am very sorry that I have been in your company"—he asked me, "Are Mr. Foreman and Mr. Hoare in custody?"—I said I believed they were not, at which he appeared very much sur<lb></lb>prised—he afterwards said a Deal boat had boarded the ship off Folkestone, I think, fifteen miles or mid channel, and they had informed him that two gen<lb></lb>tlemen had been waiting for him at Deal for a week or more, that he asked the boatmen to describe the parties, the boatmen did so, and he said, "These are my owners, "and that he then entered into an agreement with the boatmen to land him at Folkestone, for a certain sum of money—he said the mate remon<lb></lb>strated, and said it was very improper for him to leave the ship in charge of a Deal boatman, who was tipsy at the time; notwithstanding that, he left the vessel and landed—he gave ad his reason that he would rather meet his owners</p>

               <p>on shore than shipboard—that was the reason he gave to the Deal boatmen—he stated that being so sensible of his bad conduct during the voyage, and having heard his owners were waiting for him, had the vessel been going through the water quickly he should have thrown himself over<lb></lb>board—he did not say what he took with him when he went away—I do not remember that he stated anything more about Foreman and Hoare—nothing was said about what the diamonds had been bought for—nothing was said about his clothes.</p>

Did not appear in the ship's manifest—no other articles were omitted from the manifest that I am aware of—we found the prisoner at Montreuil on Sun<lb></lb>day evening, I think, about six or seven o'clock—we got to London on the afternoon of the Tuesday following—I think I took my meals with the prisoner during the whole of that time—I endeavoured to make him as happy as I could, I felt pity for him, I rather avoided speaking to him on the sub<lb></lb>ject of the robbery—I spoke on other matters altogether—the conversation at that I have stated was all at one period—there was one conversation at Montreuil, and another on the passage home—that was not a very long one—we were shut up in the steam-boat—as far as I can recollect, those were the only two conversation I had with him—Iwas perhaps half an hour talking to him—I think I could have got through all the conversation in half an hour—he did not say he had been made drunk the night before—he said he had been talking spirits, but did not convey to me that he was the worse for liquor when he went to bed—I understood he had got it supplied to him in the house in which he was—he said that next morning some person spoke to him, Mr. Foreman I suppose—I do not remember that he said that he found Foreman in his bed-room on awaking—he said they asked him how he felt that morning—I cannot say that he left on my mind the impression that he was not out of bed when he first saw Foreman in his room—I cannot give word for word what he said—he certainly never stated that he found foreman had cut the parcel, nothing of the kind—he said that either Hoare or fore<lb></lb>man proposed that the two parcels should go—he was exceedingly distressed and grieved at the occurrence.</p>

(he had not told me at that time anything about a tailor,) that he added, "I fell very ill this morning"—that he said to foreman or Hoare, "Can you sell the small parcel for me?" and then Hoare or foreman Suggested that they had better be disposed of both together; they said, "We parcels;" and then he authorized the sale.</p>

               <p>am nephew of one of the part owners. I went out with the vessel, and re-turned with her—I remember her leaving Bahia—she was caulked there—it was my duty to take an account of the cargo—I kept a book for the purpose—I was not aware before I left Bahia that there were any diamonds on board—the captain had not communicated that to me before we left Bahis, and I had no account of any diamonds—I learned it on the homeward-bound voyage—I went down into the cabin one forenood, and saw the master overhanling some papers—I happened to look over the papere, and saw two bill of lading, mentioning diamonds—they were not with the rest of the bill of lading, among the ship's papers, but were by themselves—I asked the captain why they were not put up along with the rest of the bill of lading—he said it was in case of pirates or other people coming on board; that the most likely place they would look at would be among the bill of lading and papers of the ship, and he would put them up when we got closer home, or nearer England—after he had shown me the bills of lading, he took two parcels from a drawer in the starboard side of the cabin, and showed them to me—I cannot say whether be unlocked the drawer—I looked at the parcels—one was about one foot long, and half a foot broad; the other was about half that size—there was paper out-side, which was sealed and secured—the large parcel appeared to contain some hard substance, as a tin box—it had several seals on it—I did not feel the smaller parcel—it was sealed, and in paper—the drawer was kept locked during the voyage—the prisoner kept the key—he told me the parcels con-tained diamonds—he told me where he had got them, and said the ship was to have so much per cent. for the freight of them—I remarked, "If you were to take a few out of these boxes how should the people know?"—he said they were all weighed out before him in Bahia—I remember the vessel being off the coast of Brest on our near arrival towards home—I remember two gentlemen, coming on board at Duornes, at the south-east of Brest—I saw the two parcels at that Iport—the gentlemen asked to see the diamonds—from what they said they knew there were diamonds on board—the captain produced them from the same drawer in the cabin from which he had pro-duced them to me—they were then sealed and secured as I had seen thed when we were at sea—I cannot say that I saw him replace them in the drawer in the cabin—the drawer was always kept locked afterwards, as before—I did not see them again from that time—we arrived in the Downs, on the 21st of Jan. by nautical time—that was Wednesday, the 20th of Jan., by civil time—we were boarded by some Deal boatmen, not pilots—we were then laying in the Downs, in mid-channel, between the English and French coasts—I did not hear the Deal men say anything to the captain while they were on board—it was my watch below—the prisoner came down to me, and mentioned that the owners werw at Deal, and that he had a great mind to go on shore—I said it would be better for him to stop on board—I was the next officer to him, and did not like to hae charge of the vessel unless we had a pilot on board—the prisoner went away on deck, came down below again, began to dress himself, and said he would go ashore—this was off Dungeness, about fifteen miles from the coast of Folkestone—we could see the Dungeness light—the prisoner remained below about twenty minutes, and dressed in the same cabin in which the starboard drawer was, where the diamonds were—I remember the steward coming down to the captain—I have not got the ship's log with me—I made an entry of the captain's leaving or abandoning the vessel—when he came up dressed there was a boat along-side, with the Deal men in it—he got into it, and went ashore—he left one of the Deal men, who was the worse for liquor, with us on board—next morning Mr. M'Millan, one of the owners, came on board—in consequence of not</p>

               <p>finding the captain on board, he proceeded to examine the ship—I called his attention to the drawer of the cabin—we called the carpenter down, and had the drawer forced open—we found neither of the two parcels, only some papers—the prisoner's desk was examined, and the two bills of lading were found ther—I do not know who found them—I saw them in the hands of Mr. M'Millan.</p>

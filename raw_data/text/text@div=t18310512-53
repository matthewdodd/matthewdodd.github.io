               <p>PRYCE MOTTREM. On the 15th of April I was near <placeName id="t18310512-53-crimeloc329">Temple-bar, in the Strand</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310512-53-crimeloc329" type="placeName" value="Temple-bar, in the Strand"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was it not dusk? A. Yes, rather so, and a great many people were passing - it was on Fleet-street side of the bar; the lady is not here.</p>
               <p>JOHN COLE. I am a Police-constable. I was off duty and merely coming up Fleet-street - I saw the prosecutor, who had a handkerchief a little way out of his pocket; I saw the prisoner, with another person in his company, dog the prosecutor's pocket - the prisoner drew the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket with his right hand; I went to make a grasp at him, and the other man put up his leg, and I fell down - I then lost sight of the prisoner for about half a minute - I took him just afterwards, but could not find the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where was this? A. It was between Temple-bar and St. Clement's church - the gentleman made a mistake when he said it was on the Fleet-street side of the bar; I lost sight of the prisoner for about half a minute, but he had not got more than thirty yards from there before he was taken - I cannot be mistaken in his person; I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That man is swearing my life away - he took me into a bookseller's shop in Carey-street, and said a woman saw me pick the pocket; then he went to Bow-street and said he saw me do it.</p>

            . I am the wife of Dennis Ahearne - I knew the prisoner by going to Farringdon-market - and on the 7th of August, she brought a little girl, and wanted me to take her into my care, which I did; and the prisoner came to see her the next morning - on the Monday evening after, I missed part of this property, and told the girl I must discharge her - the prisoner came and said she was very sorry for it - and on the Thursday afterwards, the prisoner came, and brought this brooch, which she said the gilr had sold to a woman for 2d., and she had bought it for 3d.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Adam and Evecourt - this property was at my house, but I do not know how it came there, without the prisoner brought it - she came there on the 7th, and absconded on the 14th - she gave me no notice - she said she came from service - I had seen her little girl come there once.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are two rings and a cap of mine among that property - I got some of those things out of the girl's possession, in Playhouse-yard, and the next day, I found her, with some more of them, making a cap- I asked her if they were her own - she said they were - I took them from her to my house, to return to the woman.</p>

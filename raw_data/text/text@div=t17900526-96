               <p>On Wednesday, about twelve in the morning, missing different things, I, myself, at night measured a piece of silk which was left; it was missed from a press in the back room; I did not miss it myself; at night, I put in that very place, a piece of silk that I measured, and a piece of ribbon; the next morning, I went into the room myself, and measured them over again, and part of it was missing: I told Mr. Dyde of it, and went to Justice Hyde for a search-warrant; I came back with a constable; and Mr. Dyde went to search the prisoner, and it was in the prisoner's room up stairs; a piece of lace was found by the constable, in a hat-box; it was black silk lace; I know of nothing else in that room; I went out immediately: Mr. Dyde, the constable, and the prisoner, went into the kitchen; a little after, I went down myself, as the constable was opening a little bundle, in which were two remnants of silk, and the remnant of ribbon, that I missed; it was a yard a half of silk, and about three yards of ribbon.</p>

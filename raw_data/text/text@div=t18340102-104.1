               <p>MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HOLDWAY. I am an officer - on the 4th of December I was stationed at <placeName id="t18340102-104-crimeloc578">St. Katherine's Dock</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18340102-104-crimeloc578" type="placeName" value="St. Katherine's Dock"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. STAMMERS. Q. Did you measure the wine? A. Yes, with a quart-pot I got from a public-house - I know it is claret wine by tasting it - I am not in the habit of tasting claret, but I have tasted it when I was in service. I do not know how many men were at work in that vault beside the prisoner.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the police at St. Katherine's Dock - I saw this wine and these other things found on the prisoner - I examined the vault, and found a cask had been spiled, and this gimblet fitted the holes - the prisoner attempted to make his escape.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were at work there? A. I do not know; there were a great many; there was a vault-keeper and several others - the usual way of tasting wine is by taking it from the bung-hole: I have seen it spiled, but it is not usual - one spile hole was left vacant, and another had a new spile in it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do merchants ever taste by a spile? A. No.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PITTENDRIGH. I am foreman cooper of vault B - the prisoner was employed to paint there.</p>
               <p>DAVID HUNTER. I am keeper of the B vault - I drewsome wine out of the cask; it was partially leaking - it is claret wine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent of the robbery. I was engaged to paint a box and three pieces of board for the "Lord of the Isles," and received the wine for it. I told the officer so, and he made a laugh at it. There is no proof that I got the wine out of the cellar - I was not stopped till I got to the front gate - the reason I did not state where I got it was, I did not know but that it was smuggled - I am guilty of having it, but I did not steal it.</p>

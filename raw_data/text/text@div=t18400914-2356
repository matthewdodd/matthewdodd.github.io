I am a mariner, and belong to the <hi rend="italic">Leeds.</hi> On the 8th of July I fell in with the prisoner Wright in the evening—I got into discourse with her, and went home with her to a place which, I believe, is called Pope's-alley—it was a small house, close by the Lebeck's Head public-house</p>

I was spoken to about this—I found the watch at Mr. Vesper's on the 26th of August—I told him it was stolen, and wished him to stop it—I sent a letter for the pro<lb></lb>secutor to arrive as soon as possible—I then took him to a house where I thought the party that stole it was—he went, and saw Wright and two other females in the room—he beckoned to me, and told me Wright was the one—I told her I wanted her to go to the station-house with me—she said, "What for?"—I said, "This man gives you in charge"—she said, "I never saw the man in my life in my house"—the prosecutor said, "No, I don't say I have been in this house"—she then said, "I never saw him in my life"—she had moved four or five days before to another house—she was not in the house the prosecutor was robbed in—Wright was then examined, and when we came out she told me where Chapman lived—I went and found her at home—I said I wanted her to go a little way with me—she said, "What about?"—I said I would tell her, and when she came out, she said, "It is about a watch, is it not?"—I said, "It is"—she said, "I have had that five months, I had it from a tall man with a long nose, I showed it to a number of girls in the lane"—I then took her to Mr. Vesper's, and he said, "It is a pity to take her up, she has been a customer of mine for ten years"—when I asked her for the duplicate she took down a Bible and gave me the duplicate.</p>

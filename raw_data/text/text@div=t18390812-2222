                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Mr. Paulus Emilius Pauli, a merchant, who lives in Park villas, Regent's-park. On the 23rd of July I had been out, and was returning home at half-past four o'clock in the evening—I met the prisoner at the top of the steps leading up from the kitchen—he was coming out of the house—he said, "I have seen the cook"—I said, "Have you," that was all—he then went away—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him to the gate, saw him join another man, and they both ran away together—I went down stairs to the butler's pantry, and opened the plate box—I saw two of the divisions were empty—it had been all safe when I left it an hour before—I went out, met a policeman, and told him that a man had robbed the house—I described the prisoner—the policeman went after him—he was secured and taken—I am sure he is the person—all the plate has been found.</p>

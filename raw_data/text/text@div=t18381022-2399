Deben<lb></lb>ham's auction-rooms about ten minutes after twelve o'clock, I met the prisoner coming out in a great hurry, with his handa to his breast—I followed him—he went into a pawnbroker's shop, at the corner of Princes-street—I saw him unbutton his coat, and take the trowsers out, which had the ticket on—I stepped into the passage, and collared him—he dropped them, and I took them up—I asked him where he got them—he taid he bought them—he wanted me to let him go, as he had a wife and family—I took him back to the room, and left him in charge of Wicks oil I got an officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see that? - A. Yes; they were then taken to Clerkenwell Bridewell; I saw all the things after; they were found at Mrs. Munday's, in Golden-lane.</p>

               <p>White's defence. We met Garland and this young man, and went to have a pot of beer, when that man gave charge of us; I am innocent of it.</p>

She was a single woman. I was apprehensive of the things being gone, so got a warrant and searched her lodgings, when all those things appeared to be missing. I went to one Finch, a pawnbroker in Berwick-street, Soho, found part of them there, the rest I found in John-street. She acknowledged before the justice that they were my property, and that she had pawned them herself. (The goods produced and sworn to by the prosecutor.)</p>

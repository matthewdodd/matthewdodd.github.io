On the 19th of January the prisoner came in, and wished to leave two umbrellas for me to take care of; I had some suspicion of him, and watched him - I saw him go into Mr. Smith's shop, and come out again with three hats; I watched him a little way further, and saw him go up Seward-street - I then went to the shop, but there was no one there; at length a person came down, and said no hats had gone out of the house, to her knowledge; I then pursued the prisoner, and took him with these hats, which he said he had bought that morning.</p>

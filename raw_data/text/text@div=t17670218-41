               <p>Gallell. No, not at all; I only said they should all stand search, and after the half guinea was found, I said if she would confess it, I should have the better opinion of her, and it might be better for the rest of my servants.

               <p>A. Gallell. No, I was ill at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in the room the time the money was in the drawer?</p>
               <p>A. Gallell. Nobody but my mother, two of our apprentices, and the prisoner; my mother said, they must stand search; a constable was sent for; after that, the prisoner and my husband came up stairs to me; she owned before me to the taking the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she got at the money?</p>
               <p>A. Gallell. She said she got the key, which was hanging up in a different part of the room; my apron she had on at the time; (produced and deposed to) she confessed to the taking it clean out of the drawer, before she went out of the room.</p>

            . I am the constable; as we were going to the Justice's, the prisoner confessed to me, she had taken a couple of guineas out of her master's drawer; I said, your master says he has lost more; then she said she had taken six guineas; she begged her master would give her leave to send for her friends; he took her home, and she sent for her friends, and they did not come; then we took her to Justice Girdler.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to her to prevail with her to confess?</p>

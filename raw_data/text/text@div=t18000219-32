             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am assistant elder in the warehouses, in Haydon-square; as soon as I heard the stocking was gone, at two o'clock, I ordered the prisoner to go over to Mr. Visset, the head elder; I saw Jackson turn back in the square, I asked him where he was going, and he said, he wanted to speak to a man of the name of Jones; I told him he must go to Mr. Visset immediately, and then he attempted to run away; I followed him, and laid hold of him in Mansell-street; I called for the assistance of the gate-keeper, Simpson, and we brought him back; then he seemed very busy, doing something about his clothes, and at the fourth house in the square, Mr. Levy's, I saw him throw the stocking down the area, the same stocking that I had seen the day before, it was tied up with a piece of red handkerchief; I told Simpson, there it goes; I desired him to take it up, and I would return to him in a minute or two; I returned back, and Simpson gave it me, and I took it to the warehouse-keeper, Stockwell, where I saw it weighed, and the prisoner was then in the outer office; it contained mace, and weighed fourteen ounces.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there mace in these warehouses? - A. There was; Stockwell then sent for an officer to the warehouses, and he was taken into custody.(Produces the property.)</p>

               <p>Q. You searched this man, when he left the warehouses? - A. I slightly rubbed him down, because I meant to have him searched by the King's officer.</p>
               <p>Q. In his side there is no mace, I believe? - A. Yes, there is, he had the charge of that part of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. But not in that room? - A. Not open, it was nailed down, in chests, so that nobody can get at it.</p>

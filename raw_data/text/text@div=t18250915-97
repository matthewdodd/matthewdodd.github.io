               <p>JOHN WILKINSON. I live in Cateaton-street. On the 2d of August, about nine o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18250915-97-crimeloc527">Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any private mark on it? A. No, it is not a common pattern - I bought the whole piece - I felt no pull at my pocket.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I saw Mr. Wilkinson, with a lady, in Cheapside, going towards home; I saw the prisoner and another go under a hoard at the corner of Old Change - they followed Mr. Wilkinson - he crossed over towards Gutter-lane - they went on before him a little, then crossed over and came behind him - there was no appearance of his handkerchief hanging out. I kept my eye on them, and, just opposite to Bread-street, I saw the other one take the handkerchief out of Mr. Wilkinson's pocket, and immediately give it to the prisoner, who put it inside his bosom, closed his coat, and crossed over to go down Friday-street - the other went strait by the prosecutor; I caught hold of the prisoner in the middle of the road, and in the scuffle the handkerchief fell down between our feet - the other ran off - he gave no account how he got it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Portpool-lane. I work at cloth caps—on the 9th of November, the day the Queen came into the City, I was at the corner of the Old Bailey, near Ludgate-hill, between two and three o'clock, standing on the edge of the pavement with a friend—I felt somebody pulling up my clothes—I put my hand down to try to put them down, and they were forced up more—I put my hand down</p>

I was on duty—the prose<lb></lb>cutrix called for assistance—she had hold of the prisoner's collar with one hand, and the pocket in the other—she said he had turned her petticoats up, and torn her pocket off—the prisoner's coat was torn from the elbow down.</p>

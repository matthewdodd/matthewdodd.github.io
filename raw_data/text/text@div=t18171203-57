               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer. On the 8th of November I was with Foy, and saw the prisoner in Portland-place, about eleven o'clock, walking with his hands in his coat-pockets; we followed him to Titchfield-street, and there seized him. He struggled very much, and drew his hand out of his pocket, put something in his mouth, and began to chew. I took six 1l. notes out of his mouth; he said he found them.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOV. I am an officer. I was with Plank. (looks at the notes). They are those which we took from his mouth.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN LEES. I am an inspector of Bank notes - They are all forged in every respect (read).</p>

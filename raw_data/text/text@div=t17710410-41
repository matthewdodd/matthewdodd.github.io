I saw the prisoner open the door, come into the shop, and take a piece of linen off the counter. I was behind a door watching him. We had been robbed twice before. I had seen the prisoner loitering about the door, and suspecting him, I watched him; he took the piece off the counter; he reached, and laid hold of the piece; he was not entirely within the door, I believe; he reached his hand out, and took it; he carried it off: I pursued him directly. When he saw me after him, he threw it down just by the door. I secured him.</p>

I was passing by Mr. Kennedy's door; I saw the prisoner come backwards with the piece of linen upon his left arm; he threw it down upon the flat stones, and ran into the middle of the street. Mr. Lancaster ran after him, and cried, Stop thief. The prisoner ran up Gracechurch-street, and ran into the Skin Market, Leadenhall-street; there we took him.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Morgan's in Lincoln's-inn-fields. I am a hosier. The prisoner made me a pair of shoes; he brought them home this day six weeks. He asked me to take a walk to see the synagogue in Duke's Place. As we were going up Cornhill, we heard a great cry of Stop thief, stop thief. The prisoner said, he would go and see what was the matter; we were then about an hundred yards beyond the Royal Exchange, in Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the cry of Stop thief come?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. They went towards Leadenhall-market. He left me, and said, he would come to me presently; - he went towards Leadenhall-market; the mob was before us; he ran and joined the mob. I staid some time, and he did not come home; they told me at last, that he was taken up for stealing something out of a shop; I heard that at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to see him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Not till about a fortnight or three weeks after. I went directly home to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you an account at the prisoner's lodgings that he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you the curiosity to enquire where he was gone, or what was become of him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I did not trouble my head about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it extraordinary, that an innocent man should be taken up for this thing? Did not you see him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I did not know where; I set out, five days after, for Leicester.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I can't say any more.</p>
               <p>Court. But I have something more to say to you. You was told he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes, I asked the people, but they could not inform me where he was gone to.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. They said he was taken up for shop-lifting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know at whose house?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in London?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Eight years; I have lived with lord Waltham, and the biggest noblemen in the land.</p>
               <p>Q. So you would persuade me and the jury, that you that have lived in London eight years, did not know how to find out a man that was taken up for shop-lifting? How came you not to find him out, and give your testimony in his favour, that he was innocent, as you had been with him the whole time?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Court. But you must have something more to say.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I thought no harm would come of it, because I knew he was innocent, so I did not give myself any further trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you suffered this innocent man to lie in gaol, and never went near him, nor gave him any assistance till a fortnight ago? How did you find out then where he was?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. By a friend of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Who might it be?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Mrs. Hart; I met her in the street; she told me; that is about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. In Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she tell you?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. That he was in Newgate for the affair that happened when I was with him. I have no more to say.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went to Newgate?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go that same day?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No, the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Messrs. Grace and Kennedy live?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you where the house is he is accused of stealing the goods from?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I do not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lancaster. Do you know any thing of that man?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. I cannot positively swear to the man; I think I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. I am not certain whether I have or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you now swear that there was a crowd in the street?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. A great many people, the prisoner said he would run and see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner ran at all, was there a cry of Stop thief?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the prisoner were walking along quietly together when you heard the cry of Stop thief?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. He was before me about ten yards; he stopped to tell me there was a cry of Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear this cry?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner had said he would go and see what it was; which way did he go?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Towards Leadenhall market.</p>
               <p>Q. What side of Cornhill was you on?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. The right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. What side was he?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. The right-hand side, both of us.</p>
               <p>Q. In the foot way?</p>

               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run along in the same foot-way, or did he go along the middle of the street?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. He was gone in a moment; I could not see.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about the time?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. It was between five and six, very near six to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100050"></xptr>Q. Which way did you go to his lodgings afterwards?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Through Leadenhall Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have gone by Leadenhall market?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes; the crowd was all gone when I went by there; I stopped some time where I was; I followed the crowd gently on.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that crowd?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I can't tell; I never like to interfere in a crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. What side of Leadenhall Street did you go down?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. The left-hand side; I crossed the way at the pastry cook's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might stay long enough to see your friend come back?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No; I kept walking on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you wait for him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you expected to meet him in the crowd. You did not stay to see what happened?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No; I always keep from a crowd.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you was right not to stay. Both these gentlemen saw this man come out of the shop, and he was never out of their sight; how do you account for this?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. People might run; I cannot be accountable for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose they are mistaken with regard to this man, that it was not him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not suppose your friend ran along after he had left you, and committed this felony, do you?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. We brought him back in less than four minutes; if he had been there we must have met him.</p>
               <p>Q. This synagogue began before six, I believe, at that time?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I do not know; he asked me if I would take a walk and see it.</p>
               <p>Q. He said you desired to see it?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I asked him if he could shew it me; he said he could.</p>

On the 9th of June, about a quarter past nine o'clock at night, I was returning from Cumberland-street chapel, and looking in at a bookseller's window - I felt a pull at my watch, and saw the prisoner run from me, and two others, whom I suspected to be his companions - he was almost close to me, and turned up a yard. I followed, calling Stop thief - his companions ran another way. I followed him in the middle of the street, and hardly lost sight of him two seconds before I found him in custody, and am certain he is the person who stood close to me. I found a link of my chain broken, and the ring left, and the rest was gone with the key. He denied it at first, but when he found I was determined to give him in charge, he asked me to go back, and I should find the chain, but I did not. Nobody but him could have taken it.</p>

On the 2nd of October, between four and five dozen of skins in an unmanufactured state, were lost from our premises at Battersea; they are never sold in that state - I went with my brother and two officers to the prisoner's premises, on the 30th of October; we saw the prisoner there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what size shop is the prisoner's? A. A small shop - he appeared to sell waddings and skins for muffs, but the whole was in a very confused state; when I went in the first time the skins were on the left-hand side, and he produced them openly to me; they were drab, which is a common colour in the trade - my brother's name was not on the skins; a stranger might have bought them innocently.</p>

            . I went with the officer, and found the skins - I picked out nine, which I know to be our property, and was a part of those stolen from us on the 2nd of October - we never sold any in that state.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your opinion respecting the others? A. That they were other persons' property - they were not ours decidedly; the nine selected were all black- our dyers put a private-mark on them, by which I know them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who are your dyers? A. We have several; they do not all make the same mark - they are our own men; they do not dye for other persons - some of them are here; I will not swear they do not dye for other persons - these skins are finished, and were so when we found them; we have sold finished black skins, and dealt very extensively in them, but not in this state - we never sell black skins, unless they are strained, which these are not.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You never sell them in this state? A. No; I can speak decidedly, with respect to the drab skin - that is not strained; they are worth 20s.; the prisoner never was on our premises, nor saw our men.</p>

            . I am a glove-manufacturer. I saw the officer with these skins at the Police-office; I never sold these or any other to the prisoner - I have not seen him these three years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him? A. Yes, I know him well - I know one Mr. Corran to my sorrow; he was in my service.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A lady came to my shop on the 9th of October, and wished me to make a pair of kid gloves to her size; I had not got a skin which would do, and on the 10th I set off at seven o'clock in the morning to go to Mr. Arnold's to buy a coloured skin for the purpose of making a pair of gloves, to be ready by the Monday - when I got to Oxford-street I had a wish to go and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090121"></xptr>see the park, but went into a public-house, and had a glass of gin and water - when I had been there some time, who should come in but a young person named Insel - we were rather surprised to see each other, and I said, "What brings you here?" he said, "I and King have been to

I want to see him;" we came out, I left him, and went to Arnold's - I purchased six coloured skins and twelve black ones of him - the six coloured I gave 13s. 9d. for, and the black ones 1l. 2s. 6d. - I paid him 13s. 9d. for the coloured skins, not intending to buy any black, as I had some at home; but he wished me to take them, and I was to pay him next time I went to the West-end; when I was at the office Arnold denied that Insel or King had been at his house.</p>
               <p>JURY to GEORGE ARNOLD. Q. Did you see the prisoner on the day mentioned? A. I have not seen him these three years; there is no truth in what he has stated- a young man brought a parcel one Sunday morning in October to go in my parcel to Torrington - I do not know what it contained; I do not know the young man's name.</p>

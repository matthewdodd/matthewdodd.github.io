                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Coates. On the 12th of June I went into the City by an omnibus—I got in in the Strand—I had 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 21/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in my pocket—the 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was rolled up in my handkerchief in my right hand pocket—when I got in, the pri<lb></lb>soner was sitting next to me, on my right side, in a cloak, and a man Sitting opposite me, who stared at me very hard in the face—the prisoner was fidgeting about in his cloak—he sat close beside me—the omnibus stopped at the corner of Farringdon-street, and the prisoner got out—before he got out I discovered I had lost my money and handkerchief, and said, "You have robbed me, Sir"—I addressed that to him, but he took no notice—he proceeded to get out—I then attempted to get out, but the person who sat opposite me was paying the conductor, and held the door and prevented me—I said, "That man has robbed me," and as I went to run over Fleet-street, as the prisoner had run across the road, the man's arm came across my neck, and hindered me from following him immediately—I went after the prisoner, and went across the road up a court—I accused him of having robbed me—he said he had not—while I was charging him, Mr. Greenland came out of a public-house, and asked me what was the matter—I said, "This man has robbed me"—he said, "If he has robbed you, we will have an officer"—this was in the hearing of the prisoner—he stood close by—while they were gone for the officer he dropped my hand-kerchief between his cloak and the right side of his person, I saw that—19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the King's Head, at Knightsbridge. I was in a public house in Crown-court—I heard a noise and came out—I found the prisoner and prosecutrix there—there were people at the end of the court—it opens into Fleet-street, and it is thirty or forty yards long—the woman said the prisoner had robbed her of some money, and a white pocket handkerchief in the omnibus—I said I would send for an officer, and have him searched—the prisoner dropped the money from under his arm—he had his arm under his cloak, and he opened his arm and the money dropped—I saw the woman pick it up—several persons came from the coffee-room and likewise up the court—the prisoner said he hoped she would forgive him—I said I would not suffer him to go unpunished—the officer came and I gave him in charge.</p>

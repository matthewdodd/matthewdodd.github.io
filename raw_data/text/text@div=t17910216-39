               <p>Did you see the prisoners afterwards? - Not at all till they were taken, and I saw them at the Justice's; I heard they were taken on Sunday, but did not go to the office till Tuesday, as they were not examined before.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; on the morning of the 16th of January, I was at the corner of Berwick-court, Nassau-street, a great way from Norman-street, between two and three that morning, I saw the prisoners pass by, one (Howard) having a piece of meat under his right arm.</p>
               <p>Were they both together? - They were both together, and came in company together down the street; I stopt in the middle of the street, and put my stick before them, and asked them what they had got there; they said nothing but a piece of meat; with that I passed, and let them pass; with that another man (Lovett) followed them up to where they lodged, and sent up for me to bring a light; in consequence of which we entered the premises, and found all the property in the premises; we found two legs of mutton, and a spare rib of pork, and part of a chine; they told me that they bought it at Islington; of a man that had a cart. Lovett asked him why they bought so much; they said that when people have a little money to lay out, people have a right to lay it out to the best advantage; when going along, they said they found it on a dunghill near Hanover-square.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the other man, at the time you passed him, had any thing on him or no? - I cannot positively swear, Lovet can tell more than me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the two men? - I am, I knew them before.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether one or both had bundles? - I cannot positively swear to Isaacs, because my principal object was to Howard; I am positively sure that Howard had one.</p>
               <p>How soon was it afterwards you went to the lodgings? - In a very few minutes; I dare say the lodgings was not above fifty yards to where I stopped them: it is Howard's lodgings; whether the other lodged there, I cannot tell.</p>

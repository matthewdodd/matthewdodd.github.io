                  </hi>. I am a Magistrate of the county of Middlesex, and reside at Walthamstow. I had some tame rabbits, kept in a house prepared for them, in a building in my yard, within the ring-fence, in a rabbit-house had been broken—I went down, and found a ladder placed against it, and a small door in it had been broken—a staple had been wrenched out of the post to which a padlock was usually attached—I then went into the rabbit-house—I found the rails of two tame rab<lb></lb>bits had been cur off while they were alive—I missed a great many rab<lb></lb>bits—I cannot tell how many—my man can speak to that—two of the rabbits have been produced which were found in the prosecution of one of the prisoners—a poker was left in the rabbit-house, which I gave to the police-sergeant—It was not mine.</p>

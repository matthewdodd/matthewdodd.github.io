            . I am in the service. of Mr. John Underwood, of Providence-row, Islington. On the 12th of November, I was passing Mr. Leigh's door, in Islington, between one and two o'clock - I saw the prisoner at the front door, and another person on the pavement; there is a garden in front of the house, fenced off from the street - I did not stop then, but in a few minutes I returned and saw the prisoner in the parlour, and the window was open - the other man was still on the pavement; I went home and left my tray, and then went back, and saw the prisoner leaving the premises, and the other man had the desk; they ran different ways - I took the prisoner, who made some resistance; the other man ran away - the desk was carried back and delivered to Mr. Leigh: I saw two silver spoons found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see my face? A. Yes, I did; and when I went by again I saw you in the parlour, and knew your person.</p>

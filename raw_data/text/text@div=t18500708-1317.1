                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Briggs, and live at 8, St. George's-place. I let the prisoner some lodgings in our house on Saturday, 29th June—he lodged and slept there on 29th and 30th, in the same room as a man named Shearwood—on Monday morning, after Mr. Shearwood went out, I heard a footstep go down to the kitchen—I got up, went down, and saw the prisoner there searching a box—it was dark—I opened the shutter, and he stood amazed and very frightened by the side of me—I asked why he was there—he said he wanted to wash himself—that was not the place to wash, and I showed him where—in about five minutes he came back for a key he had left—I said I did not think there was such a thing, and would not allow him to go in—he came home again about four o'clock, and went to his room—that was the same room as Mr. Shearwood's</p>

               <p>—he went out again—I went into the room five minutes after and missed the trowsers, which I had seen lying in a chair five minutes before he came in—no one had been in the room—there was no one in the house but myself.</p>

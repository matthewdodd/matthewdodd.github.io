Bank note from Serjeant Brooks' to get change -I went to Mr. Pitt's, but he had not the sort of change I wanted; the note was then given to the prisoner to get change at the next house, Mr. Morrison's, a baker: he went there, returned, and said he could not get it there, but they had referred him to a place at the top of the street, where by making use of their name, he might get it - I believe he mentioned the person's name, and said he could have as much change as he liked; Mr. Pitt sent him there to get it, and he never returned - this was on a Wednesday, and on the Saturday afterwards I saw him in custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you remember what I said when I came back? A. Yes - nothing was said about leaving the note and calling again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any authority given him to leave that note in pessession of any other person? A. No; I waited ten minutes, and then I left word with Mr. Pitt, that if he came he was to leave word at the barracks gate, as I had to attend parade - I went afterwards to Mr. Pitt, and found he had not returned.</p>

            . I live with my father, John Morrison, in Castle-street, Leicester-square, next door to Mr. Pitt. On the 30th of May such a man as the prisoner came for change for a note - I cannot be positive that he was the person; I said I could not give change, but I did not direct him to go any where for change - I was there the whole of that day, and saw but one man come for change.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DISMORE. As I was taking the prisoner to the station, he said he should not attempt to deny it; and when before the Magistrate he said he had received the note from Mr. Pitt, and had met some person to whom he owed some money, who had threatened that if he did not pay them they would hand him over to the Police, and not knowing what to do, he had absconded with the remainder of the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Pitt stated before the Magistrate that I had offered to leave the note, and I considered that a superior point in my favour; as to my making the statement the officer represents, I deny it altogether - I know I received it, but without any intention to steal; I met a man to whom I owed a sum of money, for which he demanded payment; I requested him to take a part of the money, which he did, but I told Mr. Pitt that there was a person or two coming from Manchester who would be of service to me, and I should he able to repay it - after I had paid the money I went to Knightsbridge, feeling conscious that I should be able to make up the money on Sunday.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. PITT. Q. When the prisoner came from Morrison did he return the note? A. Yes; he put it on the counter, and said Miss Morrison could not change it, but he might use their name at the hotel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I might possibly do it by making use of their names? A. No; you said if you made use of their names you could get it, and I woundered why my name was not as good as their's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ware, in Hertfordshire. I have a farm, called Jennings-bury, near Hertford—I had about 130 or 140 fowls there—on the 2nd of January, and a few days afterwards, I missed about forty—I saw some at the station-house, near Whitechapel church—I have not a doubt of their being part of what I lost.</p>

On Monday, the 4th of January, I found some feathers and entrails belonging to the fowls—I missed about forty-eight from the hen-house, which was shut up—I examined some fowls at Worship-street office, and knew them to be the same as I lost—I can swear positively to them—three of them had red claws sewn on the legs—we term them stockings—they were sewn on as a mark, in case they should be lost, and they had the same claws on at the office.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 66.) On Saturday morning, the 2nd of January, at half-past six o'clock, I was on duty in Slater-street, Bethnal-green, and saw a cab come down Brick-lane with the prisoner and another man in it—they turned into the street opposite Slater-street, and pulled up—the cab stopped—I waited there, and saw the prisoner and the other man get out; and before the cab-man could put down the board, I saw some thing like a bag—I waited about ten minutes—they never offered to take any thing out, not yet to knock at any door—they then knocked at the shutters of the Old Hare public-house, and in about ten minutes more the house was opened—the prisoner and the other man went in—the bag remained in the cab—I went across the street to the public-house door—the prisoner immediately came out, and in about a minute afterwards the other man came out and told the prisoner Mr. In<lb></lb>gram, the landlord, was not up—he then turned round, went in, and shut the door—the prisoner said to the cab-man, "Turn round, we will go to the other place, and see if they are up there"—he got into the cab, and was driving off, when I stopped it, and asked the prisoner where he was going—he said, "To the Cherry-tree, in Kingsland-road"—I said, "I shall see what you have here"—he said, "You may depend on it all is right"—I then pulled a basket from the cab, and there was a direction on it "For Mr. Smith, to be left at the Cherry-tree, Kingsland-road, till called for"—it contained nineteen fowls—I looked at the bag, and found the same direction on that—I put the basket into the bag, and took them to the station-house with the prisoner—there were twenty-two fowls in the bag—I went in pursuit of the other man, but did not find him—the fowls were quite warm and fresh—these forty-one fowls were shown to Butcher and to Bell, and they identified them—the prisoner said he had the fowls given to him by a man from Hertford, named Richards, or Richardson, but did not know in what street, or what business he was—that they were given to him to bring to London I went to the Cherry-tree—one Mr. Smith, a miller from Hertfordshire, I understand. frequents the house, but nobody else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was Hertford on Friday, and saw a person whose I have frequently seen in town—he asked if I was going to town—I said I was—he said he had a couple of parcels, if I would take them and leave them as he directed them—I said I would; but when I got to town, they were not up; and the other person in the coach with me said he was going to a house, where we could get something to drink, and by that time they would be up—well, after that I took the cab to return to leave them as directed—the policeman stopped me, and asked me what I had there—I said, "Poultry which was delivered to me, I believe it is all right"—he said he must see—I hope you will consider my statement—it is not at all likely a man could lose from a place, so near his dwelling-house, forty-eight fowls, and not miss them till the next week—as to his saying poultry do not come out in cold weather, it is most unreasonable, it is well known they never stop in from frost or snow, though they will from wet weather—my friends are a long way from town, or I could have proved they never were his fowls, and never in his possession.</p>

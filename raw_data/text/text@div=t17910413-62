On the 3d of March last, in the morning, Mr. Lackington told me that he had very just cause to suspect that he had a thief or thieves in his shop, and desired that I would give a sharp look-out. In the afternoon I saw some books in the pocket of the prisoner at the bar, he was an assistant of Mr. Lackington's; I did not just then detect him, but endeavoured to satisfy myself more fully, whether they were books or no: I then informed one of my shopmates, says I,

I followed him close with a candle; now, says I, David, please to give me those books out of your pocket: he gave me one; I said, give me the other; he gave it me: the books are here, they are

I told him it had a very bad look, and that he was not a proper person for Mr. Lackington's service at all; nevertheless I let him take the parcels and the books along with him; but I was a little uneasy, lest he should not deliver that parcel, and so no more passed on that occasion until the next morning, when Mr. Lackington came to town, when he ordered the constable to take him into custody immediately.</p>
               <p>Do you know them to be Mr. Lackington's books? - I do; here is Mr. Lackington's marks.</p>
               <p>Do you know where these books were taken from? - These were in that division of the shop where David was employed, for the purpose of sticking the papers on, as I think.</p>
               <p>What did he say on all this? - That he took them to read, and would bring them again the next morning; but that is a practice entirely contrary to Mr. Lackington's shop, unless they inform me of it.</p>

Knowing that I had bought them much under the value, the next morning I carried them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130066"></xptr>to Justice Triquett's, and told him that I believed them to be Mr. Lackington's; on that information he was taken up.</p>

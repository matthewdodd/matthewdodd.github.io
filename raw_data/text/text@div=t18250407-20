            . I am twelve years of age. I know the nature of an oath; I have seen the prisoner several times on Clerkenwell-green. On the 29th of January, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw Mr. Pilgrin in 
               <persName id="t18250407-20-person204">York-place, City-road</persName>
            ; I did not see the prisoner at that time, but as I was sitting on a butcher's block in Sydney-street, about five minutes afterwards, I heard the cry of Stop Thief! and saw the prisoner run down Sydney-grove; he appeared to be the person the people were pursuing; I followed and saw him hide a yellow silk handkerchief under a post in a dust hole - Mr. Pilgrin was not then pursuing him; I saw him taken the same day - I told the officer I had seen the prisoner hide the handkerchief, and saw the officer take it from the dust-hole; I saw Mr. Pilgrin afterwards; the handkerchief was shewn to him and he claimed it as his property, in the presence of the prisoner, who said he had not seen it nor had it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody. Corbett accused him of having hid the handkerchief, and shewed me where it was; a woman said, in his presence that she saw him pick the gentleman's pocket - Mr. Stephen Pilgrin claimed it. The prosecutor is now dead.</p>

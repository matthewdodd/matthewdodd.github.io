I had two half-crowns, and seven shillings. He said if I would go to a house with him, he would give me 2 s. 6 d.; he gave me 18 d. I had it all tied up in the corner of my handkerchief, which was in my hand. I was about an hour and a half in his company.

            . I am a watchman of Princes-street, Soho. On Saturday morning, the 26th of April, about half-past two o'clock, I heard a cry of Stop thief! from a female voice, and saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutrix pursuing him - I stopped him. Nobody else was running. She charged him with robbing her of a handkerchief, and 14 s. or 15 s.; he denied it. On the way to the watch-house, he produced a handkerchief, and asked Pryor if it was her's; she said, Yes - he said it was not, and he would make her take her oath of it, for it was his. I attempted to take it from him, but he kept it in his hand. In Titchbourne-street he threw it down, saying, if it was hers to take it - I took it up, and found two half-crowns, and 8 s. 6 d. in it - there was the letter B on the handkerchief. He did not claim it after throwing it down.</p>

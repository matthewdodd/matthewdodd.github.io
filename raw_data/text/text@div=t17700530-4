I was gone to a neighbour's house to drink a dish of tea, on Sunday the 4th of March; one of my lodgers came and told me my house was broke open, between seven and eight in the evening, very near eight; I was not farther from home than cross the court. I went, and found the door broke open, and the drawers were broke, and the things in the indictment (mentioning them) were taken away. All was fast when I went out, and I had the key in my pocket; they left a candle alight in the house.</p>

            . I am a constable; I had a search-warrant from Mr. Girdler to search Little's house. I found this handkerchief there in Keeling's name, on the fifth of March, for half a crown. The Justice ordered Keeling to be brought before him again. When he came, he desired to be admitted an evidence, and said, he would impeach fourteen. The Justice told him, he would not admit him, he would punish him; then he was sent back again.</p>

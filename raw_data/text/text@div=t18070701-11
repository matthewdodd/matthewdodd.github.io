At eight o'clock in the evening of the 15th I saw them safe.</p>
               <p>Q. On account of this discovery, how much of your property did you miss. - A. I could not tell that morning, they had pulled the pieces about in every place. When I came to calculate I found there were fifty pieces missing; I had four or five hundred pieces. The fifty pieces that I missed were all shawls, or for shawls; some of them were white, but they were chiefly printed. I knew that the quantity of goods that I had been robbed of must have been taken away in a cart. I sent my workmen about the neighbourhood to make enquiries, and on the evening of the 16th I saw part of my goods at Worship-street. I saw six seven quarter-shawls, and a single six-quarter square of muslin, that I know to be mine by the pattern, and one piece that had not been printed; twelve yards with the excise officers marks tore off; it was brought with it to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any other part of the goods that have been missing. - A. Not any.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. In consequence of the prosecutor applying to our office that he had been robbed, we went in search of a cart, upon which name, number, and the street were inserted. I found that cart in Castle-street, Bethnall Green, at one Mrs. Bovine's; from information that we received there, we went to Mrs. Sidebotham's, No. 3, New-street, St. Andrew's-hill; I found her there, she said it was her house. The front door of the house was open, I asked a girl that was there if Mrs. Sidebotham was at home, she said yes; I found Mrs. Sidebotham in the back parlour, which is made a bed room; the door was locked; I went into the back yard, leaving Mr. Clark the marshalman, and Mr. Nicholls at that door; the back window sash was up, the curtains were down; I moved the curtains and searched the bed furniture; I observed Mrs. Sidebottham dressing herself; in about three or four minutes she had put on her clothes; she then opened the room door; the moment she came out, I asked her if she had got any man in the house, a girl that was standing by said she did not know; she seemed to be very much flurried; I then immediately says to Mrs. Sidebotham, have you got any man or men in your room, she said yes; there was one, that was the prisoner at the bar; the was then laying upon the boards under the bed, dressed in his boots and every thing. I asked Mrs. Sidebotham if she had any bundle left at her house by any person that day; she said she had, and it was left by the prisoner Harman.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present. - A. He was not then; she opened her drawer, it was taken out in the presence of Mr. Clark; that was in the front room. She unlocked the drawer and took them out, and produced two or three shawls, which Clark has got in his possession. I had secured the prisoner Harman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Harman when she shewed this. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010011"></xptr> We had put him in the coach just by the door; immediately I received information where the prisoner's lodgings was; I went to No. 2, Ireland-yard, at the bottom of St. Andrew's-hill, I found the door locked on the ground floor; I went to Harman, and asked him for the key of his door; I told him where I had been, he delivered this key to me and it opened the door; there I found six pistols, three of them were loaded; there is an hanger; this is a center bit, this center bit will make a hole big enough for any man to put his arm through to unlock any door or draw a bolt; I found two dark lanthorns, about an hundred keys, a phorsphorus bottle; there were several matches laying in the room. I found three crows, they are of different sizes, and a black bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any goods that were stolen in that house. - A. No; all the goods that were found was in Mrs. Sidebotham's house. I went down to Waltham-Abbey, I took these crows and the keys with me; I tried that pick-lock to the shop door where these good were taken from; I opened the lock with this key. I found a mark of this iron crow where they had attempted to break open a place, nearly adjoining to where the goods were taken from; there seemed to be two or three marks where they had tried to wrench the door open.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of information, did you go to Mrs. Sidebotham's with Ray and Clark. - A. I did. The prisoner Harman was brought to me and I took care of him in the coach at the bottom of Creed-lane, with Mrs. Bovine and a man of the name of Welch, whom I had brought from Bethnal-green; I was waiting at the bottom of Creed-lane close to New-street, where they lived Ray brought the prisoner Harman to the coach to me, bid me to take care of him, and delivered him into my custody. I sat with Welch on the fore part of the coach, and Bovine and Harman sat on the hind part of the coach. After Ray had left Harman with me, he went away; in a few minutes he returned back again; he says to Harman, have you got the key of No. 2, Ireland-yard; he said he did not know. Ray said, search him Mason; then he pulled out the key and delivered it. Shortly after that Ray brought the pistols, and these things, and put them into the coach. While Ray was absent I saw something in Harman's hand, which he wanted to conceal under his thigh; after he got out of the coach I found it was two stripes of fag ends of muslin; I produce them; I have kept them ever since. At the public house at the office, he said these thing were his; that was on the Monday following him and Mrs. Sidebotham were together at the public house; she said that he brought them there, and desired her to take care of them. He did not contradict it.</p>

            , I live at No. 13, Ireland-yard. On the 16th of May, a little before eight o'clock in the morning, I saw Mrs. Sidebotham and Mr. Harman in her front parlour. No. 2, Ireland-yard; that is the room that Harman lives in, and two other men with him; they were looking over pieces of linen or cotton, there appeared to be a great many; I saw them empty them some from a black bag, such a one as I saw in the officer's hands. Harman and another man was engaged in holding up the pieces. Mrs. Sidebotham and the other men was looking on. Mrs. Sidebotham turned round and observed that I was looking at them; she said something which caused them so move the goods to the furthest part of the parlour; they moved them from my sight; my window was directly opposite to their parlour. I saw Harman go in and out repeatedly that morning. About a quarter before two in the afternoon I saw the goods removed; I saw Harman and one of the other men that were with him in the parlour.</p>

Yes, I have frequently seen him come in and out of that parlour; I saw Mr. Harman come to the street door and look at each way before he came out; he had done so frequently that morning. The other man stood behind him at the parlour door with a large parcel on his shoulder, wrapped in a green baize, and skewered up. Harman went into the parlour and pulled off a pair of old drawers; he took a pair of small pistols, something like these now produced; he put one into each pocket. He then said to the man with the parcel, it is clear, now, now come; the man came out first, and Harman followed him. In the evening I told the officers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You was not examined before the magistrate. - A. I was; I then gave the same account as I gave now.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you. - A. I am a married woman, my husband is a lamp lighther.</p>
               <p>Q. You were upon very good terms with Mrs. Sidebotham. - A. I never associated with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not owe her any money. - A. No more than you do; that I will swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you will swear that, according to the law, that you did not owe her any money, but your husband might. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was some money due from your husband to her; although unjustly, I dare say. - A. Yes, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010012"></xptr> claim there was; I had paid the money that she called for before to a man that she lived with, on the same day, I borrowed it; and I paid it again into a court of justice.</p>
               <p>Court. How much was it. - A. One pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And therefore I dare say you owed her a great deal of good will. - A. I owed her no good will.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Harman left his defence to his counsel, and called no witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Sidebotham's Defence. Please your worship, I never saw any thing of this gentleman's but the handkerchief; he asked me to let him leave it with me; when the officers asked me if any left a parcel with me, I told him there was this small parcel.</p>
               <p>Sidebotham called seven witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

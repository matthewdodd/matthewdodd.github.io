On the 26th of December, about three o'clock in the morning, two men came in and called for three pints of beer: before the boy could get down into the cellar, one of the men said, I am surprized to see you so dilatory, to be up yourself and have your cellar window open, than opens in the street: immediately the boy, in the cellar called out Aunt! Aunt ! here is a thief in the cellar. I ran down, saw the prisoner at the bar, with a silver tankard in his hand; he put his hand over a butt, dropt the tankard, and it broke a powdering pan. I took hold of him, and asked him what business he had there! The watchman came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that window fast do you know before?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. I am sure it was, there was a plate broke from the kirb.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a window was it?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. It is a standing door and a slap under it, and stairs to go down; I had just put two tankards on a butt-head before, one of which he had.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he let fall this tankard behind the butt he took it from?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. No, my Lord, it was two butts distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have fallen there by rowling from the place where it stood?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. No, it could not, without the butt had fell. (She produced two tankards, and deposed it was one of them, but she could not tell which.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be up at that time?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. Our house is an ale-house and watchhouse too, there is one room for the constable to sit in.</p>

I was with my brother; he said his watch was gone; he went from me immediately, calling Stop thief! two person's were standing close by us at that moment; he said he had lost his watch, and I seized him; they were quite near enough to do it; and nobody else could have done it; they were on his right side; they tried to get away, and dragged me about fifty yards, struggling to get away from me. I did not observe their countenances; one got from me, I delivered the other at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030022"></xptr>the watch-house.

I ran up to the mob, and saw a gentleman holding Black, and saw Black throw the watch down. As I picked it up, he got away from the gentleman; he struck me and shoved me down, and ran down an alley, and I after him, crying Stop thief! I never lost sight of him; I saw him secured; he picked the watch up once, and threw it down again. I picked it up the second time, and gave it to the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live in Hackney road. I was coming home, and overtook the prosecutor and his brother arm in arm, I walked behind them till we came to Crabtree-row. I saw a kind of sham fight in the road, and heard the prosecutor call out</p>
               <p>"My watch is gone, Stop thief!" I saw the prisoner's hat fall off; I was carrying some wine; I saw the prosecutor and his brother run up Crabtree-row; I gave the wine to my wife, and saw the prisoners turn up a court leading into Somerset-buildings; I went to the end of the court and heard a noise, and saw Black come out. Parker, who is not here, seized him. I saw Black throw a watch away, which went against Paissey's thigh: he picked it up. Black was immediately secured; I went to the watch-house with him; Mr. Hatfield brought in the other. Black denied throwing the watch away.</p>

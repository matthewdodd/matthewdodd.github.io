               <p>Prosecutor. I had leave of the Magistrate to ship the wheel, because the ship was sailing; there was the wheel, coggs, wrench, and turnscrew.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoners say any thing how they came by it? - They said they picked the boat up adrift with the case in it, which I cannot disprove: the mark of the case, W. V. J. I saw the wheel on the wharf the 9th of February; our waterman carried it down on board the ship.</p>

               <p>Watson. I went and told the mate I had goods for the ship; he said he could not take out the goods that day; the name of the ship was the Generous Planter; I had two small parcels, which I thought were moveable, I locked them up; there was no one single article which any one man, or even two, could move; I told my master what I had done; I left this case and another on board the lighter; my master asked me if it was necessary to watch the lighter; I told him I thought not, and I left it without any body to watch it during the course of the night, for I could not move it myself; the next morning I went down to get the things out; the first thing I missed was these two cases; I asked the mate, he said he hoisted out one, and no more; to be satisfied of it, I went on board the ship, and enquired, and there I found the master, and I described the case at the Custom-house before I saw it, and it was the same I missed from the lighter.</p>
               <p>Court to Walker. When you saw these three men in that boat with the case, and they put it into your boat, what became of the men? - They gave me no account of themselves, and they had but one paddle in the boat, which I knew was not fit to smuggle with, and I took them as disorderly people; I called for help, and they were taken to Gun-dock, Wapping; I am sure these are the three men.</p>

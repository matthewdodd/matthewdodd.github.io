                  </hi>.—I am the wife of Charles John Aistrop, who keeps the King's Arms public-house, Gray's Inn-lane, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On Friday evening, the 26th of June, I had been out, and when I came home I desired my niece to take my bonnet and shawl up stairs—I went up to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock that night—my bed-room is on the second floor, over the parlour—it was not locked—the room under mine is used as a parlour for the customers—when I got up I found my bonnet on the drawer, but no shawl there—I did not particularly look any further that night, but next morning I looked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184008170172"></xptr>
               <p>about more particularly, and missed from the drawers a pin-cushion, the shawl, and a garnet and pearl brooch, with one stone out—I looked into a large chest, which I do not often go to, and missed a large green silk dress, and cape, and a white crape shawl, and out of the drawer a pair of kerseymere small clothes, a waistcoat and two silk handkerchiefs—one shawl is worth three guineas—the value of all the articles is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least—I gave information, and was shown some of the articles on the following Monday—I had seen the male prisoner several times at our house—he used to come two or three times a week—I saw him there that evening, about half-past seven o'clock, and a female with him—I saw him go out of the house about ten o'clock—there was a female waiting up stairs in the parlour for him—I passed the parlour as I went up stairs, and could see the female in it, but could not identify her.</p>

On the 5th of January I was on my heat, and heard an alarm of Stop thief! about half-past nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner running - I stopped him; the witness, who was running after him, said he had snatched two bundles out of her lap; I found nothing on him - her brother picked up one bundle, and brought it forwards afterwards; one was a frock; and the other a shawl - the prisoner said nothing.</p>

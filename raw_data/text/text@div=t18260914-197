On Wednesday night, the 9th of August, I saw Lippard at the public-house where I live- I agreed to go home with her, but I did not go - I walked about the road; I told her I had no money, but if she would come down on the Saturday night I would pay her, as I worked at the gas works - this she agreed to - she went into a cook's shop, and had two penny worth of pudding, for which she paid - I dropped asleep there, and when I awoke she was gone, and I missed my watch. I was sober, and am quite certain I did not give it to her - I intended to have gone home with her.</p>

            . I am conductor of the patrol. On the morning of the 10th of August, about two o'clock, I heard the cry on the opposite side of the way - I got up and saw the watchman holding Lippard - he said to me"Gooding, she has dinged the watch to one of these men;" meaning Longman and another; I laid hold of Longman, and saw the watch fall, which Furlong took up - Longman owned it at the watch-house, and said he gave 24s. for it; Lippard told me to go down to the public-house in Kingsland-road, and ask the hostler for the young man who he called his brother, as he was the person she had it of - Longman was very much in liquor, and got fighting- Lippard was with another person in a door way.</p>

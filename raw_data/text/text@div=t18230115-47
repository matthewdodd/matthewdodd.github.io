One Tuesday in January, I received a message from Mr. Conalghi; I went to him, and saw some of my prints - a man was there, who had offered them for sale. I went with him towards my house to find the person who sent him with them; I thought he was following me, but when I got to my door I found he was not. I immediately ran up to the public-house, and saw the prisoner run from there; I called out,</p>
               <p>"Thomas, stop," and the moment he heard my voice, he increased his speed; I called</p>
               <p>"Stop thief," and came up to him in Norris-street; somebody having stopped him, and he attempted to fall on his knees - I took him to the watch-house, where he was searched, and twenty-six duplicates found on him, by which I found part of my property in pawn. I missed a great deal of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150027"></xptr>property while he was with me, but had not missed these prints, as they were tied up and put in the back kitchen.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 27th of November, the prisoner pawned four books for 3 s.; I knew him before. He redeemed fifteen or sixteen prints on the day he was apprehended; they were similar to some produced, and were pawned in two pledges for ten and four shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. MOLTENO re-examined. He had left my service on the 27th of December, in consequence of coming home drunk. The prints are all mine; those pawned at Lawson's are worth two guineas I think.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into St. Alban's coffee-house - a young man asked me to drink with him; he said he was going to redeem some prints, and would pay me if I helped him to carry them - I was waiting in the tap-room for him, and hearing the cry of Stop thief! I ran out, and Mr. Molteno called out</p>
               <p>"Thomas." I went straight on to Norris-street, and was stopped. The duplicates were given me by the young man to take care of for him. I never pawned anything belonging to him. The books were given to me by Gray, the shopman.</p>

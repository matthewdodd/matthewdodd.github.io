It was parted in the middle. The door that shuts the kitchen from the back part of the house, one of the upper pannels had been cut to pieces, and taken out, in order to come at a bar on the inside.

I went to bed a little after eleven on the Monday night; every thing was safe then. There were only me, the house-maid, and a little girl in the house. I heard no disturbance all night. The house-maid went down about seven; she and I went down almost together: I went into the butler's pantry, and saw all the plate was gone. I found a pannel of the kitchen door cut, and the bar taken down, and the sash of that window shoved up: the bolt of the window was cut in two; the shutters shut to on the outside, and bolt within. The area gate was broke open. I found they went out at the street door. The butler's drawer was broke: there was the mark of a chissel in several places, in all the places that were broke. I found two chissels on the dresser in the kitchen. They had taken down the tinder-box: I found that and some matches upon a chair in the kitchen: there was no tinder in the box, so they could not get a light there. The house-keeper's room was broke open, and three locks broke in that room. The top of the bureau was broke, and all the writings upon the floor; they took a gold ring and a breast-buckle from thence.</p>

            . Ford, Crookall, and Miller, were with me in this robbery. On the Monday, before I went into Hyde-park, coming back by this house, I saw some plate in the window: Crookall said to me, There is a good deal of plate in that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250007"></xptr> house: then we fixed upon that house to come to in the night. At night we met all four of us, and set out from the Boot in Cross-lane about twelve o'clock; I there told the other two of it. I told them I was going to Grosvenor-square, to a house there, where was a good deal of plate: we found the iron gate locked. I had a chissel in my pocket, and one of them had another: I put in mine and wrenched the gate open. I then went down and got the farther window open, by putting the chissel under it; it gave way a little; then I put my fingers under it and got it open. I hoisted up the sash, and got in at the window. There was nobody with me: they were up at the top of the stairs. I went into the kitchen; there was a parrot cage. I called up to the window to give me a light. There was no fire in the grate. I found a tinder-box, but there was no tinder in it. I strove to strike on the brimstone matches, but could not get fire. Crookall brought me a light; he went to put it in under the shutters and the draught of air put the candle cut: he was about a quarter of an hour in bringing it. After that I waited a good while and nobody brought a light. I got out at the window, and found the bit of candle. I took it, and went and lighted it myself at a lamp, about fifty yards from the house. Then I went in, and up stairs with the candle, and opened the kitchen door; Crookhall went in with me. I had opened a little door out of the kitchen that came into the area: we could find nothing in the kitchen of any value. I tried the kitchen door and could not open it; then I took a knife from the dresser and cut a pannel out; there was a bar went cross the door that shot in with a spring; I put my hand in and felt something move. I shoved the spring on one side and the bar came out; then Crookhall and I went out of the kitchen into a room on the left hand, where was some china; then there was another bureau desk we broke open, out of which we took a breast-buckle and a ring: then we came back again. There was a little pantry like; I know not whether it was locked or not; Crookhall had got it open before I came to it; there was some silver, but I am not certain what. Then we went up stairs; going up we went into a parlour where were books: we could find nothing there, nor in the back parlour. Then we went up stairs, and found a place with empty drawers; there were some ivory things; we did not touch any thing there. Coming down, upon the kitchen stairs, there was a closet, and a window upon the top; Crookhall looked in and saw something shine; I put my back to it, and he shoved against me; and when the door opened I fell down: there was a small waiter upon the dresser, and another plate, I cannot say what: there was a small chest stood upon another chest: we took it off and put it on the ground, and opened the chest. I do not know whether we broke it open, or whether it was not locked. There was a great deal of plate in it; very large plate, butter-boats, sauce-boats, a large waiter, spoons, a punch ladle; the candlesticks stood in a little closet on the right hand: we broke open the cupboard and took all we found, and put them into a green cloth which Crookhall brought there: we carried them down and laid the parcel on the floor; the cloth would not hold it all; then I went and found a woman's gown hanging on a peg; I put the rest into that; then we came up stairs and opened the street door and went out; the other two prisoners were there; they asked what we had got; I said a good deal of plate; we were in the house about three quarters of an hour. We went to Piccadiily and got a coach, and told the man we were going to Tower-hill, and bid him make haste, fearing the waggons should be gone, as the things we had were to go out of town. We all four got into the coach, and got out on Tower-hill; then I went to Graham's at Salt-peter-bank, which is about half a mile from Tower-hill; I had had dealings with him before. Then Crookhall came after me and brought the plate; the others came; we all went in. The plate was carried up stairs. I went up; the other three staid below. There were a pair of scales brought and the plate was weighed; it weighed three hundred and thirty-three ounces. He gave us 3 s. 6 d. an ounce for it, it came to 60 l. he paid 54 l. and left 6 l. remaining. It was put upon a bed. I laid myself on a bed and fell asleep. I do not know how it was taken away. I staid there about an hour, or an hour and a half. The money was not paid till after I awaked: then I called them up and threw the money down upon the table; it came to 15 l. each: we have not received the other 6 l. yet. We all went away together.</p>

               <p>Kenney. I do, he lives on Saltpeter-bank. Six or seven weeks ago, between four and five in the morning, I saw Colby and Crookhall come there, (I lodged there then) I was up in a one pair of stairs room; they called me up, and asked me to let them light a candle. There was a bundle on Graham's bed, it would not go into a peck measure. Colby and Crookhall went up stairs. I was called up stairs. Graham's wife asked me if I would carry a basket for her; I said, Yes. I carried it into the Minories some where; she went with me; it was a fish-basket; she used to sell fish. It was near half a hundred weight. What was in the basket was tyed up in a coarse cloth. When I came back again I saw Miller; in carrying it my head went through the bottom of the basket. I was obliged to bear it on my shoulder. I heard some jingling in it like plate. Before I got to the house in the Minories somebody called, Morea! (I served a Man of that name, and have gone by that name ever since.) I imagine that was Graham that called me.</p>

               <p>A young man asked me if I would spend four-pence halfpenny; I was going home, it was late. Colby and Crookhall met me. Miller said, if I was locked out, I should lie along with him. They brought me into Grosvenor-square. He stopped to ease himself; I staid and talked with him; Colby and Crookhall went away, and I saw them no more.</p>

               <p>When I was first taken up, I was brought before Mr. Welch; these washer-women were there. Mr. Welch seeing me have a golden guinea, he said, if I would back Colby's evidence, he would make that one guinea ten, and the washer-women should say nothing about me, and I should have my liberty if I would come and give evidence next sessions; and if I would not back his evidence, he would send me to Newgate, and bind these people to prosecute me.

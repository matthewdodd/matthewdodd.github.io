                  </hi>. I am in the Artillery, at Woolwich. On Sunday, the 9th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in Woolwich—I went into a house with her—she sat me down on a seat, put her head through the window, and called in two girls—just as they came in she struck me between the shoulders with a poker, and knocked me down—the other girls got a broomstick, and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">laid on me</hi> with a poker, and a broomstick—she put her hand into my pocket, and took out my purse—this is it—there were two half-crowns and ten shillings in small silver in it—I was sober—I had only drunk a pint of beer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you knock me on the floor, and say you would have what you wanted, that you had only four pennyworth of copper, and you would give me half-a-crown next day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—none of that is true—I did not take a purse out of your bosom—the girls did not come to your assistance, but to assist you to abuse me.</p>

On this Sunday evening I heard a call, went to the house, and saw Davilen there—I saw the prisoner in sight of the door—I did not go into the house—she was given in charge—she gave me the purse, and said it belonged to one of the gunners of the Artillery, and not to the prosecutor.</p>

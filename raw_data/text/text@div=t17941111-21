               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you? - Near a year and three quarters. This was Alice Buller; on the sight of me she returned down the stairs again, and I called to her, and asked her what she wanted there? She told me that she wanted to speak to her sister; I answered her and said, that her sister had left my service two days before, and she had told her; I told her that she had got a place; she said she had got no place yet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had her sister left your place? - But two days. I asked her where she was? She said, she should see her that evening; I told her to tell her I wanted to speak to her; she said she would tell her. She went away; and when she was gone, I went down in my kitchen, as I usually sit there, having no servant; in about half an hour I was preparing myself to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might this be? - It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. On my preparing to go out, I had hung a watch on a little brass hook on the chimney mantle piece, in the kitchen; I look ed and saw my watch was gone; a little while after that, it might be about ten or fifteen minutes, I went to put on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110051"></xptr>my shoes (I had had nobody in the house the whole day, only a gentleman that lodges with me, and he was out the whole day) I went to look for my buckles, and they were gone; looking round I missed a couple of spoons; I communicated this to a friend, who advised me to apply to a magistrate. There was nothing found on them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after were they apprehended after you had missed the things? - They were apprehended, I believe a very little while afterwards; that day was the 19th that I missed these things.</p>

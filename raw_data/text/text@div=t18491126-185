                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PATRICK EDWARD DONELEY</hi>. I am clerk to Mr. John Ruck, who carries on business as John Ruck and Co., at Topping's Wharf, Tooley-street; he sells grease, lard, and butter; Butler and Finch were in his employ, as porters. In consequence of something we heard, two police<lb></lb>men were requested to watch the premises, on the morning of 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Dec.; I was also vigilant—on that morning I received a communication from one of the policemen, and I went to Wellington-street; I saw a cart there, which contained two barrels and three firkins—the prisoner Dipple was sitting in the cart—after a short time Merity came up the steps leading from my employer's premises to London-bridge; he got into the cart, and as he got in, Dipple spoke to him; directly he got in, the cart drove on—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and a constable who was with me got on the box of it; that was about fifty yards behind the cart—I observed Dipple point me out to Merity directly he got into the cart, and they drove on across the bridge—I then saw Dipple point out the policeman to Merity, and directly he saw the policeman on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he turned back, and drove over the bridge more rapidly than I could follow them—I followed as fast as I could, and the policeman followed in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; the cart went down Duke-street, where the front of our premises are—I took a short cut, and arrived at the back of the premises, just as the cart arrived—I saw Merity and Dipple jump out—Merity said to Dipple, "Look sharp!"—they wheeled two barrels out of the cart, and attempted to wheel them into the cellar; I prevented it, by seizing hold of Merity and Dipple, and the barrels remained on the pave<lb></lb>ment—Merity said, "Let me go, it is all right"—I said, "No, certainly not"—I kept hold of him, but was obliged to leave my hold of the othe—the policeman came up; Merity then endeavoured to get me off him—he said, "Let me go"—I said, "I will not"—he swung me round, and came over the cellar—he plunged into the cellar, and endeavoured to pull me in, but he did not—the policeman came up—Dipple had a barrel in his hand—the policeman took him—I went by another way into the cellar, and met Merity as he was rushing up; and he and I had another struggle in the cellar—Butler and Finch were taken immediately afterwards—one of the barrels was full of lard, and the other half full—one of the firkins contained butter, and the other two grease—the two firkins of grease had been paid for, but they were all in Mr. Ruck's possession—the other things were Mr. Ruck's—Merity said to Butler, "You know, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, you gave me these things to sell; I was to get a customer for them"—Butler replied, "I know nothing but what you paid for; I gave you a receipt for what you paid"</p>

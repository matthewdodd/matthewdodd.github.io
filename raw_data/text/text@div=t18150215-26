On the 1st of February, a little boy came into the house, I came out of the parlour into the shop, to serve the least prisoner with a pair of shoes, the other two prisoners staid at the door; one of them said to the other, go in, he is gone in, Farrell was the boy, that came in first, about three o'clock, in the afternoon. Farrell came into the shop, and asked me to fit him with a pair of shoes, the other two stood still at the door; one said to the other he is gone in, go in. They came in, the three prisoner's are the three boys that came in.

I sent for him, and he told me, she had not liv'd any where in Town, but if he was worth a thousand Pounds he would give that Security for her honesty; I told him, our Service required a trusty Servant; but as you are an honest Neighbour, I believe I may depend upon you; so upon his Character I took her. She had not lived with me above a Week, but I miss'd a pair of double Ruffles, which cost me 7 l. I desir'd Mr. Daffey to part with her, for I was sure she was a Pilferer; he said, we could not do without a Servant, and we must therefore watch her. I believe she had convey'd away most of the Goods mention'd in the Indictment before; she took away (for ought I know) Things to the value of 200 l.</p>

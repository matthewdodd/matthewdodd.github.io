I called Stop thief! and my brother went in pursuit. I said</p>

               <p>"That's him," pointing to Baker - who was running; three or four more were near him, crossing him, which prevented my brother's coming up to him - I pursued Baker, the others were behind me - I came up with him; Stone, the officer, gave him a blow on the neck - he was stopped by a man tripping him up. Jacobs came up and asked him where he had dinged it, Baker said, into the kennel. I saw Jacobs go to the kennel - I pulled him down, and took the watch out of the kennel and gave it to Stone; the other men were taller than, Jacobs - I cannot say if he was one of the four.</p>

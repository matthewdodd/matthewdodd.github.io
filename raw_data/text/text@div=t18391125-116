                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and lodge in Old Cock-lane, Beth<lb></lb>nal-green. On Tuesday, the 12th of November, I accompanied Draper to load some dung at a yard in Shoreditch—and after we had done that, I saw Bygram bring a sack of corn from some where—I cannot say where—he pitched it by the side of the cart—Draper asked me to lend a hand with it, and I did—it appeared to me to contain oats—I had my hand on the sack, and carried it into the art—it was put into the fore part of the cart, and Draper covered it over with a tarpaulin—I then went with the two pri<lb></lb>soners to a public-house, and we had a pot of beer—I there saw Draper give Bygram something, but I cannot tell what—before I saw Bygram, Draper told me he was going to take some comfor the horses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Wells. Bygram had charge of the corn in the stable—my master's sacks have his name on them—I missed one sack of corn from the stable on Tuesday, the 12th of November—on the Monday fifteen quarters had come in—on the Tuesday there ought to have been eleven, and there were but ten and a half—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther one of the sacks was missing—they were fifteen quarters of a particu<lb></lb>lar sort, and four of them went out—the horses were not feeding on that corn at all.</p>

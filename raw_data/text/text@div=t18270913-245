I put my hand down, and caught the watch; the chain and seals were broken from it - I pursued him behind the coaches, but I never lost sight of him - I caught hold of his coat, the flap tore off - I seized him again; he threw me down, and we both fell into the mud, but I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me give any thing to any body? A. No; I had taken rather too much wine; my watch was safe at the corner of St. James-street.</p>

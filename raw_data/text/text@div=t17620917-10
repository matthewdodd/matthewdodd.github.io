I went to enquire her character, and left her with my child, about twelve years old; I was absent about half an hour. I came home and told her, I had been prevented inquiring her character, by hearing of another person; but I would treat her with a dish of tea. During that time, I perceived some of my linen to hang below her petticoats; I took her into a back room and searched her, and found the things mentioned in the indictment, except the apron and handkerchief, under her petticoats [Mentioning them by name]. I sent for an officer, and gave him charge of her. She owned she had given the apron and handkerchief to another person in my absence, and said, if I would forgive her, she would help me to them again.</p>

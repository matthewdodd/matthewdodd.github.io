                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in John-street, Edgeware-road, in the parish of St. Marylebone—it is my dwelling-house. The prisoner was in my service, to work in the shop by me at ladies' shoe<lb></lb>making—he lived out of the house. On the 13th of August one of my watches was on a mantel-shelf, and one on a little recess within a yard of the other—the prisoner did not come to work till about eleven o'clock, though I was full of work—I complained about his being so late—he said he did not get up till ten o'clock, he was not in bed till four o'clock—he went on with work for about an hour—he got up and asked if I would lend him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he was going to dinner, and he thought a little walk would do him good—I said those boots that he was repairing most go in that evening—I saw him go away—he said he would not be long, h would be back presently—I went to see what time it was, and looked at both watches—it was seven minutes after twelve o'clock—I sat down, and was called to dinner, and it was then seven minutes after one—I re<lb></lb>marked the circumstance to my wife—I went to work again, and looked again at the watches—it was a quarter to three—soon after that the pri<lb></lb>soner came in, and sat down—a customer came in, and at that time I saw the prisoner get up, and go across the parlour, towards where the watches were—I concluded he was going to look at the watches, as he often did—he then came out with a little cup in his hand, and his coat held together—I asked my wife where he was gone, she said he asked her for the cup to get a little milk—after that I missed the watches—no other person could have taken them but him—they have not been found—the two were worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and the two guard-chains 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

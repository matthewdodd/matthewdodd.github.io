            . On Tuesday night the 2nd of February last, I was watchman in Southampton-street. At half past eight I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner run up Southampton-street, and the boy after him; the prisoner had a bundle under his arm; he got into Silver-street - leading into Bloomsbury-market. I ran after him; just as the prisoner got into Bloomsbury-market, I saw the prisoner throw the bundle away; he was stopped by the boy, just as he got into Bloomsbury-market; I laid hold of him, and the butcher's boy brought the bundle up and gave it to the young lad; I took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

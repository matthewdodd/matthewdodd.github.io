                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Bayford, near Hertford. I had a number of ewe sheep out at pasture, at Edmonton, on Mr. Tucker's land—I had turned them out about a fortnight before the 28th of January</p>

In consequence of information, I went to Mr. Tucker's, and from there to the field, where I found part of the sheep slaughtered—it was cut across the back and also in the throat—I took possession of the part I found in the field—I then traced the footsteps across four or five fields, within a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards of the prisoner's house—the marks were distinctly visible (I saw the prisoner's shoes afterwards, fixed in the marks, and they exactly corresponded in every respect) this was about four o'clock—the prisoner was not at home then—I waited till about dusk, and then went with White to the prisoner's house—I rapped at the door, and heard the prisoner run up stairs—he came to the up-stairs window and asked who was there—I said it was me, and asked him to come down, which he did, and let me in—I asked if he was aware who I was—he said, "Perfectly so"—I said I wanted to search his house, he was charged with felony—he said I might look—I took a candle, and was going up stairs—he said, "What do you want there?"—I said, "Mr. Tucker has had a sheep slaughtered in his field, and you are suspected as a party concerned"—he then caught hold of my back and pulled me down three or four stairs, saying I should not search there—he</p>

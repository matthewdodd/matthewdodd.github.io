               <p>Where was your master? - He was in the kitchen, fronting them, standing by the fire.</p>
               <p>Who was there besides? - I saw nobody else there; in my master's presence Steward gave me half a crown, and my master came down stairs, with a bag in his hand, and he spoke sharp to me, and asked me for a bit of string, I had none at hand, and I gave him my garter.</p>
               <p>Where was that bag put? - In a place in the parlour, which was called the plant.</p>

               <p>Was there any hinge to it? - No; I went up to the officers at Bow-street, and gave information.</p>

               <p>Did you ever know what was in it? - It was the same bag that was put in, I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Why do not you know where, into the Synagogue? - I saw my master put it in, I could not swear to the bag, I saw my master put a bag in, and I heard the plate rattle, I know it was the same bag.</p>
               <p>You was examined I believe by a learned friend of mine, that is not here present, and you admitted you had perjured yourself, over and over again; did not you give a different ac count before Sir Sampson? - No, Sir, I do not know I gave him a different account.</p>

               <p>What did you swear before Sir Sampson? - I said then what I say now, no further than about what happened at Kingston.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles.

On the Monday following they came again and brought 600 one quarter and 14 lb. my servant came and told me, so I ordered him to get it into the scale, and I would come and secure them; I sent for a headborough and took them into custody. At first they said one Johnson sent them, but afterwards they said they had it of one Barker's man, so I sent to one

            . On the 10th of this month the two prisoners and I agreed to go and steal some ropes to make money ; we were all waterman, so took a boat and went up into Lambeth Reach and cut away the best part of a cable on board a balast barge; then we went on board another balast barge and cut part of that cable away, we brought away one winch-line, that is what they turn to get the balast up, and several pieces of rope lying about the barge, which we carried to Mr. Blake on the Saturday, and sold them all for 6 s. 6 d. we went on sunday and shared the money and spent it; then we went to work to carry people by water at by-stairs . A fisherman's man came to us and shewed the two prisoners where to get Mr. Steager's ropes, so we went between one and two in the morning and broke down a board and took out the 600 lb. weight, then put it in the boat, and brought it to Mr. Blake's to sell, who stopped us on suspicion of stealing it ; then we were carried to a justice of peace and committed, and I was admitted an evidence.</p>

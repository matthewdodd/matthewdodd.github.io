On the 5th of March, in the morning, I found about a cwt. of lead cut from the gutter over the stable, and carried away; in consequence of which I and Roberts watched for them the next night, in the hayloft; about one o'clock in the morning I heard footsteps of more than one person coming into the yard, and go to the dust-bole, which could enable them to get on the stable. About three o'clock I heard some persons walking up the tiles, and cutting the lead in the gutter; in about five minutes we came out; I stood at the gate while Roberts went on the tiling after them - He called out; I ran to the wrong gate, so that one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010041"></xptr>them got away. I went to Roberts, who had secured Summer, and found 27lbs. of lead cut, and moved off the building on to the adjoining roof - A hat laid by it, which I have frequently seen the prisoner, Green, wear - He was brought back again in a few minutes, without a hat. I told him he had ran away without his hat - He asked me to give it to him, but I refused. We had taken Summer to the watch-house. I found a knife on the premises, with which the lead had been cut. 40lbs. more had been cut. but not moved. Green said the hat was his.</p>

I was on the watch, and heard some persons come on the premises; I afterwards came out and saw the two prisoners in the stable gutter I secured them on the adjoining wharf - I knew them before. I found the tiling taken up, and 27lbs. of lead cut away; the other parcel Green was in the act of cutting when we alarmed them. I told them if they did not stop I would shoot them, and called to them by their names; I knew them both well.

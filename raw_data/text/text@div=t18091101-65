            , I am a constable. On Wednesday night, the 25th of October, between eleven and twelve, near the top of Cornhill, I heard the prosecutor challenge the prisoner with picking his pocket. I went to his assistance, the prosecutor took from his left hand a dollar. I took the prisoner with the assistance of my brother officer to the Poultry Compter; we searched him and found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is no mark on this dollar, I took it of Mr. Lucas, the commodore of the river fencibles, I being a river fencible myself, it was a very bright one. I am certain I lost a dollar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you my Lord, I am a man that has three children, I work very hard to maintain them. I have work of my master's at home upwards of twenty pounds worth of property. I went out that evening to shew my wife and family the sight, I shewed them the India-house and the bank; and on my return I was stopped by this man. I had a hole in my pocket, I lost eight-pence worth of half-pence. I took the dollar out it was snatched out of my hand. A publican gave me two crown pieces, and seven shillings worth of half-pence in change.</p>
               <p>Q. To CUTLER. Did you search him. - A. Yes, we found no hole in his pockets.</p>

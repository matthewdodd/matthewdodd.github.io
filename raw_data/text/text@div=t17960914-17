On the 23d of July, after having been certain that we had lost a great quantity of rhubarb, we weighed our stock of rhubarb, that was open particularly; and in the afternoon about five o'clock, we found some had been taken; when our porters left their work, for we have another besides him, about half past seven o'clock, I saw them go into the public house, the Green Man, in the neighbourhood; I had sent for a constable, and went with my partner, Mr. Harrison, to the door, and gave charge of both the men; I saw the two men come out, and Fenner the constable had charge of them; they were coming from the public house towards our own house; Fenner and the prisoner went first, and I walked behind them; the other porter was with Mr. Harrison; I saw the prisoner put his hand to his right hand pocket, and then the constable perceiving it, put his hand upon Jones's hand, and I saw him take four of five pieces of rhubarb out of his pocket; that was within four or five doors of our house, and then he confessed he had taken it from us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you used any threats or made any promises to induce that confession? - A. Neither; he said, he had taken about five or six pounds of rhubarb, and not more; on the 16th of July we had taken stock very accurately, we found a deficiency then of 68lb. between the 1st of May and the 16th of July, which is a very large quantity, and which we could in no way account for.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How much had you in the house at that time? - A. Upwards of 200lb. suspecting we had been robbed we cut round holes with a knife; at first we thought of putting paper into the holes, but we thought the pilferer, whoever he was, would be aware of that; there are two or three pieces of these pieces that are so marked, we had marked them that very morning; Mr. Harrison and myself went to see him the next morning at the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I must ask you again, if you made use of either promises, or threats to him? - A. I did not; he then said, he had been in the habit of taking rhubarb from our house since April; that he was induced to do it by a man of the name of Bavington, who lived in Old-street-square; we found he told us truly; there was such a man there, and we searched his house, but found none; he told us that Bavington gave him 4s. a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of rhubarb a pound? - A. The rhubarb that was found upon him cost 9s. I believe, or 9s. 2d. it was not fine rhubarb; he said that Bavington way-laid him, and induced him to steal; the other porter is still in our service; we have no reason to suppose he was an accomplice.</p>
               <p>FENNER sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, street-keeper of Cheapside; I was applied to on Saturday the 23d of July by Ms. Horner, to apprehend the prisoner; I kept a lookout for the porters when they left work, and I took them between seven and eight in the evening, I and my brother officer; I took charge of the prisoner; as we were going from the Green Men to Mr. Horner's, I observed the prisoner put his hand into his right hand coat pocket; I immediately seized his wrist, and took it out of the pocket; I put my hand into it and pulled out some pieces of rhubarb; in going to the Compter with him I wished my brother officer to go before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140076"></xptr>Lord-Mayor for me on Monday, because I was obliged to go to Guildhall assizes; the rhubarb was not opened before my Lord-Mayor till I returned; my brother officer kept it fastened up, (produces four pieces of rhubarb, they are deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in London sixteen years, and never did any thing of the kind before; I have a large family, and beg for mercy.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Does not the rhubarb lose considerably in its weight by dryness? - A. No, rather the contrary; we never found a deficiency before in taking stock, but rather the reverse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long had he lived with you? - A. Between four and five years; during that time I entertained a good opinion of him.</p>

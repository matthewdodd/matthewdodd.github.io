                  </hi>. I am an assistant-inspector of letter-carriers, at the Gene<lb></lb>ral Post-office. The prisoner has, I think, been in the Post-office about nine years—his delivery is in Palace-yard, Westminster. On the 10th of October, I enclosed a sovereign and a half-sovereign in a letter—Mr. Rus<lb></lb>sell, another assistant-inspector, was by at the time—I had marked the sovereign and half-sovereign on the 27th of September, and Mr. Russell at the same time marked them on the other side—we handed them from one to the other to mark them—I left them with Mr. Russell on the 10th of October—I had had them in my possession part of the interval—I looked at the sovereign before I enclosed it, and saw that it then bad on it the marks I had made—about half-past ten o'clock next morning, the 11th of October, I went to the house of Mr. Tucker, an upholsterer, in Great Col<lb></lb>lege-street, near Westminster Abbey—the prisoner had an assistant named Dowries, and Mr. Tucker's house is in Downes' delivery—in the regular coarse, all the letters would come first into the prisoner's hand, and he should distribute to Downes those belonging to his delivery—Mr. Russell went with me to Mr. Tucker's—the letter should have been delivered there about ten o'clock—I saw Mrs. Tucker, and inquired of her for a letter—she did not produce any letter to me—after going to Mr. Tucker's, I went to the neighbouring post-office, No. 2, Mil bank-street—the prisoner had been there to sign his card, showing the time he had finished his delivery—the prisoner had taken the card away with him—this is the card—it states that he had finished his delivery at ten minutes before ten, and is signed by the prisoner—about two hours after I went to the prisoner's lodging in Gibraltar-row, St. George's-fields—I went alone—I brought him with me from his lodging to the inspector's room at the Post-office—he was then asked if be remembered seeing a letter directed to Mr. Tucker, upholsterer, No. 20, College-street, Westminster—he said he had no re<lb></lb>collection of having seen such a letter—be was then told that such a letter was known to have been in his possession that morning, and it had not been delivered, and that it contained money—Tyrrell, the officer, was pre<lb></lb>sent, and searched him—he made no objection to being searched—a sovereign, a half-crown, and other silver were found on him—I examined the sovereign, and immediately saw it to be the same which I had enclosed in the letter the previous day—he was asked how he became possessed of the sovereign—he said he had had it some time, and had brought it from home with him that morning—this it the sovereign—I have no doubt about it.</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner, about eleven o'clock, on the 11th October, and found this sovereign, a half-crown, a shilling, three sixpences, and a fourpenny-piece in his trowsrs' pocket—I think he might have been asked whether he had any objection to be searched—he made no objection—I found two stamps in the lining of his hat, which appeared to have come off of letters—I asked him where he had got the sovereign from—he said he had had it some time, that he had brought it from home that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a president in the Post Office. On the 11th of October, the prisoner brought me a sovereign and some letters, stating that he had found, a sovereign among his letters—I do not recollect that be suggested any letter as the one out of which it had come—I ex<lb></lb>amined the letters—this is my writing on the back of this letter—I wrote it, at it struck me to be the most likely letter from which the sovereign had escaped—I was not aware that there were any <hi rend="italic">trap</hi> letters that morning—I do not recollect how many letters the prisoner brought to me, or whe<lb></lb>ther he drew my attention to this letter himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the sub-sorters in the Inland Office of the General Post Office. Between six and seven o'clock on the morning in question, as I was standing sorting, the prisoner touched me on the back and said, "Fred, look here"—I turned round—he had some letters in one hand, and a sovereign in the other—he said it bad dropped from one of those letters—I said, "Do you know which?"—he said, "No, I don't"—I said, "Look at them"—he immediately put the letters on his seat and looked over them, and I looked with him—he came to one with a blue stamp—this is the letter—he said, "I think this is it, here is the mark of the coin; this is the letter; I shall give it to Dowries to put the sovereign in his pocket, and he can deliver the letter"—I said, "Yon are not going to be such a fool as that, are you? supposing it should contain two sovereigns, and that one has dropped out before it was posted, or if it should be remaining in the bag, or dropped in the Inland Office"—a person named Hammond, who sat on his right-hand, advised him to do the same—I advised him to take it to Mr. Russell, which he did—I cannot positively say whether he put the sovereign into his pocket—I was in conversation with him on the subject, about five minutes before he went to Mr. Russell—I should not have observed what had occurred if he had not called my atten<lb></lb>tion to it.</p>

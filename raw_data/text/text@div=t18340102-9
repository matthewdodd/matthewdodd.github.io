               <p>GOODMAN SOLOMON. I live in Field-lane; I have an empty house next door to Davis; I employed the prisoner to repair it for me - he was there several days - he was there on the Friday morning, 20th - he came to me that day and said he wanted 1s. to buy his dinner, which I gave him, and said, "Will you go to work immediately?" he said, "I shall, you may depend upon it." I went about an hour afterwards to see how the work went on, and missed him - I did not see him till seven o'clock in the evening, when he was coming out of the public-house door on Saffron Hill; he was drunk - I asked him for the keys to shut up the house; he said, "Here they are, go about your business;" he was then talking to a man with a cab at the door; I went to the house and shut it up; I went into a room in the house, and found the attic window taken off and thrown down on the floor - it was very easy to get from there to Davis's house; I could see by the footsteps somebody had been on the tiles; I went to the prisoner afterwards, and asked him what business he had to take out that window, because he had broken the hinge, - he said, "Why to dry the room to be sure;" there was no occasion to take it out, and he was not to work in that room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The windows were taken out three weeks before. Witness. That window was in - one was taken out before, but not that.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Nicholls, a pawnbroker, living at No. 20, Gray's-Inn-Lane; I have brought here two silk handkerchiefs - I only took in one of them - I got that from James M'Carthy in the name of Sullivan; on Friday, the 20th of December, he pawned it, a shopman took in the other - he is not here; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>JAMES Mc CARTHY. I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live at No. 2, West-street, Spitalfields. On Friday the 20th, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in a beer-shop, on Saffron-hill - Powell came and asked if I would go and pawn a couple of handkerchiefs for him, and he would give me a trifle; he gave them to me - I asked where he got them from - he said, "What has that to do with you, so as I pay you?" so I went with them to Gray's-inn-lane, and pawned one at one place for 2s. - the other at another place for 2s. 6d. - I gave the money to the prisoner - he went with me and gave me something for doing it - I pawned four more for him the same day, three in St. Giles's - I can't say how many handkerchiefs he had - I went with him on the Friday night, about seven o'clock, to Monmouth-street, to a Jew, and sold twenty for a sovereign - he did not tell me where he got them - he said nothing about them that I heard - I was examined before the magistrate - oh yes, I remember, he told me he got them of Mr. Davis, and he said, "You have no occasion to say nothing" -"No," said I, "I won't:" and all the while I was in prison with him, he said, "If I said anything, he would say all he could to get me into a scrape myself - he said he got out at the window where he was at work, and got into Davis's and took them - he said, when he was before the magistrate, when we were both locked up, that he would endeavour to get me into the scrape.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH KING. I am a widow, and live in Newcourt, Saffron-hill. The prisoner lives in the next house to me - I came home on the evening of the 20th of December - he asked me to fetch a pot of beer, which I did, and had money from him to get some things out of pawn - he said,"Susan, will you take care of some money for me?" - he gave me 24s. in a piece of rag, that was on Friday night, and in about half an hour he fetched it back again.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner, and took him to the station-house, on Saturday the 21st., Davis was with me- I did not hear him say anything to Davis; at the station-house he said he was innocent of the crime, but as we went along, he said, If Davis would give him till to-morrow at eight o'clock, he would give him information where the property was - We had told him what we took him for - I was present at the prisoner's examination before the magistrate.</p>

             re-examined. I was present at the examination, and I know Mr. Laing's handwriting; this is Mr. Laing's hand-writing - I did not see him write it, it was read over to the prisoner - I heard what he said - he was called on to say what he had to say to the charge - I don't think he was told he need not say anything unless he chose - the clerk read over to him what was taken down in my presence, and the prisoner said, Mc Carthy was as much in it as he was - I heard him say this myself - he said, he had nothing further to say, except that Mc Carthy was as guilty as he was, I am sure he said so - I don't recollect his saying anything more - the magistrate asked him if he understood what was read over to him - he said, Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am quite innocent of the robber; Davis can give me a seventeen years character.</p>
               <p>DAVID DAVIS. He has been working about different premises of mine for about sixteen years in the neighbourhood - I never heard anything dishonest of him - I buy the handkerchiefs in lots, at about 32s. a dozen - we sell them at 36s. a dozen - they might not all have been taken at one time (looking at one of the two handkerchiefs) - there was two dozen of this sort, which is a misprinted handkerchief, and sold as a misprint - I saw this among five hundred, and I said this is one of the six dozen - the other one is mine -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020012"></xptr>there are eight handkerchiefs altogether - the pawnbrokers gave them up at the magistrate's, sooner than have any bother about them - they are all mine.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Have you had the whole of your property back again? A. I have had only about nine, the others have been disposed of, and the tickets thrown away; and he has sold one man twenty, and another sixteen, among people that I shall never get them back again.</p>

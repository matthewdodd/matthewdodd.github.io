            ; after being in bed some time the prisoner came to my room door and wakened me, I let him in, and he went through my room into the next room, which was his room; my brother came up stairs afterwards, and awakened me again, and asked me if my watch was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150084"></xptr> safe; I put my hand over my head, where I usually hung it, and my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of the night was that? - That was about half past twelve; I got out of bed, and went to search for my breeches, which were under the bolster, and they were gone; then I searched about the room, and went down and got a light; then I looked at my chest, and it was open, and all my things were gone, and we went down directly, and got two more men, and we saw the prisoner stand within less than twenty yards of my brother's house, which is at the neat-houses; I ran and caught hold of him, he was walking away when I came up to him; I told him you are my prisoner, you have robbed me; he seemed not to know any thing of it; we took him to the watch-house: the things were hid just by, under some weeds on the bank, and my pocket book was found upon him; the things have been ever since in my own possession, all but the pocket book, which is in the hands of Mr. Brown, the officer of the night; the fourteen shillings I never had, and I could not swear to money. (The things produced.) Here is the coat, waistcoat, and breeches I had on, I am sure they were mine; here is my watch, with my name upon it: this coat was not taken out of the room, but taken out of the chest; the key of the chest was in my breeches pocket: here are two more coats which were in the bundle I found; this coat and a pair of breeches belonged to my younger brother, who is at home, and another coat and a pair of breeches were in my care: here are a nankeen and a linen waistcoat, mine; this coat I have on, and that coat were found also; and a silver hat buckle, and a silver sleeve button were in the pocket book that was found in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the value of these things that were your own property? - The watch twenty shillings; the coat, waistcoat, and breeches I have on ten shillings; the nankeen and linen waistcoats four shillings; the leather breeches five shillings, the neck handkerchief sixpence.</p>
               <p>When you took the prisoner to the watch-house, what did he say? - He still denied it: when he was searched there were fourteen shillings found in one pocket, without any other money; there were one shilling and three pence found in another pocket, and my pocket book.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the pocket book; - Sixpence; the silver hat buckle sixpence; the sleeve buttons sixpence.</p>

            . Then he came and knocked at the door again at half past one, and I made a great many words at his going out again; he never answered me a word, he came in and went up stairs; in the course of four or five minutes he came down again, and went out; I heard him, I did not see him; then I had a strong suspicion that something was not right; then I went and called my brother, and asked him if he had lost his watch, and he put his hand over his head, and said his watch was gone, and his breeches and money; then we went out, and after a little time we saw the prisoner stand at a distance of twenty yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>How long had he been out then? - But a very little while, about half an hour; he made no resistance, but denied every thing; and after we took him to the watch-house, and found the pocket book on him, we went back and looked for the rest of the things, and we found them within five yards of the place where we saw him stand.</p>
               <p>How were they concealed? - They were under a burdock; and there was some dirt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150085"></xptr> or stuff put over the watch in the neck handkerchief, and the corner hung out, or else we should not have found the watch.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that your pocket book? - Yes, here is the buckle and button which were in the book when I lost it, without any paper round them.</p>

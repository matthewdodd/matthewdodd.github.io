            . I am a carpenter, and work for Mr. Hewitt, of Bethnal-green. I was in Chiswell-street, between five and six o'clock, and heard the cry; I saw the prisoner trying to make off, and seized him about two yards from Collins, who was rising from the ground. I saw the watch drop from his left hand. Several persons ran away when I took him; he said nothing, but hallooed and called for assistance.</p>

On the morning of the 28th of October, we were both on duty in the Inland-office—it was part of our duty to stamp and prepare the letters from the receiving-houses—I was taking letters away from behind the stampers, for the purpose of being sorted—the prisoner was stamping the date stamp—about the close of the stamp<lb></lb>ing, I perceived a few letters lying beside the prisoner on the table he was stamping at—I observed that one of them contained some coin, or something very heavy, and, very singular, there was a pin at the back of it—I took the letters up in my hand—the prisoner stopped me, and said, "Stop, they are not obliterated," that is, the Queen's head was not destroyed—there was no Queen's head on the letter with the pin in it—I laid them down again, and in consequence of the prisoner's manner, I kept my eye fixed on him—I saw him take up this letter along with the others—he went over to another table, for the purpose of obliterating them as I thought—it was not his duty to do so that morning—he came back with the same letters in his hand, and went behind a table where there is a writing-slope—I there saw him shuffling them in his hand for a little bit—he then came round, and put them down on another table along with some others that were done—thinking there was something wrong, I looked over the letters—they were all spread out with their faces towards me—there was about 150 or 200—I ran them over with my hand, and looked at the backs; and could not find the letter with the pin to it—it was not there—I then took the whole of the letters down to the sorters, which was a little way down the office—the prisoner was standing talking to one of the other messengers at the time, about five or six yards off, but not out of my sight—I came towards him again, and he said to me he thought it was time to go into the railway department, which is at the further end of the Inland-office—it is not exactly the same room, it is a place parted off at the further end, and there is a communication by arches, without opening a door—he and I walked down together into the railway department—he went to tie letters at the Stafford branch, and I at the Weedon, close by his side—Mr. Hodd, one of the clerks, came round to see the men do their duty—in consequence of my suspicion, I stepped on one side, and spoke to Mr. Hodd—we had some conversation, and I went to the Weedon branch again—the prisoner left the room very shortly—I followed him as far as the President's desk—I there met Mr. Hodd—he called the prisoner back, and said the President wanted to speak to him—I saw the President, Mr. Hodd, and the prisoner, go into a private room—I did not lose sight of the prisoner from the moment when</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Post<lb></lb>office—I was on duty in the Inland Office on the 28th of October. About nine o'clock in the morning Forbes made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went and spoke to Mr. Holgate, the president of that department, who came out of the office—the prisoner was not in my sight at the time I spoke to the president, but he was immediately after—I kept my eye on him till Tyrrell, the officer, came—in that interval he did not stoop to pick up any letter, or any thing of that kind—I called him and said, "Mence, the Pre<lb></lb>sident wishes to speak to you "—he made no answer—he appeared to be going from me—I called him back again, and told him not to leave, for Mr. Holgate would be back immediately—he waited then—Mr. Holgate came in in a minute and a-half or two minutes, and he and the prisoner then went into the president's room—Mr. Holgate said to him, "From in<lb></lb>formation I have received, I strongly suspect you have a letter which does not belong to you," or words to that effect—the prisoner made no answer to that that I heard—I was shutting the door at the time, and he might have said something without my hearing it—Tyrrell was in the room at the time—as soon as Tyrrell came in, or shortly afterwards, I observed him seize the prisoner by the wrist and struggle with him—he said, "Let go, Mence "—there was a considerable struggle between them for a minute or so—I saw he was getting the advantage of the officer, and assisted—I got hold of his other hand, and in the struggle Tyrrell took the letter from him, containing one penny-piece—the letter bears the Inland Office stamp of that morning's date, which denotes it had been stamped that morning—Tyrrell afterwards said to him that he had no occasion to answer any question un<lb></lb>less he thought proper, as it would, perhaps, be eventually brought against him, and then asked him where he got the letter from—he waited some little time, and then said he picked it up just before Mr. Hodd called him—he had a blouze on that morning, with pockets outside.</p>

             Jones, you have been convicted of an offence so peculiarly aggravated, that if it came within any of the descriptions which the law has made punishable with death, you certainly would have no mercy to expect from your sovereign. The taking away children from their parents, and afterwards stripping and robbing them, is so extremely dangerous to society, so destructive to domestic peace and happiness, so dreadful in its consequences to the unhappy infants, and so terrible in its nature to the unfortunate parents, who by that means very frequently irrecoverably lose their children, in a way much worse than death, that it deserves to be punished in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180026"></xptr>severest manner. If but a single infant can be saved by the terror of your example, and the punishment you are to undergo, (which will not be much better than that of death) the Court will be happy in discharging its duty. Under these circumstances, the sentence of the Court is, that you, and each of you, be</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Have you not advised Mrs. Watkins several times to apply to the Civil Power, in consequence of the outrageous conduct of him towards his wife and family? - A. I never did.</p>

I should not have troubled your Lordship with any observations, if I had been brought to this bar by a man whose character was even commonly decent; he is a man notoriously disaffected to his King and Country; he is a man who has been guilty of murder in his own family; and if I had not more mercy for him than he has for me, I could have proved it out of the mouth of his wife and daughter. -</p>
               <p>Court. I am sorry to interrupt you or any other man in the course of his defence, but the rules of justice must be observed; it does not become the Court to hear circumstances stated so irrelevant.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Then I shall not trouble your Lordship with any further observations.</p>

                  </hi> I am lighterman, and job for my uncle, John Riley, of Lower Thames-street. On Tuesday evening, 24th April, between nine and ten o'clock, I was on Nicholson's Wharf <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi>, which is a pier projecting from the wharf, and saw M'Clarens and Midcjleton there—I first saw them <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> away in a boat from Cox's Quay, which is the second wharf above Nicholson's, nearer the bridge—I watched them, and saw them <hi rend="italic">drop</hi> alongside Mr. Riley's punt, the <hi rend="italic">Oak</hi>, which was afloat off Nicholson's Wharf, and had sugar in it—they made fast their boat to the <hi rend="italic">Oak</hi>, got out of it on to the <hi rend="italic">Oak</hi>, and walked over her to another barge which was lying alongside of her—they got out of her into a French vessel, which was lying along the wharf, and stopped there several minutes, while the Thames police-galley was passing</p>

               <p>along—I saw no more of them that night—next morning, on coming to Legal Quay, I saw my uncle, and, in consequence of what took place between us, we went to find Draddy's house out; it is in Rosemary-lane—I saw a cart coming down Rosemary-lane with three bags of sugar in it—I saw the bags that were left in the punt next day, and they were like those in the cart—after I left the cart I met the police and my uncle in the lane, went to Draddy's house, and saw him in the shop; it is a greengrocer's and chandler's—they sell everything, I believe—I said to Draddy, "I wish to speak to you"—he said, "Oh, it is all right, the police have been here"—I said, "Have they?"—he said, "You had better come again by-and-by, I can't talk to you now"—I then returned to a house in the lane, where my uncle and the police were—that was between one and two o'clock—I went again to Draddy between seven and eight in the evening, and asked him if I might step backwards—he said, "Stop a minute," and went and said something to his wife, which I could not hear—he then said, "Yes, you may step backwards"—I walked into the parlour, saw Mrs. Draddy sitting there, and I said <hi rend="italic">to</hi> her, "You have had a curious <hi rend="italic">start</hi> to-day"—she said, "Yes, I have indeed"—I said, "I hear the police have been here?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "I came to let you know that the police had information"—she said, "Yes; but you were too late"—she said the police had been there and wanted to search the house, but she refused as they had not got a search-warrant; that one of the officers went into the cellar, but she did not mind that, because she knew there was nothing there—she said had they had a warrant she should not have known what to have done—I said, "Why, were the three bags here, then?"—she said, "Yes, they were all lying together," and her and her daughter had had a rare job to wash the sugar away down the sink-hole—I said, "What did you do with the rush part of the bags?"—she said she burnt them—I asked what she did with the under part (there is a matted part underneath)—she said her daughter carried them out of the shop underneath her shawl, and she should not have known what to have done if it had not been for a good tub of water that was in the yard—she said there was sugar in the bags, at least I said to her, "Did you have the three bags of sugar here when the officers came in?" and she saidr "Yes"—she said she bought the sugar—she did not say what she gave for it, but said it was a great loss to her to have to lose between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to have to wash it away in that manner down the sink-hole—she did not mention who she got the sugar from—I said, "Why did you buy so much sugar of them?" and she said she would not again—there was a cask of sugar in the shop, and I saw some on the table which she was pounding up with a hammer; it was moist sugar, but in little lumps—she said that it was all that remained out of the three bags—she asked me to have a drop of gin, which I had in a little water, and mixed up some of the sugar with it—I then went away and called the officers—I saw the lug-boat on the Friday that I had seen M'Clarcns and Middleton in on the Tuesday night—it was then lying at the Tunnel-pier—I knew it again; there is not another boat like it oh the river.</p>

On Tuesday night, 24th April, I was on my stand in Ratcliff-highway, and about quarter-past eleven I was called by McClarens—I went with him, and he put three bags of sugar into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not see the sugar, but the bags were such as sugar is put into—we see a great many in our neighbourhood—Middleton was with him when they were put in—I went from the stand down to the river-side, at the first stairs below the Tunnel, and it was there that the bags were put in—they brought them up the stairs on their backs—they then told me to drive to Chamber's-street—M'Clarens went inside with the bags and Middleton rode outside with me—I stopped at the top of a court in Chamber's-street, which leads into Rose<lb></lb>mary-lane—one bag was taken out there, and carried down the court by M'Clarens and Middleton—they came back again in about a minute and a half, and we then went with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> into Rosemary-lane, which runs parallel with Chamber's-street—I stopped there at the other end of the same court—Draddy's house is at the corner of the Rosemary-lane end of that court—I saw him standing at his door—he came towards the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and said to the pri<lb></lb>soners, "Wait a moment"—M'Clarens said to Middleton, "He be b—dt let us get them out while the wind is good," and they then took the other two bags down the court—I do not know whether they went into his house or not—there is a door that opens from the court into his house—I was paid my fare—I saw Middleton return to Draddy's shop-door; M'Clarens was standing there at the time—I went away and left them at the shop-door.</p>

On Wednesday afternoon, 25th of April, I went to Draddy's house in Rosemary-lane, with inspector Jones—some words passed between him and Draddy which I did not hear, but I heard Draddy say he would not let us search the house without a warrant—Jones asked if he would allow us to search the cellar; he said, "Yes; but no<lb></lb>where else without a warrant"—after that we went away—I produce a sample of the sugar from the barge, and also some of the matting of the bags that were left.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames-police inspector</hi>) On Wednesday afternoon, 25th of April, I went to Draddy's house, between three and four o'clock—I measured the length of the court which leads from Chamber's-street into Rosemary-lane—it is about sixty or sixty-five yards—Draddy's shop-door is at the corner of the court, in Rosemary-lane—there are two other doors in the court leading to Draddy's house—three doors altogether—the first door in the court is about five yards from Rosemary-lane, and the second about the same distance; the front door is in the lane itself—I went into the shop and walked into the back-room where he was—I told him I wanted to speak to him, and walked up-stairs followed by him and his wife—I said to him, "Draddy, have you had any sugar offered to-day or last night?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you bought any?"—he said, "No, except a quarter of a cwt, I had of a Mr. Wood," and I think he said "yesterday"—his wife said, "It is not likely he would have bought any, for if he had he would not be as he now is (meaning that he was sober), for he would have bad a drop on the strength of it"—I then asked if he had any objection to allow me to search his house—his wife said, "Are you going to look for anything else besides sugar?"—I said, "No"—and she said, "You may look"—I then went over the upper part of the house, and on going down into the back parlour, where I had left inspector Jones, he said in their presence, "Why, they have been burning the sugar bags; see, here is some of it," and he produced a portion; I do not know where he took it from, he had it in his hand—I then looked in the grate, and found a portion of burnt sugar bags which I now produce, with some sugar still on it—I then went into a back wash-house adjoining that room, and I saw sugar spilled over the flooring, and the yard adjoining was very wet, as though it had been recently washed down—I then went into the room again and saw a large cask with about one and a half or two cwt. of sugar in it—it was dry sugar—I took a sample of it—there were three kinds of sugar in it, placed one on the top of the other—I asked Draddy if any of that sugar was what he had from Mr. Wood; he said, "No"—I then left—I went again between eight and nine the same night—I had had some information from the witness John Riley—I asked Draddy if he had any objection to show me the bill of parcels for the sugar he had had from Mr. Wood—he said, "No, certainly not," and he produced a bill of parcels—I then took another sample of sugar from the same cask, and near the cask I saw a brown paper bag containing sugar—I took a sample from that—I asked whether it was any portion of the sugar he had had from Mr. Wood—he said, "No"—I then asked where he had got the sugar from, and he said, "That is putting it too close"—his wife said, "We sometimes buy ten pounds of sugar or so of the labourers"—he told her to hold her tongue and not to say too much—I then went away—next day I went again, and told him I was not satisfied concerning the burnt sugar bags; that I must apprehend him for receiving three bags of sugar knowing them to be stolen—he said, "Where are they? ah! where are they?"—I afterwards went to Mr. Wood—I have been to the place with the witness Stokes; he showed me Draddy's house.</p>

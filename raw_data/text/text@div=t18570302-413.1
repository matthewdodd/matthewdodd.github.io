                  </hi>. I am at present a prisoner in Newgate, under sen<lb></lb>tence of transportation for life—I was convicted here a few Sessions since of the crime of forgery, with a person of the name of Hardwicke—I know Saward and Anderson—I became acquainted with Saward first—I was intro<lb></lb>duced to him by a person of the name of Saunders, a scalemaker and smith, in the Old-street road—it is now turned twelve months back since that introduction took place—it was in the year 1855—it is now about thirteen months back, I think—I had at that time in my possession three cancelled cheques, and two blank cheques—I received them from a person; I believe they came from a burglary—they were afterwards torn up—they were drawn on Barclay's bank by a person in Brick-lane, of the name of Doe, I think—I had some conversation with Saunders on the subject of those cheques, in consequence of which I appointed to meet him again, and did meet him again soon afterwards at his own house—Saward was present when I met him the second time—I had never seen Saward before—Saunders gave me the cheques that I had left with him, and then I showed them to Saward; Saunders said, "That is the person I mentioned to you"—Saward and I had some very trifling conversation inside; I came out with him from Saunders's, and he asked me then if I knew where they came from; I told him I believed they came from a burglary at a person's of the name of Doe, in Spitalfields; he said he should like to know where the person was, and who he was; and if I would go with him he should feel obliged—I went with him as far as Doe's place—before we went there Saward said that the two cheques that were not cancelled were to be filled up, to be forged—he said he had a man who he called his <hi rend="italic">sender</hi>, who would send them to the bank when they were filled up—Mr. Doe's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020062"></xptr>
               <p>premises are in Brick-lane, Spitalfields—on seeing the premises he said that it was a very small place; he did not think he should be able to get much money from them—I then left him—I gave the cheques to Saward—he took them all five—I had an appointment to meet him a short time afterwards, and he met me, and told me that he had them all ready on a certain day—on the day that we went to see Doe's premises I made an appointment to meet him another time, I met him, to the best of my belief, a little above Old—street road first, that was the time before, before the cheques were sent, and I then had an appointment to meet him in the New-road, Spitalfields, to the best of my belief, where he then introduced the two cheques that I had given him in blank, filled up—it was on the second occasion that be brought the cheques—I believe those (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the two cheques that were in blank, and which he brought to me on the second occasion that I met him—when he produced them he said he had filled them up, and he showed me the three that were cancelled, to compare with the two that he had filled up; he asked me if I thought they were a very good imitation—I said "Yes," to the best of my belief; I looked at them all—after I had examined and compared the three cancelled cheques with the other two, he said these were of no use, and we tore them up.</p>
               <p>(The two cheques were here ready they were dated 9th and 10th Jan., and were for 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and were signed J. B. Doe, jun.; payable at Barclay's)—after the other cheques had been destroyed I went into the neighbourhood of Leman-street, Whitechapel, with Saward; three other persons were with him—one of them was Anderson, whom he called his <hi rend="italic">sender</hi>, and two other persons not in custody—we then went into a house near Leman-street, where Anderson bad taken lodgings, and wrote a letter to some person—I did not go into the house—Anderson went in, no one else—he told me he had written a letter for a person to come—this was on the day that the cheque was sent to the bankers—the lodging was taken, and the letter was written <hi rend="italic">unbeknown</hi> to me—he told me that be bad done it before; it was not done that day—he did not say where he had written it to; he said he had written it to a man who advertises generally in the papers for a situation—whilst we were in Leman-street a young man came to the same house were the lodgings were taken—I do not know his name; I should know the young man—(<hi rend="italic">The witness Draper was here called in</hi>)—I believe that is the young man that came there that morning—when he came Anderson was to give him this cheque to go to the bankers; I was to follow him there to see whether the money was paid; I did so, and saw the money paid—it was the smallest cheque of the two, for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I saw him receive the money at Barclay's—when he had received the money he came straight down to Leman-street—I followed him back to the lodging—the arrangement made by Anderson was, that a man who went with me to know whether the money was paid, was to run back and tell him; Anderson would not be in the lodging at the time, be would come out after he had given the man the cheque, and he was to go back and tell him whether the money was paid—I sent a message through that man that the money was paid—when I got back to Leman-street I found Anderson in the house—the money was given to Anderson; I believe he brought it out with him—the young man then went away—I did not hear anything said to him by Anderson—I and Anderson then went to a public house in the neighbourhood of Spitalfields, and stopped some little time, and had a glass of something to drink; and from there we went to the Eastern Counties Railway, where he proposed to meet another person to take the other cheque—that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020063"></xptr>
               <p>was the same day—Saward was with us all day—when I returned on the cheque being paid, Saward was in Leman-street, not with Anderson, Anderson was inside, and Saward outside—we all joined, and went together to the Eastern Counties—the money was given to Saward by Anderson before we went to the Eastern Counties—the gold was shared, and the notes were given to Saward—there were five of us there; Anderson, Saward, and two other persons—one man they commonly called <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>; I do not know them by any other names—the notes were given to Saward—he said he would keep them until the other cheque was sent, to see if it was paid—we then went to the Eastern Counties Railway—I there saw another young man—I do not know his name—I should know him—(<hi rend="italic">Edward Brown was here called in</hi>)—that is the young man—Anderson spoke to him, took him into a sort of public house, and there gave him a cheque for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he was to take it to the bankers and get it cashed as the other man had done—at this time Saward was waiting outside, in the neighbourhood; I followed this young man to the banking house, as I had done the other—the cheque was paid, and I followed the young man back—at first he was going over London Bridge instead of going back to the Eastern Counties—I went and tapped him on the shoulder, and told him I thought he was going the, wrong way—he said that he was only going over to his master to inquire about his character; he did not mean anything dishonest—he turned round and came the right way, and gave the money to Anderson, right opposite Spital-square—I can hardly say whether it was in the street, or whether Anderson took him into a house; if it was in a house it was just round the corner—I think he did take him into a house, but I saw him give him the money—I saw Saward there; he was on the opposite side of the way—as Anderson was coming down one side Saward was coming down on the other—I had sent a message this time, the same as before, to say that it was all right—we then went into the neighbourhood of the Hackney-road—we went into a public house, and Saward took the notes to try and dispose of them for gold; to sell them; I mean the last notes as well as the first—he said he would go and try and sell them to a person that he knew—he mentioned a person of the name of Hall, to the best of my belief—I do not recollect Hall's Christian name being mentioned—Saward left us for that purpose, and took the notes with him—he was gone about an hour, or an hour and a quarter—when he came back he brought us so much gold for the notes—I believe the cost of them was about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—we then shared the money—it was put up in sixes—there were five of us there—I took a share for bringing the papers, and that I gave the person of the name of Saunders a part of, for the introduction—I had somewhere about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—I had two shares, because I had the papers—we then separated—Saward told me if I should ever have anything of that kind I was to let him know, and he said he would let me know—I gave him my address where I lived in Cottage-lane, and he said he would write to me, or I might always find him through Mr. Saunders—he did not give me his address at the time—I was then living in Cottage-lane—I went by the name of Hawkes—a female was living with me as my wife—her name is Eliza<lb></lb>beth Evans, I believe—I lived with her a little better than two years, I think—I have an aunt of the name of Elizabeth Haydon—she occa<lb></lb>sionally used to visit me at Cottage-lane—Saward came to me in Cottage-lane about two months after the transaction at Barclay's, I think, or it might be less; I cannot speak to the time—I saw him more than once there, I believe—I saw him twice in Cottage-lane—I</p>

               <p>remember the presentation of the cheque at Smith, Payne, and Smith's—he called at my place on that day—he said that he had some business on hand, and if I wished to join in, as I had done before, I could come; which I agreed to do—he showed me some cheques—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>) these are them—they are nine cancelled cheques—they are signed by a person of the name of Ash—he also showed me this one (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is a cheque for 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the same bankers, and in the same name of Ash—he said that was to be sent to the bankers, in the same way of business as the one to Barclay's—I compared this with the cancelled cheques, and said I thought it appeared very perfect—he did not tell me then how he had got these cheques, but I believe I heard afterwards how they were got; they were the produce of a burglary—he told me that there was a place taken in Oakley-crescent, City-road, I think—he said the same person as before was going to present this cheque; Anderson, the sender; and I was to follow the man to the bankers in the same way—he left the cancelled cheques at my place for me to take care of—I then met Anderson out in the road—Saward was with me—we all went to a public house in the neighbourhood of the City-road, and then Anderson dressed up for the occasion, as he used to do—he wore a wig; sometimes he would wear whiskers, and sometimes not—I did not go with him to Oakley<lb></lb>crescent—I was waiting in the neighbourhood—I saw a young man come there—(<hi rend="italic">The witness Humphreys was here called in</hi>)—I believe he looks something like the young man—he went to the lodging in Oakley-crescent, where Anderson was—he was sent at first on some errand to the railway at Camden Town—I waited in the neighbourhood until lie came back—Anderson went into the lodging before he returned—the young man then came out, and went in the direction of the City—I followed him—I saw him present the cheque at Smith, Payne, and Smith's—it was not paid—on that, I came back, and met the other persons, who were outside—I sent them on, and then I came on myself, and told them it was stopped—(<hi rend="italic">The cheque was here read, dated</hi> 21 <hi rend="italic">Feb.</hi>, 1856, for 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">drawn by Charles F. Ash, on Smith, Payne, and Smith</hi>)—at the time these nine cancelled cheques were deposited with me by Saward, I was in the front room of my house, in Cottage-lane—I then had the whole of that house—Elizabeth Evans came into the room whilst this was being done—a sheet of paper was left at the same time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I received it from Saward, at the same time—(<hi rend="italic">This was stated to be a sheet of blank cheques upon the North Western Bank of England</hi>)—they all continued in my custody for some time—Saward asked me to take care of them; they would come in very useful—I gave the cancelled cheques and this sheet of paper to Eliza<lb></lb>beth Evans, to take care of them for me; to put them where I might know where to find them at any time—they continued under her care until I was taken into custody—after this, Saward left a letter with my brother one evening, stating that I was to meet him—I did meet him—I believe he called at my place the next morning, and told me that he had received a book of cheques from a banker's at the corner of the Haymarket, which they had sent for, that they had taken some lodgings, and they wished me to go and follow the young man to the banker's, as I had done before, with some of the cheques out of that book; I agreed to that—I followed three young men, each with a separate cheque—one was sent from the neighbourhood of Park-street, Camden Town, and the other two from the neighbourhood of St. John's Wood-lodgings were taken for the purpose, in the same way as before—(<hi rend="italic">The witness Bowells was here called in</hi>)—I cannot say that that is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020065"></xptr>
               <p>the young man that went from Park-street—I have no doubt he is, but I cannot swear it; I cannot call his features to mind—soon after this, I saw Saward about a bill of exchange—I remember a lodging being taken in Cumberland-street, Hackney-road—Saward said that he had a bill ready filled up, which he wished to try upon the bankers, and I was to go with them and get a lodging—I met them against Shoreditch Church; Saward, Anderson, and another person—Anderson went and took a lodging in Cumberland-street—I waited in the neighbourhood—Saward did not show me the bill that day—he did the next day—I believe this to be the bill—(<hi rend="italic">This was a bill for</hi> 386<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated Jan.</hi> 15, 1856, <hi rend="italic">at three months, pay<lb></lb>able to W. F. Jennings and Co., addressed, "Samuel Dobree, 6, Tokenhouse-yard, London;" accepted at Hankers, for Samuel Dobree and Sons, Thomas Gray</hi>)—this bill was sent from Cumberland-street by Anderson—he was then dressed the same as he usually was, with a wig—I do not know whether he had false whiskers then or not—the young man was despatched from there with that bill—that is the young man (<hi rend="italic">looking at Wigzell</hi>)—I followed him to Hankey's bank, and saw him present the bill—it was not paid—upon that I went to a coffee house, in Shoreditch, where I found Saward and Anderson—I told them the bill was not paid, and we separated—I had seen something written on the back of the bill that day, in the coffee house, by Saward, before it was sent—the bill was detained, it did not come back—I do not know exactly what it was that Saward wrote; it was some little trifling thing—the date of the month was generally put to them on the day they were dated, making them due that day; otherwise, if they were dated before, I have heard him say they would not be payable at all, provided they were negligent as to the date—I believe he wrote nothing except the day of the month—In April last I went to the office of Mr. Turner, a solicitor, in Bed lion-square—that was in consequence of an arrangement made by Saward, myself, Anderson, and another person—Saward gave me an I O U, which I was to take to Mr. Turner, and give him instructions to write for payment, for the purpose of getting a cheque of Mr. Turner's, after the money was paid—I went to the office with the I O U, and instructed Mr. Turner, or his clerk, to proceed to recover the payment of that money—I described myself to Mr. Turner as Mr. Hunter—Saward suggested that name to me—he said, as the debt I applied for was under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I might give the name of Hunter; that Mr. Turner should write the letters "Hun," which would be half of the word "Hundred," and so get the cheque from him in order to forge others—Mr. Hesp was the name of the supposed debtor—I do not recollect the address; I know the place very well; it is in the neighbourhood of the New-road—Anderson took a lodging there, for the purpose of having the letters to Mr. Hesp addressed there—I advanced, I think, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money for the payment of this debt—my brother took it to Mr. Turner's—I gave it to him—a few days afterwards I called at Mr. Turner's, and his clerk paid me the money in cash—I saw Saward afterwards, and told him—he said, "We cannot help it; it must stand over till another time; we must try it again"—About this time I became acquainted with Hardwicke—Saward first mentioned Hard-wicke to me—he told me that he had an old friend of his that he had known many years; that he was going to meet him, and he would intro<lb></lb>duce me to him; that he had come from Australia, and had some business to do—I went with Saward and Anderson to Farringdon-market, and met Hardwicke—we went into a public house, and had a glass of something to drink, and some little conversation passed between us</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020066"></xptr>
               <p>about having some papers—we met again that same evening, at a house in the Southwark-bridge-road, Hardwicke, Saward, Anderson, and myself—we had something to drink, and we had something to eat that evening—they had no cooked victuals in the house—we asked the landlord whether he had anything cooked; he said, "No," but he would send out and get us something; he did so, and got some boiled beef ready cooked; in conse<lb></lb>quence of that we always called that house "The beef house"—we met several times afterwards at that house, Hardwicke being one of the party—on one occasion of our being there Hardwicke produced this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) with some others; all the other persons were present when he produced it; he had some blank forms that he had brought from Australia, and a for<lb></lb>gery was to be committed by copying this; the bill and the other papers were given to Saward; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the blank forms, this one was in blank—the whole of the papers were given to Saward—Saward afterwards told me that he had the bills ready to present at the bankers; we were then at the same house, the beef house—we were all present—he did not produce any that evening; he told me there were two bills, one for 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I believe the other was to be for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I saw nothing of them on that occasion—I saw the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on the morning it was pre<lb></lb>sented at the bank—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—(The 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bill was here read; it was dated Hobart Town, Feb.</hi> 16, 1856, <hi rend="italic">payable to the order of Mr. William Crosby and Co.</hi>, at Messrs.

Riley, at Heywood and Co.'s, with the following receipt written on it:</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Received per Heywood and Co. F. R. Riley.</hi>")—About this time I happened to be at a hatter's, in Bread-street, Cheapeide, with Hardwicke and Anderson—whilst we were there a young man came in to ask if they knew of a situation—(<hi rend="italic">the witness Clemence was here called in</hi>)—that is the young man—he was told that they did not know of one, and he went out—Hardwicke followed him out, and spoke to him—he came back and told us that the young man was out of a situation, and that he was a very likely man to suit Anderson to go to the bankers to take the bill that was to be presented—this was told to Saward—Saward was not there at that time, I believe we met in the even<lb></lb>ing at the beef house, as we called it; it was there arranged that a letter should be addressed to this young man, and I believe Hardwicke went to him, and left a letter at his house—an apartment was taken in a turning out of the Kingsland-road—Anderson there assumed the name of Riley—we met that morning at a public house in Old-street—road; afterwards we met in Inglefield-road—we got there rather early, I suppose about 9 o'clock in the morning—I believe the sign of the house was the Inglefield Arms, but I am not positive, I know it was some Arms—it is a largish house with a small bit of grass plot in front, and stabling, and coach house at the back—the rooms were not ready for customers, and a female came in to make some apology about the house being dirty, and not being cleared up—Hard<lb></lb>wicke produced a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at that house; pen and ink was brought by the servant I believe, or a female; Hardwicke gave it to Saward, and he wrote an address upon it—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is what Saward wrote, "R. Riley, No. 2, De Beauvoir-place, Kingsland-road"—that was the place where the lodgings were taken by Anderson in the name of Riley—Cle<lb></lb>mence was to go into the City to get the note cashed; it was a sort of trial, to see whether he was capable of going right for the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he was sent to get the note changed, and to bring two 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill stamps from the City—Clemence came there and was dispatched with the note—I saw him</p>

               <p>return, he brought the two stamps with him—Anderson sent Clemence out, I believe to go and get some refreshment, while he brought the stamps to Saward—we were still at the public house; Saward took one of the stamps and placed it on the back of the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and wrote the address across the stamp—the change for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was given to Anderson, and he gave it to Hardwicke, it was Hardwicke's note; the other 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp was given to me to take care of—I kept it, it was in my pocket book; this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—when the stamp was put on, and the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was ready, Ander<lb></lb>son took it from the public house—he was then dressed, and had his wig on—Clemence was sent with the bill—I followed him, I rode down on the same <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> with him to the City—Hardwicke and Saward also went in the neighbourhood of the banking house, not to the bank—Anderson was to wait at a public house in Bishopsgate churchyard, or passage, whilst the bill was being presented—Clemence went to Heywood's bank, I do not know whether it is in Lombard-street, it is on the same side of the way as the Mansion House, in King William-street, I think—I saw him go in with the bill—Saward was at that time waiting under the clock, right opposite, not the clock that sticks out, but the one under the archway, in King William-street, near the old Post-office—Hardwicke followed the young man into the banking house—soon after, Hardwicke came out and gave me a sort of signal, and I went in directly after him—I saw that the money was stopped; it had been paid to the young man by the appearance, but I could see by the finish of it that the money was being taken back—I then came out and went away with Saward and Hardwicke—I saw Saward outside in the passage—I went to him and told him that the money was not paid, and we all went to Anderson at the public house in Biahopsgate Churchyard, where he was supposed to be waiting till our return—we waited there some little time, and then separated—after this I employed Mr. Turner again, in the same way as before—I think T went there on the Monday as the bill foiled on the Saturday—we met at a public house, I believe in Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, to arrange the second applica<lb></lb>tion to Mr. Turner—Anderson, myself Saward, and Hardwicke were there, and another person who had the blanks, those that were written out, forged—an I O U was then written—I cannot call to my recollection now the name of the supposed debtor in that case, there have been so many different names—I believe Hart was the name—I went to Mr. Turner's and gave instructions in the same way; the debt was 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, I cannot tell exactly—a lodging was taken by Anderson for the supposed Mr. Hart, in the New-road, near St. Pancras Churc—a few days after the 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced by Hardwicke—he sent it to Mr. Turner by some person—a few days after it had been sent, I called at Mr. Turner's—I still kept the name of Hunter—they told me that the debt had been paid, but Mr. Turner was not within when I called in the morning—on calling again, I got a cheque, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the receipt I signed—(<hi rend="italic">The cheque teas dated, June</hi>, 24th, 1856, <hi rend="italic">on Gosling and Sharp</hi>, for 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">signed Alfred Turner. The receipt was of same date, and signed H. Hunter.</hi>")—Mr. Turner wrote me the cheque, and I brought it out and gave it to Saward—he took it away for a short time, and brought it back in about an hour and a half, to the public house in Duke-street—he did not produce any other cheque at that time; he said he would get the blank cheques from the person who had them; that was the person who was with him that morning, but he had not got them with him—I was told that those cheques were got out of Mr. Turner's pocket book by robbery—Saward</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020068"></xptr>
               <p>returned me the cheque that I had received from Mr. Turner; I took it to the banker's, and got the money; I received a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I gave it to Havdwicke, it was his money—About this time several letters were written to persons who advertised for situations; among them was one near Moruington-crescent—I saw the young man that came there—Anderson had taken a lodging there, I do not remember in what name just now; he was to meet him at the University Hotel, in Tottenham Court Road; I do not remember the day—I, and Anderson, and Saward, met together the first thing that morning, at a public house in the neighbourhood of the New-road, Hardwicke waiting in the neighbourhood of the banking house to see whether the young man came, because it was some distance—Saward produced a cheque—I believe this to be the one—(<hi rend="italic">This was a cheque for</hi> 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 28th June, 1856, <hi rend="italic">on Gosling and Sharp, signed Alfred Turner</hi>)—the cheque was given to Anderson, to give to the young man, to take to the bank—I was to watch the young man to the bank—I saw the young man leave the University Hotel, and go to the bank—I followed him—(<hi rend="italic">the witness Hardy was called in</hi>)—I believe that to be the young man—Hardwicke went inside the banking house whilst the young man was there; I did not go in—it had been arranged that if the young man came out, I was to follow him—I followed him back to Mornington-crescent; as he was going along, he was stopped by Anderson, and I saw him hand the money to Anderson; I did not hear what passed—we subsequently met at a public house near the Haymarket Theatre, I, Anderson, and Saward, and the other man that was with us; Hardwicke was not there—we waited some time for Hardwicke, but he did not come; we then went to a coffee house in the neighbourhood of the Blackfriars-road, I do not remember the sign; it was leading up the Elephant and Castle way, in the same road; Saward said he knew where he could find Hardwicke if he was at home, and he went and fetched him—eight 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were then produced, and some gold, the difference of the cheque for 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Hardwicke had the notes; he gave cash for them at the time; he gave 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the money was divided into five parts, for me, Saward, Anderson, Hardwicke, and the other person not in custody; he had a share because he found the three blank cheques; he had produced them, and given them to Saward; he had them from Mr. Turner; he picked his pocket, I believe; he was considered entitled to a fifth share—Hardwicke and I then went to Ham<lb></lb>burg with the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and got them changed there—In Aug. last I remember a transaction of the same kind at Hankey's bank; Hardwicke received a check from some one who I do not know, for a small amount of money; he showed it to Saward, Saward said that he had some blanks which would fit it—we met by appointment at the house in Bishopsgate-churchyard, where we had met before; I Saward, Hardwicke, and Anderson, attended that meeting; it was on a Saturday—Saward then produced some cheques (<hi rend="italic">looking at three cheques, one for</hi> 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">signed Daniel Baldwin</hi>)—these are what he produced—he said that Anderson was to take them, one of them which he gave him first, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the White Hart, in Bishopsgate street, and send the boots from there with it—the did so—Saward was to be at the Magpie, in Bishopsgate-street—we all four went to the Magpie, and there arranged our business, in the back parlour—I was to watch the man to the banker's, as I did before; I do not know his name—I should know the young man; that is him (<hi rend="italic">looking at Mitchenton</hi>)—I went to the banker's after him—I did not see the cheque paid, Hardwicke saw the first cheque paid; I was outside the</p>

Reynolds and Palmer, and Mr. Preston, and to Miller and Son, of Norwich—the names of the debtors in London to whom I directed them to write were, I believe, Mr. Dixon and Mr. Jones—Anderson had arranged to take places in London to receive the letters that should be sent—(<hi rend="italic">looking at three letters</hi>) I received these letters from Saward, in London; I came up to London with Hardwicke to pay the money into the banker's here—I went and paid in some at the Royal British Bank, in Threadneedle-street, and I believe Anderson paid in some money at Barclay's; I did not see him pay it in, he went with Hardwicke—he told me when he came back that he had paid it in; it was something over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the debts—upon that day we dined together at the bottom</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a prisoner in Newgate, under sentence of transportation for life. Many years ago I was sentenced to a term of transportation for felony from Brecon; I expiated a crime that I never committed; I was transported to Van Diemen's Land—I established myself in business at Hobart Town—after the expiration of my term of transpor<lb></lb>tation I returned to England, and continued to return about every three years—I have known Saward from twenty-four to twenty-six years, perhaps a little longer, I cannot confine myself to a year or two—I had known him some years previous to my first conviction for felony—on my occasional visits to this country from Van Diemen's Land, I used to see Saward from time to time—this day twelve months I took my passage at Melbourne, and arrived here on 26th May last—I and my wife took lodgings in Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road—shortly afterwards I met Saward in Suffolk-street, Borough—he met me with astonishment, and asked me how long I had been in England—I said some time; I did not satisfy him at first how long I had been here—he said, "How is it you have never called upon me?"—I said, "I never intended to call, from the manner in which you have treated me, I never intend to call upon you again"—he said, "Oh! never mind, old fellow, we will pay up all arrears, and we will go together, and get some money; I will put your passage money into your pocket again"—we drank together, and next day, or a few days after, I met him by appoint<lb></lb>ment in Farringdon Market—he said that he would introduce me to the parties that he was then working with; I did not know their names at that time—I was introduced to them in June, in Farringdon Market, and we afterwards drank together at the Coach and Horses; I was introduced to Anderson and Atwell—Atwell was known by the name of Hawkes at that time; he was called <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, Anderson was called <hi rend="italic">Bob.</hi>—I subsequently met Anderson and Atwell at a house in Guildford-street, Southwark, which we called the beef house—when I came from Australia, I brought with me a bill of exchange for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and others; this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had about l, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Treasury bills; and I had some blank forms of bills with me—I had to draw on a house for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and took the blank forms with me, but when I arrived there they had got the bills already drawn to accommodate me, so that I should not be delayed in going on board the ship, so I brought the blank bills to England with me—I met Saward at the beef house, and showed him what I had, and he said he thought some business might be done with them; we could go into business—I gave him the bill to take a copy from it for the purpose of taking Stephen's name off—I saw him on the following day, and he returned me the bill, saying he had done what ho wanted—I then paid the bill into Coutts's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of conversation between you, Saward, and Anderson, what plan was to be adopted for the purpose of making use of the accept<lb></lb>ances which he forged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was to find the money for out of pocket expenses, and Anderson was to be the sender, that is, the sender of the forged bills, and Atwell was to be implicated to watch what took place—that was the plan arranged upon between us—shortly after this plan was</p>

               <p>arranged I went with Anderson and Atwell to Townsend, the hatter's, in the neighbourhood of Cheapside, to purchase a large sized hat—Anderson was trying on the hat—Saward was not there, he was not in our company that morning—a young man named, Clemence came into the shop, to inquire for employment—after seeing that young man, I told Saward that a very likely young man had been into the hatter's shop, seeking for employ<lb></lb>ment, and that I had got his address—Saward and I arranged that when the bill was ready, and we were to go into the transaction on the Saturday following, this young man was to be written to, to be engaged by Anderson—the taking the apartment was left to Anderson and Atwell—Saward had arranged with them to go and take the lodging for the purpose—I believe a lodging was taken, for that special purpose, somewhere by the De Beauvoir-road; I never went there—Saward met me in the Borough, and we went to the Kingsland-road—I think that was on a Saturday morning, 14th June—we went into a public house on that occasion, it was an old fashioned public house, for Anderson to change his dress; that was to put on his wig and whiskers—I do not remember the name of that public house—I had never been there before; I am speaking of where we first met, that was at the Sussex Arms in the house where we went afterwards in the Inglefield-road—I am confounding myself—previous to his taking the lodging, he had dressed at a public house in Kiogsland-road, but on this occasion he dressed at the Sussex Arms in the Inglefield-road—that was about 9 o'clock in the morning—we had some brandy and milk there—the landlady apologised for the room not being ready, having had company the evening previous; but I got the newspaper from her, and I held the newspaper, and pen and ink was called for—I had a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note with me—I gave it, I think, into Ander<lb></lb>son's hands, but Saward put the name and address upon it, across the nice of the note—I believe this is the note (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—that note was given to Clemeuce, its I understand, but I did not see it given—the change was handed over to me when he came back; 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamps—Ander<lb></lb>son gave the stamps to Saward; he pasted one on the back of the 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and filled up the date on the bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) this is the portion, written by Saward—that bill was afterwards given to Clemence for the purpose of being taken to Heywood's—I went to Hey wood's, and saw Clemence go in—I saw the money paid, and the last of the sovereigns put into the bag—after the sovereigns were put in, it was taken from Clemence's hand, and put on one side of the counter—in consequence of that I came out, and made a signal, and motioned Atwell to go in—Saward was waiting under the old Post Office-passage, in Lombard-street, by the clock—he was made aware of what had occurred, and he went off directly to tell Anderson that it had failed—we afterwards went into a public house in Bishopsgate-churchyard, and dined—upon a Monday soon afterwards, I, Saward, Ander<lb></lb>son, and Atwell, met in reference to another transaction; that was about Mr. Turner's matter—Saward said that they had failed in the first instance in getting Mr. Turner's signature, not having sufficient money, but would I advance a further sum, say 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so, for another application to be made to Mr. Turner; and let the money remain a few days in his hands, so that it should be paid into his bankers', and get his cheque—I advanced 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—we met in reference to that matter at a public house in Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields—an I O U was written on that occasion by Saward, and given to Atwell—on the day when Atwell was to go to Mr. Turner's office, we were all in Kingsgate-street, waiting for him—Mr. Turner was not in at the first application—myself, Anderson,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020072"></xptr>
               <p>Atwell, and Saward were standing in Kingsgate-street in front of the house, when Mr. Turner passed by, and Saward said, "That is Mr. Turner"—in a few minutes Atwell followed him into his office—he brought a cheque out with him, and it was given to Saward to take the signature from—I consented for him to take the cheque away (it was my money), and do what was necessary with it, to take a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>) of the signature—I was not at that time engaged with any person in reference to some blank cheques on Gosling's—I do not know the party at all; I have seen him—Anderson and Saward were the parties that had this man with the blank cheques—on Saturday, 28th June, we all met at a public house near St. Pancras Church—that was the day on which it was arranged to utter one of the cheques—a cheque for 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., purporting to be signed by Mr. Turner, was given to a young man, and sent to the bank—I went to the bank myself—I went inside and saw the cheque presented—I was making inquiry about a dis<lb></lb>honoured bill drawn by a Mr. Richards—that was merely to take the clerk's attention—I saw the money paid, and the man leave the place—I after<lb></lb>wards sought to meet Saward and Anderson, but I forgot the house where I was to meet them, and I went home, and from there I went to a Mrs. Dixon's, a cousin of mine, in Union-street, Borough-road; they have the care of St. Michael's Chapel—I said, if the elderly gentleman that used to call on me, should call and ask for me, to say I had been waiting for him, but I had gone home—on coming out of the gate I met Saward—he said, "It is all right, old boy; where have you been to?"—he took me to a coffee shop where the rest of the party were waiting; Anderson, Atwell, and the man that had brought the cheque—on that occasion there was a division of the produce of the forged cheques—I purchased the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at the request of Saward—Saward put the price upon them, and I found the gold to pay—I gave 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; it was all paid in gold—shortly after that, I and Atwell went to Hamburg, and there I changed the notes—I was away about seven or eight days—shortly after my return, a cheque on Messrs. Hankey's, signed by Mr. Baldwin, fell into my possession—I was going into the City to get it cashed, and I showed it to Saward—he said that he could <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> it, meaning that he had got similar cheques—he said he could <hi rend="italic">fit</hi>, it, he had other cheques of the same descrip<lb></lb>tion; I left the cheque in his possession—I cannot say whether it was returned the same day or the following, but I had it returned in an envelope—I met Saward shortly after—I do not at this moment recollect at what particular house—we were in the habit of meeting at the Magpie and Stump, but we had so many meetings that I got confused with the different places—an arrangement was come to between Saward and myself with reference to some cheques upon Hankey's—he said as he could, <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> the cheque, he should send in some cheques for money—he showed me three cheques prepared for that purpose, one for 50<hi rend="italic">i.</hi>, and two for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—on that Saturday two of those cheques were sent to be cashed by a young man, one from the White Hart in Bishopsgate-street—I went to Messrs. Hankey's as I had gone to the previous bank, and saw the first cheque paid—Saward, Anderson, and I were at different places that day—we did not part till the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was paid—I subsequently had an interview with Anderson and Saward on the subject, at the Magpie and Horseshoe, or the Magpie and Punchbowl, in Bishopsgate-street—we made an arrangement to meet on the Monday—we met on Monday at Gregory's Hotel, I think they call it, in Cheapside, under an archway—the other cheque was presented for payment that day—I had two of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, the proceeds of the cheques, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020073"></xptr>
               <p>Saward had two—I paid 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for them in gold—I remember being at the Gresham Arms, in Wood-street—there was some money of mine counted out there on the table, bank-notes, and gold—that was in case any question should arise about a stranger being in the bank, he should pay in a sum to some one in the country, so as to be afterwards received—I believe the money passed between Atwell and Saward—I let them have the money out of my pocket, and they were counting it—I am not certain whether Atwell had it, or whether I had it, but it was returned to me—Atwell was at the table at the time, and he and Saward, I believe, were both counting it—shortly after I went down to Yarmouth in the name of James Ralph—I took a small furnished house in that name—before going, I made an arrangement that letters directed to James Ralph should be left at the Chapter Coffee-house, Paternoster-row—when I came to London, I found the Chapter Coffee-house was closed, and, as I understood it was in Chancery, I called on the persons inhabiting the house, and asked them, if any letters should arrive in the name of James Ralph, to take charge of them for me, and I would reward them for it, which I did—Saward went with me to the Chapter Coffee-house—I introduced him to the young girl who took in the letters, and told her if any letters arrived in the name of James Ralph, she was to be kind enough to give them to that gentleman, which was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went down to Yarmouth, you were aware, I believe, that letters were to be sent to solicitors there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Atwell was to have the whole management of sending up to London to parties upon I O U's, and Anderson was to take lodgings in fictitious names, and receive the letters sent from the solicitors—after being some little time at Yarmouth, I came up to London to see the result of the letters, and to find the money to pay the proceeds to the different attorneys who had been applied to—I met Saward, Anderson, and Atwell in Queen-street on that afternoon—upon that occasion Saward wrote to the different parties whom Atwell had been in correspon<lb></lb>dence with about these assumed debts—in pursuance of the arrangement, I changed a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, to get 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—the whole of the money remitted to the country was somewhere about 314<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found the balance very heavy to carry in my pocket, and being anxious to return to Yarmouth that evening, I paid 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into Barclay's bank—I paid it in in the name of Whitney, but I forgot to put that it was for James Ralph, the name that I was assuming at that time; I was flurried at the time—when I got to Yarmouth I applied through Messrs. Gurney's for the money, as James Ralph, and then discovered the mistake I had made—inconsequence of that I wrote to Saward under the name of James Ralph, at the Chapter Coffee-house—he got that letter, and returned an answer which I never got—I was apprehended on the 15th.</p>

Monday: I did not write on Saturday, because I expected to<lb></lb>day to have been able to have rectified fully your unfortunate mishap. Mr. Roberts attended again this morning at B—'s, to know their determination under the circumstances. It is this, that Mr. Whitney must attend himself at B—'s, and explain the matter, and sign a fresh note with his name, the same as he signed the paying in note, the writing of course being the same by comparison—they will then send a fresh note as instruction for G—'s to pay to James Ralph; the paying in note has been sent to G—'a, and they have it; they would not show it to Mr. Roberts when he applied there on Saturday, but said that Whitney had paid it in to his own credit. Now, I considered the matter <hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi> yesterday, and you must do this, literally: just do as I state; go to G—'s, see the paying in note, mind you must see it; state you have written to Mr. Whitney, and he will rectify it at B—'s, and you will call on them again in a day or two. Come up directly, go to B—'s, write a fresh note for them to send to G—'s, and then return, and you will get the cash. Pray do not move further in other matters until this is arranged, I beg of you not to do so. I can see through a brick wall sometimes, and I see through one now; be guided by me, for I am generally secure by caution;<hi rend="italic">cavendo tutus</hi>, as Ovid says. Mr. Roberts told B—'s this morning, that he thought Mr. Whitney might have gone on a tour of pleasure up the Rhine, but he did not know positively; they said they could not help it. If you can accomplish what you have to do, we will meet you to-morrow night, Tuesday, at 9, at the beef house, but if we do not see you there at that time, we will meet you the next day, Wednesday morning, at</p>

Bank of England note; I was to get it changed, and to bring two adhesive 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamps—I got the note changed, and got the stamps, and gave them to Anderson; he sent me on an errand; he afterwards gave me a bill of exchange for 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went on an omnibus to the City, and took the bill to Hey wood's—it was not paid; they gave me part, and then stopped the rest, and I was detained—I did not see Anderson afterwards till I saw him at the Mansion House—I saw nothing of Saward—I believe the handwriting to this bill to be the same as the note that was written to me—I gave that note to Anderson to show I was the person that had been written to, and he kept it.</p>

In Aug. or Sept. last the prisoner Anderson took a lodging at my house, in the name of Jones, for a friend that was coming from Brighton—two letters came—he called for them, and I gave them to him—I think they were from Yar-mouth—I think this is one of the letters (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it looks very much like it, I go by the handwriting.</p>

A person hired a lodging at my house in Aug. or Sept. last, in the name of Dixon—it was the prisoner Anderson—he said he hired it for a friend; he said I was to take in any letters that came in the name of Edward Dixon—a letter came; I gave it to my child, and she delivered it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the officers of the City police. On 26th Dec. last I went with Huggett to No. 9, John-street, Oxford-street, for the pur<lb></lb>pose of apprehending Saward—it is a sort of dining-room—I inquired for Mr. Hopkins; I was told that Mr. Hopkins had just gone out; that he had been gone three or four minutes—that was said by a female who came from the back room—she said that he was gone to the second public house on the left hand side in Oxford Market—upon that Huggett went to Oxford Market, and I remained at the house—shortly after Huggett had gone, I observed the door leading into the room at the back very gently close—I went and looked into the room, and saw the prisoner Saward—I said, "Oh! Mr. Hopkins, we have been looking for you"—he said, "My name is not Hopkins, Sir;" I said, "No, I believe it is Saward;" he said, "You are quite mistaken"—at this time Huggett returned—we then charged him with being concerned with Hardwicke, Atwell, and Anderson in forging a bill for l, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Heywood, Kennard, and Co., of Lombard-street, on the 14th Jan.—he said he knew nothing about the forgery or the parties; he said he should not go with us unless we forced him; he meant merely placing our hands upon him—when we were about to remove him, he said, "Before you remove me, I shall be glad if you would allow me to go to the closet;" I said, "Yes; but before you go there, we must see what you have got"—Huggett searched him, and took from his pocket two blank cheques of the London and Westminster Bank, St. James's branch—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Saward said, "Oh! they are nothing; destroy them"—after that he did not wish to retire, as he had done before—nothing more was said—we put him into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and brought him into the City—he said, "Well, I suppose it is no use holding out any longer; my name is <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> Saward."</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060052"></xptr>Q. Do you know Taylor and Finch? - A. I know Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from Nixon, whether, before this transaction, he was acquainted with Smith, or Taylor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long he had been acquainted with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had been acquainted with them any time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were Smith and Taylor? - A. I have had them in custody several times for thieving. In consequence of some information that I received, I went to Nixon's house, on Sunday, the 7th of August, 1796, upon a charge of another robbery; he keeps the Swan and Pike, at Enfield Lock, in the county of Middlesex; I found there these three pieces of muslin under the bed, between the bed and bed-tick; I asked him how he came by them; at that time he did not tell, for they were under the maid servant's bed; we searched the house for other things, and we brought him and a man of the name of Akenhead, who was tried at Chelmsford, upon the charge I went down upon, and executed; Nixon gave evidence against him; they were brought up to Bow-street, and on Monday, he was examined; I do not recollect that any thing passed in the way to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Mrs. Gibbons was taken into custody? - A. I was at Peterborough at that time; I went down there by the direction of Nixon, where Smith and Taylor were gone to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. This direction was a part of the examination? - A. I believe it was at the beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. He did not say a word till he was admitted an evidence? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Was he not in the act of giving information? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. In consequence of what passed, did you find Gipsey Tom? - A. I did, at the Fighting Cocks, at Peterborough, on the 9th of August, in the morning; I found Taylor also, but he made his escape; when Fugion and I took Gipsey Tom, he searched him; Fugion and I went together; in his pocket was the key of a room door; I searched a room in which he had slept, and there I found forty-five pieces of muslin, in a pair of saddle-bags; we brought Gipsey Tom to town, and he was tried at Hertford.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with Nixon, since he gave his information at Bow-street, respecting this robbery? - A. Yes, frequently; he said, that Smith, Taylor and Finch brought the whole of the muslins there, I forget the exact number that he said; it was one hundred and something; he said, he had brought them to his house, at Enfield-Lock, and that it was a very rainy morning, and that Smith sent his (Nixon's) son to Mrs. Gibbons; that she came down, and the pieces were told out to her; he said, he saw them told out; he said they were put in a sack, all but forty-five pieces, which were Gipsey Tom's, and he kept his part; Gipsey Tom said, he knew how to make as much of them as Mrs. Gibbons, for he was a pedlar, and travelled with a licence; he said, Mrs. Gibbons was gone away, and one of them said, fetch her back; she came back, and she took the sack away with what was in it, which contained Taylor and Finch's share, but not Smith's; with respect to the three pieces that I found concealed in his maid's bed, he said, one was given to him by the other two; two were to be sent to Finch's wife, or to Finch's house, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You say this was private conversation between you and him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did it take place? - A. Many times; we had been at Hertford and Chelmsford, and other places, and I had given him good advice to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. That if he did not tell the truth it would fall upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You know at that time he was admitted an evidence for the Crown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know also that all this had been taken down upon oath, at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I told him so, that what he had said at Bow-street, was taken down, and sent to this Court, and if he did not stick to that, it would fall upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had heard what had been taken down at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I heard the evidence read.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him something like this, you at Bow-street, said, so and so? - A. No; I said, you know what you swore at Bow-street, if you do not stick to the truth, it may fall upon you.</p>
               <p>Q. Understand me, and stop before you answer, we know what he swore at Bow-street; you have seen him frequently, and talked about the business, was it not in this way, you have said so and so, stick to that, or it will fall upon you? - A. I have repeatedly said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did he shortly say, that is the truth? - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This conversation you talk of having had with Nixon since he was at Bow-street; have those facts that you have now related been related by him since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Do you mean that he has told the whole story over again to you? - A. Yes; as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. At those times you always exhorted him in that way, at the introduction of such a conversation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. That it would be better if he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060053"></xptr>stick to the truth, and if he did not, it would fall upon him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He was, at that time, not charged as a criminal, but admitted as a witness? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Gipsey Tom took his share away? - A. Yes; they were divided in three.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these three were no part of the forty-five? - A. Not of the forty-five that were at Peterborough.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LAVENDER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk at Bow-street; I was present when Mr. Nixon was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Since the examination have you had any conversation with him relative to this? - A. I have had many conversations with him since his examination was taken, but I cannot recollect the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q.Nixon was admitted a witness against Gipsey Tom, and was afterwards admitted an evidence against Mrs. Gibbons? - A. He certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me if you know that letter? - A.It is a letter I received from the prisoner, Nixon, it is a letter addressed to Nixon, from Smith. (It is read, addressed Mr. Nixon, at the Swan and Pike, Enfield, Marsh, Hertfordshire, dated Peterborough, August 1st, signed

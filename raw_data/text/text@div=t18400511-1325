On the 26th of March I retired to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—I had been sitting the lat<lb></lb>ter part of the evening in the back drawing-room—when I went to bed I left the butler to extinguish the lights and see the house fast—I believe no<lb></lb>body else was up—I went into my study to put away some papers, the last thing before I went to bed—I had a silver inkstand on the study table, which, I have no doubt, was safe that evening—if it had not been, my attention would certainly have been called to it, as it is a small table, and I had occa<lb></lb>sion to go round the table—there were three ornamental pen-holders in the back-drawing-room, mounted with gold—the stem of one was blood-stone, and another cornelian—the three were worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the ink-stand was solid, and ten or eleven inches long—the articles stated are altogether worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had been sitting on the sofa—the table on which the pen-holders were was immediately opposite the sofa.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Lord Colchester. On Thursday, the 26th of March, the prisoner called at the house, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and said he wanted to know if the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping, and that he came from Mr. Tozer—I sent him to the housekeeper, who was in the kitchen—at night his lordship called me to take the lamp away—I went to bed at a quarter to twelve o'clock, leaving every thing safe—I was awoke about half-past four o'clock in the morning, by a violent ringing at the area-bell—I got up, found the prisoner there, and another man with him—I wished to know why he rang the bell so often and so violently—he said he was very busy, and had other places to go to—I let them in, and gave them a light—they went into the kitchen—I left them there—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I knew him well before—I went to my sleeping-room, which is immediately opposite the kitchen, and put on some of my things; I then went up stain to call the maids, then came down and went to bed—the gas light in the fanlight of the hall-door was burning at that time, and there is a window which throws a borrowed light from the passage on the fire-place—while I was in my room I heard somebody in the kitchen—I looked through the pantry window, which looks from my room</p>

               <p>into the kitchen, and saw one of the persons busy, apparently, before the fire-place, but only one of them; and while in my room I heard somebody go along the passage, which I supposed to be one of the maids—about half an hour after the prisoner came and knocked at my door, and said be wished to be let out, as I had locked the area-gate, and taken the key—I saw his companion in the area at that time—when I let them in they had an empty bag—when I let them out, I cannot precisely say which had the bag, but they had it with them, and it appeared to be fall—they wanted some beer, which I could not give them—I suspected nothing, and let them out—neither of the servants had come down stairs at the time I let them Out—nobody had an opportunity of coming into the kitchen except those two men—when I locked them out I went to bed, and remained there till half-past seven o'clock—I then went up to his lordship's dressing-room, which is on the ground-floor—the under house-maid gave me an alarm, and I then missed the silver ink-stand from his lordship's writing-table in the study, and a great-coat from a stand in the same room—I had seen them safe about eight o'clock the evening before—I also missed a pair of boots from the passage leading to the kitchen—they must have passed through that pas<lb></lb>sage to go out—in consequence of what was said afterwards, I examined the lower part of the chimney, but did not look up it sufficiently to say Whether it had been swept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am his lordship's housekeeper. About eight or ten days before the robbery the prisoner came to the house and asked me if the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping—I told him it did not, and when it did I would let Mr. Tozer know—I told him to ask Mr. Tozer if he could sweep the chimney with a machine, for it was Lady Colchester's wish that it should not be swept by the boys—he said, "Very well," and went away—on the day before the robbery he came again, and asked if the chimney wanted sweeping—I said it did, and asked if he had inquired of Mr. Tozer if he could sweep it with the machine—he said he had done so, and Mr. Tozer could not do it, unless Lady Colchester had two draft-holes made on the outside of the chimney—I told him the chimney smoked very much, and I would have it done by the boys in the morning—he asked at what time he should come—I said, "Half-past five o'clock"—I went down next morning at five o'clock, or twenty minutes after—the men had then gone—I found the kitchen-maid in my room—I looked at the kitchen chimney, and it had not been swept at all—I put a candle up, and opened all three of the flues, and there had been no soot taken from them.</p>

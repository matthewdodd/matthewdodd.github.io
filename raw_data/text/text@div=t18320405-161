            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday, the 6th of April, and told him it was for stealing his father's watch, seals, and chain; he said he had made it all right the night before, as he had seen his mother - I asked what he had done with the chain and seals; he refused to tell me, but said they were where they could not be recovered.</p>
               <p>JOHN DANGER. This is my watch - it is worth two guineas; there was a gold chain, three seals, and two keys to it - I value them at between 3l. and 4l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not send me word by my mo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050067"></xptr>ther, that if I brought the ticket, or the chain and seals, you would forgive me? A. No; I said I would not interfere at all about it - I went all round the neighbourhood, to stop it from being pledged; the; pawnbroker positively denied to my son-in-law, that such a watch had been pawned, and he had got it all the time.</p>

               <p>Collins. Open; on Sunday night the watchman found the prisoner in the shed and took him to the round house; On Monday I asked the prisoner if he knew where my things were; he said he had hid them in the king's new road.</p>

               <p>- Jones. I am a watchman. On Saturday, the 13th of October, I found the prisoner in the shed, in Grovener's place. I asked him what he did there; he said he came in for shelter; it was a rough bad night; I seized him and took him to the watch house. I did no know him before. I asked him how he got in, and he said the shop was broke open before he came. I know nothing about the tools. The next day, before the justice, he said he was the person that broke the shop open; he said he took the tools away, and hid them in the Five Fields, that go to Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe where he hid them?</p>

            . The prisoner told me where I should go to find the tools; it was on Monday, as we were going to the justices; he said they were in a ditch, in the Five Fields, going to Chelsea. I went and found them there. I brought them to the shop, while they were gone, and about an hour after he came and took them to the justice; I delivered them to him, and he has had them ever since.</p>

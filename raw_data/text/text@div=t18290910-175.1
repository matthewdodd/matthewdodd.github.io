I said it was, and kept him; they had run in different directions; I saw Gibbs in about ten minutes - I had not seen them near me.</p>

            . I live in Tower-street, Westminster-road. I was in Beech-street, on the opposite side to Haywood, and saw the two prisoners following him about the length of two houses - and nearly opposite Beech-lane I saw Gibbs take the handkerchief out of his pocket and give it to Jones who put it into his breast, under his coat; they passed on to the corner of the lane; I saw the prosecutor feeling for his handkerchief - I heard one of them say, "He is nobbing for it;" they directly ran down the lane; Haywood came over to me and we pursued; they divided - I saw Jones run down a court, and called to the prosecutor to tell him; I was close behind him when he took him; he gave the handkerchief from his hat - he had changed it from his breast; he said, "Is this yours Sir?"</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoners running down Beech-lane together; I followed them into a court into Redcross-street - I ran round Redcross-street, and apprehended Gibbs in Whitecross-street; I found Jones in custody, and took them to the Compter; I found a handkerchief in Jones' hat, which has not been claimed; he said it was his own.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. There was rather a shorter boy than this before me; I was ten or twelve yards behind him - I saw the handkerchief drop and picked it up - being out of work, I put it into my breast and turned down Whitecross-street; they called Stop thief! I thought I might get away with the handkerchief, which would fetch me 1s. or 2s. - the gentleman called after me; I asked if it was his - he said Yes; and if I would give it him I might go.</p>
               <p>Gibbs's Defence. I know nothing of Jones.</p>

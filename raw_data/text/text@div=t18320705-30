A. Yes, but nothing of this description - I said I would make up your salary to 20l. a year, but there was no per centage allowed you.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he any right to take property? A. No, not without its being entered in the book, and there is no entry of these articles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Before I came to live with him, I used to travel for myself - these are mostly the remains of my own packages; these two frock-bodies had been sold to a customer on the Monday before, and they were to be returned if not approved of; they were returned, and as they had been entered and paid for, I put them into my box - I had an accident with some of these handkerchiefs, and Mr. Church said I was to pay for them.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCH. He took out articles, but he was not to keep them till they were disposed of; these are not articles which he was allowed to take out at any time - they are not entered in his book at all; they were in his trunk in his bed-room - I have only a lad who used to go out with the prisoner, my wife, and myself; he never sold any velvet for me - if he had come and brought an order for it, I should have sent it out, but it is not likely to sell at this time of the year; I received this note, which is the prisoner's writing - (read).</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Have you any invoice of these articles? A. No; he used to take goods out in pieces, but not cut off - the velvet and this silk have been cut off the pieces.</p>

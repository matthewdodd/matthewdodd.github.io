               <p>I never saw the gentleman in my life; I picked up the handkerchief coming through Temple-bar, I did not know but the gentleman might be ill natured enough to swear against me, therefore I put it into my breeches, which I did at the house, and I believe the gentleman saw me; I think it is a very unlikely thing, that if I had picked his pocket ten minutes before, that I should pick it again.</p>

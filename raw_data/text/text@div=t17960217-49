               <p>I was informed that these two boys were in custody at the Police Office, in Lambeth-street, Whitechapel; I went and asked the jailor to let me speak to them, and Patten informed me that they had taken these prints from a shop in Oxford-road, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 25th of January; James was then locked up in another apartment; the goods were in the possession of Beare, the officer; I went with him to No. 108, Oxford-road, where there was a pane of glass broke out of the window, down very low, almost at the ground; it was the lower part of the glass that was broke; they could not take the prints from there, and they pulled out the other part of the glass, and got the goods; then we went into Mr. Jones's shop; I went in with the prisoner, and saw two of the shopmen there, and asked if they had lost any thing; they said they did not know that they had; I told them we had two lads in custody; I told them what Patten had informed me; they said they would come the next morning and look at the prints, they did not know whether they had lost any or not; I then took the lad to the house of correction, and left him there.</p>

               <p>Between the hours of nine and ten, on the 25th of January, I stopped James, the short lad, with the prints; the tall one ran away; I pursued him, and took him, concealed in a privy; I carried them before a Magistrate; and that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Evans. There is our mark upon two of them; they are Mr. Jones's property; the other has no mark.</p>

               <p>Patten's defence. When the gentleman came in, he said, if I would tell him how I got them, he would let me go, and that I should have plenty of drink: I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>James's defence. The gentleman said, if I would tell him where I got them, he would let me go about my business.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Griffiths). Did you tell him, if he would tell you where he he got them, you would let him go, or give him drink? - A. No, neither.(The prisoner James called four witnesses, who all gave him a good character).</p>

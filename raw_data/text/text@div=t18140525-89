On the 19th of April, I employed him to bring a quantity of oats from Mantz and Smith at Wapping-wall; he was to bring the oats to my stables in King David-lane; that is behind my dwelling-house, in Shadwell High-street. I saw him bring the last load. I gave him directions to take one quarter to Mr. Fox, and another to Mr. Barford; they were to be delivered out of the last load. One quarter is two sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the last load that he brought - A. Six sacks. By sending him to these men, I expected he would be back in a quarter of an hour. I was standing at the top of a court, waiting for him; I saw him coming down the open road; he must have gone three quarters of a mile out of the way to where he delivered the oats I went up to him, and asked him if he had brought the empty sacks back; he replied, he had. I stopped some time while he saddled a horse for an opposite neighbour, and as soon as the horse was taken out of the cart, I took my four empty sacks out. I then found a sack of oats lay down in the cart length ways, near the front board, and the empty sacks had been put over it to conceal it. I said, Stephen, you have a sack of oats here; he answered, yes, I bought them of Mr. Kent. I am confident there were only four sacks in the cart when he set off. I trusted him to deliver the oats, without any observation.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your premises to carry some corn to Mr. Cook - A. Yes; the first and second load I was not present at the delivery. He came for the third load; there was a wrangle between the meter and the porters, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250048"></xptr>wanted to put fourteen sacks in his cart; there were thirteen sacks in his cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how many sacks there were in his cart - A. Yes; the prisoner said, the first load I had fourteen, the second load twelve, and now I have thirteen. I was very particular about it. When he fetched the fourth, I was in the ship; he said, Mr. Mantz, I had only twelve sacks in the third load; I answered, you certainly had thirteen. I was busy. I said, I do not think Mr. Cook would cheat me of a sack of oats. He pressed me so much about it, I gave it up. The fourth load should consist only of eleven sacks; I allowed him twelve, because he said, he was one short before. I counted the fourth load, when there only should have been eleven. I saw a sack at the office, that was one of the forty sacks that he had loaded that day.</p>

               <p>Q. And yet, after the Grand Jury had thrown out the first bill upon the very same charge, you went before the Grand Jury again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The first charge was for privately stealing, and it turned out that there was a person saw it, and he preferred another bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Who told you to go again to the Grand Jury? - A. The Solicitor, I believe, or Sansum, or some other person.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the constable advise you? - A. Yes, and the Solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the Soicitor for the City of London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your other bill was found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else give you any advice upon the subject? - A. We had nobody else with us to give us any advice.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw any body else on the subject? A. I saw a great many people, but not to advise with them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I object to that, because it is upon record.</p>

            Did you know him before the 3d of September? - A. Yes, in the pick-pocket way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known his person? - A. Three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cork, the prosecutor, on that day? - A. I did, about one o'clock, as near as I can tell; it was at the time that the late Lord-Mayor was going to proclaim Bartholomew-fair; when I saw him first, he was standing behind a coach, I believe a hackney-coach; I saw the prisoner in company with several more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the names of any of them? - A. Yes, Taylor, Anderson, and himself, were all three together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time see him near Cork? - A. I did; I saw a man who I knew to be a pickpocket, tell the coachman there was a whole lot of people behind; the coachman then desired them to get down; then Anderson went right before Cork, and the prisoner at the bar went between Cork and another man, a countryman; just at that time the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050070"></xptr>state coach went by, and for a minute or two I lost sight of him; then I went on the same side of the way that they were on, when the coach was gone by; then I stood along-side the horses of another coach, next to that coach where Cork stood; the horses heads were to the hind wheels of the other coach; the prosecutor's arm was upon the handle behind the coach; he was very much pressed, though he need not have been pressed, he was pressed sideways; I saw Coleman shoving him in that way, keeping him down, so as to keep him in that posture, bending upon his elbows; I then saw Taylor stoop down; I called out, "butcher, take care of your pockets;" the prosecutor had a blue apron on, like a butcher; I then stooped down, and looked underneath the horse bellies that I was standing along-side; I saw Taylor draw his hand from Cork's right-hand pocket, and give a canvas bag into Coleman's hand; it looked like a dirty canvas bag; then they both ran away one way, and Anderson went another way; there were so many coaches going by, I could not immediately, but as soon as I could, I went to the prosecutor, I told him what I had seen, and who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not apprehend them immediately? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe Coleman was not taken till November last? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was brought up from Hull, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How did Coleman appear to be dressed? - A. He had on a mixed coat, like the coat he has on now, but it had not a black velvet collar to it.</p>

            Being under the horses bellies, you must have stooped? - A. Yes, and so was Taylor upon his knees; I made it my business to look.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Anderson apprehended? - A. Yes, I apprehended him within five minutes afterwards, and he was discharged by order of Mr. Alderman Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he was discharged, had you any conversation with him? - A. I never had; I ordered him to be locked up after he had beat me.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank with him? - A. Yes, I had a glass of gin with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the colour of his money? - A. I have seen the colour of his fathers's money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any money from his father? - A. Yes; when I took Anderson, he having beat me, as there was not susfficient evidence upon this charge, I told the Alderman he had assaulted me in my duty, and I did not mean to let him go, I should charge him with an assault; upon that his father went with me to a public-house, and offered a guinea between Backrow and I, for he had assaulted him too, and kicked his shins; I went back to the Alderman, and told him of the proposal, and he said, if I chose to settle it in that way, I might, and I received a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Anderson was sent to sea, I believe? - A. Yes, I could not swear particularly against him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have known Coleman two or three years? - A. I cannot say whether he has been home from Botany Bay so long; I have seen him in Fleet-street and Newgate-street, among a gang of thieves, and turned him out of different mobs many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Hastings? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. He has been a constable of the City? - A. Yes, till he was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are a City constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, if I should call a dozen people, who know Coleman as well as you, to say, that, upon your calling for assistance, Coleman was not there, what should you think of that? - A. They will false swear themselves.</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a cork-cutter, I work at Mr. Hardy's in Little Eastcheap: I was present when the Lord-Mayor went to proclaim Bartholomew-fair, I was standing about four yards and a half from the place where the robbery was done; I saw a man, not the prisoner at the bar, clinging round Mr. Cork, with his arms round his waist; I had seen the same man do the same sort of acts before, I took particular notice of him; I saw him run across the way, and a man that is described by the name of Taylor, which I gave part of his description to Mr. Alderman Staines; one was of a light complexion, and the other of a dark complexion, they both ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the person with the dark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050073"></xptr>complexion before? - A. Yes, I have seen him go past our shop many times, in the same sort of acts, when I worked in Watling-street, two doors from Bow-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was his name? - A. William Saggers.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the prisoner at the bar? - A. No, I can swear it was not the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of the light complexion man? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is become of Saggers? - A. He is now in Newgate, under sentence of transportation. The first time I was called up, I said, that I could tell the persons that committed the robbery, but I did not see the prisoner at the bar. I was summoned one day when another Alderman was sitting, and Sansum would not let me be heard before that Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Samsum say so? - A. Yes. And afterwards I had another summons to come up, and then I said, that the prisoner at the bar was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you assist in apprehending Anderson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information to Sansum, by which he might lay hold of Anderson? - A. With respect to Anderson, I did not say any thing about it, but with respect to Saggers, I did; and I gave the description of Taylor too.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there? - A. I may say, nearly half an hour in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when Sansum came up, and Anderson was laid hold of? - A. No, I went to work at that time; I never saw the prisoner with my eyes, till he was brought before the Magistrate.</p>

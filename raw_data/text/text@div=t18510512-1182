                  <hi rend="italic">Carter's Defence.</hi> I am guilty of pawning the watch, but not of the rob<lb></lb>bery; I met these two in Strutton-ground, and afterwards I met another man; we all went together, and they did not begin to work that day; the other man asked me to take a walk with him; I did, and he asked me to pawn the watch for him; I said, "Yes," and I put it in my own name.</p>

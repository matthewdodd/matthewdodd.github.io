                  </hi>. I am a livery stable-keeper at Dalston. On the 3rd of April, about a quarter to eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was standing at the corner of a public-house near my premises—I went to a window, which commanded a view of Mr. Aspland's place—I saw Rourke go to the side gate—Saunders stood outside—I fetched the man who had given me the information, and went back with him to mv own house—in a few minutes Rourke came out again, with a coat on, buttoned up to the top—Saunders came up to him, pulled up the collar, and smoothed down the back—I went out and met the prisoners—Rourke's hands were in his great-coat pockets—I seized him—he tried to get away, and fell—I fell with him—I held him—my companion seized Saunders—they were given into custody, and searched—while Rourke was being searched, I saw a watch drop from him—the constable took the coat off his back directly he came—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

On Friday, the 10th of April, I went into the Horse and Groom, Edgware-road, and called for a pint of beer—the three prisoners and others were in the room—I began to smoke my pipe, the beer was brought to me—I had a shilling, a sixpence, and 1 penny in my pocket—I changed the sixpence, to pay for the beer—Lawley asked for a drink of my beer, and I paid for a pot for them—the prisoners and the others drank it—Lawley asked me to stand another pot, I refused—Lawley put his hand on my mouth over my throat, and kept me down on the settle, while Grady put his hand in my pocket, and took off my boots—Shehan was missing from the room when I called out "Murder"—I cannot say whether he took any part in it—I missed my shilling, from the pocket which Grady put his hand to, and also my boots—the landlord came and closed the door—I got hold of Lawley round the neck, and also Grady—the constable came and took them.</p>

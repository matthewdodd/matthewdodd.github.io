On the 4th of February Williams came to my house alone, and wanted a room for herself and another young woman; she said they got their bread by needle-work - I took her up stairs, and showed her the second floor front-room which was furnished; she took it and gave me a shilling earnest - they were to give 4s. a week for it; they took the room immediately, but I did not see Holland till I went up stairs at night to give them a pair of sheets and a counterpane - they were then in the room; they continued to live there till the 9th of February; when I went up and knocked at the door they asked who was there - I said the landlady, and I wanted to come in for something particular; they said they were cleaning themselves, but if I would go down stairs they would call me when they were ready - I stood on the landing-place; when the door was opened I looked in and missed the bed, and saw the room was stripped of nearly every thing but the table and a tea-kettle - they got down stairs; I called out, but nobody could get out of their rooms in time to prevent them - they got into the street; we called the Policeman - they were pursued and taken; I missed the saucepain, pail, fire-shovel, and a variety of other things.</p>

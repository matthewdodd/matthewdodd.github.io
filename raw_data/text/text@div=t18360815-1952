                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Thomas Willey, a professor of music, in Alderman-terrace, St. Pancars. On the 16th of August, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was called up by a policeman—I know when I went to bed the parlour window was down, but not fastened—the blind was down—the shutters were not closed—I went down, and found the prisoner in custody—the policeman had the property stated in the indictment—it had been safe in the parlour the night before—I found the things removed—the prisoner was quite a stranger.</p>

I went to the stable at five o'clock in the morning, and went with the cart to Battle-bridge, and saw the prisoner standing opposite the prosecutor's house—I returned to the stable with the cart, and at a quarter-past six o'clock, I saw him standing where he was before—I passed by three doors, and saw a young man come out of the prosecutor's street-door with a</p>

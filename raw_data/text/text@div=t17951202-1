               <p>I am servant to a pawnbroker in Bridges-street, Covent Garden. Four window curtains, two sheets, and three shirts were, pledged with me at four different times, by the prisoner, on the 24th of February, 9th March, 20th April, and 15th May.(Edward Treadway, a constable, produced two duplicates which he received from the prosecutor; I did not find any thing upon the prisoner.)(The goods produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Thompson. This mug is my property; it has been in the family about two years; it has my crest and motto upon it; it cost four guineas. With regard to the curtain I think I can safely swear to it, but it has no particular mark; I cannot positively swear to it. I can only swear to one of the sheets, worth about 7 or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020004"></xptr>8s. this shirt has my mark, it is worth about 8s. the milk pot I think is worth 13s. I know it by the crest and motto; the pepper castor has the same, and is worth 10s. the four window curtains are mine; I think they are worth a guinea and a half; the two sheets are mine, they are worth half-a-guinea; the shirts are mine, my name is on them, they are worth 15s.</p>

                  </hi> I am a constable at the East and West India Docks. On the 5th of Oct., about ten minutes past four in the afternoon, I was at the gate—the prisoner came out—I called him by name, he would not an<lb></lb>swer—I ran after him, took hold of his arm, told him I wanted to speak to him, and asked him if he had anything in his hat—I thought he had by the position of it—he said he had got nothing there—I brought him into the box, took off his hat, and found in it 3 3/4 lbs. weight of cochineal—I asked how he came by it—he said he did not know, he found it in his hat, and did not know who put it in—I searched further, and found 1/2lb. more cochineal in his coat-pocket—it is worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—the prisoner was foreman of a warehouse, and he had a great many persons under him—it was not usual to rub the prisoner down when he left the docks—the foreman are not rubbed down.</p>

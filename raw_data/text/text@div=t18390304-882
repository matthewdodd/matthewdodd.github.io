                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Sarah Ellis, a widow—she keeps a corn-chandler's shop in Salisbury-street, and sells hay and straw in Portman-market, which is opposite her shop. About eight o'clock on the evening of the 5th of February, I was in the shop with Wharton, and saw the prisoner coming across the street, from the market, with a truss of hay—he went down Stamford-street—I pointed him out to Whaurton, who went after him—we had thirty-two trusses in the market that evening—I went to it, and missed one, which I had seen safe at seven o'clock—Whar<lb></lb>ton brought the prisoner into the shop in about half an hour—I went to</p>

I was in the shop with Ellis—I followed the pri<lb></lb>soner up the street into Lisson-grove, and into Queen Charlotte-mews, Stingo-lane—I asked him, at the corner of Grove-street, where he got the hay—he said he bought it at Mr. Bunce's, at the top of Capman-street, which is about a hundred and fifty yards from the market—I went to Bunce's, and in consequence of what he told me I went after the prisoner again, and stopped him—I left the bay against Hale's stable, but I after<lb></lb>wards found it inside the stable—it was the same hay—I knew it belonged to Mrs. Ellis from the quality and by the bands.</p>

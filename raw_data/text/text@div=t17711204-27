            . On the 23d of November last I was at the lottery office examining some tickets. About six o'clock in the evening I laid down my pocket book on the counter. I missed it in a little time. The prisoner was there examining some numbers. I believe, when I missed it, he went out. I told the people in the office that I suspected that person. He returned again. They said he would return again. I asked him about it; he said he had not seen it. I got a warrant for him on Wednesday the 27th of November, and searched his lodging. We found a bank note, that caused a little suspicion. I lost a 50 l. and a 20 l. note.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the room did you stand was it next the street?</p>
               <p>Golightly. Yes. I stood near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible that it might get into the street?</p>
               <p>Golightly. It could not of itself.</p>

I am a goldsmith and jeweller. About the Thursday morning after, Mr. Golightly came to me, and described the name and number of it.

            . The prisoner is my son-in-law. He told me he had found two bank notes in the street, and desired I would go and buy some things with them; it was on Monday. Accordingly I went to Mr. Jefferies, and bought half a dozen of spoons, and he changed the 50 l. note. I live in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Jefferies live?</p>
               <p>Cooper. In Cockspur-street, Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go so far to buy these spoons?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I was that way; I thought it looked like a good shop. I changed the 20 l. note at a silversmith's shop in New-street; there I bought two salts and two spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. What change did you receive of Mr. Jefferies, cash or bills?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I received cash of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you changed the 20 l. note, what had you done with the other money?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I had given it to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you tell what was the number of the note?</p>
               <p>Gargrawe. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>- Bird. I am a silversmith in New-street, Covent-garden. This Mrs. Cooper came in after candle-light, and looked at some salts; then she said, I cannot have them unless you can change a 20 l. note. I sent out and changed it. I put it among more, that I cannot tell what the number of it is.</p>

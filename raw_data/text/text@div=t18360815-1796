               <p>on the 6th of July, in company with Duke and Ashton, I proceeded to a house in Williams'-buildings, French-alley, Goswell-street, about three o'clock in the afternoon—I found the street-door open—the parlour door was fast inside—I forced it open, and saw the male prisoner sitting by the side of the fire, on a chair, and the female sitting on a stool by the table, in front—on the right-hand-side, the male prisoner's wife and child laid in bed—I laid hold of the male prisoner, and caught him in my arms—he immediately stooped, put his right-hand down, and seized a poker—I said, "James, it is of no use, you may as well put it down'—at the same time, from his left hand he dropped something white, which he was breaking with his feet—it turned out afterwards to be a plaster-of-Paris mould—took up part of the mould, which was quite hot at the time—also a coun<lb></lb>terfeit sixpence, which was very hot, among the plaster-of-Paris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I accompanied Rey<lb></lb>nolds and the others to the house—I saw Reynolds force the door open with his shoulder—when I got into the room I found the man standing up, and Reynolds having hold of him—the female was sitting on a stool close to the table, facing the man—I saw a counterfeit sixpence, found on the floor by Reynolds—it was near the man, and about two feet from the woman—I found on the fire a ladle with metal in it, in a melted state—on searching the room, I found a tin band with plaster-of-Paris adhering to it, in a tub of water; and another band with plaster-of-Paris to it, on a chest of drawers—I found this holder for the mould—I saw Duke find some metal on the table, and some on the floor near where they were sitting—I re<lb></lb>mained there till they were taken into custody—the man's right-hand was very dirty—the first and second fingers were very black as if he had been working over the fire, and had plaster-of-Paris round the nails as if he had been working with it.</p>

I accompanied the witnesses to the place—I searched the room, and on the table in front of the fire, found a counterfeit sixpence in an unfinished state, and on the same table some pieces of metal and a file, with white metal and plaster-of-Paris in the teeth of it—a pair of scissors with plaster-of-Paris on them—this piece of rag with a quantity of plaster-of-Paris on it, and this piece of ribbon which exactly fits the tin-band as if it had tied it—I found a bowl with a quantity of plaster-of-Paris in it, and un<lb></lb>der the fire-place part of a mould among some wet ashes—I went with them to Hatton Garden office—I did not hear the male prisoner say any thing—his hands were very dirty, and his breeches were stained in several places with plaster-of-Paris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint.

            . I am a Policeman. On Saturday, the 29th of May, between five and six o'clock, the prosecutor complained of being robbed - he was perfectly sober; he took me to the house - two rooms in it were fastened up; he said it happened in the top room, the door of which was open - I went in there, and searched well, but found no watch; the prosecutor on the road produced the duplicate of the watch to me.</p>

               <p>JOHN EWART re-examined. While I was stopping at the bottom of the stairs, the duplicate was thrown into the stair-foot to me - I had not seen the prisoner leave the house; I was there half an hour altogether - I had been with no other woman; I was perfectly sober - I had but two glasses of grog between eleven and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not at the office say you had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080089"></xptr>several glasses of rum, and could not swear to me? A. No - I am quite certain of her person, and never expressed a doubt of it; I never said there was another woman in the room - a woman went out of the house while I stood at the stair-foot; I never said I knew the person who pawned the watch - I am certain I was with nobody but her.</p>

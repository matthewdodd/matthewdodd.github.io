On the 6th of October, I went into the stable, and found the prisoner behind one of the corn-binns; we took him into the house and sent for the officer - this pocket-book was found on him, it is my property, and is worth fourpence: and on his feet were found my pair of shoes - these horse-cloths are mine; they were found at Shepherd's-bush; I had missed my shoes about six weeks before - I had missed the horse-cloths on the Friday before.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol. On the Sunday evening I took the prisoner; I found on him this pocketbook, and a pair of shoes which he had on his feet, and I believe he has them on now - I asked him if he knew any thing of the horse-cloths; he said yes, and he could produce them, providing I would not take him before the magistrate - I gave him no answer nor made him any promise in any way - he said the next day that he had sold the horse-cloths to an ostler at Shepherd's-bush, for 4s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When we were coming from the watch-house he said if I told him the truth where the cloths were, he would not take me before the Justice - he said so if I were now on my dying bed. Witness. No, I swear I did not; I made him no promise nor threat - I told him I was obliged to take him before the magistrate before I could discharge him.</p>

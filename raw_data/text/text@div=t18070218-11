               <p>JOHN RAY. I am an officer of Worship street. On Wednesday the 4th of this month, between the hours of six and seven, I was going down Montague street, about half a mile from the prosecutor's, I was in company with Kennedy and two other officers, I met the two prisoners, one had got a tea kettle in his hand, and the other a tea board; the moment they saw me they separated, White went into the middle of the road, he had got the tea board against his breast. I immediately got hold of him, and the other was stopped by Kennedy. I asked White where he got this tea board; he told me he got it from a man in the Commercial road.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the Commercial road. A. We might be three quarters of a mile; he said he was going to take it to his master's in Saffron hill. We took them into a public house; Collins then began crying, and he told me immediately where they stole them from; they had taken them from a shop the corner of Osborne street, in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed Recollect yourself, did not he say, I stole them. - A. No, he did not.</p>

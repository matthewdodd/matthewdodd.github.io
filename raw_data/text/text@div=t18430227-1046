                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the vice of Messrs. Allen and Smith, who live in Friday-street, Cheapside. On the 21st of Jan. I was ordered to conceal myself—Amos Hayton was at the entry-desk in the counting-house at that time—Rawlings, who is a porter in the house, was directed to remain in the warehouse while the others were gone to dinner, and not to leave—he was left in charge of the warehouse—I concealed myself behind the counting-house—about half-past two o'clock I watched Rawlings, and saw him go into the linen-room, to a box in which some lawns were—I bad counted the pieces of lawn in that box about five minutes before, and found forty-nine pieces—I saw him put his band on the goods—his back was towards me—he instantly left, and walked behind some boxes which were standing in front of the warehouse—I then came forward from my hiding-place, and asked what he was doing there—he said he was looking for a sheet of paper—I immediately went to the box, counted the pieces, and found three pieces were missing—in the meantime Rawlings walked forwards, and Hayton told me he was gone out—I went in, search of him, and could not find him—in about an hour he returned—Mr. Allen called him into the counting-house, and afterwards gave him into custody—no one had any pos<lb></lb>siblity of getting to the box between the time of my finding forty-nine pieces of lawn and counting them again, and finding only forty-six, except Rawlings—there are three pieces of lawn here now—I am able to say that this is one of the forty-nine pieces which I saw in the box before I saw Rawlings go to it—I know it by the "No. 591" on it—the marks have been removed from the other two pieces—I had observed this number on them before—here are several other pieces of the same lot, and the same manufacture, but there is no mark or number to enable me to detect them—they contain about six yards and a half in each, and are wrapped in green.</p>

I took my passage on board the Caroline for New South Wales; I packed up the articles stated in the indictment in my trunk - a man named Ecclesby fetched the prisoner to carry it to St. Katharine's-dock to be put on board; I saw him in possession of it - I went on board next morning, and found it had not been brought; I went to Ecclesby's house, but did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody - the box was locked, and was found still locked, but the screws are taken out.</p>

Ecclesby described the prisoner to me; I found him at the General Elliott, Jews'-row, Chelsea - as I brought him by the Coach and Horses public-house, he wanted to go in there, but I would not let him; I took him to the station-house, then returned to the Coach and Horses, and found this trunk - I went and searched the prisoner, and found this duplicate on him; he then owned that he had taken some shirts out of the box, but that he took the box on board, and said Ecclesby knew nothing about it.</p>

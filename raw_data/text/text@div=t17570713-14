               <p>Q. Was the hanger drawn?</p>
               <p>Arnold. No, it was in the scabbard. I told him I had none. He said he'd search my pockets, which he did, but found nothing; then he demanded my cloaths (I had observed he had drawn his hanger two or three times before he stop'd me.) I pleaded very hard, and said I had been ill many months, and they were very bad. He took my hat off my head by force, and seeing it not a good one he returned it to me again. I went up to Copenhagen-house and told the case. Two men went down the field and found him. Then he was carried before a magistrate and committed.</p>

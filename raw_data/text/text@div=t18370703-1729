                  </hi>. I am in the service of Samuel Richard Heseltine, who lives in Church-street row, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On the 1st of July, about twenty minutes after one o'clock, the prisoner, who was a stranger, came and asked if Mr. Heseltine was at home—I said, no—he asked if Miss Heseltine was at home—I said she was not, but I expected them in</p>

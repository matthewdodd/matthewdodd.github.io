I went on Sunday morning, between eight and nine, to take it off; and it was gone. It was black woollen cloth, one piece, about twenty-seven yards. I heard that two women were stopped with some cloth. I went to the watch-house, and found the prisoners in custody; and the officer of the night had got the cloth.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoners on Sunday morning, about four o'clock, in Chiswell-street, about half-a-mile from the prosecutor's. Billings had the cloth in her apron. I saw them come out of Grub-street. Billings made a stop in Chiswell-street; the other said, Blast you, go on. I asked her what she had got there; and the other woman said, It was only an old blanket used at that parish chapel, and they found it there. When I was going to take Billings, the other prisoner was going away. Billings said, For God's sake, do not let that woman go away. I took them both to the watch-house. At the watch-house, Billings began to cry, and was very willing to tell how she came by it.</p>

               <p>Coulston. They were taken from out of a room up one pair of stairs; I went into the city of an errand, I came home about a quarter of an hour after nine o'clock; after which my wife was going up stairs for something she wanted, and found the chamber door come to her; she came and told me there were rogues in the house. I went up, and the prisoner was then coming down stairs. I took hold of him, he directly said, do not hurt me, and I will tell you the truth; I have carried away a looking-glass and tea-chest, and have removed the china up two pair of stairs, and that this was the second time of his coming into my house.</p>

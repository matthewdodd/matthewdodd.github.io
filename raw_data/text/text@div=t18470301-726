                  <hi rend="largeCaps">MARY EDWARDS</hi>. I am a widow, and live in Brunswick-street, Commercial-road. About the middle of Jan. the prisoner came to me and told me she had got an advance note for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. she wanted cashed, and wished me to do it, for the note was all right—that she was going into a little business, and wanted the money very badly—she produced the note to me, it was in the name of Mitchell—I gave her a sovereign for it, and she afterwards gave half-a-crown out of it for cashing it—in a few days she came again with a second note, and asked me to cash that for her, as she wanted me to do all her business—I did not cash it—I had not got the money, and told her to call in a day or two—she told me I was not to let Mr. Myers, who she lodged with, know anything about it—I went to Mr. Chapman, in Leadenhall-street, and made inquiries—in a few days I went to her and told her the note was forged—she said, "<hi rend="italic">Pooh, pooh</hi>! it is a parcel of nonsense," and said she had got it from a sailor, and if I would wait a day or two she would write to her brother at Liverpool, and pay me the money—this was on the Wednesday—I was to wait till Friday or Saturday—I did not see her again till she was custody, a few days after, about some other matter—this is the note.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you read writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I can read a little—I know the note by the name "Edmonds" being scratched out—I am in the habit of cashing seamen's notes—I do not always get 150 per cent.—this was half-a-crown in the pound—she gave me that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you saw her in custody, did she say anything to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said she hoped we would not hurt her, that trouble and sorrow drove her to do it—Mr. Myers was with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was after you had had another note or two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I only cashed this one—I get my living by taking in a few sailors as boarders—I had two or three, sometimes five or six—I do not keep what is called a <hi rend="italic">crimp</hi>—I do not get ships for sailors—I do not know whether the prisoner has a husband—she said the second note was her husband's, and it would be paid on the 2nd—I did not know her as a person in the habit of receiving sailor's notes—she was brought to me by a person who is here, who heard that I advanced money on notes.</p>

Chapman, No. 1, Leaden<lb></lb>hall-street—it mentions the <hi rend="italic">Big Ann</hi>, bound for Madras, Bombay, and China—I do not know of any other <hi rend="italic">Big Ann</hi> in the trade.</p>

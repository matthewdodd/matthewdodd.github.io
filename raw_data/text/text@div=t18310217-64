               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When did you see the work last? A. On the 9th of July - I put it by; I believe it was after he left - it was tied up regularly for delivery, in sheets; not bound - not one copy had been sent home to Mr. Colburn, the publisher, for two years, when exactly two thousand were sent to him in sheets, in the same state as those stolen - I discovered the loss on the 23rd of December; Mr. Baylis discharged a boy that day - I took that boy into custody on the 6th - he is not in custody now; I have not taken means to apprehend any body but the prisoner for this property - I have attempted to find people for other losses.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and live in Fetter-lane, in the City - the prisoner came to my shop about September last, and offered paper for sale, which he described as misprinted; I asked if it came from a printer's; he said, Yes; I said, "Is it your property?" he said No, it belonged to the men, and was their perquisite for beer - I did not open it; I bought it as waste-paper, at 3d. a lb., which is a fair price - I bought the quantity now produced at twice; about half each time - he brought the other half about two or three days after - the first weighed about 10 lbs.; when he brought the second parcel, I asked if there was any more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170054"></xptr>of it - he said, "No, not at present;" he had offered waste-paper for sale about a month before, but I did not buy it - I told him it was too good for my business; he showed meens sheet; it was a thick good paper, and printed on - I showed Moss the same paper as I bought of the prisoner; I had opened it, but used none of it - it weighed 19lbs., and I have not a doubt of its being the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which end of Fetter - lane do you live in? A. The middle - it is in the City; I occasionally sell a little writing-paper; I buy waste-paper, and sell it if I have more than I want - I opened this for a person to look at after I had bought it; he looked at it as waste-paper - it did not suit him; I did not know it was books with the title; it was all clean perfect sheets, in quires - I have dealt in waste-paper about twelve months; I do not recollect buying of any other boys - Moss clamined it early in January.</p>

            . This is the paper I saw at Paget's - it was given to Hall the officer; the 19lbs. make twenty-one perfect volumes of the Highways and Byeways - it is perfect, and cannot be mistaken for waste; the prisoner must know it was perfect from his experience in the business; Mr. Colburn's name is Henry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear this is not part of the two thousand copies sent from the printing-office? A. I should think not, but cannot swear it positively.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Suppose they are part of the two thousand, would they be Mr. Colburn's property? A. There is no doubt of it - the two thousand copies were sent off above two years ago.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are misprinted copies the workmen's perquisites? A. Not a sheet; if a journeyman spils paper he has to pay for it, and has it for his own use.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Mr. Colburn has a partner? A. He has now, but had not when this was printed; he lives in Burlington-street.</p>

               <p>I am constable and patrole of Billingsgate Ward. On Monday the 2d of November I met with Briggs first with a bundle at his back, about fifty yards from the Queen's Head; I asked him what he had got? he said, his clothes, he brought them from Gravesend, and said, he was going to the Tower to get a boat, to go down the river: I took him to the watch-house; going along Farrer came up and called Briggs; as soon as he came up I took him, with the assistance of the watchman, and put them both in the watch-house: Farrer had the prosecutor's coat on; several other things were found upon them, which I have kept separately; here are two coats, one blue, and one black: these things I took from Farrer, viz. one lamb skin waistcoat, value eight shillings, two black satin waistcoats, value ten shillings, two pair of satin breeches, value twelve shillings, an oldish black coat, value fourteen shillings. These things were taken from Briggs, viz. a blue cloth coat, value three pounds, a black cloth coat, value three pounds, four corded dimity waistcoats, value two pounds ten shillings. (Produced and deposed to.) Briggs had all the new things on his shoulder in the hammock.</p>

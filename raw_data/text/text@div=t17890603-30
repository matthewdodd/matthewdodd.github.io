               <p>Court. Were they talking together? - No, Pinkstan was before Green three or four yards; I asked him what he had on his shoulder, and he said nothing.</p>
               <p>Did Pinkstan say any thing? - No, when Green threw the cloth down, they run away together; I sprung my rattle and my partner came, and we pursued them and took them.</p>

               <p>Have you sold any of that cloth with that mark on it? - No, the mark is on the outside fold, and we cut the inside fold: on the evening these were supposed to be stolen, we were busy, and I suppose it might be taken at the time the lamps were dull, and the shop was rather dark.</p>
               <p>Thwaits. I am certain the cloth is my property, there is my own private mark and my brother's.</p>

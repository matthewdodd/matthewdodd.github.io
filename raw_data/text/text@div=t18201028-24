            . I was laundress to the City Solicitor, and had been so twenty years. The prisoner has assisted me between four and five years. There was a quantity of papers in the chambers when she first came. I have not attended lately, being ill. I always told her never to meddle with papers written on, and not to destroy them. She also worked for the Remembrancer and Mr. Montague; I was laundress to them all. I had noticed her with money, which excited my suspicion, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280013"></xptr>asked her how she came by it? she said she had a friend, who supplied her.</p>

               <p>These two women came into the shop, and asked for stockings, they walked to the upper end of the shop where they had no right, and one took up a paper with three pair of stockings, I observed her, and when she saw I took notice of her she dropped the paper: Then they asked to see some black stockings, the boy shewed them some, and one of them clapped her leg on the counter, and with one hand shewed the stockings she had on: and she put two pair under her petticoats. Then a hamper of wine and brandy came in, I went backwards, and the prisoner Ware followed me and took up a bottle, I do not know whether it was full or empty, she said, damn your eyes you old blood of a bitch! If you do not open the door and let me out, I will dash your brains out! She held me by the collar at arm's length, and stood over me with this bottle, and swore she would knock my bloody brains out! I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100065"></xptr> frightened very much indeed: There were two men at work in the garret, and one of them was called down, and he said, you shall not kill my master, and he took her away, and just then the constable came to the door, what became of the bottle I cannot say, I expected nothing but to be knocked on the head.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Ware. The prosecutor said, when he took me up, he had transported four or five, and he would hang me for an example.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you say so? - I never said any such thing, she was the terriblest woman I ever saw in my whole life, but I never said any thing about hanging or transporting.</p>

I saw her go to the back part, and there was a scuffle ensued, I went to their assistance; the woman had got the last witness by the threat, with the finger and thumb; and the other had hold of his ear: I was for to all the strength I had to open her hand, she was very strong indeed: We pulled her off of him, and he run up stairs; then my master went backwards, and she got hold of a bottle, and swore she would knock his bloody brains out, if he did not let her out, I said, she should not strike my master; then the constable came, and he desired me to go with him to prison, and while I put on my coat Ware got away from the constable, and the other was striking him; Ware was found in a public house, and the constable said, I durst not meddle with her, for there is a great number of thieves, so she got away once or twice, and I fetched one Collins and Mitchell from another house, and she was taken.</p>

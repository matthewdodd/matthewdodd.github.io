                  </hi>. I live at No. 29, Wellclose-square, in the parish of St. John, Wapping, and am a waterman. I have lived in that neighbourhood about twenty years—the prisoner Hughes is a daughter of mine—on Thursday morning, the 17th of August, I went to my work, and told her to get me a shirt—I put it on and went to my work—when I got there I pulled off my jacket, and found my shirt all ragged, and said, "This shirt I must have left off two years ago"—I did not see the male prisoner till Saturday, the 19th of August—on Sunday morning, the 20th of August, I received some duplicates from my daughter Mary Ann—I have seen the property produced—the whole of it is mine—I have never authorised my daughter to pawn any property of mine within the last twelve months—I had redeemed some that she took there before—I know nothing of the man any more than he was pointed out as the person that was always in company with her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Abraham Hughes, and shall be sixteen years old on the 20th of December next. I remember being ex amined before the Magistrate—on the Thursday morning week before I was examined I left my father's house—just before this my sister, the prisoner, took away some shirts—she had taken things at other times—I knew the prisoner for Chambers about two or three months—he has often been with my sister—on the morning of the Sunday before I was examined I saw him at the top of Wellclose-square—I asked him if he knew where my sister was—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he would tell me—he said he would tell me to-morrow—he asked me what I wanted with her—I told him to get the tickets—he put his hand in the tail of his coat, and brought me out the tickets—there were twenty-nine, I believe—he said he got them from my sister—he told me where my sister was—I saw him again the next day but not to speak to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Miss Mary Lushington, of No. 4, York-place, Baker-street—she is the housekeeper—I have the care of the plate. On Wednesday, the 22nd of January, I was in the kitchen about half-past eleven o'clock in the day-time—the plate is kept in front of the house, in my pantry—I saw two tea-pots and a milk-jug, and other plate, which had just been cleaned, standing on the dresser, about a quarter of an hour before—while I was in the kitchen I heard the area door at the bottom of the steps open, and in about a minute I heard a sort of jingle in the pantry—I went there, and missed two tea-pots and a milk-jug—I saw the prisoner going up the area steps into the street—I went after him, came up to him, tapped him on the shoulder, and said he had something which did not belong to him—he said he had, that he had just picked them up—I got an officer, and had him taken—I was present when two tea<lb></lb>pots, silver milk-jug, and two packets of blacklead, were produced from his person—he had them in his hand, in a bag—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—these are my mistress's property—they are silver, and are worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I should think.</p>

I was passing No. 4, York-place, on the 22nd of January, and saw the prisoner come out of the area about twelve o'clock, or a little before—I saw the witness seize him, and am certain the man he secured is the man I saw come out of the area.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Russell-street, Brixton. About six or seven o'clock, on the 30th of May, I was in Kent-street—I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor—a party ran against him and pushed him down, and at the same time took his watch—the prisoner Walsh ran away with it, and Moore at<lb></lb>tracted the attention of the by-standers from the one who was running, by first attempting to raise the prosecutor from the ground, and then, before he was quite up, he dropped him again, and ran in a contrary direction to the other prisoner, saying, "Here he goes, here he goes," whereas, in fact, he was gone the contrary way—I am satisfied the prisoners are the persons.</p>

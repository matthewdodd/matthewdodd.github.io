             sworn. - I live with Mr. Jenkins as servant; am twelve years old, and know the nature of an oath: On Tuesday my master sent we with two legs of pork to the Gentleman and Porter, in Nichol-square; I put them in the tray on the bar-door for the lady to take which she liked of the two; she took the bigger one, and left the other in the tray; I turned my face to the tap-room while the mistress gave the men change; when I turned about the leg of pork was gone; I asked the lady about it; she said she did not know; then I went home, and told my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Which went out of the house first? - A. The three men; there was another with the prisoners.</p>
               <p> - BLAND sworn. - I am a cabinet-maker: On the 28th of December last, between twelve and one o'clock, I called at the Gentleman and Porter; on going in at the outward door on the lefthand is the bar directly by the door; the passage is rather narrow; there were several people standing at the bar, to the number of four or five, which rather obstructed my going forward; the first person next the outward door was Burgess; next to him was Charles, who had a leg of pork in his hand; a third person of their company was observing, that if it was to be baked, it would shrink up to nothing; the little girl stood close to the bar, and the tray was on the bar-door; they seemed to have got some change, and moved outward, which gave more room for me to pass, and I went into the tap-room; almost directly there was an alarm that the leg of pork was stolen; Charles was holding up the pork, looking at it, when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. Q. It was not concealed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And what was said was loud enough to be heard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Roberts.) What became of the other leg of pork? - A. The mistress took the other leg, and put it in the bar.</p>

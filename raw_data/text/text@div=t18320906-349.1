             (Police-constable F 69.) On the night of the 11th of August, I was on duty in Great Russell-street. I saw a crowd at the corner of Bow-street; when I got up, I saw Tipper surrounded with people; the prisoners were endeavouring to get from him - there were some men about who were trying to hustle the witness, and get the prisoners from him; I secured Harvey, and they were taken to the station-house; the witness said Harvey took the watch, passed it to Jones, and he took it from her hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is this from your station? A. From three to four hundred yards, and about fifty yards from the office; there were people about, and the corner shop was open - there were a number of persons there; it was a fair night - there was no rain; I believe the witness had a brown coat on - I observed nothing particular about his clothes or face; he told me he had been hustled and thrown down twice by the crowd - I did not see any dirt or mark on his clothes; when I got up, he seemed quite fatigued and harrassed; when I went up the crowd dispersed - we were not in hail of our station; he certainly did tell me that he had been knocked down- I heard him swear to that at Bow-street, and I was told of it by a gentleman I know, but who is not here; his name is Barns; he is a chemist in Great Russell-street - he came across the street, and told me a gentleman had been hustled, and I went over.</p>

            . The prisoner has worked for me between eight and nine years, in making up cloaks and hats: she came to my house almost every day. I moving from my house in Berwick-street, to Newman-street, near the Middlesex Hospital, I desired her to help me. After she had went a second time, I enquired for the piece of lace: she said I should find it among the things. After that I missed several other things; when I asked her about them, she made slight of them, but at last she owned the fine lace and some ribbons were sent to Chertsey in Surry, to her sister, to be sold. I went the same day to Chertsey, and shewed her sister the hand-writing of the prisoner of the things; then her sister gave me this letter (producing one) which I know to be of the prisoner's hand writing. (It is read in court.)</p>
               <p>The contents  were, that the prisoner had sent her some lace, which she said was very cheap, &amp;c. (The lace produced in court.)</p>

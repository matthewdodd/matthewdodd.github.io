                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday, the 28th of March, I was in Bethnal-green-road, and saw the prisoner coming by the church, towards the Salmon and Ball public-house—he was by himself, at large and at liberty—a little before I came to him I received information, in consequence of which I came in contact with him against the Salmon and Ball, and asked if he was not an escaped convict?—he replied that he was—I then took him to the station-house—he was intoxicated—he was walking by himself, unsupported by any one—he appeared to know what was said to him, and what his answers were—I have no doubt of that whatever—I did not hold out any promise or threat to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-Inspector K.</hi>) I was at Beth<lb></lb>nal-green station-house, on Tuesday, the 28th of March, when the prisoner was brought there. I did not make him any promise or threat—I asked him if it was true that he had returned from transportation—he said, "Yes; about fourteeu years ago I committed a burglary, for which I was tried at the Old Bailey, and transported for life; about four years since I effected my escape, by <hi rend="italic">slowing</hi> myself away in the hold of a ship, and I have been in England about four months"—I made him no answer, but that the door of the cell, and left him—he was drunk—I have not the least doubt that he knew what I said to him, and what answers he gave—before the Magistrate he admitted the conversation with me, but denied that it was true.</p>

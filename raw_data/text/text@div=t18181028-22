On the 6th of July, an acquaintance brought the prisoner to me, and asked me to let him be with me until he could get a lodging - He slept four nights with me. On Monday, in the morning, I was in the yard cleaning myself, to go to his ship with him, to get his things; I saw him take my watch off the nail - I did not suspect any thing-my wife was there. When I came into the room, he was gone.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280012"></xptr>was in the parlour with me. He asked me to change him a 5l., note. I laid three 1l., notes on the table, and went to the public-house to get a pen and ink - I left him in the room. When I returned, I missed him, the notes, and the watch - He never produced the 5l. note. About three weeks ago I met him, and gave him in charge. I have not seen the property since.</p>

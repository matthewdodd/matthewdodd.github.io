                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Stevens, and live at West Dray ton, in Middlesex. On the 5th of October I hung some things out to dry in the morning, in my garden—a woman went by about three o'clock, and told me to go out—I did not miss them then, but I did be<lb></lb>tween three and four o'clock—I saw the prisoner with them on the road—I saw her go down by the hedge, close by my house—my little girl was standing at the door—she said something, and I Went out and stopped her—the property was found on her.</p>

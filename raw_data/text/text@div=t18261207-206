               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you stand by while he was searched? A. Yes, and the other prisoner came up - I suppose I was with the officer two or three minutes - I am a shoemaker - I had the jaundice at the time; Smith said, "You yellow rascal, if you don't let me go, I will knock you down."</p>

            . I was in Poland-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I pursued Smith, and a gentleman stopped him - I took hold of him; he made great resistance, and said, if I did not let him go, he would cut my*** - Williams came up, and said that he had taken a gentleman's handkerchief - Smith said he had none; but I found this one in his pocket. Barley came up in a minute or two, and was taken; as Williams said he was the other - I have not found the gentleman.</p>

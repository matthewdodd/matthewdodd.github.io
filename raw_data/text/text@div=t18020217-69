               <p>Mrs. GILBERT sworn. - We live in a room over the stable, where the watch hung up; the prisoner came to our room about half past five in the evening, and staid there till my husband went out with the carriage, about half past nine; they had lived servants together; as soon as my husband left us, the prisoner went to the stable to clean it, and asked me to assist him; as soon as I went down stairs, he told me he wanted to go out, but had left his hat up stairs; he went up for it, and said he would return again in a few minutes, but desired me not to leave the stable before he came back; I waited above five or six minutes, and went up stairs, when I immediately missed the watch, which I am positive was hanging up over the fire-place; I was very much frightened, and as soon as I recovered, I alarmed a coachman in the Mews; the prisoner was taken into custody the next day.</p>

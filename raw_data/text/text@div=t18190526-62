            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 19th of May I was in company with Thomas Foy, Freeman, and Harrison, and saw the prisoner in Ivy-lane. He came into Paternoster-row; Harrison and

             seized him. We took him into Chapter Coffee-house-court, and told him he was suspected of passing forged notes, and asked what money he had about him? he said he had none, and repeated it over and over again. We proceeded to search him, he struggled very much; I thought it necessary to handcuff him, and while I was so doing, he endeavoured to put his left-hand into his right-hand waistcoat pocket, Harrison and

             prevented him. When he was handcuffed, I found in his right-hand waistcoat pocket six or 7 s. in silver, and three 1 l. forged notes, rolled up, and tied round with a piece of worsted. On taking them out, before I opened them, I asked him what they were, and where he got them from? he said he did not know what they were, or any thing about them. I said,</p>
               <p>"They are forged notes" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I hope not." I asked him who he had them from? he said it was no matter. He was taken to the Compter. I marked the notes, and gave them to Mr. Freeman. He gave no account of them before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did he not say a woman gave them to him to keep, and he did not know the contents - A. No. There was a woman near him, with a bundle of asparagus under her arm. He said,</p>
               <p>"I don't care what you do with me, so that you let the woman go." We searched her found nothing on her, and let her go. He swore that the woman should go - we would not let her go till we had searched her.</p>

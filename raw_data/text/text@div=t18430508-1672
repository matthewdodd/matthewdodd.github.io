                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Oak, in the parish of Lee. On Monday, the 15th of August, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and another person, came to my house, and directly ran up into the club-room—there is a passage between the club-room and my bed-room—the doors are opposite each other—I kept a cash-box in my bedroom—the pri<lb></lb>soner called for two slices of bread and cheese, and a pint of stout, and after<lb></lb>wards for another pint of stout, and a screw of tobacco—when I went up the third time, the prisoner said, "Landlord, will you let the door be open, for your room is so excessively hot"—I opened the club-room door at his request, and went down again—I observed a pocket-book on the table—about half an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner and the other coming down stairs—(Mrs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What sort of a watch was it? A. A silver hunting watch, No. 3,896; I gave information at Marlborough-street and Bow-street, and about a month after I lost it I received a letter from Mr. Read; I afterwards saw my watch at Hatton-garden - I said I considered it altogether worth 10l. or 12l., but it was given to me; I do not remember the Magistrate saying he thought that a great deal - the Magistrate said there was a mistake about the maker's name, but I believe it was in the pronunciation - it is Dubois, a French name.</p>

            . I am high-constable of Leeds. I apprehended the prisoner and some others at Leeds, on the 17th of April; I found this watch in his waistband, and another watch in his pocket, with this seal, ring and key attached to it - the number of this watch is 3,896; I asked who it belonged to, he said to his brother, and he had brought it that morning from Ripon to Leeds to be cleaned; the Mayor of Leeds directed it to be advertised, but no one owned it - I then searched the Hue and Cry from London, and found a description of the watch; I then told the prisoner I had found an owner for the property, and he said he would tell me the truth how he got it - that he had it of a Jew at Ripon, and had given his own watch and 26s. for it; I asked him if the key and seal which were to the other watch belonged to this - he said they did; the other watch he said he had had a long time, but did not say how long; I asked him if he had been in London - he said a long time ago, before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. What induced you to apprehend him? A. I found him with some suspicions characters - I took them all; the others were discharged; I was at the office when the prosecutor claimed the watch - he gave the same statement he has to-day; the Magistrate said there was a mistake in the advertisement in the name of Dubois - the prosecutor said it must be the mistake of the person who gave it.</p>
               <p>COURT to PROSECUTOR. Q. Was this seal and key attached to your watch? A. Yes, and this watch is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave my own watch and 26s. for this watch, to a Jew, at the Black Bull public-house, at Ripon.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner upwards of five years; I was informed in February last that he was at Ripon; I live within a mile and a half of that town - he was residing in the Market-place; I saw him there, but not every day - he has a very bad state of health; he sent for me from my own house to the Black Bull, to pay me for a pair of shoes, and to order another pair - this was the latter end of March; a man came in with a box of jewellery and other goods, and asked if we wanted any - I saw the prisoner give his watch, and 25s. or 26s., for a hunting watch, with a key and seal; it was such a one as this - I did not take notice of the ribbon.</p>

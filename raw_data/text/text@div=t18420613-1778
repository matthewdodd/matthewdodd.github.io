                  </hi>. I live at the Fox and Wheatsheaf, Three Colt-street, Old Ford, near Bow, in the parish of St. Mary, Stratford-le-Bow. On the night of the 1st of April I was the last person up on the premises—I retired to bed, as near as I can recollect, about half-past twelve o'clock—I fastened up—all the fastenings were secure all the way through the house—I make it a general rule to fasten up myself—the grating at the back of the house was secure—it is a fixture in brick-work, a flat iron grating, which yon may walk on—it goes over the kitchen area—the back-door was shut and bolted—there was no fastening to the window, but it was close down—I left the premises in that state when I went to bed—my servant came up about half-past five in the morning, and in consequence of what she said, I went down stairs, and found all the lower part of the premises in confusion—the iron grating was pulled up, and the brick-work which held it down was broken away—the window was open—the back door was fast—I did not find any other door open, except the cupboard and parlour doors—this was before six, as soon as the alarm was given—I searched and missed the property stated in the indictment, which is worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since seen the liquor-bottles and stand, work-box, one hearth-rug, the mouseline-de-laine, the white stockings, the picture, two volumes of Cook's Geography, and the two gallon bottles.</p>

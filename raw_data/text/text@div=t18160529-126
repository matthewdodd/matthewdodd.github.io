            . On the 14th of April, the prisoner at the bar came to me, and told me he had a great quantity of bolts to sell. I am a coach-maker, and I agreed with him to go and look at them the day following. I went and looked at them. I did not know at that time what capacity the prisoner was in; but after I had learned that he was in the employ of Messrs. Collingridge and Co. in <placeName id="t18160529-126-crimeloc681">Liquorpond street</placeName>

I accordingly went to him with a friend, and told him I was not satisfied concerning the bolts I had bought of him. After taking me to a great many places to see the person of whom he said he bought them, without effect, I determined to take them to Messrs. Collingridge, because I knew that if they were got from their premises, they would have the tools with which they were made. I went there, and as I was going along, the prisoner said, you appear dissatisfied, if you like I will give you your money back again; I told him no; that it was my determination to see the matter properly cleared up, and then I should be satisfied. When I took them to Liquorpondstreet, the prosecutors claimed them.</p>

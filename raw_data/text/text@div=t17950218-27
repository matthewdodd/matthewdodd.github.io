               <p>Q. Had you candles alight? - Yes. When I came to put the shutters up, and take the wire down, in Cornhill, the first wire was up and the other two were fell down; the one was found under the window, and the other laid over the pavement; there are three wires, and one holds the two others up.</p>
               <p>Q. How are they fixed up? - There are short pins at the bottom of the wires, that go into the holes where the shutters go.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was it broke? - Big enough for a man's arm to go in. Then I saw the tray that held the knives was drawn close to the pane of glass; which before stood two panes off, or very near, and the things in the tray were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that tray last? - I had seen the tray in the course of the day.</p>

            Did you miss articles of that description? - Yes, I knew of the articles that were in the window, I firmly believe the whole to be my property, but this wine funnel has got the private mark.</p>

               <p>Q. What may be the general value of all the things that are there that you believe to be your's? What may be the value of the things now produced? - About two guineas; but the woman has sold as many articles as fetched her five pounds fifteen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Good. When I was taken Mr. Armstrong asked me if I had got any money? I said, a guinea; and he said if I would give him two guineas he would let me go, and because I would not give two guineas he took me to prison and said he would try to get forty pounds by me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Vanderfall. I bought a watch at this woman's house. and Mr. Armstrong came into a public house where I was having a pint of beer, and when he searched me he found the duplicates of a watch and ring, and I told him where they were in pawn, and he could find no owner to the watch, and he took me to the office; I don't know nothing of this affair what he took me for now.</p>

            . I was minding this horse and chaise at Mrs. Rice's door; I went to get some tobacco, and left it for about ten minutes, when I came back it was gone; about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the chaise by the side of the road; I fetched Mr. Rice to see if it was his.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner on the night in question, in Whitechapel, with the harness on his shoulder; I followed him to Wellclose-square, he turned and asked me the way to Whitechapel. I asked where he got the harness, he said it came from Twickenham in an errand cart to the Three Tuns or Three Nuns public-house, and he was going to get it repaired; I took him to Whitechapel to enquire, and as we was going along, he said it was of no use for he bought it at Moulsey, at the fight; I then took him to the office, and he said the man would wonder what was become of the horse; I said</p>
               <p>"Why did you not take the horse:" he said he never took the prad because that would touch his life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at the Three Nuns in Whitechapel, and had been drinking, and as I came down the gateway, I met a man with the harness on his shoulder; it hit met and I said</p>
               <p>"Friend, keep the harness to yourself," he said</p>
               <p>"You may have it if you will give me a price;" I said I would give him 2 l. for it; we went on together, and finally it was agreed that I should give him 3 l.; I had but 2 l. 14 s. about me, but I told him if he would give me credit for 6 s. I would have it; I gave him my address, and was to see him the next morning.</p>

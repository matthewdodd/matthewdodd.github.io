            . Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he called on me in December, I do not recollect the day of the month; I was engaged as foreman; I knew Moulds the prisoner when he was an apprentice. When Moulds called upon me I and Mr. Markey was at a public-house, we all had some porter together. In the course of conversation Moulds asked me where it was likely for him to get sale for marble chimney pieces; I said I did not know any likelier place than about that quarter that I was employed in, there were so many builders to purchase; the prisoner went away. I saw the prisoner again on the week following, we went over to Lisson Grove where the prisoner was at work; Mr. Markey expressed a wish to see the chimney-pieces, he agreed to go with the prisoner and to see the chimney-pieces. We went into Locks fields, I saw the chimney-pieces, Mr. Markey and the prisoner agreed for the price; this was on Thursday, on Saturday Mr. Mackey was to send a cart, and on the Friday before that Saturday they were brought and delivered into the shop; I was not present; when I came home I found them in Mr. Markey's shop.</p>

On the Thursday following we went over to see the chimney pieces; this was Thursday, he was taken up on the Monday. Barnes, him, and me went to inspect these chimney-pieces, it was a long way from the other side of Westminster bridge; he shewed me the chimney-pieces, he asked Barnes in my hearing what they were worth, if he thought they were worth twelve pounds; I said I thought they were; Barnes said, there is Ellison's cart; I said, that will bring them over on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it proposed that you should send the cart and bring them away - A. Saturday was mentioned. On the Friday they were brought over in my absence; on Saturday morning I found they were on my premises.</p>

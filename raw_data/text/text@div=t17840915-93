               <p>Mrs. ALLEN sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of August, at seven in the morning, the prisoner came into my apartment, I was in the room, he took the watch and gown out of the room, I was in bed and saw him before he went out of the room, I did not see him come in, I called out Charles, I thought it was my husband, but I saw it was not him, and I was rather terrified: the prisoner went out, he was stopped and taken directly to the watch-house; I know the prisoner is the same person that was brought back, but I did not see his face in my room, his coat was the same colour, the watch and gown were found upon him, the gown was concealed in his foot-bag.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner run out of the street, and drop a foot-bag which seemed very heavy; I pursued him, and he was taken, the gown was in the bag, and the watch in his pocket.</p>

               <p>I searched the prisoner, and found this watch and gown on him, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Court. No, she does not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When you come to hear me speak, you will find it to the contrary; first you will observe, that such as watchmen, and thief-takers, and such sort of people as those, never come to swear for their King and country in this Court, but also for the money that is allowed by this government: also, the night before this happened, my brother came and told me, that another brother was very bad; in the morning about a quarter before six I arose, when I had dressed myself the clock had struck six; I set out to go to Knight's-bridge, and coming along Piccadilly, on this side the Haymarket, I heard the alarm of stop thief, and one man five feet high, and one man six feet high, one in a light coloured coat, and one in a drab coloured coat, one man took something from under his coat, but I cannot say what it was; he threw down a sack and immediately crossed to the other side of the way, I went over and took up the sack, I turned back and came towards Hare-street, and saw the prosecutrix stand there, in a smock and flannel petticoat, and I thought it was a horrid thing, and she said to me, I believe you are one of the thieves; and I was taken up, they all searched my coat pocket, and my breeches, and a man says to me (begging your pardon my Lord) damn me I will do for you now; he cried come along, follow me, and there were seven or eight more people, and they were all amazed, says one man, I will be on my oath, I put my hand in his coat pocket, and there was nothing; I pulled them inside out, but they are welcome to say what they please, I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Foster. Is there any truth in this? - None.</p>

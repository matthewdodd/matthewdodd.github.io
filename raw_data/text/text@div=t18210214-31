I was not alarmed, and got up about half-past six o'clock - it was dark, and about half-past seven o'clock I went on the lawn, and found a ladder standing against my master's bed-room window, which was broke and the shutter cut; some person had let down the top sash, and got down into the room - the drawers were broken open. I sent to town to my master, and the things remained as I found them till he came - it was daylight when I discovered it; I had a candle when I got up.

I told him I wished to take him respecting a robbery. In consequence of information, I and Wales went there again, we said we had come on an unpleasant business, and had a few questions to ask him, and begged he would take time before he answered, as it was a matter of consequence to him. I asked if he knew Robinson, (describing his person) and said I supposed him to be a companion of the baker; he said he knew no such man, either by name or description. I asked him if he had any boxes, bundle, or property left there by any person, or if he had bought any plate, and named a silver tea-pot. stand, and spoons? he said he had seen nothing of the sort; I said that was not true, and that I had a warrant to search his house, and again entreated him to tell me if he had any thing of the sort; he said he had not, but when I was about to search the house, he said there was a trunk left there by a man. I told him I would look at that presently. His wife in his presence gave us a key of a cupboard, in which I found four table-spoons and one gravy-spoons. I said those were the very things I wanted, and questioned him about the tea-pot and stand; he said</p>
               <p>"I will tell you presently." I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140017"></xptr>said</p>
               <p>"I must know immediately;" he then said they were at Danell's, a silversmith's in Oxford-street, to have his name engraved on them. I asked how he got them; he said he had them of Robinson, and to whom the box belonged, in payment of a score of 3 l. 15 s. He said he had nothing else from him. I took him up to his bed-room, and there we found four silver salt-spoons, plain; he said they were his own, and I left them there. There was a cloth marked P.P. he said he did not know how it came there. The prosecutor and I went next morning, and found the salt-spoons and took them away; Wales took the box. I went to Danells, and found the tea-pot, stand, and seven tea-spoons.</p>

             re-examined. I went with Plank, his account is perfectly correct. Drinkwater said the box belonged to a man who he called the gardener, but appeared not to know him by the name of Robinson. There was nothing particular in the box. I went to Danell's, and found the property.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Oxford-street. Drinkwater brought the tea-pot to have a new nob, and the bruises taken off, and a few days after he brought it back with the stand, to be engraved; I told him it appeared to have had initials or a crest taken out from the upper part; he said he thought it would bear engraving, and that he bought it.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I remember the tea-pot being brought back to be engraved. While had it Drinkwater came, and wanted to see some spoons; I shewed him some; he asked me if we took old silver in exchange? I said Yes; he then brought some spoons, for which I agreed to allow him one guinea. I remarked that the handles were old fashioned, and he said they were his wife's mother's, and had been in the family many years.</p>

               <p>ROBINSON. I took the plate from Mr. Parker.</p>

               <p>DRINKWATER'S Defence. I am sorry to be placed in this situation, as the mere dupe of these two fellows. I had taken the house about a fortnight, and Robinson was recommended to me by the late landlady as respectable. He came in a few days, and asked me to lodge him, but I could not. He said he was going into the country, and asked to leave the box till he returned. He called in a day or two, brought the plate into the bar, and I bought it of him not knowing it to be stolen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it not because you usually lock your door that you say you did so that morning? A. I will not swear it positively, but to the best of my recollection I locked it; I have not found the spoons and pins.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does your door shut with a catch lock? A. A common lock, with a handle - I am certain it was shut, and to the best of my knowledge it was locked.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 29th of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at the bottom of St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoner in Hemming's-row, with a bag and a handkerchief; I had seen him before, and followed him - I saw him first go on one side of the street, then on the other, and look behind him; I followed him as far as Green-street, Leicester-square; I then went up, and asked what he had got - he said clothes; I asked him whose they were - he said they were his own: I asked where he brought them from - he said that was another man's business; I said I should stop him on suspicion - I did so, and took him into a public-house; he remained there till I got more assistance - he was very resolute, and said he would not be stopped; I got further assistance, and secured him; I took possession of the bundle, and now produce it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you he had bought them of a gentleman's servant? A. Yes, when he got to the station, but not till then; it is not above ten minutes' walk - he said he bought them of a gentleman's servant that day, for 2l. 8s.; I did not find the spoons - I found no housebreaking implements on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

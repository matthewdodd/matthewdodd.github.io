             M'Daniel. These things here produced are the prosecutrix's property.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. She said these things were her own.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by these childrens things?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I went over to Virginia to my godmother, who was also my aunt; she left them to me. I have a great deal of cloaths besides these things. These were taken out of my box in the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>These things are my own; one of the caps she took off my child's head, which I bought in the Change two years ago. At the same time she says her box was broke open. She lay in the same bed with me. Three days after she had been in my house, she sent to me to know if she had left such a bundle of child-bed linnen in my house. The other woman that stands there, said, she offered them to sale. I never saw any such things; she complained her box was broke open, while in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Where is the cap that was taken from the child's head?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is here. [Producing it, compared with the other, they agree.]</p>
               <p>Q. to Mackdaniel. Look at this cap?</p>
               <p>Mackdaniel. I know this to be the prosecutrix's property. </p>

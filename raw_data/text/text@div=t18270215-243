On the 17th of January, he asked if I was going to dinner- I said, Yes; he said he would put a shilling in my way, and in his own way too; he asked me to take twelve cocoa-nuts to his house; he selected them, counted them, and told me to take them; I told my master of it, and he told me to take them; I then took them to his house, and left them there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You told him to take them, if the prisoner desired him? A. Yes; the prisoner lived with me about six months - he was formerly in the trade; he was in distress when I took him; I never told him to take what he liked and I should be satisfied if he gave me an account of them - I never gave him leave to sell any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never go to his house, and say, "Sell those nuts for me?" A. Yes, - that was before he was in my employ; I always paid his wages regularly - he once bought two dozen dry nuts of me.</p>

I was fetched by Castello; I followed Barry to Petticoat-lane, to the prisoner's house; I went in afterwards, and the prisoner's mother said there were no nuts, but under the counter I found thirty-one in a basket - twelve of them have milk, the others are all dry.</p>

            . I was servant to the prosecutor. The night before the prisoner was taken I heard the prosecutor say he might take as many cocoa-nuts as he chose, and have them drawn off from his wages at the end of the week - he often said so - he said it every evening when they were talking - I do not live there now; he was to take as many as he could sell, and account for them at the end of the week; I am sure this was said the night before he was taken. Mistress and I fell out, and she gave me warning - I was not before the Lord Mayor.</p>

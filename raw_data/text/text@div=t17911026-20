I marked the spoons after they were found.</p>

               <p>I was employed by the prosecutor, on the 19th of October, about seven, I met my master, he begged me to stop to be searched, the three prisoners were ordered to stand by themselves in the parlour. My master read<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179110260018"></xptr>the letter; during that time one dozen of spoons were laid on the chair behind where Clinch stood, and I heard a rustling, and saw Owen shuffling something into his bosom. I asked him what he had there, he said he had nothing, but turned round, and attempted to pull off his coat, and there was a bundle laid on the ground between his legs; neither Clinch nor Blair stooped down at this time; there was a carpet on the room and a cloth over that, and each spoon was in a single paper.</p>

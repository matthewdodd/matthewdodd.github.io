On Thursday evening, the 20th of March, I was at the Lion and Lamb at Hoxton - I was in liquor - I walked away towards Bishopsgate-street - I and my shipmate had a quarrel at the corner of Ashford-street - I walked away from him - a man came up to me, tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me about some vessel - he walked with me, and we had something to drink in Pitfield-street - we then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100059"></xptr>went on towards Norton Falgate, went into another public-house, and had a pint of half-and-half - I had two £5 notes and some silver in my pocket - I had been paid that day - the man looked to me like a dyer - I do not see him here - he was with me about an hour, I should think: when we came out of that house the air took effect on me, as I had been smoking - I got to Bishopsgate-street, and then missed my two £5 notes, which must have been taken out of my pocket - they could not have got out - these are them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know them? A. By taking the number of them - I was tipsy, and do not know the man who was in my company for an hour - the notes were in my inside waistcoat pocket, which was buttoned - I had not lost them when I was in the public-house - I was not so overcome then as I was when I got out - I felt them as I came out; and when I missed them my waistcoat was unbuttoned - I think I met the man about nine o'clock in the evening - I should think I was with him an hour - I quitted him a little after ten o'clock - whoever the man was, he must have been with me between half-past five and half-past ten o'clock.</p>

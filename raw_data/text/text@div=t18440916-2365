                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 5, Northampton-place, Old Kent-road, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. On the 26th of Aug. I went to bed at twelve o'clock at night—the house was fastened—I noticed the door leading to the garden, on the kitchen stairs, was fastened—the stair-case window was down, but not fast<lb></lb>ened—I put my hand to it, and found it was down—I was awoke at two mi<lb></lb>nutes before six, by my watch, as I looked at it—I had made it five minutes too fast on the Sunday previous, for a particular purpose, and have every reason to believe it was not really six at the time—my watch goes well—as I came down I noticed the stair-case window open, and in the back parlour and surgery a great many lucifer-matches were strewed about—they did not</p>

On the 27th of Aug., about eight or nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and offered me the upper parts of six tea-spoons, broken asunder, and several pieces of surgical instruments—I asked how he became possessed of them—he said he found them in the New-cut, Lambeth, and considered them his property—not being satisfied with his statement I called a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

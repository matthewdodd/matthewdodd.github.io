I perceived two men, one in blue and the other in a light drabbish coat; and I heard two women cry stop thief! and immediately the man in blue passed me; I followed him, and he turned down the stable-yard in Weymouth-street, on the right-hand; I followed him, within ten yards of him; I saw him heave something from him white; I crossed over to stop him; he knocked me down; then I picked up the bundle to give it to the person it belonged to, which I did, and gave it to the gentleman.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that there is no other person who sells hair, that could tie the hair exactly the same way as you have done? - I can swear they could not do it so exactly, but I could know my own tie from any other.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Are you sure as to the identity of the prisoner coming to you on the 25th of April, with any hair at all? - Yes, I am positive of it; it was on Easter Monday, it was on the day the bills were printed.</p>
               <p>I have witnesses to prove him in another place, therefore I warn you before you give an answer? - It was on Easter Monday, and it was the very day the bills were printed, I am certain of the day.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Your Lordship sees the indictment charges it to be committed on the 7th, which could not be.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the nature of the prisoner's disorder such as confined him to the hospital, and that he could not go out occasionally? - Certainly, the hospital confines them to it, they will not let them go out.</p>
               <p>Are those that are in the hospital so confined? - Not without leave of the surgeon or physician, or by a discharge.</p>
               <p>But such a leave would be on application given? - Yes, if he asked it, but he never did.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - Because I should have known, because he was under a particular gentleman, that is Doctor Pitcairn, and if he had said he had wanted to go out, the doctor would have said, let the sister know when you go out and when you come in.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear here that this prisoner at the bar was never out of the hospital from the 1st of April to the 8th? - Not to my knowledge he was not.</p>
               <p>But he might without your knowledge? - He went down stairs to fetch provisions, we give them leave to do that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080061"></xptr>How many persons have you under your care? - Fifteen.</p>
               <p>Can you give an account of every thing these fifteen persons did during that week? - When I am present I can, but not otherwise.</p>
               <p>Do you believe that that man was in the hospital without going out, from the 1st of April to the 8th? - He was to my knowledge, I know we sent him down stairs, he had his linen washed in the place, so he did not go out for it.</p>
               <p>- NIGHTINGALE sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known this man some time, I can say nothing only he has been a journeyman barber ever since I knew him.</p>

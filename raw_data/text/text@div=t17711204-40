The prisoner took a lodging of me on the 18th or 19th of September; he was to give me two shillings and six-pence a week for a two pair of stairs room; he continued in his lodging till last Thursday week. When he was gone, I missed two sheets out of the room: they were there when he took the lodging, and they were for his use.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness; the prisoner took a lodging of us; the things were missing; the wife had a pair of sheets to change the bed; they quarrelled and fought; he used then to beat her. I went up, and she pulled the bed-down; I saw there was no sheets on the bed. I got a neighbour to help to get the things out of the room, for I would not let them be there any longer. On the morrow, when they got up, I asked the prisoner's wife for the sheets she had to change the bed, and I put a pair to the fire; I desired her to bring down the dirty sheets; she came down and brought a candle, and set it on the stairs, and went out; she took the sheets from the back of the chair out with her, and pawned them. The constable was sent for: he would not acknowledge any thing about them then; but as they were going to the justice, he acknowledged they were pawned. He followed no good, for he was always a-bed in day-time, and out at night.</p>

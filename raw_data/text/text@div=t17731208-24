I am porter to the prosecutors: on the 28th of October, about five o'clock in the evening, I locked the door and went to Exeter-street to supper; I returned at eight o'clock and took the key out of my pocket to unlock the door; when I put my hand to the door it flew open, and I saw the prisoner Harding.</p>

               <p>Kennedy.

(The pick locks produced). They are what they call in their cant language dubbs.</p>

            . I met Rooker and Harding about seven o'clock; they asked me to fetch these tools, which they asked me to carry home; before I did fetch them, they agreed to go to some shop to break it open; I stood and covered them; I did not enter the shop: they wrenched the staple off the door and then got into the shop; Rooker gave the things to me; this young woman stood by. I was afraid to have any thing to do with them; I took hold of the corner of her apron and chucked them into it; she was going to throw them into the kennel; I bid her go with them. They bid me fetch a candle; going to Temple Bar, I heard that Harding was taken. In the passage by the church I saw Rooker and this young woman talking together; he asked me to get the things to go out again; I said I was afraid. I drank a pint of beer with him, and left him, and went home.</p>

               <p>Kennedy. Yes, since my master and mistress took the shop I have lodged in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that do you know whether the shopman or porter used to lodge in it?</p>

               <p>The night this unfortunate affair happened I had been at the Black Lion in Wych-street; Chivers was sitting at the same time there; he went out and staid for the space of some minutes; he came in again, and asked me if I was going home, but in the mean time made me as much in liquor as possible; I answered in the affirmative, and said as he was going part of my way I would accompany him; I knew him, but did not know what course of life he followed; when we came by St. Dunstan 's church he went without hesitation to a shop; if it had been broke open it was before he went in at the door; he gave me some things and desired me to put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080019"></xptr> them in my pocket; as he was going to carry them down to Fleet-market, and he had more than he could conveniently take himself, I accordingly took them and put them in my pocket, and he went to get a candle, and then this person, I take to be Kennedy, came and went in, and finding the door open, two people rushed out, and struck him down, and I being terrified, as I had the property about me, and dreading the consequences seeing them run, I ran as fast I could; a number of people pursued me, and I went down Temple-lane, where I was stopped, and the property taken from me that is now produced. I am really innocent of the robbery, and of any intent to commit it.</p>
               <p>Rooker's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the affair; I have been in company with that Chivers; I was with him at the Black Lion the night the robbery was done; after he was gone about an hour, a report was brought that this Harding was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. to Kennedy. Which knocked you down?</p>
               <p>Kennedy. I cannot say.</p>

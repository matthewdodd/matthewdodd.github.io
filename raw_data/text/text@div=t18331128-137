I saw the two prisoners close behind the prosecutor; Rockall stepped up in front of the other prisoner, and took a handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket - I took hold of him immediately; he scuffled and threw the handkerchief down - I told my brother officer to go and tell the prosecutor that his pocket was picked- the prosecutor returned and took up his handkerchief - we took the prisoner to the station-house - Brown stood close by; he was taken by another officer - I had not seen the prisoners speaking to one another.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the other officer see the handkerchief thrown down? A. I do not know; he was close by me - he was running after the prosecutor when it was thrown down.</p>

             (police-constable E 86). I was there, and saw the prisoners walking by the side of each other; I did not see them speak together - I saw Rockall step before the other prisoner, behind the gentleman and lady; he put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, and

               <p>Rockall's Defence (written). About eight o'clock on the evening in question, I was hastening home, through Holborn, to my father's house, when to my surprise, I was taken into custody on the present charge; and what added to my surprise was, that the prisoner Brown was taken as an accomplice. I can assure you, my Lord, that I never saw him, before he was apprehended.</p>

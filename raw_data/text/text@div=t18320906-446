            . I go out washing. On the 15th of August, I had been to Tabernacle-walk - I had some ale given to me, which I am not used to, and was used very ill by some prostitutes; when I left home I had two shillings, a sixpence, three pennies, and five halfpence, in my pocket, with a bit of stone-blue; my pocket strings were broken, and the pocket snatched off by a man who came up to me, and said something abusive; the Policeman came up and asked where I lived; I know I had half an ounce of stone-blue in my pocket - I do not know the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner in Church-street, with his arm round the prosecutrix's waist; I was looking after him, as it was suspected he would rob her - I saw him run from her, and run down Club-row; she called out, "You have got my pocket" - she was in liquor, but sober enough for that; I then pursued him, but he got away; Shippey, a private watchman, took him in about an hour, and gave him to me - I searched, and found on him two penny-pieces, and some stone-blue; Shippey picked up a pocket; he must have gone down where it was found.</p>

On the 3rd of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was going home, and had got within one hundred yards of my own door - the prisoner ran across the street, and took hold of my left arm, which was towards her; my purse was in my left-hand waistcoat pocket - there were 24s. or 25s. in silver in it and five sovereigns; she held my arm so violently that I could not get rid of her - when we got about twenty or thirty yards further, which was about half-way between where she first accosted me and my own door, she quitted me, and ran up one of the courts; I missed my purse, and ran after her - she went up one or two courts, and came back again to the court she first ran up; I came up to her there - she was stopping, and seemed to be secreting something; two sovereigns fell from her on the pavement, and the purse was in her hand - I took the purse, and part of the silver was in it, but none of the sovereigns; there was some silver in her pocket, which, with what was in the purse about made up the quantity I had in my purse - I went with her to the Police-office, where she was searched; I should think about a minute and a half had elapsed from the time of her first running and my taking her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. I should think it wanted a quarter to twelve o'clock - I very frequently take a walk round Lincoln's Inn-fields; I did not speak to her first - I only told her to go about her business; I did go twenty or thirty yards with her, but I must have knocked her down if I had not; she did not accuse me of soliciting her; I dare say she asked me to go with her, or something of that kind - I told her to go about her business twice or thrice; I had taken fast hold of her when the Policeman came up; she did not state, in my presence, that I had given her the silver: my purse was in my pocket, as it is now, and the only way she could have got it was with the hand that was through my arm; I did not go into any court with her - when she was first taken she said she had not so much as would purchase a glass of gin; I can only account for the money being in her pocket by her putting it in as she ran away - she did not say that I had given her the five shillings, and that the seven shillings in her pocket she had got to pay a bill for a woman named Bryan - I think I had seen the prisoner before: I judge that by her person, not her voice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the purse contain? A. Five sovereigns and about 24s., as near as I can calculate; I recovered two sovereigns and the silver, the purse was in her hand.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer; I heard a cry of Police! - I came up, and Mr. Dixon had hold of the prisoner; he said she had robbed him of five sovereigns - he had the purse in his hand, and said he had taken it from her hand - I found five or seven shillings in her hand, and in her pocket I found some more silver; I took her to the station house, but I found no more, though I made her strip.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search every part of her? A. Yes: I cannot exactly say how much money I found in her pocket - she said the money in her pocket was her own; she said so in the presence of Mr. Dixon, and she said it all through - but she said at first that she had not the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080039"></xptr>price of a glass of gin; I searched every place about there for the three sovereigns, but I could not find them; the prisoner did not mention the name of Mrs. Bryan - the inspector asked her address; I do not know whether she gave it right or not, I did not go to it, - it was Fetter-lane, but I do not recollect the number - she did not say who she lived with.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Chancery-lane, and this man met me; he put the 5s. into my hand, and said he wanted to speak with me - I would not comply with him; he called the Policeman, and gave charge of me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.What time do you leave off work? A.Sometimes as late as nine or ten o'clock - she lives at No. 28, St. Clement's-lane: I believe at a lodging-house for tradespeople - I cannot account for her being at a quarter before twelve o'clock in Chancery-lane; I suppose she left my place between eight and nine.</p>

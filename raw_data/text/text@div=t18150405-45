I suspected him, that he was the person that had taking my pocket book from me; I ran, and took hold of him; he threw the pocket book away from him, from under his coat; my friend picked the pocket book up, and delivered it to me; it contained a note for twenty pounds, and eighteen pounds. This is the pocket book; it is mine.</p>

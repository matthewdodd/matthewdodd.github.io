               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Which of your customers have lost any silk? A. They did not complain of any loss - they said I returned the silk very damp, and asked if they had all their silk - there is a boy and girl who do nothing but tie up silk - other persons do it sometimes - I had not missed any silk, that I know of, but my customers complained - this silk would be kept in the skeining room, if it were in my care - I went to France about two months ago - when I returned, I went all over my place - I did not miss this silk - I do not deal in silk, but when I have it left on my hands, I do the best I can with it - that is damaged silk - I have sold Dumar damaged silk very like this - I never authorized any person to sell silk for me - I think the prisoner has been six years in my employ - when manufacturers send me silk to dye, they send the weight, and it is weighed when it goes home - the prisoner chiefly attended to the weight with the street man - he did not tell me, when I returned from the continent, of this silk being detained at Mr. Lane's, till he was called into the parlour - he then turned, and said, "You know I took it, as I have done before" - I had a partner before I went into the country - his name is Davis.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could you give this silk to any body to sell? A. No; I could not - when I returned I had perhaps 3000lbs. of silk in my house - Mr. Machu was a customer of mine - this silk was supposed to belong to him.</p>

            . I am a silkman, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the 11th of September, a woman called on me in the afternoon - she brought two small samples of silk, and the next morning she brought 34lbs. or 35lbs. - I had some conversation with her - I afterwards saw the prisoner - I told him what had passed between me and the woman - when I first saw her she said she had some silk to sell, would I buy it - I said I could give no answer till I sw the bulk - she stated she could not bring it that afternoon, as she lived a considerable distance off - I asked her where, and she said in the Commercial-road - she then went away - on the following morning, she drove up to my door in a cab, and brought about 34lbs. of silk - this is part of it - she stated the silk had belonged to her father and mother, and had been in her possession two years - I asked her her name, and she said it was Jones, and she lived at No. 3, Lower Chapman-street, Commercial-road - I detained the silk, and told her to come with her husband, which she did in the afternoon - the prisoner was introduced as her husband - I asked him his name, he said, "Jones," and that he lived in Lower Chapman-street, Commercial-road - he said he was a cabinet-maker - I stated I had detained the silk, and should do so till he could give me a satisfactory account of how he became possessed of it - he stated the same as his wife had, that it had been the property of her father and mother, and their name was Jones - I asked him how it was that the name of Jones was attached to all the family - he said, after a moment's hesitation, "That is all right, we were first cousins, and we married" - I noticed that he had a pair of black gloves on - he pleaded great ignorance about silk, and said he knew nothing about it - I afterwards saw him at Mr. Labussiere's - he was summoned into the room for me to identify him - I said, "This is the man who came to me about the silk" - he said, "I will tell you all about it," and turning to Mr. Labussiere, he said,"You know I had the silk from you to part with, the Friday before you went to France - you called me and gave me that bag of silk - told me to put it to rights and dispose of it, as I had done former parcels" - he was then taken into custody.</p>

            . I am partner with Mr. Labussiere. I went into partnership with him about four months ago - I think the beginning of June - there is silk comes from Mr. Machu's, generally speaking, every day - this is the dye-house book - I see by an entry of my own that Mr. Machu's silk was all cleared off on the 18th of August, and on that day we received from him 106-3 of Bengal sewings, which corresponds with the number of this silk, and 54-5 came in at the same time - on the 24th of August, we received 24-6, and more afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As you were not a partner before June, you cannot tell what he received before that time? A. I cannot - he had received a great quantity according to the book - the mark I spoke is No. 15 - it is the mark of the cotton to distinguish different manufacturers' silk - it is only the quality of the silk - here are two knots with a coarse cotton, No 15, which corresponds with the mark on the 106-3.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you, to the best of your knowledge, believe that this is part of the 106-3? A. I do.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any means of believing that except from the number? A. No; it answers to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160051"></xptr>number in the book - it is impossible to miss what is taken.</p>

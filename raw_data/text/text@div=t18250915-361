I took the prisoner into my employ in May last, in consequence of having a good opinion of him. I was to give him 50 l. a-year, and to find a lodging in my warehouse for himself and family. I left town on the 12th of August, and left fifty bundles of worsted in my warehouse; when I had been absent a little time I received a letter, and returned to town. I went to my warehouse, but the prisoner was not there. I saw him on the afternoon of the 20th, and asked him what worsted had been sent out in my absence. He said none. I missed a considerable quantity. I went home, and the key of the warehouse was sent me the following evening about seven o'clock. I went next morning, and found the prisoner, his wife and child were gone away. There were several boxes left belonging to him - they were opened, and some papers found in his desk were open, and this paper was found in it - reads "Messrs, Block and Son, Dr. to - ." as if it were the beginning of an invoice. I afterwards saw Mr. Block, who shewed me this paper in the prisoner's hand-writing. I caused a search to be made, and found him on the Thursday evening following, in the Edward-road; he ran away - I set up a hue and cry, and he was taken - here is a sample of worsted which was found in his box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. From what part of the kingdom did the prisoner come? A. From Birmingham - about two years ago - he had been in good circumstances - his wife is related to mine; I had perfect confidence in him - my suspicions were excited by the letter I had received - when I returned the prisoner was there - I did not use any harsh expressions to him - when he went he left his desk open, and his boxes locked - he had no business to deal for any other person. I cannot swear the worsted - all I can say is, that this is like some I had in my possession, and which other persons must have likewise. The property is my own, and is regularly consigned to me by invoice.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Has your worsted any particular number? A. Yes; this is No. 12 slack worsted - the bulk of my worsted is on the ground floor, to which the prisoner had access - when I returned there were twenty-six bundles missing.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Block. The prisoner was the man who brought the worsted to my masters.</p>
               <p>JAMES CASTLE. I live at No. 7, Bull's-head-court. About nine o'clock in the morning of the 17th or 18th of August, I saw a light cart, painted green, draw up to the door of No. 1, and sixteen or eighteen brown paper parcels were tossed into it, two at a time. I have seen the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150137"></xptr>bundles that remain at the prosecutor's warehouse, and they seem exactly like those.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARLOW re-examined. Q. Had the prisoner any authority to sell goods for you? A. Yes; if application was made to him, but he was not to make application. My price at that time was 2 s. 8 d. per lb. I had no other clerk nor porter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the return of Mr. Barlow from Halifax, he accused me of stealing worsted; I distinctly denied it, and said "The quantity of worsted is the same as you left it," which it certainly was - many words arose out of it, and he said, "I am desired by my employers to discharge you instantly - however painful to my feelings I must instantly discharge you;" "I am sorry, Sir," said I "but I dare say I can find other employment." I was taken five days afterwards, in the Edgware-road, where my wife was about to open a little shop; I took the key over to him myself; it was not a clandestine departure. - A good deal has been said about my boxes; when I was taken the prosecutor said, "Do you know any thing of any cutlery" - I said, "My boxes are all there, search my papers, my pocket-books, and every thing for proofs (if you can find them) of my infidelity" - there was not a lock on any box. A good deal has been said about a bit of worsted being found in my desk - these samples were about the warehouse, and I was in the habit of shewing them - it might have been in my pocket; because five individuals had applied for samples, which I had shewn them - it might have been in some of my apartments, but it was not in my boxes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARTON re-examined. Q. How long was it before you left that you saw these fifty bundles of worsted? A. On the morning I left (the 12th of August) - on my return I discharged the prisoner, on my own authority - I never said that any persons had directed me to discharge him. On the Thursday after he left he sent a note to me, with a cart, and desired the goods that were left might be given up to him; and the carter told me, with a great deal of reluctance, that he was not to go to a house, but to meet the prisoner in the Edgware-road, opposite the New-road, Paddington; I went there, and met him. I did not know of any house being taken.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

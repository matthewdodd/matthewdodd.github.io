               <p>Q. Were they all pledged in the same name? - Yes. On April the 16th, in the morning, about half after eight o'clock, he brought two more desert spoons, which he offered to pledged; by his appearance at that time of the morning, I thought every thing was not right; I interrogated him particularly; he told me that he lived at No. 12, Green-street, Liecester-square; I asked him if he should have any objection to my going to the house to know if he lived there, as he was an entire stranger to me?</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your shop? - St. Martin's-lane, No. 32. He said, no, none in the least; I might go and make inquiries, and find that he did live there; he was a lodger in the house. I went and made inquiry, but there was no such person lived there, nor they did not know one of the name.</p>
               <p>Q.He did not go with you? - No, he did not; he was kept in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What you left him in custody? - Yes. I came back and told him I had been where he told me to go, and that they told me there was no such person lived there; he said, you have been wrong, I will go with you and point out the house to you; and going up Clement's-row he walked slowly, which made me believe that he would run away, and in Remmings-row he said, to tell you the truth, I do not live there, but in Duke-street, Westminster; I asked him if he really did live there? - he said, yes; says I, then I will go with you. At the bottom of Castle-street, I then asked him again, if he really did live there? - he said, yes; and going down the passage that leads to Mr. Paine's, the bookseller, I again asked him; and he trembled very much, and attempted to run away. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200156"></xptr>immediately secured him, and by the assistance of some that were coming by, had him conveyed to the watch-house. In about an hour afterwards this here bill(produces a bill) was brought into my shop, which led to a discovery to whom they belonged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There were three several pawnings of these? - No, he came three times, but two pawnings.</p>

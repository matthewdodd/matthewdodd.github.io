            . I was standing at my Master's Door, the Corner of Salisbury-Court, and saw 2 Fellows stop at Mr Harrington's Stall (I have seen them in the Street before, and took them to be idle sort of People, at other Times) I looked at them and saw the Prisoner put round his Hand to the Corner of the Post, and take a Piece of Fish off a Kit; as soon as I saw him, I cried out to Mr Harrington, and he and I ran after him about half a Dozen Doors; but before Mr Harrington overtook him he had thrown the Fish from him; but I did not see him do it; Mr Harrington took hold of him by the Collar, and the Prisoner cried out, some Body had hit him on the Eye; Harrington asked him for the Salmon, and he said, he had it not: I thought I saw something in the Channel, and I went and took the Fish out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the Person?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes, I am; for though it was Night it was as light as the Day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabman, and live in Rawstorne-street, St. John-street-road. On the 18th of October I employed the prisoner Dawson to exercise a horse for me—he did not bring it back—in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation I received I caused the two prisoners to be apprehended—the horse was worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not authorise the prisoners or anybody to make sale of it—I only employed Dawson.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not call me out of the public-house, on Thurs<lb></lb>day evening, and say I might sell it for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and all I got above that I might keep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never said so to any person—the horse was never to be sold—I never had such a thought—I asked you if you would lead it up and down to exercise, as you were almost starving, and wanted something to eat—the horse was in a very bad state—I did not tell you to take it to the knacker's and get it killed—it was not worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the state it was then—it was worth nothing hardly at that time, but it would have been when it got well—it had been a very good horse, but had had a misfortune and fallen down—I gave you some halfpence to lead it about—I had employed you several times before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier, and live in Three Tun-court, Bun-hill-row.

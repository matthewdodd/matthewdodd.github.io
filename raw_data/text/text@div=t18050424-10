            ; two of them lived at Manchester, and one at Bethnal-green; I was the only person that kept the house: On the 18th of March last, about half past six, I was just come from my tea, the accompting-house is up one pair of stairs, I was about to go down stairs to shut the street door; I heard a gentle rustling of the straw in the passage, I suspected that somebody was at the packs, which stood in the passage; I came gently about half way down stairs, and saw the prisoner at the bar with his hands upon a pack of goods: I quickened my steps, and he turned from me and went towards the door; as I went down I perceived lying upon this pack, two white pieces of calico; I immediately ran and seized the prisoner; I asked him what he had been doing, he said he had been inquiring for a situation, I told him he had been cutting open that pack; I called for assistance to a person in the court; I returned to the pack, and found it had been cut open, out of which the two pieces before-mentioned had been taken, and a third piece was about half way out of the pack; I of course concluded that the prisoner was the man who had cut open the pack, and meant to take them away; I sent for a constable, and had the man immediately taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that they were removed from the place where they actually were? - A. The pack was cut open with a knife, and these things were taken from the inside, and laid upon the outside wrapper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At the time this transaction took place you were not a partner in the house? - A. No, I had no interest in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner saw you, he told you he wanted a place? - A. He asked me for a place; I said, I have got a place for you, and took him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the goods were separated from the rest of the parcel? - A. The bale was really open, and these two pieces were separated from the rest, and a third piece was partly out.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable: I produce two pieces of calico; I saw these two pieces lying at the top of the pack, on the outside of the pack, and another piece was half out of the pack; I took him into custody and searched him, and in his left hand pocket I found that knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You found that knife in his pocket, so you might in any other man's pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Jones.) Q. Did you contribute towards paying the rent at that time? - A. No, except by my service.</p>

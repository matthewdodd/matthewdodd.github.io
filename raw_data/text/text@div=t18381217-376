                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Saturday evening, the 15th of December, I was coming over Tower-hill about a quarter past six o'clock, and saw a cart with some packages coming from Tower-street—it turned down towards Thames-street—I saw two men following it—it was light enough for me to distinguish them—I took notice of them, and am quite positive the prisoner was one—I did not know him before—I suspected and watched them, and as they got under a lamp, I saw the prisoner, and the other man make a pull at a package behind the cart, but did not get it out—they made a second attempt, close against a gas lamp, took the package out, carried it about eight yards, to a coach rank, and placed it behind a coach—I immediately followed them, and they made their escape—I re<lb></lb>turned, and gave the bale in charge of the sentry at the Tower-gate—I then went towards Thames-street, and saw the prisoner coming along, running back in the same direction, as he had run away, breathing very hard, with his handkerchief to his mouth—I secured him, and said, "You are my prisoner," and asked where he came from—he said he had come from over the water—I took him up the hill, and gave him to another constable—I said, "You are the man that stole the bale"—he said he was innocent of it, he knew nothing about it—I had lost sight of him for about two minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the Rifle Corps. At a quarter after six o'clock I was sentry at the gate of the Tower—I saw a cart come out of Tower-street, and two men following it—just as it came into Thames-street I saw them make a pull at the cart—I am perfectly certain the prisoner is one of them—they made two pulls at the bale before they got it—when they got it they planted it behind a hackney coach—Singer went up to them—they saw him, and ran away—the prisoner came running up close to me, and made a blow at me—I had my rifle in my hand, and held it out to stop the blow—I am certain he is the man, he ran so close to me 1 could not help seeing his face—there were two lamps near me—Singer af<lb></lb>terwards brought the bale to me, and came back himself in about two minutes with the prisoner—I delivered the bale in the same state to him.</p>

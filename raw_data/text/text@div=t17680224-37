            . The watchmen told me they had taken a man, last Saturday was se'nnight, in ripping and cutting of lead belonging to Mr. Isgrave, a tenant of mine; I attended the examination before Mr. Girdler, it was the prisoner at the bar; he was charged upon oath of two watchmen; he there confessed he did rip the lead and threw it down, but denied that he had any intention to take it away; the Justice asked him if he intended to do it in play; he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own that any body was concerned with him?</p>
               <p>Stevens. He said there was no body concerned but himself.</p>
               <p>- Bagget. I am a watchman; about half an hour after four, last Saturday morning was se'nnight, I happened to be coming by the back-side of the soap-house, I heard something fail; I stopped, and my brother watchman came; I told him I suspected there was somebody robbing the place; we both got over into the place, there we saw a brass candlestick with a light in it on the ground, that was soon blowed out; there was a ladder against a beam on the inside the soap-house; we stood there about ten minutes, then came down a piece of lead, after that a hatchet; the prisoner came down the ladder, we started from behind the door, and took him; he lived in the neighbourhood; there were 160 pounds weight of the lead; we took the prisoner to the watch-house, and after that he was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Weatherall. I went up the ladder about a quarter after five that morning, and found about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240024"></xptr> ten feet of lead belonging to a gutter was cut away, and the other end of the gutter had twice the quantity cut off; that seemed to have been done before, by the appearance of the wood work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was lying there, I heard a noise in the soap-house, I went up the ladder to see who was doing the mischief; I did not cut the lead.</p>

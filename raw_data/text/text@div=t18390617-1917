                  </hi>. I am a widow and a tobacconist, and live at Hem<lb></lb>mings-row, St. Martin's-lane. About four in the afternoon of the 25th of May, I was in my back parlour—I looked up, and saw the prisoner leaning over the counter as far as he could reach—I got up and came into the shop—he was leaning over the right side of the counter—I passed him and saw a</p>

               <p>box of cigars moved from the window, and placed on the glass case which he was near—I said, "What have you been doing with these, you have moved them from the window?"—he said he had not—I said, "I am certain you have, and I will send or go for a policeman"—I looked in the window, and saw the bundle was moved—I said, "There is a bundle gone from the win<lb></lb>dow, what have you done with them?"—he said, "I have not taken them"—I felt about him, and felt something under his arm—I opened his coat, and all the cigars fell into his apron—I am sure they were mine—I turned and shut the street-door, and pushed him farther from the street-door, till I got him to another door, and during that time a person came down stairs, hearing a noise—the prisoner cried, and said, "Pray don't give me in charge, my mother has got nine children"—with a good deal of trouble I got him to this other door—the person staid with him while I went out and got a policeman.</p>

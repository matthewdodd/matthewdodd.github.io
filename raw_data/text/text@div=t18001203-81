               <p>Q. Does he raise vegetables for the London market? - A. Yes: On Tuesday, the 28th of October, about ten minutes before two o'clock in the morning, I delivered to the prisoner a team of three black horses, with twelve sacks of potatoes; I gave him a note for Mr. Robert Coleman, potato-salesman, in Covent-garden market, and two half-crowns to bear his expences on the road.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could he read? - A. I do not know, he had been there before with notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the load you expected on the 28th ever come to you at any time since? - A. It did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour if he would confess, or threaten him if he did not? - A. I promised him all the favour the law would give him; he told me in the morning tht he had sold the potatoes to three ostlers at Mile-end,

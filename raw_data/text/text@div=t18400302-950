                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, and have a partner.

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Burrows, and went out with the teams of coals—I went out with coals with Haggett—I do not know what month it was in—it was about six weeks ago and better—the first time we went to the Mother Red Cap public-house, near Highgate, and before he began to unload the coals, a man, like a countryman, stood by—he went up to him, and asked if he would buy the corn—the man said he would, and then Haggett took the nosebags off the wagon, took them over to a shed on the other side of the road, and emptied them into a manger—the man agreed for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and when they were unloaded he said he would give him a quartern of gin instead—Haggett would not take that, and sent me back to take the <hi rend="italic">grub</hi> away, but the man afterwards agreed to give him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the horses had not had any of the food at all—it was oats, chaff, and beans—I know Tingey, by seeing him at a public-house—he had nothing to do with those nosebags—about eight or nine days afterwards we went to George's-place, Holloway—Haggett did not put the nosebags on the horses while he was unloading the coals there—in coming back he pulled out of his way, came to the Pied Bull public-house, and delivered two nosebags of food to Tingey there—I had seen him before that at another place—the nosebags were full when Haggett gave them to him—they were returned empty-Tingey paid Haggett 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a quartern of gin for them—the horses had had none of the corn at all—I do not know whether Tingey keeps the house there—I had seen him once before, when he bought two nosebags, at another place.</p>

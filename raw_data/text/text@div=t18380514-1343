                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John Augustus Nicholay, a furrier, in Oxford-street. On the 15th of January the prisoner came and presented this letter to me—knowing Mr. Moore, whose signature is to it, I gave the prisoner three boas—I saw Mr. Moore about three weeks afterwards, and mentioned the circumstance to him.</p>

I shall be in town again to-morrow, and will call on you—he kind enough to ticket the price on them. Yours, faithfully, George Moore, Uxbridge."</p>

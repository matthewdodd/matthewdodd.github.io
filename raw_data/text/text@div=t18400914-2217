                  </hi>, Jun. I am a cattle salesman, and live at St. Cloud, Cornwall. I have one partner. The money in question was the produce of beasts, which I had sold on account of myself and partner—I had not seen my partner since I sold them—on the 22nd of August I sold 125 beasts for 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I paid 1046<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into the bankers, all in cheques—I was entitled to a larger portion of the money than I had in my pocket—I came to London on Tuesday, the 25th of August, from Norwich—I had at that time 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in country notes, some of the Norwich bank, and five sovereigns, and some silver—a little after nine o'clock on Tuesday evening I went into a cigar-shop on Ludgate-hill, and purchased three cigars—I changed half a sovereign to pay for them—I kept my purse in an inside pocket, in the waistband of my trowsers—I took out my purse to get the half-sovereign—I then placed my purse in my left-hand pocket, not in the same pocket, and came out of the shop—on coming out I saw the prisoner close to the window—I had not observed her before—I think she was in a position to have seen me in the shop—when I came out she asked me where I was going—I said, "Not far"—she invited me to go to a house—I agreed, and we went to a Mrs. Green's, No. 13, King's Head-court, near Shoe-lane, I think—I had not been in the house a quarter of an hour before I missed my notes from my pocket—I had been on the bed with her—I told her she had robbed me of some Bank-notes—she denied it—I said, "You have, and I shall not let you go till I have a policeman"—I kept her there, I suppose, for an hour, trying to get a policeman—I desired the woman of the house to send for one, but she would not—they said they would accompany me to a policeman—we came a little way from the house, and just by a public-house Mrs. Green said, "You had better come in here, and have something to drink"—we went in, and had a pot of porter—my object was not to lose fright of them, and I thought the landlord or landlady might send for a policeman—I asked the landlady to do so, but she refused—we then left the house—a few minutes after we met a police-man, and I gave her in charge—after we had got about 100 yards she made a stop, and said she would go back and speak to the woman—the police-man said, "You are not going back, you are doing something"—he looked at her feet, and said, "You have dropped something there"—he stooped down, picked it up, and said, "Here the notes are"—I saw him pick them up near her feet.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a supernumerary constable of the City police. On Tuesday, the 25th of August, I was on duty at the corner of King's Head-court, Shoe-lane, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor said, "I give this woman in charge for robbing me of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in country Bank-notes"—I took her in charge—when we got about half-way down Harp-alley, I observed her shift about a good deal, and the wanted to walk by herself—all of a sudden she turned round and said, "I shall fetch the woman of the house"—she leant herself forward and pulled up her clothes, as it were—I had some suspicion, pushed her aside, and there lay the notes—the prosecutor was about two yards to the left of her at the time, on the other side of the gutter—I was between them—he had not gone over the spot where the notes were.</p>

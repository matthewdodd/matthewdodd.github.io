                  </hi>. I lodge in Roupel-street, Cornwall-road, Lambeth, in the house of William Patrick Gray—my wife and I occupy a sitting-room and sleeping-room on the first floor. On the 26th December, I left the house between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, leaving my wife at home—I returned about half-past nine o'clock with my wife, opened the door with a key, and went up stairs—I found both rooms had been opened, the drawers forced open, and things strewed about the place—I missed several things—I gave the policeman a list of what I lost—the doors had both been locked—the hat belongs to Lapthorne, a lodger.</p>

I found this iron bar in a pocket inside a rough coat he had on—he said, "It is only a piece of old iron I found"—he had the hat produced on his head—I afterwards showed it to Lapthorne, who said it was his—I went to Mr. Nowell's house, and on the bed-room door were marks of some instru<lb></lb>ment—eleven marks above the lock, and two or three underneath, between the door-post and door—I compared this piece of iron with the marks, and they corresponded—there was something black on every mark there, and on this bar there is black, as if it had been in the fire—Lapthorne described his hat minutely to me before he saw it—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth.</p>

            . I am brother to William and Thomas Venables, who are in partnership; Thomas Page, the prisoners' brother, was in their service - he pleaded guilty this morning to stealing these things. On the morning he was committed, I applied to Sir George Farrant for a warrant to search the prisoners' house, No. 2, Windsorplace, and in a hat-box, which

I found twenty-six silk handkerchiefs, and seventeen in William Page's box; John said they had been given to him by Thomas, to keep and to sell - William was out at the time; when he came home we took him: he said he had bought them of his brother Thomas; he had given 1s. a piece for some, 1s. 6d. for others, and 2s. was the utmost price he had given; he said he had been in the silk business, and he considered he had given the utmost price - they have our marks on them.</p>

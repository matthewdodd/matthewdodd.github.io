               <p>Q. Was any body else in the room at that time?</p>
               <p>Rogers. Yes, my lord, there was another woman that sat at a distance. The people without were breaking open the door at that time, to let her out. A man got in and said, do you come here to breed a riot with my wife; he got hold of a glass bottle, with which he struck me, cut a hole in my hat, wounded my head, and knock'd me down; other people put up the window, and threw stones at me. I have that man in the Compter now who abused me. One person brought an iron poker; then they called out for knives, &amp;c.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Going my round about a quarter after ten this night, the prosecutor call'd to me, saying he had been abus'd and robb'd in such a place. He was all over blood. I went directly to the house, and could find no person in it but the fellow that is in the Compter now. The prosecutor gave me charge of the man, I carried him to the watch-house, and delivered him to the constable; then I went to the house again to secure any body I should find there. I brought up the man's wife next. Then I took assistance and went again, and met the prisoner in the court, much in liquor. I had seen her before at that house, so I took her to the constable. The man and she were sent to the Compter, and the prosecutor also.</p>

Kitchen—I believe the prisoner may be the person who made the application, but I cannot swear to him—he had a pass-book in his hand, which I supposed was Mr. Kitchen's, but I cannot say whose it was—I told him we did not give check-books without an order—he said he was Mr. Kitchen's son—I turned immediately to Mr. Tessier, another clerk, and a neighbour of Mr. Kitchen's, and said, "Is that Mr. Kitchen's son? "and he said, "Yes; it is all right"—the person who obtained this check-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), No. 9174, signed his name to our book, before me—this is his signature, "W.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If you had been asked, without seeing the prisoner, to whom it was you gave the check-book, would you not have said it had been given to Mr. Kitchen's son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; I did not tell my brother clerk it was Mr. Kitchen's son; I said I believed it was all right—I con<lb></lb>nected together his being in possession of a customer's book, and having represented himself as Mr. Kitchen's son—I know two of Mr. Kitchen's sons well—they are not like the prisoner; there is a very slight resemblance, if any at all—they do not wear any beard under the chin.</p>

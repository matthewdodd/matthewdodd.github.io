On Saturday night, 7th Aug. last, I locked up the station at twenty minutes to 11 o'clock; the windows were then safe—I left the clock and money all safe—next morning, about twenty minutes to 8 o'clock, I sent my son to the station—he returned and gave me some information, in consequence of which I went immediately and found that the office window had been broken open—I went in, and missed the time-piece—my ticket desk, till, and writing desk had been broken open, and I missed 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper from a bowl, all the property of the Company—I know the prisoner; he is a carpenter—about that time he was in the habit of riding by the train about twice a week from Ashford to Staines—he worked at Mr. Richardson's, a builder, at Staines.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach smith, at Staines; I know the prisoner. About the end of Oct. I purchased a clock of him—I gave him goods and money, amounting to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for it; I gave him a portable forge, a pair of bellows and anvil, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was only one key with it, which opened the dial—there was no key to wind it up—the prisoner said the key was with it when he had it, but another party had had it on trial before me, and they had lost the key—he said he got it from a man who kept a beer shop at Hampton, or Twickenham, or Kingston, whom he had been doing some work for; he did not mention any name—he hung it up in my shop himself—about five weeks afterwards the prisoner came again, and wanted to purchase the clock back again; he said he had bought it, but it was not right, and he had heard some <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it—I said I had got the article, and I ought to know what the <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> was, and I did not want to sell it—he then asked me to cover it over—I said I would not—he then asked me to take it up stairs, and I did not answer him—I did take it upstairs, and afterwards brought it down again and put it in the same place it had been before—on Saturday night I saw it safe at 6 or 7 o'clock, and when I came home at twenty minutes to 12 o'clock I missed it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock manufacturer, at Princessquare; we supply clocks to the South Western Railway Company, and go down the line every week and repair the clocks. The pin that holds the hands on of this clock produced is broken on the inside—I remember seeing a clock of a similar appearance at the Ashford station—this clock cost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is now worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

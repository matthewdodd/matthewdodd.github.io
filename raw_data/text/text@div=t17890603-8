               <p>I am servant to Mr. Cadell; (Mr. Cadell having frequently missed books, desired me) on Friday the 22d of May, I marked a number of these books which I put on the shelf; I made a point on the following morning, Saturday the 23d, to watch particularly who came into the shop; we had had some cause to suspect that the prisoner was the thief, and we knew, or at least expected he would be there that morning, and the moment he came into the shop, I put myself into a situation to observe all his motions; the prisoner is a journeyman book-binder, and they have often occasion to apply to us to perfect books; when he came into the shop an opportunity was given him, if he was so minded, to take them, by the other person going to the back of the shop; the moment he had opportunity, I saw him take the books off the shelf, put them first in his hat, and then into his pocket; I then went and got him the sheet he desired, and suffered him to go; I followed him in half a minute, he was running, I soon overtook him, and brought him back to the shop; I made him sit down till an officer was fetched, I stood by him all the time; he was then searched, and the books taken out of his pocket, which will be produced by the constable; he had seven volumes, the titles were, four volumes of Pope's Homer, the Triumph of Temper, a single volume of Blair's Geography, and Dr. Gregory's Father's Legacy.</p>

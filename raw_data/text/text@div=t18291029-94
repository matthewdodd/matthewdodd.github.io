            . I am in the service of a gentleman- my brother keeps a smith's shop in Blandford-mews, On the 9th of September the prisoner came while I was there, and asked for a key for a box; I shewed her a large bundle - she selected one, and went away for three or four minutes; she then came back and said it would go in, but would not turn - I picked her out two or three more; she took them, came back, and said neither of them would do - on the Monday following the officer came to me; I went and saw the keys, which I believe were what I gave her - one of them locked and unlocked the box.</p>

            . The prosecutrix applied to me on Saturday, the 12th of September; I took the prisoner at the house, and said it was on suspicion of taking money- she said, "She can't swear to money;" the prosecutrix said she knew she had taken it - the prisoner said any body else might have taken it; I then went and got the keys, and this one opens the box.</p>

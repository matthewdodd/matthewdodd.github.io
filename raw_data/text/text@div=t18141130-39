They followed me about ten yards from the public-house, I did not notice them in the public-house; I did not see them sitting in the tap-room. They followed me about ten yards from the public-house; they came and hustled up against me.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you first missed your pocket-book - A. After they passed me a minute had elapsed when I missed my pocket-book; I had felt my pocket-book after I got out of the public-house, before these men came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the men entered into conversation with you - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they enter into conversation with you upon different subjects - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said a word about their husting you in the deposition to the magistrate, you observed you missed your pocket-book after they jostled against you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they had been in conversation with you had they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then they jostled by you - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all you observed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you missed the pocket-book; and after you missed the pocket-book what then - A I followed them to Virginia-street, it is about twenty yards from the house; when they got to Virginia-street, I challenged them with having my pocketbook; they denied it with abuse, and one of the two prisoners knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it - A. I believe it was the prisoner Curran, and then they ran away. I came up to them again at the lower part of Virginia-street, one of the two prisoners cried out give it him twice; they turned round, and knocked me down again the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they acting together - A. They were both concerned together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who struck you this second time - A. I believe it was the prisoner Curran.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was Smith that said give it him - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Smith afterwards in the watchman's custody - A. Yes, after I got up the second time; I called out watch I found Smith in the custody of the watchman.</p>

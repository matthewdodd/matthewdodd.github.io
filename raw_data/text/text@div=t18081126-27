            . I live at Furnival's cellar and chop house. On the 12th of October, a little before eleven at night, I heard a call out of stop thief; I immediately ran up stairs; finding one door open on the stairs, that had no lock, and the other door which had a lock and chain round it broken and open also, on looking in I missed a rump of beef and two fowls; I immediately crossed the way, hearing a noise, towards Dyer's buildings; I met the prisoner in the possession of a gentleman, I immediately catched hold of the prisoner also, and brought him back to the foot of my stairs; the prisoner cried out I am not the man; presently the gentleman said you are the man, and you have broken my mouth, see whether he has not got something about him; I called my boy to see whether there was any fowl down on the ground; I looked and saw no fowl on the ground; that minute a fowl was picked up just by the prisoner's feet by the witness who catched the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260020"></xptr>prisoner, and he hit him across the face with it; I immediately got the watchman and gave him in charge; I asked the witness to stop with him while I went down to get my hat; I walked slowly down behind them; I was about twenty yards from the watchhouse door when they let the prisoner go, I heard a voice say stop thief by two or three; I immediately ran into the road to see which way he had taken, he ran by me up Holborn, I turned and ran after him, he turned up Hatton Garden; I made a spring and hit him on the head with my fist, he tumbled; the watchman was running down, hearing the rattle spring; he tumbled over him, knocked me down; as I fell I turned round on my side and catched hold of the prisoner's leg till the watchman got up; we took him in custody again to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same man that you saw at your cellar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the minute before you looked and saw no fowl at all - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. You had not seen this man down in the cellar at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been out this day - A. I had been to market. I always take the meat out myself upon all occasion, except I am out, then I cut steaks and leave in the lobby till I am at home. I had seen the beef five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the man was brought back was there a number of persons about him - A. There was one of one side of him and one of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore from which the fowl dropped you cannot tell - A. My witness will tell.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, when he was before the magistrate was sent on board the tender, yet you have preferred your indictment - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker. I was coming down Holborn about a quarter before eleven on the 12th of October, I perceived six or seven, or more, men in a cluster, they were a little divided; I paused for a little while whether I should go on, thinking I was beset; I perceived a man go down the steps and put his hand into the larder, he took two fowls up by the two legs extremely leisurely and participated into the street rather sneakingly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the beef - A. There were enough to take the beef, the beef was gone before. He took the fowls rather sneakingly and went into the street; when I advanced forward and asked him what he and with the man's fowls; he made no answer but run; his partner made a blow at me and cut me here; when I turned round after the man I returned the compliment; I ran after the prisoner, he took across Holborn and up Dyer's buildings; he returned back, there being no avenue up the buildings; on seeing him return down again I made a stop; at that moment as he was just at the point of my fingers I felt a violent blow from another man whom I did not see till the moment, which brought me to the ground; at that time there were several people assembled and he was got just round the corner of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the same man - A. I am positive, I had sufficient view of him through the side of the larder; I took him across the way with the assistance of a person, I was met by the person who gave his evidence last.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the cellar with him - A. I did, and there I picked up a fowl from between his legs, which I judged he had dropped: he had thrown a fowl prior to that at me.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see him drop it - A. No, I felt something by my feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not drop it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had thrown one fowl at you - A. Yes; that was at my first start before he was got to the watch-house: there was a set of them who made the watchman fall, who rescued him; the man that particularly rescued him, I took, and had the watchmen done their duty more of them would have been taken. One of the watchmen on seeing me so bloody, said, I had enough of it, he had no notion of being cut.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. It was in the night time when you was coming down Holborn; you saw several persons - A. Yes; they were all ragamuffins like himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the man went down stairs his back was towards you - A, No; he went down as crabs walk, side ways; if he had tried to make his face conspicuous he could not have done it more, the light shined fully upon it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What became of the fowl - A. After I had picked it up I gave it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was one of my own fowls; I took it before the lord mayor at the mansion house; I am sure it was my own, it was my own trussing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening that I am charged with the robbery I had been in Chancery lane spending the evening with a few friends; I passed through Chancery lane into Dyer's buildings, and when I came to the end of Dyer's buildings the gentleman dragged me over the way; that gentleman swore that I was the person and that he saw me at the larder; I told him he was wrong; when the watchman had got me in his possession, his mouth was bleeding, and several people said at the watchhouse I was not the person and they pushed me away.</p>

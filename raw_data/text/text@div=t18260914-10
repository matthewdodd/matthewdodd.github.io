            . I am an officer. On the 4th of August I found the prisoner in Wentworth-street; she denied knowing anything of the robbery; I said, "Have you any duplicates?" she said none, and turned out both her pockets; I said I must search her - she then put her hand into her bosom; I saw her move something under her arm: I held both her hands while the prosecutrix took the purse from her bosom, and in that purse I found a duplicate of the watch, pawned at Price's, two doors off - I took her there - he said, in her hearing, that she had pawned it, and had only asked 4s. on it; she said she knew nothing of the other property, but next morning she said voluntarily, "There was another person, named Haggerty, with me, who encouraged me to break open the trunk with a poker - she got the wearing-apparel, and I the watch."(Watch produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A woman came up to the room after me, and asked what was in the box - she broke the box open with a poker; I began to cry - she struck me, and said she would kill me if I spoke.</p>

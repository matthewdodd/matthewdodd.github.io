             Sworn. - I am one of the patrol belonging to Bow-street: On the 23d of February, as I was going through the passage of Lincoln's Inn, the two prisoners ran across from Portugal-street towards Lincoln's Inn; the prisoner, Fry, had this ink-stand, (producing it,) which struck against the upright iron bar going into the passage.</p>
               <p>Q.How far might they be from Mrs. Barrett's house? - A.Not more than thirty or forty yards; some of the things fell off the ink-stand, and they both stooped to pick them up; I laid hold of the ink-stand, and asked Fry what he had got; he said nothing, and immediately let go, and ran away; then White got up, and I laid hold of him, and searched him; I found under his coat these pencils,(producing them;) from there I took him to the watch-house; about half past twelve o'clock, in company with Christopher Jones and Michael Lee, I went to Fry's lodgings, and took him out of bed.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL LEE Sworn. - I was with Limbrick and Jones at the apprehending of Fry.(The property was identified by Mrs. Barrent.)</p>
               <p>Fry's defence. I had had a drop too much; this young man dropped the pencils; I picked them up, and before I could give them to him, Mr. Limbrick laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, White, did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Fry called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

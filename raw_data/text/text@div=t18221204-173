               <p>"My sister lives hear, will you go in and have it." - it was a private house, one of the men and I went into the ground floor room, they sent for the porter, I had no money, Archer said,</p>
               <p>"Will you put your watch in that tea-caddy, and we will find porter." Bradshaw and another woman were in the room, I refused and then he drew near to me, and made a snatch at my watch, my fob was twisted, the chain which was steel broke, it had a gold seal and key to it, which cost me 4 l. 10 s., he rushed out of the room directly, I pursued but he got off with it, Bradshaw said nothing, I gave information at Lambeth-street, and he was apprehended, I have not recovered my property, I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Were you perfectly sober - A. Yes, when he robbed me, I might have been intoxicated three-quarters of an hour before, only one link on my chain was left, I had been drinking with a friend in George-street, Minories, about four o'clock that afternoon, we had three bottles of wine between us. I left there between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you going the nearest way home - A. I had been robbed that evening of 129 l. at a house about thirty yards from the house he took me to, and was looking for the woman. I got sober after being robbed.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a sawyer, a journeyman, I am a house-keeper in the Horse-ferry, Westminster; I was coming home after I left work about seven in the evening, there I saw the prisoner looking in at the window of a hosier and hatter's; and my mate said, look at Gray, he is looking in there, what is he doing? he staid there about a minute and an half, or two minutes, and there came a man right facing me, it was the same side of the way facing me, but at a distance from me; I was of the same side of the way with the prisoner, a man pushed the prisoner in, he was very high the door, and said, you villain or something to that purpose, you was going to take the woman's bundle; but I never saw him offer to take or touch anything at all.</p>
               <p>Was you in such a situation that you could see him touch any thing or not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you see him when he was in the house? - I could.</p>
               <p>Was he stooping at all? - No, he never stooped at all, not to my sight.</p>
               <p>Was the whole door open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are both sides of the shop alike? - I believe they are, I did not go into the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230149"></xptr>Whereabouts did you stand? - Rather on one side, and the man that beckoned to me was on the other side.</p>
               <p>How far is the door from the window? - It joins in the middle; I saw him through the door way.</p>
               <p>Do you swear he took nothing? - Upon my oath, when he was pushed in, I saw nothing about him.</p>
               <p>After he was pushed in did you? - No, I did not, I must have seen it if there had been any such thing.</p>
               <p>Who brought you here? - The prisoner's sister; she happened to come into the house where I lodged last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Who do you work for? - For Mr. Luward at Pimlico, a cooper.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there any other people about the door, but this gentleman that pushed him in? - Not just at that time, but directly after.</p>
               <p>How happens it you did not stop then? - My curiosity never leads me into such affairs as those; his sister came to the public house accidentally, the sign of the White Hart in the Horse-Ferry, and she was talking to the landlord about her brother being detained for a supposed robbery; and he said there were two men that lodged in his house that saw it; and she desired we would come down.</p>
               <p>What brought her to the public house? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court to Askew. Did you see this man there? - I did, but not till more than four minutes after I had the prisoner in the shop; I only observed two girls and the prisoner about; but after this man, and several more stood at the door, and the people declared they would rescue this man from the shop; I do not recollect his saying any thing; the prisoner was not quite without the shop, but he had the bundle in his arms, and I forced him into the shop, and held him there: at the time he was before the Justice, he asked me why I did not permit him to come out of the shop with the property, that that must have done him, and he should not then have returned from whence he came, for he would rather be hanged than return from whence he came.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. How long have you known the prisoner? - Only seen him come into a public house, no acquaintance at all.</p>

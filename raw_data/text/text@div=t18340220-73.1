               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When did you first say the prisoner was the man who took it? A. I told the landlord I had lost the watch - I made no charge against the prisoner till the policeman came, because I felt myself in danger among so many strangers - I told the landlord I had lost my watch, but said nothing about the prisoner - I did not see him drop the watch, but I felt him drop it down by my feet; and he had snatched it from me - I did not see him snatch it, but felt him, and he was the only person within reach when it was taken from my person - he did not remain near me till the policeman came.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say, "He was still near me?" A. He was not a distance from me - he was not so far from me as he is now - the room may be about sixteen feet long.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was not further from you than he is now? A. No, not so far; I heard the watch fall, when it was first dropped - I was quite sober - it was not the first public-house I had been into that night - I had had one glass of ale - my friend Daniel M'Carthy was there, but he went out before it happened.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you clear that is the man who took the watch? A. I am perfectly certain of it - I swear to him positively - when I charged him with it, he said nothing.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I went into the King's Arms, being sent for by the landlord - I got inside, and the landlord and prosecutor stood at the door of the back parlour - the landlord said, in the prisoner's hearing, that a watch was lost, and he would not let anybody out till it was found - I went inside, and took the candle which one of the party had, and searched under the settle - the prosecutor did not charge anybody at that time - I went to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200050"></xptr>further end of the room, and found the watch lying on the settle, out of the case, which was within three or four inches - I put it into my pocket - I asked the prosecutor who was the person who stole the watch - he pointed immediately to the prisoner, and said he was the man - I told the prisoner he must go with me to the station-house - he refused at first, and denied it - I said, "Come to the station-house with me" - he said, "I shall not go with you," and the whole party in the room got up off their seats, men and women; and I attempted to take him through the door, and the party inside pushed me back to the table - the prisoner slipped from me into the bar, and escaped from me - they rescued him - I should think there were seven or eight characters that I knew - and there were a dozen of them all in a string helping him - I did not see him again till the 15th, at half-past ten o'clock - I had known him before - he was brought to the station-house, and I identified him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were the prosecutor and landlord standing? A. Just outside the door, so that nobody could get out - the prosecutor was in no danger at all from the people in the room - he could have told the landlord then who took it - he did not tell me who took it till after it was found - I did not see that any of them were intoxicated - the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I heard of this, and found the prisoner at the Swan public-house, Bacon-street, Brick-lane, playing at cards, about half-past nine at night - I told him I wished to speak with him outside - he objected at first to come out - I then told him if he would not come out I should tell him before the company what I wanted him for - he then came out - I told him he was my prisoner - I brought him outside the door - my brother constable was there, in case I wanted assistance - we got him outside, and then the party inside came out - he then tried to get away - he struggled and got away, and ran to a court opposite which I knew was no throughfare - I called to my brother constable, we followed, and caught him without his getting out of sight - I told him if he did not go quietly I would handcuff him - he then asked what I wanted him for - I had told him I wanted him for a job in Whitechapel - I secured his hands and took him down Bacon-street - the mob followed us, and we were molested by stones being thrown at us - I brought him down and secured him.</p>

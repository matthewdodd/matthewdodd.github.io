                  </hi>. I am the brother of Jeremiah Woods, a hosier, living in Bond-street.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 13th of December, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I saw a mob running in Lower Berkeley-street—they were crying, "Stop thief"—the prisoner was run<lb></lb>ning from the mob—he crossed the Edgeware-road into Connaught-square, and I stopped him—he said, "Let me go; I have done nothing"—I said, "Then you need not be afraid"—in a few minutes, a young man came up with a bundle in his hand, and said in his presence, "I give this man into your custody; he has been at our shop obtaining goods under false pre<lb></lb>tences"—I took him to the station-house—on searching him, I found these four handherchiefs in his pocket, and three all in a piece, in the crown of his hat.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The day I went into the shop I had four handkerchiefs ordered by one of my customers, Mr. Morton, of 228, Hyde-park-corner. I had not the handkerchiefs, and went for them—he was to sail for Ireland next day, and I was to go and get them, and to select for him two night-shirts and waistcoats. I went to the gentleman's shop, and asked him if he had any flannel waistcoats—he showed me some. I asked for night-shirts; the gentleman who sent me for the order told me to get large ones—the gen<lb></lb>tleman had not them long enough—he produced some—I told him to take them to Morton, 228, Hyde-park-corner. Mrs. Williams, his cousin, was to sail to Ireland with him, and she told me to select two shawls for her and her sister. I went to Redmond's in Bond-street, selected some, and told him the woman would meet him at 229, Oxford-street. On my way, in going to take the handkerchiefs to the gentleman, I met a gentleman with the parcel, I said, "Did you take the shawls to the lady?"—He said, "No, for there is no lady there." I said, "Come with me, I will take you to where the lady is." I took him to the place, and asked if Mrs. Williams had called. The servant said, "No;" he was so enraged with me, I wished him to go where Mrs. Williams lived; but he gave me in charge of the policeman, who asked if he had got the shawls—he said, "I don't choose to be humbugged in this way." The policeman said, "I shall not take him without some charge." I wished to go to the station-house—the policeman refused to let me take hold of his arm to get out of the crowd—they were ill-using me. Somebody said, "Run away—don't be ill-used in this way." I ran away, and this man ran after me, calling "Stop thief!" The next policeman came up with the witness, and I was glad to throw myself into his hands.</p>

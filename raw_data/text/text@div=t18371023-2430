                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 175.) On the 28th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Newing<lb></lb>ton churchyard, and saw the prisoner Eliza Wright loitering at the back of the houses which goes against the churchyard—she was walking up and down—the back of Mr. Borras's house comes close against the churchyard—after a short time, I saw the prisoner Elias Wright give her a bundle over the back wall of Mr. Borras's house—I stopped her, and asked what she had got—she said, "Nothing"—I said, "You must go with me, you have something wrong here"—she said, "For goodness sake say nothing about it; what shall I give you?"—she had the street-door key in her hand, and asked me to let her go into the private door of her master's house—I took her in there and searched the bag, in the pre<lb></lb>sence of her mistress, who brought Elias into the shop to me, and I took them both into custody—Elias said he knew what the contents of the bag were—Mrs. Borras saw every article.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Borras; he has a situation in the City, and we carry on the business of fancy stationers at Newing<lb></lb>ton. The female prisoner was our household servant, and the other the errand-boy—they are brother and sister, and both resided in the house—the policeman brought Eliza in with the bag—I identify the whole of the property as belonging to ray husband—no part of it had been sold by me—I believe the yard measure is entered in the book as sold, and a writing-book also, I believe—our shopwoman was discharged at Union-hall, and has been very ill since—I know this spelling-book—it has my private mark in it—it was never sold by me</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You cannot say whether Miss Morton might not have sold it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—there is not any entry of a book sold in Miss Morton's writing on Thursday, the 28th—these are the reading-library books, not what are sold in the shop—some of the entries are my own writing—what is entered at the bottom of the page was sold after they were in custody—Miss Morton's entries on the 28th are, "Paper, 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; mea<lb></lb>sure, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; paper, 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mrs. Borras as shop-woman, and had been so about four months—I was in the habit of selling things over the counter, and of making entries in the book of what I sold—I have seen these things—I sold a few of them to the prisoners—do I not exactly know what they were—there is a yard measure I sold—there I was some paper, but I cannot tell how much—not so much as three quires—I do not know whether I sold as much as a quire—I did not sell the wax pears, nor these books, nor the copy-books—I think I sold some of the pens to Eliza Wright—she paid for what she bought—I did not sell her any thing on the 12th of September, but a yard measure—she paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that, and it is down in the book.</p>

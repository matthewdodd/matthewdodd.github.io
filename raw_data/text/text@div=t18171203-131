I did not know them before. I said I would not leave go, as they had my property - I brought them up to the bar, and called the publican - I told him that Henry had robbed me of my property as I was going up the passage-Walters tried to rescue him; I called the publican, and he laid hold of him. There was nobody else in the passage but the two prisoners - I got my watch in about five minutes.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARK. I am a publican. On the 2d of November, about half-past seven o'clock, the prisoners came into my house; the prosecutor came in a few minutes after - He called out that he had lost his property - I seized Henry, and asked him what he had been doing? I saw the watch in his hand - He tried to shuffle it under his clothes - He slipped it behind him. I held him till the officer came-the watch was picked up by another person; he begged of me to let him go; Walters was close to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Stowell, of 6, Newcastle-place, Mile-end, in the parish of St. Dunstan's, Stepney. On the evening of 20th April the prisoner Howe came to my house—he told me that my son Richard had met with a serious accident, that two men had taken him up, and he was to go to the London Hospital, but he refused to go till he saw me—he then gave me a letter—I asked him to walk in—I took him into the back parlour, and read the letter by the fire-light—I said as soon as I had changed my dress I would go—he begged me not to wait, but to go directly—I asked him if he was going back—he said, "Yes"—I told him to be kind enough to tell my son I would come directly—I went and asked Mrs. Love to come over, and left her in my house—I went by the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> to Stratford, where my son was—I found him quite well, and at work—I returned by the train, and found my front-room had been stripped—four sheets, two dresses, two petticoats, a frock-coat of my son's, a coat of Mr. Elliott's, a waistcoat, and pair of trowsers, were all at the station when I returned, and a black bag which was not mine—I never saw it before—they had put the things into that bag, and left it behind—these are the articles—the letter was not my son's writing—I stood at the door looking at Howe, and have no doubt he is the man—there was a gaslight there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Newcastle-place, opposite Mrs. Stowell. On the evening of 21st March I took charge of her house, at her request—when she left I locked the house up, and went to my own house—I was absent ten minutes or a quarter of an hour when my lodger told me something—I looked, and saw a light in the front room, and saw the shadow of a man walking about—my husband went to the door, and knocked—he then opened the door with the key, and called out, "Who is there?" two or three times—no answer was returned, and I said to him, "Go for the policeman"—I remained at the door—I heard footsteps coming down the stairs—I called out, "Who is that?"—directly afterwards I heard footsteps in the passage, and Coe passed my right arm, and Phillips my left—I turned directly, and pursued them—they ran off—I am sure they are the persons—the gas was full on their faces—I have no doubt of them whatever—when Coe was brought back, I went up-stairs with the policeman—I found the chest of drawers in the front chambers open—the things were all out, and taken to the back room, and great part of them had been put into a bag—the front room was all in confusion.</p>

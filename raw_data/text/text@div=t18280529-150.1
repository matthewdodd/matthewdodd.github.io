The prisoner had been a year and two months in my service; I did not miss any particular article - she was under warning to quit on the 12th of May, and on that day I went into her bed-room; I saw a box which she brought when she came into my service - it was unlocked; I opened it, and found a muslin collar; I went down stairs and called her into the dining room - I asked if any of my young men had sold it her, if any one had given it her, or how she came by it; she denied having it; I then said I would search all the boxes- I went up to her box and found the collar; I found six pairs of gloves, and several other articles which I have not mentioned; we then had information that a box had been removed during some alterations - I spoke to her, and she said there had been an old box removed, but there was nothing in it; I found the box at Mr. Gribble's house, with some shawls, prints and other things in it of mine, with my mark on them - the prisoner was then in custody; the value of all the things is 9l. or 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you go into her bed-room in consequence of some suspicion? A. Yes - I had a brother living with me some time before; I have since heard she has miscarried, in consequence of a connexion in my premises - I never went into her bed-room, except once, when she was ill, out of humanity; my brother lived in the house for two or three weeks while she was there; he did not often come to my house, for we had a dispute - it was nothing about her; she said she took the gloves from my dining-room, and the collar from my parlour, not that my brother gave them to her.</p>

            ; he is a sawyer. The prisoner came and asked me if I knew any one who took in lodgers; she said she was going to leave her situation, and should like to have a week or a few days before she went to another - she said she had taken away a box, and did not like it to go back again, and she brought it to my house; she went, and ordered a trunk, which was to come to my house, and she left me the money to pay for it - when it came she emptied the things out of the old box, and put them into the new one; there were some clean things of her own but nothing of Mr. Bates'. I never saw her bring any other articles there. I heard of her being taken up, and went and told Mr. Bates that I had a box, but I did not see her bring anything to put into it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a servant to Messrs. Wells and Company: On the 9th of June, the prisoners at the bar came into our back shop; I saw Palmer, the last witness, serving the prisoners with some thread; he had occasion to go into the front shop; I then saw Mary Johnson cross from the west to the east counter, to look at some artificial flowers which were hanging over the counter, where there were some muslins lying; I saw her take some muslins, and put them under her cloak; but upon looking round, and observing that I was looking that way, she put them down again; she then came across to the left-hand counter, where I was standing, she staid there some time looking at the threads, and then Palmer returned; Mary Robson stood before

             between me and the counter; then I saw Mary Johnson cross a second time to the right-hand counter, and take the muslin off the counter, and conceal it under her cloak; she then came over with Mary Johnson to the left-hand counter; I went round the counter and told Mr. Jones of it; I then challenged her with the theft; Mary Robson was close to her when I challenged her with it; she moved about, and I saw the muslin lying close by where she was standing; I sent up to my master; a constable was sent for, and they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the two prisoners conversing together? - A. Yes: they were talking together just before I challenged Marry Johnson; I picked up the muslin, put my mark upon it, and gave it to the constable; there were nineteen yards of it in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Four pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Johnson had her back to you the first time she went over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were artificial flowers, you have told us, hanging over the muslins? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was an article of great sale at that time? - A. Yes; we have sold a great number.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you had seen that which you have represented, when her back was towards you, you did not at that time charge her with any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When she went towards the counter the second time, was her back towards you then? - A. Yes; and Robson was standing partly on one side of her.</p>
               <p>Q. The artificial flowers hung over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her back towards you then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no muslins upon the west counter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. I had put them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there had not been muslins there? - A. There had; Mr. Palmer had been serving there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of her when you came to the other counter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came round, you found the muslin on the ground? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see her drop it? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not Johnson offer any of you to go to her own house with her? - A. Not that I know of.</p>

On the 22nd of May, I was in his shop about half-past two o'clock; I saw the prisoner and another man near the shop - I then saw the prisoner looking in at the window; he was there for several minutes; I then missed him all on a sudden - I looked to the inside of the door where goods were hanging for sale, and missed two pair of men's shoes; it struck me the prisoner had got them - I went out, and on casting my eyes toward Norton Falgate, I saw the prisoner and the other man running - I pursued the prisoner and collared him; he undid his apron and threw these shoes down; a person who was passing took them up - they are my master's property, and have my mark on them - they had been safe at the door while the prisoner was looking in at the window; they are worth 11s.</p>

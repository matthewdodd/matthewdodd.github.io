            . I am a waterman, I work from Chertsey and the west country, to Queenhithe; my servant received the box mentioned, and I delivered it to Mrs. Watkins at Laleham, that is near Stanes; this was in December, before Christmas; it was locked and tied round with a cord: after that Mrs. Watkins delivered it again to my man, and he brought it safe, locked and corded, to my boat at Chertsey. I received it on board, it was very heavy; I brought it down to London, to Scotland-yard: we had many brooms on board; we laid them out upon a lighter, at Mr. Wood's wharf, to get some things out; then we put the box down into a hole, and laid the brooms upon it, being tired and hungry; as we could not get our boat off, the tide having in part left her, we went to an alehouse, and had some bread and cheese and beer, and were gone about three quarters of an hour: when we returned to the boat, we saw the brooms thrown about; we looked and missed the box: this was betwixt 11 and 12 at night.</p>

When I heard the two boys were taken, I went to the Gate-house to see them. Lambeth came up to me, and told me of several things that he had taken out of my boat, besides the box which I had not then missed, and he owned that he had taken the box of linen, and that they tried to break it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Walker in the hearing of this?</p>
               <p>West. He was, he stood by me at the time; Lambeth said they stole a boat and rowed up the river, and heard a gentleman call for oars; they took him in, and carried him to Whitehall; then they went on board a west-country barge, but got nothing, then they came to my vessel, which he called a broom-boat, and got into her stern, and tried at the cabbin, but that was locked; then he looked under the cloth, and saw a chest, and with a great oath said, here is a good prize: then they said let's heave it out, we will sell the things, and sit ourselves out for sea; they got it out of the hole and cut the rope, but could not then break it open upon the bulk; then they put a rope through the iron handles, and in lowering it down into their boat it fell, and hurt one of them very much; then they went away with it, and flung the rest of the things which they had taken over-board, near Scotland-yard; they rowed down to the Old Swan, and there broke it open, and carried the things off, but did not tell me where; they were both close together at the time Lambeth told me this.</p>

            ; they had two shirts of the same on. When they came to the Gatehouse, we bought them two cheque ones and put them on, and took the others from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners Welch and Foy?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I do, they are dealers; they buy kitchen stuff and things in the lane; they don't care what they buy, or how they are come by (the sheets and shirts produced, and deposed to by E. Bennet as the prosecutor's property).</p>
               <p>Saunders. These sheets are worth two guineas a pair.</p>
               <p>Walker's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been to sea in an east country ship. I went to see a relation in Lambeth parish. We drank till it was pretty late, then we agreed to come to Westminster bridge, and take a boat, and come to the Old Swan: there came a man with a boat; he said, he would not carry us under six-pence. When we came into the boat, he had these things in a white napkin; he asked us if we would buy a shirt or two; we bought each of us one; then he said we should not have them without we bought the whole lump, so we bought the whole tote. The next morning we saw these marks upon them: we never went to do them out, but went to sell them. We sold some to these women. The next day that man stopped us, and while we were in prison the ship sailed. She lay at Rotherhithe, and belongs to Gottenburg.</p>

               <p>It is true what he says.</p>
               <p>Welch's defence.</p>
               <p>I met the young men; they had some things tied up in a handkerchief; they shewed me these things at the Blue Boar. I agreed for them for 23 shillings: they said they were their own property, that their mother was killed in St. George's fields, and they had been abroad 9 years; that they buried her directly in Whitechapel. I never saw them before.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Welch desired me to look at these things. I asked them where they got them; they said they were their mother's, who was killed, and they had been abroad.</p>

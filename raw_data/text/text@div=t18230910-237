On Saturday, the 5th of July, about six o'clock in the morning, I missed all the linen off the horse, which I had ironed the night before. The prisoner had lodged with us, and came again that night; he slept in the parlour, and was gone when I got up.</p>

            . On the 5th of July, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Dartmouth-street, Westminster, with these things in a bundle; he walked into Great Queen-street, and there I stopped him; he said he had a shirt, a pair of stockings, and a handkerchief; and I found he had several more things, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>William Wallis. On the 31st of October, between six, and seven in the evening, I felt a hand at my pocket, as I was under <placeName id="t17641212-1-crimeloc3">Newgate</placeName>

I sent for a constable: in carrying him to Woodstreet Compter, he attempted to get away; we again took him into a public house, and sent for a pair of hand-cuffs; he again struck me a violent blow on the face.</p>

            . I was in Pye-Corner, where the prisoner was secured; I saw him give a handkerchief to another man that struck the gentleman two or three times; then there came assistance; the prisoner and the other man made off, but the prisoner was soon secured.</p>

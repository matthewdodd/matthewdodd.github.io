                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live in Hart-street, Covent-garden. I took possession of a house, No. 34, Hart-street, belonging to Henry Richmond—the prisoner's father formerly resided there—I took pos<lb></lb>session of it on the 8th of June, and was to pay my rent quarterly—on Friday I went on the roof of the house, and it was all right—I employed some people to repair the house—on Saturday, the 10th, about a quarter to five o'clock, in consequence of information, I went on the roof again, and found about nine feet of lead cut out of the centre of the gutter—it must have been cut with a sharp instrument, and the edges were bright, as if recently done.</p>

               <p>Westminster. On the 10th of June I was employed by Mr. Howes on the premises in Hart-street—between four and five o'clock that afternoon the prisoner came into the back yard where I was at work, and asked if we had seen a bit of looking-glass in any of the rooms up stairs, which his father had left behind—I said I had not—I went after some mortar, and when I came back the prisoner was not there—about ten minutes or a quarter of as hour after I saw him at the foot of the stairs in the passage, going out with a parcel under his arm, wrapped up in a handkerchief—I called out to him, and asked what he had there—he made no answer, but walked away—he had no bundle when he came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed at No. 34, Hart-street, Covent-garden, on the Saturday, and saw the prisoner leave the premises with a bundle under his arm. I heard Kelly cull, and ask him what he had in it-he made no answer—I followed him up the court—he took the bundle from under his arm, and put it on his shoulder—there was something which ap<lb></lb>peared heavy in it—he looked round, saw me, and ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. About seven o'clock, on the 11th of June, I met the prisoner in Drury-lane, and took him—I told him he was charged on suspicion of stealing some lead from No. 34, Hart-street—he said he had never been near the place, and he could prove it—he re<lb></lb>sisted violently, flung himself down on the pavement, and said he would not go.</p>

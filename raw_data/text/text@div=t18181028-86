            . I am a carpenter. On the 16th of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was coming over Tower-hill. It rained very hard; I stood under the Excise gateway. The prosecutor was laying down in the wet. The prisoner came by; I asked him to help me to take him under the gateway out of the wet, which he did, and then went away for eight or nine minutes, when he returned and said "What? is he not gone yet?" I told him he wanted a coach to take him home, and sent a boy who stood by me for one, which he did, and the coachman refused to take him. I sent for another, which came, and the prisoner assisted me to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280038"></xptr>coach-door with him. After getting him up two of the steps, he fell head-foremost into the coach. The prisoner got in to lift him up. I thought he was a long while about it. I looked round, and saw the prisoner's hand in the prosecutor's left hand inside coat-pocket. I saw him pull the pocket-book out, and put it into his own left hand side-pocket. I told the coachman of it. When the prisoner came down the steps, we secured him, and charged him with it; he denied it. I took a pocket-book and catalogue from him. There was a gas-light over the gateway, opposite the coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Where did you find the pocket-book? - A.In his left hand side-pocket. Hearn gave me another pocket-book.</p>

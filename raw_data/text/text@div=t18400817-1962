                  </hi>. I live in Tottenham-street, Tottenham Court-road. On the 9th of August I was in the New-road, just by the rails of Euston-square, about two o'clock in the morning, returning home from a friend's house—I had two half-crowns, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. about me—I saw the prisoner coming towards me—when she got within about six yards of me, she suddenly ran, and came with that violence against me, I must have fallen down if I had not laid hold of the rails—she put her hand round my body, under my coat, saying, "I am in great distress, can you relieve me?"—she was off in a moment—I heard money jink in her hand—I put my band into my pocket, and missed 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I ran after her, calling, "Stop thief"—I overtook her about thirty yards off, and told her she bad robbed me—she said, "What of?"—I said, "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—she put her hand behind her—I tried to catch hold of it—she then put her hand to her bosom—I heard money jink in her hand when it came from her bosom—I took hold of her hand, and held it till I got to the policeman—she said if I did not let her hand go, she would knock ray b—eyes out, and that she had no money in the world—I gave her hand over to the policeman—he asked what she had in her hand—she said "Nothing"—he forced her hand open, and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the way to the station-house she dropped 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I took up and gave to the po<lb></lb>liceman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 193.)

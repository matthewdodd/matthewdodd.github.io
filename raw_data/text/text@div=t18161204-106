Nichols had some boys with him to look for the prisoners, two of the witnesses were with him; soon afterwards I apprehended Davis.

I told her I came for the China which the boys had brought there that evening, and for which she had paid 3s.6d., the said, she had none. I said, I would see; she then said, some boys had left some there, but she had not bought it; and that they were to call again in the morning for it. I went into a back-room, with Mr. Nichols, and found the articles mentioned in the indictment there. Mr. Nichols claimed them. I gave them to him; and we took them, with the prisoner, Carney, to a public-house, where we had left David Davis, and some other boys. I took her into the room to see if she saw any of the boys, who had brought the China; she came out, and said, she did not. I took her to Bridewell, and sent for the prisoner, Sheen; she charged him with being the boy; she said, she could swear to him.</p>

He said, he knew nothing about it, and that he had got them from Paddington. I did not say any thing to him about the robbery. I searched him, and found a 1s.6d. token. and 6d. on him. When the prisoner, Carney, came, she said, it was some of the money she had given him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, THOMPSON. Will you swear, that you laid hold of me-A. I will; I left him with one of the boys, and he ran away. He was taken the next morning. I am sure it was him, that I laid hold of.</p>

I did; and the woman gave him 3s. 6d., and I was to eail for the 6d. in the morning, in part of my shilling. I was coming down Pye-street, and Green laid hold of me.</p>

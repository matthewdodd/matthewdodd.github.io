             (my uncle), wrote to inform me he had sent a flat of butter by Rich's waggon; on Friday morning a watchman came and told me there was a flat of butter directed to me, at the watch-house, and that he had stopped a man with it - I went and found it there. I told the constable there was a note inside for me, I opened the flat and found it there.</p>
               <p>DANIEL MAHONEY. I am a watchman. I was calling half-past five o'clock in the morning, and met the prisoner in Cow-lane, with the flat of butter on his head, I thought he was going to the George Inn, he passed the gate, I followed him, and asked him what he had got? he said it was an empty hamper that his father gave him to carry to the Bull Inn, Holborn - He threw it down. I found it heavy, and asked him what was in it, he said, butter; I asked him if his father gave him the butter, he said, no. I told him he was going the wrong way to the Bull Inn, and secured him. It was directed to Mr. Stevens.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A hamper was left every morning at a door in Newgate-street, for me to carry to the Bull Inn, I took this thinking it right</p>

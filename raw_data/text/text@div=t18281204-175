            . I am the prosecutrix's brother. On the 8th of November I was keeping the shop for her, and was in the back-parlour; there is a window looks into the shop - I saw the door gently open, which I knew before to be shut; I got up and saw Gardiner lying all across the counter - he had got the till out and was taking some money: I ran, shut the door, and heard him drop some silver into his pocket - the other prisoner was in the shop, outside the counter, but close to him; I locked the door and sent for the constable - when he came, I said if he would search Gardiner's right-hand breeches-pocket he would find the money, and he found 5s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GARDINER. I came in for a pennyworth of candy; you went round to the till, and said "I have lost half a crown and some more silver," but you did not know what. Witness. No, I locked the door, then looked into the till, and missed the money.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and found the two prisoners; I searched Gardiner, and found 5s. 6d. in silver in his right-hand breeches-pocket, and 3 1/2d. in his fob, one halfpenny in another pocket, and a knife - they both stated they came in for a halfpennyworth of candy; when I brought them out to take them to the cage, I asked where they came from - one said from the Mint, in the Borough, and the other from Gravel-lane in the Borough.</p>

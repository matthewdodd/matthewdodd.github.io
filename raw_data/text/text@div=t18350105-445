                  </hi>. I lodge in the house of Charles Smith, in Market-street, St. George, Bloomsbury. There are two other lodgers—Smith lives in the house himself—I am a lithographic printer—on the 11th of November I left my house about eight o'clock in the morning, and re<lb></lb>turned at three o'clock—I found my door broken open, which I had left locked—the catch of the lock was broken—force must have been used to do it—I found three boxes broken open, and missed the property stated in the indictment—mine is on the second floor back room—I had left the things safe in the boxes—I had seen them there about ten minutes to eight o'clock, before I went away—the prisoner had been a schoolfellow of mine—I had given him a lodging, out of charity, about a fortnight before—he left about a week before this hap<lb></lb>pened—he has been a groom—the officers had been looking for him, and tried to find him ever since, but I did not see him till last Friday night, when he came to where I was at work, rang the bell, and said he wished to give himself up—he said he had been very miserable, ever since the time he had robbed me—I went and got my coat, and gave him into the custody of Ford, a policeman—he told me he was very sorry for what he had done—I asked him what he had done with the property, that was all—he said he did not know what made him commit the offence; that it was his first offence—the articles were worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. including the money, which was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if I wanted to sell the articles, I. think I might have made 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of them.</p>

I am single, and live in Ernest-street, Regent's Park—the prisoner came to my lodging on the day of the robbery, about twelve o'clock—I was then lodging in York-square, Regent's Park—he brought a crape shawl to sell—he said his uncle had come from the Indies, and wished to sell it—he asked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I examined it, and should know it again—I did not purchase it—it was not left with me—he had a small box with two brooches, about nine shirt-studs, and an ivory bodkin—he said he had bought them while he was in place, and he did not wish his mother should see them—I took up one brooch, and looked at it in my hand—they were returned to him—I should know them again—I asked him to give me the pearl bodkin, and he did, after some hesita-tion—he took the shirt studs away with him—they were plain studs—I do not know whether they were metal—some of them were mother-of-pearl, with gilt edges—he had a wedding ring tied to the end of his handkerchief—I was taken into custody on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery, and discharged—directly the police<lb></lb>man told me the robbery was committed, he was about to search me, and then I gave the bodkin up—I get my living by different things—sometimes I do needlework—my friends do not live with me—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner three years—he called on me to sell the shawl, nothing else that I know of—several young women lodge in the same house with me—they get their living in the same way as I do.</p>

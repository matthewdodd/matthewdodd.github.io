            . On the 21st of January we had an information of a robbery in the Five Fields, Chelsea; upon which I went to search some houses at Westminster; I took the person robbed with me, and two other persons, at the door of the Nag's Head, which is a bad house, and which I had some suspicion of as a place of resort for bad people; I went into Tothil-street; I found Whitehead and the evidence at the door; Whitehead appeared to be in a good deal of confusion; upon that I took more particular notice of him; I observed him put something into his breeches pocket; having a strong suspicion of him I took hold of both his hands and held him fast, and desired the other two persons that went with me to secure the other person and Jordain the evidence; I took him into the Nag's Head; on searching him I found a small bottle in his breeches pocket; (Mrs. Hall deposes to it.)</p>

            , the accomplice. Whitehead and I went from the Nag's Head in January, the latter end; we went together into the street; there we met Eades the other prisoner; we stopt at the persumer's, the corner of Beaufort Buildings; at first we looked in and passed by; then Whitehead and I returned, and Whitehead took a knife and said I fancy there is some buckles or something within this pane of glass, and with his knife cracked the glass; but there was nothing there; upon that with the knife, he broke the shew glass, and he took out the things, and he gave them to me as he took them out at that time; Eades was not there, he was at 20 yards distance, and did not know what we were about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he set there as a spy or watch, to give you an item if there was any danger to get away?</p>
               <p>Jordain. No, he knew nothing of what we were about.</p>

               <p>I received these things of Jordain the evidence. I was coming down the Strand at the time; Jordain's pockets were so ragged he could not keep them himself, so he gave the bottle to me.</p>

               <p>I was going towards Temple Bar in order to visit my brother; after I had seen my brother I was going on towards Westminster; in my way home, in the Strand, I met Whitehead and Jordain together; they desired me to go on a little further and they would come to me; I did so; they overtook me soon after; they desired me to stop and they came back to me and gave me the thing found in my pocket.</p>

            . I belong to the 1st regiment of Lifeguards. I was informed, that Bywater had offered the rabbits for sale. I went up to him on Knightsbridge-green, between one and two o'clock, on the 15th of January: Chard was with him. I asked him, if he had got rabbits to sell: he said, no. I asked, if he had sold them: he said, he never had any to sell - he did not keep rabbits. I said, "You had some to sell this morning." He said, he was sure he had not. I questioned him a good deal, and he at last said, he was the only one who had stolen them. I told him, the constable was after him, and he would be taken. He said, "Let me put my coat on;" which he did. He then went with me to Mrs. Stole's, and showed her where the rabbits were.</p>
               <p>MARY STOLE re-examined. Q. Did Bradbury bring Bywater to you? A. Yes; he told me where the rabbits were; and said, I should get them again, if I would not hurt him. I said, "Well, take me." We went to Mr. Edwards's stables, and found them. I did not know the prisoners before.</p>

            . I live with my father: he is a cow-keeper, in New-road, Chelsea. I bought these rabbits of Chard, about half-past nine o'clock, on the morning of Saturday, the 15th of January. Bywater was with him, They both asked me to buy them. Chard asked 4 s. for them. I said, "I will give you 3 s. 6 d." I gave them 2 s.; and Chard took 1 s. and Bywater the other: they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170054"></xptr>then left. I was to give them the other 1 s. 6 d. when I could get it.</p>

            . I went to Parker's house to wash for him, at nine o'clock in the morning. The prisoner, Aggus, came up, and asked for Parker, Cresswell said he was not within. He went down, came up again in about twenty minutes, and asked for him again. Cresswell said she did not know where he was. He came up again in a few minutes, and threw down a large hamper, a handkerchief hung out of it. He brought up one or two more hampers. In a few minutes he came up again with Thorpe-both of them were carrying a large sack - I looked at them. One of them said, "Mind your washing." The officers immediately came in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never knew Parker before that day. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner AGGUS. Q. Did you not carry part of the property into the room - A. No.</p>
               <p>MARY CRESSWELL. I went to work at Parker's at velvet-weaving. Aggus came up first, and asked for Parker - I said he was not at home. He went down, returned in half an hour, and asked again for Parker. He returned in a few minutes with a hamper. He went down twice, and brought up a hamper each time-then Thorpe and him brought up a sack, which they put into a room. Aggus afterwards brought up a portmanteau. We were all taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know the day of the month. I suspected there was something wrong.</p>
               <p>REBECCA DUNKLEY. I live in the one-pair-of-stairs room in Parker's house. On the 9th of January, the prisoner, Aggus, came into my room, with a bundle under his arm - He was a stranger to me. I asked him who he wanted? he told me to hold my tongue. I heard footsteps on the stairs - He gave me no answer. He heard the footsteps, ran into my bed-room, and threw the bundle on the other side of the bed. I told him I would have nothing left there. He said, "If you will not let me leave it, throw it out of the window." I gave it to him, and he threw it into the cellar. I pushed him out of the backroom-Armstrong was at the door, and took him - I shewed him where the bundle was dropped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The window was open. Parker lives in the room where the sugar was found.</p>

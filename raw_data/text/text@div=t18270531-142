I was convinced they had got something from me, but I said nothing, being intimidated, I was then going home; the prisoner came up and appeared to console me, and offered to see me home. I said I had nothing then but my watch, and as we were going along Oxford-buildings, she snatched my watch - (that is not my way home, but she wished me to go there;) she snatched my watch and broke the guard. I called Stop thief! she was taken and the watch picked up- I had been drinking that evening. I did not know her before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty a few minutes before one o'clock - and saw the prisoner and prosecutor together - he appeared a little in liquor, and seeing the prisoner enticing him into these buildings, I went down Woodstock-street, and saw a scuffling between them in the passage of No. 21; she got up and ran past me; the prosecutor said he was robbed. I pursued, and saw her throw the watch over some high fence - I still pursued, and sprung my rattle. Partridge caught her - and we took her back to the place. Partridge got over; and found the watch - she said it was her first offence, and wished to be let go.</p>

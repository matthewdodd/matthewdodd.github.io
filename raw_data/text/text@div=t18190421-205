            . I am a shoemaker, and live at Walworth. I have a house next door to the prosecutor's, which was stripped of its lead on the 17th of March.

            . I live with Mr. Philpot. Hearing the dog bark, I went into the garden, and walked slowly to the bottom; on my return I observed the figure of a man passing from the water-closet of No. 2, on to the premises of No. 1; I gave the alarm, and opened the back garden gate - I had to climb over a gate to get there. I saw the prisoner get over the wall, and drop at the corner of Mr. Eaves's house into a recess. I found him there, collared him, and dragged him out of the recess; he had no handkerchief on his neck; the lead was found in a handkerchief similar to what he used to wear. A small piece of lead was found on Eaves's premises, just where he climbed up to get over the wall. We went to his house, were we found the prosecutor's tub.</p>

On the 21st of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my master's room, and saw the prisoner pass once or twice.

About three minutes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210079"></xptr>after I went out, and saw him getting over the wall, which leads to the prosecutor's privy; when I got up to him he turned his back.

            . I am an officer of the City. -On the evening of Monday, the 21st of November, I saw a cart cross from Tower-street towards Tower-hill; I saw two men come from behind the cart, and the prisoner was some distance a-head, carrying a basket: I followed him to Crutched-friars, and asked what he had got - he said he had been hired to carry it by a person on Tower-hill, and he thought he was behind him; I detained him, and have the basket - the articles stated were in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.When you stopped me, and I said I was hired to carry it, did you not see a person run away? A. There were two or three persons behind you, but I did not see any one run away; there was one person a little on the trot.</p>

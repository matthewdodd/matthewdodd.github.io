Being very ill, I went and lay down about twenty minutes. When I went to lay down, the shirt was in a basket, with other things that were to be ironed; and the gown hung on a pin by the door. A gentleman knocked at the door. Not hearing her go to the door, I got up, and opened it. I then missed her and the shirt out of the room. I went to her sister's to enquire after her; and when I returned I missed the gown. A little girl, who lives opposite, told me, she saw her go out with her apron full of things. I gave a description of her at the justices; and the next day I was informed she was stopped with a shirt upon her. I went and saw the shirt was mine.</p>

               <p>I asked Mrs. Hall to let me have some money. I wanted to buy a pair of shoes. She said she had missed taking a bill, and could not help me to any money; but said, I might take any thing and pledge that I thought would not be wanted. There was a gown and a shirt of one Parkinson's, who lay down with her that afternoon; she said they would be least wanted. I took them to pledge, and the pawnbroker stopped the things. One of them sent me to the watch-house, and I was taken the next day before the justices. There this poor lady was very ill, and she was near fainting; but the justice forced her to be bound over against me.</p>
               <p>Q. To the prosecutor. Did you give her leave to pawn things for you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never did.</p>

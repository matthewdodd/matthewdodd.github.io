                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Bliss, the barrister, of No. 11, Bentinck-street, Manchester-square. On the night of 12th May, about 10 o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at the door of No. 12, which is opposite, trying to open the private door with a latch key—after he had tried twice, he turned away as if he was waiting to be let in, but as he did not knock or ring, I watched, him—he went away—he afterwards returned, tried the door a third time, it opened—he went in and shut the door after him—I told the landlord's daughter, and a policeman was called.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, Bentinck-street, with my wife and family, and a lady lodger. No male person lives in the house but myself—I know the room in which the prisoner was found; it is Mrs. Wright's bedroom, the lodger—she has not a latch key—a latch key which was found in that room has been shown to me, it does not belong to the house—the door, when closed, can only be opened with a Bramah key.</p>

Q.</hi> I suppose you have applied the key to the lock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not; I have compared it with my own (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it exactly corresponds—Mrs. Wright is not here—she has lived with me about two months, and lives there still—she always rings or knocks when she comes in; Indies never carry latch keys—my servant lets her in, and not me—I am very much at home—Mrs. Wright does not very often come home late.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 132). On 13th May I was called to No. 12, Bentinck-street—I went to the second floor front, a bedroom, and when I got to the top of the stairs, the prisoner opened the door of that room (he could have heard me coming up stairs)—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he was waiting for a gentleman—I took him to the station, searched him, and found these two keys on him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and several lucifer matches—he said he was a painter—neither of these keys will open the street door—I went back to the house about half an hour afterwards with another constable, and saw him find a key behind a box near the door of the room where the prisoner had been—it opens the door of the house.</p>

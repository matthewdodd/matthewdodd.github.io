I put my hand in my pocket and missed it, the prisoner made an offer to run away, I took him with the assistance of another person that met him, and brought him to the place where the person said my pocket was pick'd, there lay my handkerchief on the ground. The handkerchief produc'd in Court and deposed to.</p>

            . I was coming down by the end of Shoemaker-Row, at this time the prosecutor had made a stop; the prisoner was there and another man with him ; a gentleman in blue said, Sir, your pocket is pick'd of your handkerchief, and by that man, pointing to the prisoner. I was within two or three yards of them, and saw the prisoner drop the handkerchief, then he ran, but the gentleman brought him back, and pick'd up the handkerchief, while he had hold on the prisoner's arm.</p>

On the 2nd of September, about ten minutes before six, when I came to my work, I crossed the yard to feed my horses; I saw the back window open of the room where I put the gentlemen's coats; I am sure I shut it the night before. I then went into the riding school; I saw the marks of many people's feet, more than usual. I went to the other side of the stables; I saw that window pushed up, and the shutter just shut down; I fastened it the over night. I found four pair of spurs missing, and three umbrellas. I saw the saddle-room was broken open, and two box-coats gone; I had locked them in the over night and in the cupboard of the stable, I missed two pair of boots; a chaise-bit was found by the officer at

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. I apprehended the prisoners on the 7th of September; Bradnum let me in; Burridge was in bed, and some other person, who made his escape; Bradnum ran up stairs. I found a coat on the table in the lower room; I found three duplicates on the bed; one for an umbrella, and a pair of overalls, in the name of Smith, and I found a chaise-bit. As I was searching under the stairs, I observed Bradnum push something of one side; I went immediately there, and took this crow. I have matched it to the doors that were broken open; it exactly corresponds. Bradnum said it was a bar that they occasionally fastened the gates with.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pickett. Look at the great coat, and the chaise-bit - A. They are my masters property, and the other box-coats are my masters property.</p>

On the day stated in the indictment, Burridge and Smith were lodgers in my house; I thought they were honest characters; the crow was certainly taken by Smith, as well as the coats; every thing was pledged in his name; he has escaped. I am innocent of this charge, so help me God.</p>

               <p>May not one hog be like another? - Yes, one man may be like another, but I am clear to the hogs as to my own brother.</p>
               <p>Should you know them among a number of others if they were mixed? - If they mixed an hundred hogs together that had no marks, it would be very difficult, but I am very positive I could pick out two of them.</p>

I said well, we must have a drop of beer first, and we had a pot of beer, and when I had sat a minute, I said, now I will go and get my man to light the copper fire, I went out to seek for Dinmore, and at last I found him.</p>

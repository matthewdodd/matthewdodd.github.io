            . In consequence of what Goddard said, I looked down into the area and saw the two prisoners, I immediately locked the gate, and then went into the hall. Goddard said they had brought the coat out and put it in the cellar. I looked into the cellar but it was not there, there was a coal cellar just by, I did not look there but went back into the servants' hall, but it was not there, I went up and alarmed my master, and when I came back I found it thrown on some lumber in the hall, rolled up; it was not there when I went up. I suppose it was in the coal cellar, which is about a yard and a half from the dust-hole. I do not know the value, it had been in wear two years I should think. I saw it safe at twelve o'clock hanging in the hall.</p>

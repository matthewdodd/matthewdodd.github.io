               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you use this wash-house yourself? - A. No; I only bought the fixtures and things of the garden, the week before, and Mr. Morrison left the key with me.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On the 24th of December last, I was fetched by Holmes, and when I came to Phillips, he swore he would not be handcuffed; he put his hand in my face, and said, d-n your eyes, if I ever get my liberty, I will remember you, for if you had not made yourself quite so busy in going to see whether the lead came off there or not, Bruce never would have been committed, and they never should have been caught.</p>

                  </hi>. I lost a silver-handled knife from my kitchen, at No. 6, Pleasant-row, Pentonville, on the 11th of February. I employed the prisoner on that day as a charwoman—she came about eleven o'clock—I went to market, and returned about three o'clock—I did not miss the knife then, but a gentleman who lodges with me, sent her out for some porter for dinner with a sovereign—she did not return with the sovereign, I was obliged to go to the station, and the handle of the knife was found on her—the blade had been broken off—I then went home, and missed it.</p>

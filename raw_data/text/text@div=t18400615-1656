                  </hi>I am a police-inspector. About one o'clock on Mon<lb></lb>day morning, the 18th of May, I was going my round, and was called by Stephen Keen, the landlord of the Prince's Head public-house, Battersea—I found the prisoner there—he was not sober—he was partly undressed—he had his coat off—I was called in in consequence of his refusing to go to bed—he said he would neither leave the house nor go to bed—he had taken a lodging there—the landlord was afraid to go to bed, and to leave him rambling about the house—after I got him up stairs, circumstances arose which excited my suspicion, and I searched him—I found on him this purse with four duplicates and the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and three other purses; one was empty, one with eleven duplicates in it, one with a seven-shilling piece and half-a-crown in it, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver loose in his pocket, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in the same pocket—I found two pencil-cases, a penknife, a pair of tweezers, a split ring on which was appended a small gold seal with a cornelian stone and two metal keys—I also found a bunch of keys, a com<lb></lb>mon metal seal, two old foreign coins, a woman's pocket, and, in his hat, a new stock of figured silk, a pair of slippers, a pair of gloves, two odd stockings, and a neck-handkerchief with two stiffeners in it—in lifting his coat off the ground I found this tablecloth (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) folded along under<lb></lb>neath between the coat and the floor—I asked whose cloth it was—he said it was his wife's—I asked what mark was on it—he said he did not know, be thought it was the mark of some of his wife's friends, and he had brought it away from home unknown to her—I sent him to the station-house—at the station-house I searched him further—I found, concealed between his draw<lb></lb>ers and his skin, inside the right thigh, two tablecloths, and one in the inner part of his left thigh—I told him I should detain him on my own respon<lb></lb>sibility till I made inquiries—he then asked for pen, ink, and paper—I cautioned him that he must be very careful, he was not compelled to write any thing, nor to say any thing; if he chose to make a voluntary state<lb></lb>ment I should assuredly make use of it—I said I had no doubt, without assistance from him, I could find out who these things belonged to—he then, in my presence, wrote this letter, addressed to Mr. Clarkson, Wands<lb></lb>worth—I called on Mr. Clarkson about half-past five o'clock—he came with me to the station-house, and identified these tablecloths, and recog<lb></lb>nised the prisoner as having slept there on the Saturday night—the pri<lb></lb>soner was present when he did that, and shook hands with Mr. Clarkson—I afterwards took the bunch of keys I found, and among the rest I found one which locked and unlocked the drawer in which Mr. Clarkson stated these tablecloths had been put, in his bed-room—Mr. Clarkson was by when I tried it, I showed the note to Mr. Clarkson.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—"To Mr. Clarkson, Wandsworth. My dear Sir, You will, no doubt, feel shocked to find I have been your enemy instead of your friend, when you see this letter, and will be surprised to think that I</p>

You little thought that when we were together this day that I had your property concealed about me; but never mind, I will return it to you two-fold when I go abroad. My respects to the cook. Farewell."</p>

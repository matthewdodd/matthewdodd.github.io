            . I am an officer. On the 23rd of September, I was on duty about one o'clock in the morning at Paddington - I heard a noise in an unfinished house; I went in, and found the prisoner, who appeared to be asleep; I asked why he did not go home; he said he and another had been to the play, and could not get in at home - I took him to the station-house, and asked what he had about him, he said nothing; I searched him, and found on him this 5s. 7d. in coppers; I asked how he got it? he said that Waller, the other boy, and him had been selling walnuts, and part of the money belonged to him - I afterwards found that the prosecutor had been robbed.</p>

On the 23rd of September, at half-past nine o'clock at night, I set down my tray of beer at a door, while I went into a baker's shop with a pot of beer; I sat it on the counter, and he gave me half-a-crown; I went to the tray, and missed a pot with between six and seven shillings in copper in it - there were four or five farthings in it - I can swear to one of these halfpence, I had had it five or six weeks in the pot.</p>

On the twenty-fifth of July, I was informed, by one Barclay, one of our men, who worked in the same shop with the prisoner; that he suspected the prisoner was not honest, for he had seen him go up into the warping rooms, at the time the other men were absent; and that the appearance of his pockets made him suspect he had taken something. I saw the prisoner a going out soon after nine o'clock; I called two or three times to him, and bid him stop; I went into the compting-house, expecting he would follow me; I staid talking to a person there two or three minutes; the prisoner not coming to the compting-house, I kept out; I found the prisoner was not gone up into the workshop; I concluded he was gone into the yard. There is at the end of the shed a tub where the men make water; there is place beyond the tub, so dark, that I could not distinguish any body; there I searched about the yard, but could not find him; I called several times; at last he came out; he was got beyond the watering tub a yard and a half, or more; he came out, and said he had got the gravel very bad; I said he had no business there, if he had. I brought him back to the shop door; then he bent himself almost double, and said he had a very bad fit of the gravel, and must go back again. He went back; I was almost close to him; he had one hand at his breeches at the watering tub, as if he was going to unbutton it; I saw him make a motion, from his pocket, with his hand; then he shifted his hand, and made the same kind of motion from his other pocket; I suspected him, but it was so dark, that I could not see what he took from his pockets. I called for a candle; when the light came, I found six bobbins of silk at the prisoner's feet. I am confident that they were not there two minutes before, for I stood in that place before; when I looked further I found six other bobbins piled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110075"></xptr> up together, about a yard and half from the tub. I took the prisoner to sir

I can swear to a bobbin of worsted, and the loose worsted; it is a particular colour of my own dyeing; the loose worsted is formed into stripes, ready to be worked up into regimental lace; it was a particular sort, for Lord

On the night of the 27th of April, 1824, by the accounts in his own writing, he was indebted to the house, and next morning he received 85 l. 18 s. 11 d. and gave an acknowledgment for it. The clerk who paid him the money is dead; business begins at eight o'clock, and at nine he was missing; he might have made disbursements before nine o'clock, but there is no entry of any; he was apprehended a fortnight ago - he had given no notice of his intention to leave - he lived in the house; I assisted the solicitor and officer to open his box on the 29th, and found six papers of corking pins, worth about 7 s. 6 d.; each paper should contain 1008 - the six should be packed in one outer paper, which is taken off - also five new stocks (three of them with our private mark). I have no reason to believe that he ever bought such things.</p>

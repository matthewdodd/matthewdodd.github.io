On New-year's-day, in the afternoon, about four o'clock, I saw Maycock on the top of the archway, close by the yard; I saw him take a gridiron out of the wash-house and take it into a field - Bradley and Metcalf were with him; I saw them all three - I saw Metcalf alone two hours afterwards, carrying the washing-tub - they were all close to the house when they had the gridiron; there were four of them together, and at eight o'clock at night I saw Maycock carrying the beer-barrel.</p>

On the 13th of January I took the prisoners, Bradley and Maycock, at a coffee-shop, in company together; Metcalf I took two days after - he acknowledged being in company with the other two at the robbery; I did not ask him any questions, but he said he was with them when they broke into the place; and that the property was taken to Maycock's house, and that the washing tub and barrel were there, and the others were hid some where - I went to Maycock's house, but could not find the beer-barrel.</p>

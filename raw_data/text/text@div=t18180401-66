            . I am a cabinet-maker. On the 28th of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing down Holborn-hill, and saw the prisoner and another man together, trying to take the handkerchief out of Mr. Sawyer's pocket, who was walking before them. They kept following him, and made a second attempt. I saw the handkerchief taken out of his pocket between Shoe-lane and Fleet-market. I went up, and collared the prisoner, he threw it down. The people said,</p>
               <p>"Let him go!" Mr. Sawyer told me to detain him - I took him to the Compter. His companion went down Field-lane. The prisoner said he was sorry for it, and if I had any children they might come to the same fate.</p>

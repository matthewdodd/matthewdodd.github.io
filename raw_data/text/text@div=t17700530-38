I found fourteen of my watches in the prisoner's house. They are only in the inside cases. (Produced in court ). They have all my name and numbers upon them, and the Arabick characters for figures. I have the outside cases here to them. (Produced in court). The prisoner told me, if I would get him the King's pardon, he would discover the whole of what I had lost. I did not promise him that I would. I took him before Sir

             about five months ago ; she was in trouble and went from me and stole these things.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Verney . I missed them about nine or ten weeks ago; I went to her in Clerkenwel Bridewell, and she said she hoped I was not come to trouble her there: I told her, I only desired I might have my things . She said, she had given them to her sister (who is a good honest woman) to pawn them. I found some at Mr Granger's, and the saucepan at another place. I catched her in bed with my servant on Monday last, which frightened me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope it was a maid servant?</p>
               <p>Verney . No; it was a man servant.</p>

            . The Prisoner married my own brother; she brought me this sheet and two plates to pawn about ten weeks ago, and I pawned them to Mr. Granger, the sheet for a shilling, and a groat a piece the two plates. Mrs. Verney came and told me my sister had brought me a sheet and two plates which she had stole; I went and fetched the sheet and throwed it into Mrs. Verney's House; I never was in such a concern in my life.</p>
               <p>Verney. I was abroad, and the sheet was thrown into my shop; the plates I had last night from Mr. Granger.</p>
               <p>Daniel . This is the sheet she brought to me, there was this mark upon it then, Mrs Verney owned it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you pawn a sheet for the use of your brother?</p>
               <p>Daniel. No, indeed; my brother knows nothing of it; my brother is an honest man, he is at sea, I would scorn to say a false thing for my child's sake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They were pawned for the use of my husband when he broke his arm, before he went to sea. <rs id="t17440113-23-verdict121" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. I am a constable of Worship-street. On the 25th of March I was going out with the patrole, about eight o'clock, into Shoreditch; as we were going along, we were of the opposite side of the way to Mr. Moss's; we saw three or four boys at his window, there were four at first at his window, he had a very great light in his window One of them crossed over to that side where we were watching them, and one (I think it was Parker) crossed over to him; Parker was one that was standing at the window. The others walked a little distance from the shop once or twice; there was a house that was quite shut up next door to Mr. Moss's, and it being a dark night, we had lost sight of them for a few minutes; in a minute or two, by the light of Mr. Moss's shop, we could see them all three quite plain, as Parker had returned, and only one remained of the dark side where we were, whom we have heard was his brother. At first I thought they might only be looking out of curiosity; I sent Gleed the officer over to see if they were doing any thing; Gleed then laid hold of Kennovan and Gable, Parker walked away, I immediately ran across with Ferris, Ferris went after Parker and fetched him back; Gleed was in the act of stooping down with the boys, I thought they would get from him; I pushed the two boys and Gleed into the shop altogether; Ferris brought Parker into the shop directly, he had only gone one door off. Gleed searched the prisoners in my presence, and took one pair of stockings from one of them, I being behind them did not see from whom.</p>
               <p>- GLEED sworn. I am a patrol of Worship-street office. On the 25th of March I was with Mason and Ferris; I observed the three prisoners at Mr. Moss's window, the house on the left hand side (to where they was) of Mr. Moss's was shut up, I observed them all three walk away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them do any thing. - A. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a fourth person. - A. Yes, he was of the side of the way where we was; after the three prisoners had walked away they returned to the window the second time; I crossed over the way by Mr. Mason's desire to see what they were doing. When I had crossed over the way I catched Gable's right arm in the window, and the prisoner Kennovan had this pair of stockings in his left hand; Kennovan seeing me, dropped the stockings on the ground, and tried to kick them away with his foot; Parker walked away immediately. I then stooped and picked up this pair of stockings off the ground, and by the time that I picked up the stockings, Ferris brought the prisoner Parker back; I am sure Parker was one of them. We searched about the street, there was no more than one pair of stockings found. When I was pushed into the shop I had this pair of stockings in my hand; I says to Mr. Moss, are these your pair of stockings, he said he had a whole row in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any search made upon the prisoners in Mr. Moss's shop. - A. I did not see them searched there. When we came to the office, I searched the two prisoners that I had apprehended, and in Gable's left hand pocket I found this knife; when I took it out of his pocket, I said to him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160011"></xptr>knife has got the putty on the point of it; he replied that it was not putty, that it was eggs that he had in his pocket and they had been broke; I examined his pockets, I could not see any appearance of eggs whatever, there is putty on the knife now. After I had searched them at the office, I immediately went to Mr. Moss's shop, I with a candle examined the window, I observed there was a piece of glass taken out of the window, it was big enough for me to put my hand in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the part of the window where you saw one of their hands in. - A. The same place, and the knife fitted the hole in the putty.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see more than three at any time. - A. There was four at first, one of them crossed over to the side of the way that we were, I could not see which of them it was.</p>
               <p>A. Did you see any of the other prisoners move from the place where you first saw them. - A. They all moved, but we did not see where they went to.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards saw them at the window again. - A. Yes, Gleed was sent over by Mason to see what they were doing, and I crossed at the same time, Gleed ran, and was rather nearer than me, I observed Gleed catch hold of Kennovan and Gable, Parker walked into the next house, a grocer's shop, which was open (the house of the other side was shut up), he just walked in and turned round, and as I got to the door he was coming out again, I caught hold of him at the door, and put him into Mr. Moss's shop; I just rubbed them all three down, and found there was nothing on them.</p>

I asked Parker what had become of the other stockings; Parker said the other boy had got all the other stocking; but that one pair. I went to his mother's in Wheeler-street, and to several other places, but I could not find him. (The stockings produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

             took them out and gave them to me; Parker went and put his hand to the window at the same time to take them out, and made a noise; the stockings fell, I picked them up; one of the men came and laid hold of me, and I dropped them.</p>
               <p>Gable's Defence. I was coming along with this boy up Shoreditch, we perceived the window broken and a pair of stockings hanging half out, I pulled them out, and gave them to Kennovan; Parker put his hand in the window and made it crack. I let them fall on the ground, Kennovan went and picked them up, and put them in his apron till the officer came, and then he dropped them.</p>
               <p>Parker's Defence. I had not been to work all that day; my master was not at work (I work at the chip hat business), my master could not get his irons to cut his wood, I was playing about the street, after I had done playing I sung a song, then I went to the tripe shop in Bishopsgate-street for some tripe; coming back I saw these two boys stopping at the shop-window, I went to the window, I knew them, they shoved me away; Gable put his hand into the window, took out the stockings, and gave them to Kennovan. I walked into a grocer's shop, and asked how much his rice was a-pound, he said sixpence; I immediately come out again, having only four pence. A gentleman came to me at the grocer's door when I had the tripe in my hand, and shoved me into Mr. Moss's shop. I put the tripe I had been buying on the counter, and there I left it.</p>
               <p>Parker called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Gable called one witness to his character.</p>

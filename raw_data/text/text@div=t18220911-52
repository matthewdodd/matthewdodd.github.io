On the 16th of August, these things were locked in a box, in a back-room on the third floor; the prisoner had come to lodge there on the 15th of August, in the front room; the box contained the articles stated in the indictment. I got up at seven o'clock in the morning, but did not go into this room till about three o'clock, and found my box removed out of the back-room into his room. There were other lodgers on the second floor; it was broken open, and these things taken away; we expected him to return to dinner, but he never returned; on the 20th, my brother secured him in the Haymarket. I have never found my property; nobody slept in the room but him; the rest of the lodgers remain now.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Chester-le-street, in the country of Durham—on the 12th of July I was on board a steam-boat off the Adelphi-pier, Hungerford—I had got on board at Westminster—the prisoner sat near me—I saw no one in his company then—I did not see him move from the rail, but I saw him standing before me in the act of taking a purse from the pocket of the prosecutor with his right hand—his comrade held the pocket—the pri<lb></lb>soner had a great coat hanging on his left arm—he put the purse under the coat—I tapped the prosecutor on the back and told him he had had his pocket picked—I laid hold of the prisoner, and told him the purse was in his possession—I secured him—he stopped down and then threw the purse overboard—it was a kind of shot coloured purse—I did not see the face of the other man—we had left the Hungerford pier about 100 yards—the vessel was in motion—a good many people were on board.</p>

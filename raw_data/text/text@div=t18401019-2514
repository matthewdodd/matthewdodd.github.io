                  </hi>. I manage the business of George Smellie, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Shadwell. About six o'clock, on Monday evening the 5th of October, I observed the prisoner outside the shop—from information I had received before, and from what I had seen, I knew that she had come for the purpose of thieving—I placed myself behind a half-glazed door—when I had done so about five minutes, she came into the shop, and passed along a row of cloaks and gowns—these pillow-cases were</p>

               <p>suspended aloft by a piece of string, and as she came by, she pulled them down, and put them behind some curtains—she then mixed with the per<lb></lb>sons pledging—I watched her about half an hour, when she saw the coast clear she stooped down, and picked them up—I came out, put my hand on her, and asked what she had got—she said, "What! nothing"—she had fre<lb></lb>quently been in to buy and pledge, but on this occasion she wanted nothing—I caught hold of her by the wrist, and threw her backwards, and these things lay at her feet—I snatched them up from between her ancles, and said, "I have got you at last"—I held her till a policeman came—she had not got out of the shop when I took the pillow-cases from her.</p>

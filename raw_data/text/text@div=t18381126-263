                  </hi>. I am clerk of the guardians of Lambeth. Jackson used to receive the money for the work done by the paupers—it was his duty to hand that over to the prisoner, and at the end of the quarter the prisoner was to give me an account of all sums received—he was dismissed on the 16th of October—I saw him on the 18th, and asked him for his account—he rendered me an account of the money he had re<lb></lb>ceived, amounting in the whole to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him for the particulars of it—he gave it me—one of his items <hi rend="italic">was</hi> "4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Piggott"—I have no doubt of the receipt of it—he did not give me an account of the sum of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the date of this receipt, the 26th of July—he did not give me an account of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these three dates are wholly omitted in his account—he has never accounted for these sums before or since—I asked him when he gave his account, whether that was all he had received, he said it was—these receipts are in his hand-writing—it would not be his duty to leave receipts in the hands of Piggott or Jackson, unless he received the money.</p>

               <p>the prisoner—he was responsible to them—two or three members of the Board are here—the accounts should be audited every three months—they have not been audited the last six months—I had nothing to do with the appointment of the prisoner—he did not say that was the best account he could give, nothing of the kind—he said he was going to live in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood, and he would look in, or something to that effect—he did not say for what purpose—the parish came under the dominion of the New Poorlaw in the beginning of the year 1836—the duties of the station filled by the prisoner have increased.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the man you laid hold of by the collar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before you went from the waggon to go into the yard? - A. No; it was crouded with people, the mail coaches were just going out between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Your yard is paved with very rough stones, so as the waggon might be put in such a position that a package might tumble out? - A. It was not rough at all where the waggon stood.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You saw him put his foot on the wheel, and take the parcel out of the waggon? - Yes; and as soon as he took his foot off the wheel I laid hold of him, and he tried to get from me, but he could not get away from me with the parcel; he dropped the parcel.</p>

               <p>JOHN TEW. On the 30th of May I was in <placeName id="t18260622-212-crimeloc1080">Crown-court, Blackfriars</placeName>

I saw the handkerchief laying as I was going along. I sent for a constable - he asked me what I detained him for; I said he should go, but I would have my handkerchief first; a person in the crowd then asked if I would let him go if I got it; I said I would have it first, and then I would see. I took the prisoner into Crown-court, and a woman gave me the handkerchief through the crowd. The prisoner then got through some railing, and I tried to get him out, but could not; two gentlemen came up, and got him out, I am certain the prisoner was the person I saw running away.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you was in Crown-court did you observe me running? A. I did not see you till my handkerchief was stolen - you was then going from me; I observed no other person near me, but the gentleman who spoke to me. I was reading a paper; I believe he did say he saw a handkerchief laying down, and he would show me where it was. I did not ask the woman how she became possessed of it; the examination was put off to try to find her, but we could not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from the Borough, and was running to get into Chancery-lane - I came through the court, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw a crowd coming after me, and thought rather than they should take me I would run into the coach-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. TEW re-examined. Q. What time elapsed from the time you lost your handkerchief till you got it? A Perhaps half an hour; I had sent some persons for an officer, but they could not get one.</p>

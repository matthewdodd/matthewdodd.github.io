               <p>W. Hartly. I had been at London, and returning homeward, I went to ease myself in a Ditch in <placeName id="t17330912-4-crimeloc20">White-Horse-Field, in Radcliff</placeName>

I was waked by Somebody's twitching my Hat away, for I had put the Loop of it about my Finger. I started up upon my Breech, and, God! says I, where's my Shoes and Buckles? Says a Man, who was not far from me, There goes he that has got 'em, and pointed to the Prisoner, who was running off. I saw my Hat in his Hand, and followed him barefoot. He dropp'd my Hat, and jump'd over a Bank into a Garden, and I after, and took him. Now are not you a Rascal, says I, to rob a Man of his Clothes? You think to get the Devil and all of a Man, if he is but a little tight and clean. He called after the other Man, who followed at a Distance, and said, Jack! where' the Man's Shoes? but he sheer'd off. Then, says the Prisoner, if you'll go with me to Rag-Fair, plausible you may find him a selling them. So I collar'd him, and took him with me, and he went from one Place to another under that Pretence, but only wanted an Opportunity to get off; and so I got Help and secured him.</p>

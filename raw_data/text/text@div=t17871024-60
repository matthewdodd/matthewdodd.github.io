               <p>I was present when the house of Neven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240070"></xptr>was searched; I saw, found there, a callico napkin, the same thing as a towel, a chintz muslin shawl; I think there were two calico handkerchiefs; I do not recollect any thing else, any more than some patterns which we used to sell the handkerchiefs by; no pieces of handkerchiefs; they were found in the drawers of a bureau up one pair of stairs in a bed-room.</p>
               <p>Did you hear from Neven himself, that it was his apartment? - I do not know that I did; I took it to be so; he said, he knew nothing of them, he supposed his wife bought them.</p>
               <p>Were you present in Court when Gilbraith was tried? - I was.</p>
               <p>Were those things produced on that trial? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether they were a part of the things for which Gilbraith was indicted? - They were not; we supposed them to be things stolen by Gilbraith.</p>
               <p>But were they included in the indictment against Gilbraith; how many chintz muslin shawls were there in that indictment? - Two.</p>
               <p>How many altogether were found? - I I do not know; Lavender has a list.</p>

               <p>Do you know of any connexion between the prisoner Neven and Gilbraith? - Only by intercepting a letter addressed to Neven from Gilbraith.</p>

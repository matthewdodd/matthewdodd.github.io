               <p>I took charge of the prisoner; when I took him, a number of them came up to me, and asked me in a blasphemous manner, what the man had done; I insisted on his going with me; I suppose there were fifty or more rescued him, and with the loss of half his coat; I am sure it was the prisoner that was shewn to me by the prosecutor; I knew him exceeding well above all men in London.</p>

I believe you have picked my pocket; I said, no; in a quarter of an hour he came back with the patrol and took me; we both struggled together, and I got away; the patrol saw me several times since, and did not take me; I had plenty of witnesses yesterday, but they thought my trial would not come on to day.</p>

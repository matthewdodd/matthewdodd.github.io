            . Last Thursday morning about ten o'clock, being the 18th of July, I was backwards in the yard washing my hands, my servant came to me and said he wanted 7 d. to pay for some brass that he had bought. I came into the shop, there was the prisoner. I gave him 7 d. it was for some old brass which he had brought. He went out, and I believe he went a little way down the street, for a little time after came a neighbour and told me he had offered this brass arm to sell ( producing one) it is my property. I went to the prisoner, and charged him with stealing it, he said he bought it, and mentioned first one place then another.</p>

            . The prisoner came into my shop betwixt 10 and 11 o'clock on Thursday last to sell a parcel of old brass. the brass weighed 4 ounces; he offered this brass arm of a candlestick to sale; I sent over to the prosecutor (he lives over against me) I thought it was his; the prisoner went out of the shop, and Mr. Child sent after him and took him.</p>

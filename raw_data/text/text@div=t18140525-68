I asked him whether he had bought any asses; he said, no, he had not. I told him they were two young asses, and an old crop mare ass; he said he did not recollect buying any. I then asked him where he lived; he said, in Union-court, Chick-lane; he would go shew me. In going along, I asked him whether he had not got some asses at home; he said he had got one young one. I asked him how he came by that; he said he bought it of a young man; he should know him again. We then went to his house, and saw this ass which has since been sworn to be the property of Lord Ellenborough. In the room I found one young ass, locked up in the room, as if it was a stable for asses. That ass has been since claimed as Lord Ellenborough's property. Thornton was with me. Thornton is Lord Ellenborough's servant. When the young ass was claimed, the prisoner Hill then changed his story, and said he had bought of

            . I am a brick-maker; I live at Egham, in Surry. On the 10th of March, Purvis and I went to Rochampton; we went to Lord Ellenborough's ground; we took three asses out of the yard; two young stone asses, and an old crop mare ass. We drove them up to Smithfield. It was on the 10th of March that we took them; I do not recollect the day of the week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is Thursday, and Friday is Smithfield market, is it not - A. Yes. We took them at twelve o'clock at night on Thursday, and drove them up to Smithfield. At Smithfield, Purvis went away from me; he said he would come back to me. I then was left in possession of the asses. He returned in about a quarter of an hour. We drove the asses down to Union-court, Chick-lane. We went to Hill's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. He did not come to market to buy them - A. No. When we got to the door a man of the name of Harl bought one young stone ass; the crop mare, they gave five shillings for that. One young ass we drove into Hill's stable; the other two we drove to a gin shop, where the landlord wrote out a bit of paper for the purchase of the asses, two pound five shillings. Harl paid the money before the landlord.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the landlord's name - A. I do not know. The money was paid by Harl to Purvis. Hill was by at the time. We had some gin together. When we came out of the door, Purvis paid it all back except twenty-five shillings at that time. Hill and Harl were in conversation together; I could not hear what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the young ass and the cropped mare - A. They drove them away. I parted with them at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your share of the booty - A. After<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250041"></xptr>the gin was paid for there was only one pound two shillings. I got seven shillings for my share.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go afterwards to Hill's house with Thornton and Snow - A. I did not go to the house. I saw Hill in Cow-cross; I said, here is the person that this bargain took place between Purvis and Harl.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You seem a nice clever, careless, fellow; have you been tried yourself - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you ought to be. Do not you come here to give evidence, and not to be tried - A. I came here to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you stole the asses did you tell Lord Ellenborough's servant - A. I was taken in custody, and then I told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You broke out of prison, did not you - A. I walked out of the watchhouse. I was taken a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that paper in your hand, and look at that - A. I cannot exactly swear that this is the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that forty-five shillings was paid for the asses, and did not you tell the poor man at the bar that you came by them honestly - A. No. Forty-five shillings was given down before the landlord; and when we came out of the public-house Purvis gave the money back, except one pound five shillings. That was done to make it look more like the value.</p>

            . I was with Wilkinson at half-past six o'clock in the morning; we went into the wine-vaults; he said he had lost his purse and money - the prisoner was at his side and the other young woman was close to him; they were close to him for about ten minutes; I saw the prisoner put her hand into her bosom, take out the purse, and pass it outside her linen, between her thighs; she kept it there about three minutes and then let it fall; the other woman, who was close to her, turned round, and asked if I would accept of a glass of spirits; I refused and placed myself against the door; there were seven or eight men there; some of them went out at the other-door.</p>

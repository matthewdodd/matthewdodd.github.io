             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect having any parcel from Mattocks, directed for Mr. Charles Smith, of Bunhill-row? - A. Yes, a little deal box; I took it till I got just beyond Whitebread's brewhouse, the prisoner at the bar came up to me -</p>

            Between twelve and one, he asked me whether I was going to Mr. Smith's -</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - A. On the Tuesday; I told him; he said, you young dog, why did you not bring it before; I told him I could not conveniently bring it before, for it came in but last night; he said, I know better than that, for it came in yesterday; says he, I have not money enough now, you must bring it here; going along Bunhill-row, he said, I have got money enough now, and gave me two shillings, I gave him four pennyworth of halfpence in change; he then went as far as the first pair of gates up Bunhill-row, on the left-hand side of the way; there was a parcel of women, he talked to them upwards of a minute, and as I had been served such a trick when I was a school-boy, I followed him up as far as Mr. Smith's court; I crossed over to the court, and saw the gate shut too after him; then I thought I had delivered it right; I charged one shilling and eightpence for the carriage, but it was not the proper charge; I got as far as the India-house, and then I found I was wrong; I went back to Mr. Smith's to rectify the mistake, and they told me no parcel had been there; I saw the prisoner again on the Friday following, at the office in Hatton-garden; there were thirteen or fourteen together, and I picked out the prisoner; I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it that you have been quite sure the prisoner is the man? - A. When I saw him at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. No, you were not, I was there, you know? - A. I did not know him when I first went in, till they desired him to stand up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, at the last examination, that you were not quite certain, but you believed he was the man? - A. I did not say so, I was always sure he was the man.</p>

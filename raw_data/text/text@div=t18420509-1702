                  </hi>. I am seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Courier,</hi> lying at Windle-wharf—I had this copper funnel safe at nine o'clock in our ship. About ten minutes past nine, as I was going to bed, the prisoner came on board—I said, "Holloa"—he said, "All right," and went on shore—I watched him on shore—he then stood and looked at me—he had nothing with him—I went below—I thought he had been after something, and while I went down to dress myself the prisoner came on board again, and raised the funnel up—I went up and ran after him, and he threw it into a barge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never had the funnel in my hand. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am sure he is the man—he came back a third time to fetch the funnel, thinking I did not see him throw it down, and he tried to break into the cabin—I caught him in East-street, and he had 7lbs. of copper nails on him, which are taken out of ships' bottoms—the funnel belongs to William Carter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went down to look for work, and as I was coming away the man ran after me and asked me about his funnel; I was never aservaut t of the docks all the time.</p>

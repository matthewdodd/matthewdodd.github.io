                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman H</hi> 87). On 18th Feb., at 3 o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner in Mr. Riley's cellar, under the house—there are bars about an inch and a half asunder under the shop window, on the flags—I found this iron bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) broken off, by which means anybody could get into the cellar—I tumbled in, turned my light on, and found the prisoner—(I had called to him before I went in, and asked what he was doing there; he made no answer)—I laid hold of him; I said nothing, but he said, "Bad company has led me into it; I am innocent, two men broke the flap, and unlocked the padlock, and put me in, and I was to go up stairs, open the front door for them, and let them in; and hearing the noise when you came to the flap, I took you to be them"—I searched him, and found in his pocket this wax taper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and two lucifer matches; there were several matches thrown about the ground—while I was searching him, he said, "I have got no tools about me, the men have got the tools, I am innocent, I have been led into it"—I had passed the cellar flap about twenty minutes before, it was safe then, it locks inside—he said the men lived in Brick-lane, but next morning he denied knowing anything about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of 75, Whitechapel-road, in the parish of St. Mary's, Whitechapel. On the night of Wednesday, 18th Feb., I was called up by a policeman, I went down, and found the prisoner in custody—I had seen the cellar shut up at 10 o'clock the night before—I found the flap forced when I came down—I lost no property, there wasnot time—there was cheese in the cellar, and butter in the shop.</p>

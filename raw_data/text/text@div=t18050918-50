               <p>Q. Did you search his lodgings? A. Yes; on the 15th of August, I and Stanton, between ten and eleven at night, found the things that are in the indictment, and now produced; we entered the room, the prisoner was in bed, pretending that he was ill, his wife told me that he was so deaf that he could not hear, and she hoped that we were not come to fetch him or her away; I answered, I did not know that; what have you got under this blanket on the table; I pulled the blanket off the table, and there I saw a quantity of linen of different descriptions; I tied it up, and begged Stanton to get the man out of bed; he pretended he was so ill he could not get out of bed; we forced him out, and when we pulled the clothes off the bed, we saw he had some of his clothes on; Stanton pulled him up and saw another bundle and two pocket-books; we took them both into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have lost my hearing and part of my sight.</p>

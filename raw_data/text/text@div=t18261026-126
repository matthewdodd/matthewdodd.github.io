On the 30th of September, at half-past five o'clock, I went to lay down, being ill; my room door was then locked, but I laid down with it only pushed too; at a quarter past six my daughter awoke me, to give me some tea; I found the room in a litter, and the contents of a box strewed about, which were safe when I went to bed - on the table lay a gown and two shawls - my daughter looked round the corner of the bedstead, and said, "Here is a man in the room;" I then found the prisoner under the bed - I immediately looked for my jacket, which I had laid on my bed, with 40l. in it, and found it on the floor; my daughter ran down, and got two persons up; I endeavoured to arouse the prisoner, who pretended to be asleep; we at lost got him up, and asked what he did there - we could make nothing of him, but he said he wanted to go to bed; he then suddenly jumped up, and made a desperate resistance. An officer came in about five minutes, and tied his hands, and in his hat I found a handkerchief; all the other things had been moved from their places.</p>

I took him some tea, and found the property strewed about - I found the prisoner partly under the bed, concealed; he affected to be asleep; we could hardly awake him - I got two persons up, and he at last made a powerful resistance - the officer took him.

             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden; I was standing at the Hat and Tun door, in Hatton-wall; On the 18th of April, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner and a boy past me, the prisoner had got an old basket on his back, it was as much as he could carry; I suspected that it was stolen property; I followed him and at the bottom of Vine-street, Saffron-hill, he stopped at an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this boy any thing with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the old iron shop? - A. One March; he mounted the steps of the door and threw it down and run away; I rather suspected that he saw me standing at the top of the hill; I imagine that the boy told him I was following him; I immediately laid hold of the boy and took the property.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the bag contain? - A. A great quantity of iron old and new; I took the boy to the office; and the boy was committed to the House of Correction; and by the boy I found out that he worked for Mr. Bailey; and where he lived; I went and took him up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the prisoner up are you sure he is the man that run away? - A. I have no doubt, I asked him how he came to run away; he said, he run home on purpose to shut his house up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his house? - A. No. 2, in Weston-park, Lincolns Inn-fields; not having an opportunity to take him before the Magistrate, I took him to the House of Correction, I also informed Mr. Bailey the next morning what I had done; I took Mr. Bailey with me and searched the house, and Mr. Bailey owned the iron and tools; I brought it away; I had two hampers full; Mr. Bailey saw the iron at the Office, that the prisoner threw down at the old iron-shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing to the boy before he run away? - A. I did, but I do not know what it was, he run pretty fast, he had like to have knocked down two or three people as he was running away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to his house, was there any forge there? - A. There was, and a great many tools which Mr. Bailey owned, and there was a stove there, in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. Never to my knowledge. I produce the property.</p>

             sworn. - I am a smith, I work for Mr. Bailey; I know the tools to be Mr. Bailey's property. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I keep a little smith's shop, and have done for seven years past; sometimes I have a man to work for me; I buy old iron; I buy half an hundred weight or an hundred; if it is too heavy for me, I sell it again; I left work at seven o'clock and went with this iron, with my little boy; I said to my wife, my love, I will leave Ted there to take the money, I will not stay, she being ill, and I had not fastened the house up; I went down to Mutton-hill, to the iron shop, and left the boy there; I returned home to my house again directly, my wife being ill at home; I could not think where the boy staid; by and by, after nine o'clock, a person came to our door and knocked; I said, who is there; I opened the door, and this officer came in; he said, are you the person that belongs to this house; I said, I am; did you leave this boy with the iron; where did you get it; I said, I have got more; he said you must go to the Justice, and let us know how you got it; I shewed him all down the cellar; said he, you must go to the Justice; I went to Hatton-garden, and he took me into a public-house; then, by and by, he said, the Justice was gone home; he took me to Clerkenwell for that night, till the next day; at twelve o'clock he came up to me again, and took me to the office, and when I found what he had brought there, I saw enough to frighten five hundred people; I said, what did you bring this property here for, this property I have had by me this seven years; they took every thing from me but my anvil and my forge; if masters knew a man worked for himself they would not employ him; I make stove-grates for one particular gentleman.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He has not had the chain and pulley above a week.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

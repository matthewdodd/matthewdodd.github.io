            : these were not the stockings I put by; they were from another parcel; I am certain they were taken out of the parcel on the counter; I remembered seeing this pair on the counter, when I shewed the stockings to him; I knew them by the mark; I am sure they were in the parcel when he came into the shop; there were more pairs than one in the parcel with my mark, but I know this by the pattern; they were coloured silk without clocks; I have sold some in the shop of the same pattern, but not to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know the number that was in the parcel? - No.</p>
               <p>Till he dropped the stockings, was you aware that he had any? - From what he had done, and I saw him in the motion of putting them in his pocket; I believe there was but one pair of that pattern in the parcel.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150042"></xptr>Suppose you had not suspected any thing, should you have missed these stockings from the parcel? - I don't suppose I should.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Upcott, I observe these stockings are a very common pattern? - They are a very particular pattern, it has not been made above six weeks.</p>
               <p>You said you were sure this pair was there when the prisoner came in; can you venture to swear that these stockings were in the parcel? - I am as positive of it, that those stockings were in the parcel, as that I am in this place now; I knew them by the particular pattern of the stockings, and I swear more positively from hearing the noise of the parcel; I don't swear positively, by the pattern of the stockings, that they were in the parcel, but also by hearing a rustling on the counter.</p>
               <p>Upon your suspicions of this man, you went round to a leaf of the counter; and by your own account you carried him to the other side of your shop; what is the width? - About four feet.</p>
               <p>Now these stockings were found on the floor? - As close to the opposite counter as possible.</p>
               <p>How long might any stockings have been open on that counter? - Three or four hours, but not silk; we never have silk on that side.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear that there had been no silk opened on that side? - It is merely accidental if any are opened on that side; there was not a single pair opened on that counter at that time.</p>
               <p>I would just wish to know, so as to see, with all your accuracy, how he took them out? - I took them up at his feet.</p>
               <p>I want to know how you could see so much as this? - There were four candles in the shop.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that you saw so accurately? - I have sworn it, and I will abide by the whole course of my evidence.</p>

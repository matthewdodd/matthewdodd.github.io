She said she should get the watchman to call her, which she did at five the next morning; she called me about seven o'clock, and asked me if I had taken in the gowns - I said No - she said they were gone; I then told her to go to Mount-street watch-house for an officer - she returned, and said there were none there; I then double locked the door, so that she could not get out, and went to Bow-street, got two officers, who came, and took her.</p>

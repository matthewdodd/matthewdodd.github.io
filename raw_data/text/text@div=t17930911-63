               <p>Q. Tell me whether or no you saw them at the time you was going along<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110109"></xptr>Oxford-road? - I saw Brown, but I did not see the other then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you or do? - He said how do you do Mr. Hunsley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - Not to my knowledge. I said, you have got the advantage of me; he said he had got a gentleman in town that had six daughters, and they must have some of my fruit by all means; I told him I had none of them to spare, I had agreed with one man for all I had, and I would shew him where the man lived, and he might have them twice a day if he pleased; and I went to shew him the shop where I served with the fruit.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you went? - I forget the street's name, it was just at this lower side of Mary-le-bone, I went to the shop with him, and he said very well, and we went into an alehouse and had a pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. What street was it? - I don't know the street, the house was just by the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of the man that kept the house? - We had but one pint of beer there, and just as we got the pint of beer Linton came in too, and he would drink with us; Brown asked Linton what he was? he said he was come up to London to receive his fortune, as he had an aunt dead; Brown says to him, how much is your fortune? O, says he, three hundred pounds, to the best of my remembrance, so says he, if ever a one of you will shew me fifty pounds I will give you ten guineas; Linton said so to Brown, and I, says I, I have no money to signify; and I went to a man that I knew, and I borrowed the sum of the notes, forty-five pounds, of

            , in Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what notes they were? - No, I am no Scholar; I know them to be four bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what sum where these four notes? - Two ten pound notes, a twenty pound, and a five pound. So in going back, covetous to win the money, thinking I was never master of so big a sum, Brown meets me; as soon as Brown met me Linton came, and they took me up to Jacobs's house, I don't know the street's name, and we went in there, it was a public house, and had a shilling worth of brandy and water; Linton said if we could shew fifty pounds a piece he would give us ten guineas a piece; I produced this sum that I had borrowed, I produced forty five pounds in notes and five guineas besides; I laid it down on the table, the forty five pound in notes and and the five guineas; I laid down the notes, and I think the same money, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay down all the notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money besides that you laid down, besides these bank notes? - I had some money out.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you lay down? - I believe a couple of guineas. Linton said his lawyer told him he was a fool, and could not write his A, B, C. Brown says, let us see if you can write A, B, C. He writ it down A, B, C. Says Linton, I have writ it, where is all your money? Brown says he had given his Polly some to buy her some clothes; and where is your rest? says he, my Polly's aunt has got it and locked it up. There was a letter or two that Brown made and put a pot over it, and so he was to guess; Linton laid a guinea with me that he guessed the letter that was under the pot, and he did not guess it, and so I had the guinea, I took the guinea when I had won it. Then another guinea was laid, and I won it, then Brown took up the money and the notes, forty five pounds the whole sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take up any money that you laid down? - I cannot tell how much he took up, but there was but one guinea of mine, and he took that with him; when he had taken it up they both went away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110110"></xptr>I followed them out, and said stop them! they are rogues and thieves; and they were stopped immediately, and brought back, and gave me every penny of my money again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then you went away after you had got your money? - I did; and the people followed and stopped me and said I should come back; I had got nothing but my own money, and Linton gave me a guinea more.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you won a guinea, what did you do with that? - I put it down again, they gave me a guinea over, they said that was to bear my charges, I was going home, but Scott and the other man followed me as far as the gravel pits, and fetched me back again.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to Scott to get some money of these people? - I mentioned to Scott that I had won nine guineas of them, and desired him to go back and get it of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you won these nine guineas? - In shewing the fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Clay, the person of whom you borrowed this money, that it was all a gambling transaction between you and these men? - To be sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went before the magistrate the 10th of July? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And there these men were committed as rogues and vagabonds. Now afterwards you went before the magistrate again? - I had some things coming to town, and I begged leave to go and come to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all they were committed as rogues and vagabonds? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. This Mr. Scott has told you that he will pay you the expences of this prosecution? - He said I should be paid, the justice said so.</p>
               <p>Court. And so you shall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not Mr. Scott tell you that if you preferred an indictment against these people for felony, that he would pay you? - I cannot be sure whether he did or not. The justice told me I should be paid my charges; I paid ten shillings when I filed the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. After the men were taken up in the street, who was it said they had only been gambling? - I cannot tell.</p>

I saw the prisoner Brown, I believe it to be him leading along the old man, the prosecutor, and I believe Linton he was along side of him; what made me take so much particular notice, I knew Linton some time, and I knew what they both were; in the course of about eight minutes I saw them both run by me, they came out of a public house, I believe it is the Barley Mow, it is kept by Mr. Jacobs, I believe his name is James, it is in <placeName id="t17930911-63-crimeloc343">Mary-le-bone Parish</placeName>

               <p>Q. You can tell us whether somebody or other did not talk about their having been gambling? - They both of them declared, both Brown and Linton, that they and the old man had been gambling, and the old man said they had not, and the old man, as soon he came into the room swore that he would not take the money but he would prosecute them; the two prisoners at the bar desired that Mr. Jacobs might take up the notes, and he delivered them to the old man, and the old man kept them when Mr. Jacob's told them they were very good notes.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoners on the 10th of July, at East-street, I was standing in my own room, and the woman that lives in the first floor said to me that there was a mob of people; and I went out, and I saw Brown, and he laid hold of me by the right arm, and said I hope you will be my friend; and a Mr. Scott had hold of him, and we went to the public house, and Linton and Brown were both there, and Scott went for the old man, and when the old man came in he said you have robbed me, and I will prosecute you; Linton put down the bank notes, a twenty pounds, two ten pounds and a five pounds on the table; Brown took them up hearing the old man say that he would prosecute him, and swore that he should not have them, but Linton persisted that he should have the money if he would not prosecute them; the old man with the persuasion of the publican and the company that were there took the money, he took the money and was got out of the house immediately.</p>

I said they are good, I told him they were so good that I would give him cash for one or all; I said now tell me what is the matter; says he, only some gentlemen have been a joking with me, and I have won ten guineas, I have got one and my own money, and if you had been with me Mr. Tribble I should have had the other nine; I have seen him repeatedly since and he has told me the same.</p>

Mr. Scott came after the old man for to make him go back, and Mr. Hunsley says to Mr. Scott, the butcher, they owe me nine guineas more, do you run back and get that; Mr. Scot immediately ran back, and then he came and he said to a constable there, that is the man that has been robbed; says the constable, you must go back to give charge of the people, and then we went back and had a drop of brandy; and that is all that I know about it.</p>

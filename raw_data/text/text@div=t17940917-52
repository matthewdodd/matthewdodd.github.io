On Tuesday the 5th of August, about half after eight, as near as I can recollect, in the morning, I heard a calling, Mr. Reeves! Mr. Reeves! here is a woman stealing your pots; I immediately went to the door, and I saw Mrs. Russell, who was the woman that called, she said, there she goes up the street, she has got some of your pots; I ran after her, she turned up Hanover street, and she took the pots and slung them into the passage of the White Bear; I did not see her sling them from her; but I heard them fall, and the gentleman is here in whose house she slung them; and he picked them up, and gave them to me; I pursued the woman, and took her about two houses further; I brought her back to my own house, I sent for a constable, and delivered them up to his care; I did not lose sight of her at all; that is the woman.</p>

I was coming down the court, and they said, that I had got some pots, and I had no such property when I was taken; I know nothing at all about it; the gentleman sent me word that he would have nothing to do with it, he did not think I was the person, and so I have not sent for any body.</p>

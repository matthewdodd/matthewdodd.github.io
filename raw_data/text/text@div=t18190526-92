On the 25th of April, between nine and ten o'clock at night, three boys came into the shop, and asked for some jellies - I gave them three spoons to eat them with; before they had finished eating them all three ran away with the spoons, leaving the jellies behind. Reeve, the witness, was one of them; I know him well, but cannot speak to the prisoner.</p>

            . I lived at Mr. Adam's, public-house, in Tottenham-court-road. On Sunday night, about half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner, I, and Lyfield went into the pastry cook's shop, and asked for three six penny jellies - the lady gave us two, and said she had no more; we asked for three spoons, Lyfield ran out with the spoon, the prisoner followed him, and I ran out too. Each had a spoon. Brown took mine from me in Greek-street, and took them to the Black Dog and Still, Short's-gardens, and gave them to Mrs. Wild.</p>

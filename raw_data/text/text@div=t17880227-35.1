               <p>The coats mentioned in the indictment were taken out of the passage in my house.</p>
               <p>- SHIPLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker, in Piccadilly; on Thursday, the 14th of February, the prisoner came between ten and twelve o'clock, and asked, if we could send to Mr. Smith's, in Swallow-street, for two great coats he wanted to pawn; I said, no; he said, would I take them of him if he brought them? I said, yes; and he went and returned with the two great coats in ten minutes; upon a suspicion he did not come honestly by them, I jumped over the counter, and told him he must stay there till I went to hear what Mr. Smith said about it; he said, I need not go, for he had taken the coats from a house by Buckingham-gate, but could not tell exactly where; I told him I must take him before a magistrate, but would be as favorable as I could.</p>
               <p>Reid. I did not miss the coats till Thursday, the 14th; when a man came and told me they were at the office; I saw them last before they were taken away on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in Court, and deposed to by the Prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>It is a false charge; I met a man, and he asked me to go to the pawnbrokers, and ask him to send for two great coats to Mr. Smith's in Swallow-street; I went in; he would not send; I came out and told the man; he said, if I would go in and pawn them, he would give me a shilling; I went in with them, and the man stopped me; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270050"></xptr>told him a man had given them to me, and he said, he would be favorable to me.</p>

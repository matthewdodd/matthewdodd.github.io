My lodgers who occupy the first and second floors enter by the same door. I went out when it had turned five o'clock in the evening of the 30th, I left my wife and child in the parlour. The shop door in the passage when I went out was latched. I returned in about an hour. When I returned I went into my shop, I missed nothing that I had left there, I missed the things at a quarter after seven on the Monday morning. These gowns I had taken to do; two pairs of silk stockings, the silk sash, and the silk fringe, were all to be dyed.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. I am a city officer. On Monday the 1st of this month, I was in Fleet-street I had occasion to follow five men, and I followed them until they came to Pie-street, Westminster. In coming into Pie-street, at about twelve o'clock, I saw the two prisoners pass the five men, and speak to them; they were not two of the five. I observed the prisoner Curle with something under his coat; and knowing them, I suspected that they had something that did not belong to them. Curle turned round and saw me, and I knew be knew me. When I approached him, he gave the parcel to the prisoner Richards; I stopped them, and asked them what they had got; that was after he had delivered the parcel to Richards; Richards hesitated some time, and then said he had been of an errand for his mother. I asked him what was in the bundle? he said silk gowns. I asked him where he was going with them? and he said he was going to his mother's. I then asked him where his mother lived? and he said in Titchfield-street. I could not get anything out of him but that he was coming from his mother's and he was going to his mother's. On the Wednesday or Thursday I discovered Mr. Fielding had been robbed. This happened on the Monday.</p>

Last Saturday night, about half-past twelve o'clock (I had spent the evening with my father, at Ratcliff-highway), I met the prisoner in <placeName id="t18271206-198-crimeloc1056">Whitechapel-road</placeName>

I live in Finch-street, Whitechapel - I did not stop at all; before I reached home I found my pocket was turned out, and all my money and these other things gone; I had given her nothing - she had then left me; I went to the patrol - he pursued her- she was taken in about twenty minutes, and produced most of the things herself.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house by the patrol; she took no notice of the charge, but laughed, and said he offered her two half-crowns, which the prosecutor denied; I said, "Let us see what you have got;" she pulled out this money and all the other things but the ink-bottle, which I found in her pocket.</p>

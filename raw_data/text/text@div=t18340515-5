             (policeman D 67). The prisoner was given into my custody last Saturday, about half-past four o'clock, in Oxford-street - as we went to the station-house I asked his name - he said it was nothing to me - I asked where he lived, he made no answer - I neither threatened nor promised him - when we were at the station-house I asked what induced him to do this - he said he had no work - he had heard the charge made, it was for stealing a lady's reticule from her arm - he said then, "I suppose it will be all up with me this time" - when I got to the station-house I had searched him for the pocket-book, but not finding it, I said, "What has become of the pocket-book?"- he said if we had looked out sharp we might have seen that as well as the purse; and then he said he hoped somebody had got it that would do good with it, it was a good prize - I received the bag from the witness - it had a red purse and three sovereigns and a half, five half-sovereigns, two shillings, and two sixpences in it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing through Castle-street promiscuously - I picked it up - several persons saw me pick it up, and called after me - they ran after me, and being so closely pursued I threw it away.</p>

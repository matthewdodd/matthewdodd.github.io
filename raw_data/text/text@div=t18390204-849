                  </hi>. I keep a stationer's shop at Deptford—I sell combs. On the 19th of January the prisoner came into my shop to offer matches for sale—I did not want any—I had an opportunity of seeing him, and I believe he is the boy—soon after he was gone I missed six pairs of combs from the window—it was then a little after twelve o'clock—soon afterwards the prisoner was taken by the officer—I saw these six pairs of combs, which I believe are mine—they were all fastened together when I lost them, but they have been cut.</p>

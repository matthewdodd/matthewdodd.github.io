On the morning of 25th July, about half past 2 o'clock, I was on duty in Great Russell-street, and saw a light burning in the first floor front room of No. 35—I waited a short time, got three constables, we gave an alarm, and Mr. Burch got up—we found one of the windows half way up, and the middle square broken close to the hasp—the persons had got away when we gave the alarm.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 35, Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury, a corner house; I am a hosier. On 24th July, I went to bed about 11 o'clock, leaving all the doors and windows firmly secured—I was awoke between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, and found the drawing room window broken, and one of the fastenings undone, in which way I imagine an entry had been made; the other window was open, by which I think the parties had escaped, because the lead of the waterspout was bent—I missed a miniature, a gold chain and locket, six gold guineas, and a variety of other things, which had been lying on a table in the centre of the room.</p>

On 25th July, about 9 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner Lewis came to my shop, and offered me two quarter guineas for sale—I said, "Where did you get them?"—he said he had picked them up in Broadway, Bloomsbury—I said, "Where is the purse?" (nothing had been said about a purse); he said, "There was no purse"—I said, "There was more than this," and he put his hand in his pocket and took out two more—I said, What did you do with the purse?"—he said, "I <hi rend="italic">throwed</hi> that away, it was no good"—I said, You have stolen these, you must go with me to Bow-street," and took him there.</p>

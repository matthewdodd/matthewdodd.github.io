On the morning of the 26th of April, I got up about six o'clock, and left the prisoner in the room in bed; nobody else was in the room; the box was safe as usual then; I took particular notice of the prisoner, he seemed very suspicious, and did not want anybody in the room to take notice of him; and on Thursday evening, I sat up and smoked my pipe while he was going to bed, and took notice of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I humbly beg to acquaint you that during my life, I have been brought up in a respectable family, and a large family of twenty-two brothers and sisters - I am the first of the family ever accused of theft; I know myself to be innocent; I never saw the property, it is the last thing I should have touched; I have been trusted where if I thought of doing wrong, I might have had hundreds of pounds in money and plate, in situations I have been in since I left business; I have been rather unfortunate; I kept an inn; I have been unfortunate by affliction, but as to honesty, my character was never questioned; I am not near my friends, who are upwards of one hundred miles off.</p>

            . I am a City policeman. I apprehended the prisoner in Brill's-head-court, King-street, Snow-hill, on the 27th of September, about ten o'clock in the morning - the prosecutor's brother came to me and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170044"></xptr>asked me to come and take him - I told him what I took him for; he said, he knew nothing about it, and denied ever having lodged in the place, or having been there - he said he was down at Bristol, at the time the occurrence took place - the prosecutor and Mrs. Cole were there, and they named where the lodging was; he denied having lived there; he was remanded to get a letter from his friends at Bristol, to state he was there at the time, and a person came forward to prove it, but he never saw him in Bristol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix, as I stood by the door, came in and passed me in the house, and I stopped some time myself talking to the landlady of the house, and went out again - if I had had any inclination to escape, I had plenty of opportunities - she was away some time before she brought the person belonging to the property - I never knew the woman - I went into the Cholera Hospital, in Greville-street on the 10th of August, and stopped there eleven nights, and had all my clothes burnt - but it was a different time that I was in Bartholomew Hospital - I have a certificate from the Cholera Hospital to show I was there, and afflicted with the malignant cholera.</p>
               <p>Edmund Ireland, butcher, No. 3, Water-lane, Fleet-street, and Samuel Allen, a coffee-house-waiter, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

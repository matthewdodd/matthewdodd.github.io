I am assistant to the receiver general of the Customs, and was so in April last; these two documents (looking at them) were produced to me on the 18th of April by a person who was rather short - I think the person was very much like the short prisoner(Maynuard); I am unable to identify him - I saw him for a very short time; I think the resemblance strong, but cannot identify him - on the documents being put into my hand, there was something in the receipt, that struck me, a little remarkable; it appeared something like a schoolboy's writing - I communicated with the corresponding clerk, and being satisfied the document was genuine, I marked it for payment, with my initials and the date, the 18th of April - the course of business, after I had marked it, would be for the individual presenting it to me, to present it at the Treasury for payment, which, I believe, was the case - for Croxford, the clerk of the Treasury, not having cash to meet it, came to me for a cheque on the Bank, to pay it with; (looking at the cheque) this is the cheque I gave him for it - this receipt was annexed to the document, and purports to be signed by the comptroller of the Customs; when I pay a warrant of this sort, I do not ask the name of the person receiving it, or for whom it is received - that is Croxford's duty; I have been in the Custom-house upwards of thirty-four years - these two documents are filled up perfectly regular and correct in all parts.</p>

               <p>Q. Are both these documents the work of one office or would they pass through two offices? A. That would emanate from the Secretary's department; I know of no order given at the Bank respecting the payment of cheques for the Customs - (looking at a 5l. note) after this fraud had been committed, I traced a 5l. note; I believe this is it, by the name of Maynard at the back of it, but I have put no mark on it - I obtained that note from the Bank of England; I think, on the 7th of May I went to Lees', the banker's in Lombard-street, from there to Ruden and Co's., Salvador-house, Bishopsgate-street - I finally traced it to a baker, of the name of Bristow; I have no doubt this is the note delivered to me, in consequence of this notice from the Bank, which is attached to it - I had no other 5l. note at that time; it was cancelled when I got it from the Bank - I had no other cancelled note. After this fraud was discovered, placards were stock in the lobby of the Custom-house; here is one which I took down from the officer - the 5l. note, No. 5068, is the last of the series mentioned here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You think one of the prisoners is like the person, but you do not swear which? A. Certainly not; if I had met him in the street or play-house, I think I might have passed him without noticing him - the name of Maynard on the note is not my writing; I identify it, by that name being on it when I received it cancelled from the Bank - I never had it before.</p>

            . I am in the Treasury department of the Receiver-general's office, and was so in April. These documents (looking at them) were presented to me for payment, on the 18th of April, by a person who stated that he came from Praed and Co's. house; I examined the documents afterwards, and found Praed and Co. written across it, and asked him, supposing he had been in the habit of coming from Praed's, why he had not put his name on it as usual, and he wrote his name,

             - from the appearance of the prisoner Maynard, I believe him to be the man who presented it; I had not sufficient money to pay it, and went to Mr. Beaumont and asked him for a draft on the Bank of England - he gave me this draft, to the best of my recollection (looking at it) - I gave it to Maynard; it was necessary that he should take the draft to the Comptroller-general, to be countersigned by him before it would be paid at the Bank - I do not think that I told him that was necessary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any previous acquaintance with the person you call Maynard? A. Not to my knowledge; I see a great many persons in the course of business - when I saw Maynard again, he was in custody and pointed out to me as the man charged with this offence: I had not seen him from the day he presented it, till he was in custody - I do not swear positively to him, but I believe him to be the man.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Comptroller-general's office at the Custom-house. On the 18th of April, I recollect this warrant for 1973l. being brought in (looking at it) - it was presented to Mr. Mure in my presence; it was necessary for him to make an entry of it, in a book- while he was so doing, I observed the person who brought it, sitting on a box near me; the prisoner, Maynard, very much resembles that person - to the best of my belief, he is the person; I had an opportunity of seeing him for a quarter of an hour; I should think - the prisoner Jones, is in the same office as myself; the green book is kept in the Secretary's office - whether he had access to it, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Can you take on yourself to say the person was there a quarter of an hour? A. I am confident it was near a quarter of an hour; Mr. Mure had to examine the document to see if it was correct, and make an entry of it; he had not got to copy it - he did not remain longer than while Mr. Mure was so engaged: all the time he was in the office Mr. Mure was engaged writing - there is a railing round the first clerk's desk, but Mr. Mure's desk is not enclosed by any partition; I was sitting opposite Mr. Mure - there was no railing to prevent my seeing him; I was engaged reading and examining debentures, which Mr. Mure was ticking off, prior to the person coming with the document - we both left off instantly: I did not see Maynard again for about four months - he was then in custody on this charge.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When the person entered, you left off reading the debentures - were you employed doing any thing else, or had you an opportunity of observing the person? A. I had an opportunity of observing him, because I could not go on without Mure.</p>

            . I am assistant comptroller. I have been in the office since last December; before that I was inspector of out-port collectors' accounts - if an outport collector has occasion for money, the practice at that time was either to apply to the Board, or to make a statement to the comptroller-general of his account; if it is found he is in want of money, an entry is made in this green book (producing it) by a clerk in the office - it is called the receiver-general's interest book: the clerk enters it, and then brings it to the chief clerk to put his initials - the book is then taken to the Secretary's office; what passes there I do not know - the prisoner Jones was a clerk in the Comptroller's office; I found him there when I came in December - his salary was 90l. a year; the hours of attendance are from ten till four - he had a specific duty, which was to enter the reports of the principal of the department; that required his attendance daily, except on holidays - I sat in another room, and therefore had not constant inspection of him, to see whether he was there every day; when an order is made on the Bank for the payment of money by the receiver-general, it is countersigned by myself and the chief clerk, by power of attorney from the Comptroller-general; it is countersigned before it is taken out; Jones had been in the office some years, as I understand, and would be acquainted with the forms of the office - this order on the Bank has my signature to it; I have no recollection of the person who brought it to be signed - the green book is kept usually in the Secretary's office, I believe; I expect that the clerks in both offices had access to it; one of the clerks going to the office, and inquiring for it, would of course have it - it is not locked up during office hours.</p>

W. in the margin of this order are not my initials - they are in the proper place where they would be if the order was genuine; I had occasion to make my initials several times in the green book in April - I have been in the Custom-house nearly twenty-four years; the prisoner Jones has been a clerk there about five years - be first was in the Searcher's department, and subsequently in the Comptroller-general's; documents for the payment of money to the collectors of out-ports pass through both those offices.</p>

Bank notes; I paid him those notes - this book contains the entry, here is a book containing the number of the notes; the 500l. were Nos. 2536 and 2537, dated the 6th of April, 1829 - nine of 100l., Nos. 19,417 to 19,425, both inclusive, dated the 11th of April - one of 50l., No. 16,63, dated the 21st of March - four of 5l., Nos. 5865 to 5868, dated the 9th of March (looking at a 100l. note, number 19,495) - I have no doubt of this being one of them; and this 5l. note, number 5868, is also one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of the person who presented the ticket? A. I have some slight recollection of the party; the prisoner Maynard resembles the person who presented it - the other was dressed in a blue coat, but I did not notice him.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Secretary's office in the Custom-house. I have known Jones rather more than three years; when he first came into the Custom-house he was in the Secretary's department, and was then removed to the Comptroller's; I know he was in difficulties in the year 1828, for I was applied to by a relative to settle his private affairs; I communicated with Jones, and found he was in difficulties - the amount I paid for him was about 100l.; it was an arrangement with his creditors - they had 20s. in the pound; I got part of it from a relative, and deducted part from his own salary; I saw him in June last, when he told me his wife had 700l., and a piano left by a relative of his wife's, residing in Newgate-street or the Old Bailey, I do not know which - I advised him to invest it; I have seen the warrant and receipt - in the way they are got, I should say it was certainly necessary for the person to be acquainted with the method of business in the Secretary and Comptrollers' offices.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long before the 27th of April was it you advised him to invest the money? A. It was about the 9th or 10th of June this year; I had been intimate with him about three years - his difficulties were finally settled in February, 1829; that was the last payment I made - the money was advanced him by a gentleman moving in a respectable sphere of life, and of some opulence.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Would the gentleman that advanced the money allow it to pass through his own hands, or did he give it to you? A. He gave it to me - he had no communication with the prisoner himself.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is the man that did all this? A. The prisoner Jones; I have no doubt he is the man - I certainly did doubt at first; I named another person at Bow-street as the man, but I had not seen Jones then - I recalled it almost directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not Jones at that time in the office, as conspicuous as any other? A. He was; I did point another man out - I was on my oath at that time; I cannot recollect, but I think some one did tell me to look round again - I have no doubt of it; my attention was directed to the part of the room Jones was in - I selected Jones the moment I saw the man I pointed to - no person pointed to him; I think I was directed to the part of the room he stood in - he was about two yards from me; the man, I first pointed out, was about the same distance - I thought the other man resembled the features at the moment I looked round; I had not then seen Jones - I certainly thought he was the man.</p>

               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. It turned out you were mistaken? A. I was; I was agitated in giving evidence- I am sure the man told Ferguson he must go for a parcel to Hamlin's, and he said he was to bring it to the Temple; he had no mustachios on when he wrote the note.</p>

            . I was sent with a note from the the Blackmoor's Head to Hamlin's; it was on a Monday, and I think the 10th of August; the person told me to go to Mr. Hamlin's, Princes-street, and bring a parcel from there to the Blackmoor's Head to him - I did not see him more than once till I saw him at Bow-street; I knew him again immediately - that is the man (pointing to Jones) -I took the note to Hamlin's and left it there; this is it -(looking at it) - I believe this to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You did not know the person before? A. No; when I saw him again he was in custody - Cox was at Bow-street with me; he spoke to the man before I did - I saw him point to a man, but which man it was I do not know; I went into the office, Jones looked round at me directly - Cox had sworn to him before I did; I should not have sworn to him without being positive - I had only seen him once before, but that was for a long time; he wrote the letter in the room - I saw him at Bow-street on the Friday week following; I do not think Cox saw him so long as I did - he was talking to him when he called me to take the letter.</p>

               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Did you know the man immediately you got into the office? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>"I cannot think of fetching it without you give me a note for it;" we went into the Coach and Horses, near the New Church, in the Strand - he wrote a note there in my presence, and put the name of Arrowsmith at the bottom of it; we went out together - when we got to St. Martin's Church he said,"Bedwin, I don't wish you to leave this note;" I said,"What is to indemnify me or the landlord, Mr. Jones; I hope you are not going to bring me into a scrape about this parcel? for I was never brought to justice in my life for any thing;" I went on with him - he went within four or five yards of the house with me, and pointed out to me the Blackmoor's Head, in Whitcomb street - I gave the note to the landlord, but did not get the parcel; I went back to Jones and told him the parcel was not come, that the publican had sent to Mr. Hamlin for it, they said the man who packed it up was not in the way, and they did not know when he might be - Jones told me to stop for the parcel, (and gave me 6d. to get some drink with) and take it to the Bull and Mouth, Regent-circus - this passed in Whitcomb-street, where he had been waiting for me; I went back to the public-house - the landlord spoke to me, and seeing the name of Arrowsmith - I did not stop, but went home; I saw no more of Jones - (note read).</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at No. 18, Lant-street, Borough; the prisoner Maynard came to lodge with me on the 6th of last September, and remained till Palm Sunday, the 12th of April - he had a wife living with him; when he went away he owed me four guineas, for rent, at six shillings a week - I had applied to him for it from time to time, but have never been paid.</p>

             across it, I believe to be Maynard's writing; I do not positively swear it, (looking at the letter found in Maynard's possession) to the best of my judgement, the whole of this is in West's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is your warehouse? A. I have none, nor any shop - I have not dealt in ironmongery lately, not for about a twelve month; I have bought and sold 4000l. or 5000l. worth within this fifteen years; I was a black ironmonger, and was never in business in London; I had a shop at Coventry, in 1815, since which I have been staying in London - I have been a hired servant - I have had no establishment in the ironmongery trade since 1815; I now live in Green-street, Blackfriar's-road, which is in the rules of the Bench, but I am not a ruler - I never in my life was bail for any person at Westminster. nor at Serjeant's Inn - I have been bail to the Sheriff; I have never been bail at Westminster unless once or twice, perhaps, I have put in bail for remnant; I never justified, nor attempted to do so - I have been in the employ of Mr. Turk, at Lambeth, then in Frith-street, Soho, and at Sturch and Co's., where I was two years - that is eleven or twelve years ago; I left him through illness - there was no imputation against me, that I know of - I was never bail at Union Hall; I once bailed a person at Bow-street, seven or eight years ago; I was then selling goods on commission - I know the Globe public-house, Borough-road, and know the landlord - I have not been in the habit of getting bail, or receiving money for doing it - I have when I have been bail - I have asked friends to go to bail; I have been paid my expences for that, but received no fee - nothing more than I considered my expences; I have done that perhaps half a dozen times - I cannot tell to a few times; you may take it at forty in all - I have not been the procurer of bail; I have introduced the parties together, and within fifteen years it may be forty times -I did not give them money to be bail; the defendants themselves did, I dare say, but I do not know it - I did not promise them payment - I know a man they call Mack - I do not know him by any other name; I did not tell him I had been to Bow-street against West, or that if I could swear, so as to convict him, I should get 50l.; I never mentioned such a word; nor that if not, I should have a guinea a day for my trouble - I never thought of such a thing; but that person told me he would go and swear so; he saw it in the newspaper, and came to me next morning, and abused me very much.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever say with an oath that you would swear above a bit? A. No, I never made use of an oath in his presence - I do not swear very often - I never said that if I got the money I should leave the Borough-road; that I was short of blunt, and not particular - I know Mr. Parish, the clerk of the papers, of the King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Q. And if we have him here, you will go on to swear you were never bail for people in the King's Bench? A. Never in my life - I was charged, about fourteen years ago, with not making my accounts correct at a place; there was 3s. 6d. deficient, and when the books were brought forward, it was proved I was innocent and I believe you pleaded for me: it was Mr. Lawford, the ironmonger, made the charge - he was my master - I was acquitted, certainly; I never was in any other disagreeable situatin.</p>
               <p>Q. No Custom-house affair? A. I signed a bond for a relation of mine, and suffered six months in Horsemonger-lane for it, four years ago - I was a housekeeper last in Union-row, Kent-road; that is two years ago - I have not been a housekeeper all the time I have been from Coventry - I sometimes was for two or three years, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Who is Mack? A. A person who has been in the army, and now carries yeast about - he sells Birmingham yeast; I have seen the prisoners and him at Mr. Bailey's public-house several times.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He came into the parlour, and you, being a parlour customer, went in likewise? A. Yes; this conversation was quite voluntary on his part - I sent the next day to tell West of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say there were several people there? A. Yes; Bailey was not there.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Hewit, in the office of the King's Bench prison, and have been there about seventeen years. I have known Bushel at least ten or twelve years - he has been about the place assisting prisoners, and I believe at times getting bail for them; I have not had much opportunity of judging of his character, for I never associated with him - I should not myself consider him a person to be believed on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Now, why do you come to say you would not believe him on his oath? A. I speak in general terms - I do not mean to say he is not to be believed; I only know him about the prison - I had nothing to do with him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you seen him in particular societies, and with particular persons? A. I have seen him almost daily - he seldom or ever goes into the prison; it does not fall within my department to know what he is employed in about there.</p>

            . I am a special pleader - my chambers are in Serjeant's Inn, Fleet-street, and my house at Pimlico. I know Bushel, unfortunately, and certainly would not believe him on any oath he would take.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. For what reason would you not believe him? A. Because he has obtained money from me on several occasions on promises which he never performed, and which I believe at the time he never intended to perform.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you any other reason? A. He has told me that he was a common procurer of bail, and would swear any thing if he was paid for it.</p>

               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. On what occasion has he made this declaration to you? A. I was some time ago arrested for 500l., by a person calling himself

            . Q. Is the receipt said to be written by West, a peculiar form of office, or is it a common receipt, which could be written by an uninformed person? A. It is written according to the usual form; it might be worded different, and yet would be paid, but I should require it to be signed by the collector, and it must be transmitted with the warrant.</p>

To the Bull and Mouth; I got there about one o'clock on Friday, the 28th of August, set off that night by the mail, and got to Taunton about half-past one o'clock next day; the others went by the North Devon coach from the Bull and Mouth - I am certain Maynard did not go by that coach; I got there about six hours after the North Devon coach, and found them together about three o'clock.</p>

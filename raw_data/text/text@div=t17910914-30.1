               <p>Last Saturday, the 10th of September, I was in the prisoner's lodging room, in <placeName id="t17910914-30-crimeloc185">Turnmill-street</placeName>

I agreed to go home along with her, to have a night's lodging. I went home with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140045"></xptr>her. I felt my watch and my money in my pocket when I was in the room; I continued there, as long as I can guess at it, I might be there half an hour; and she asked me, whether I should be against giving her half a crown for the night's lodgings. I told her, I could not afford 2 s. 6 d. I thought 2 s. was enough. She got the money out of my pocket, and then went down stairs immediately.</p>
               <p>You felt it in your pocket just before? - I did.</p>
               <p>And you missed it directly afterwards? - I did. I had got my shoes off towards going to bed. I lost her for that night; I put my shoes on again, and went out of the room, and went out into the street, and I met with the watchman, and went to the watch-house, and there I staid all night. The next morning I went home, and put on a fresh coat, and about nine o'clock I saw her come out of the yard into another yard, and I followed her, and catched hold of her, and told her, I would swear she was the woman that robbed me; she said, she was not the woman; that she had a husband, and if he heard what I said, he would murder me. A mob came about, and I gave it up, and told her, if she was not the woman, she was very much like the woman; and presently she called me out of the company, and told me, she wanted to speak to me, and she told me, there was another woman in that neighbourhood very like she, and she would see what she could do in the course of the day, whether she could get my watch or not for me. She went round to a little public-house near Hicks's Hall, and there she told me, if I would meet her at seven o'clock in the evening, she would see what she could do in getting my watch again. She met me there according to her promise, and told me, if I could produce half a guinea, she could produce my watch. I told her, I could not then; but if she would give me liberty, I would try if I could make a friend, to let me have half a guinea, and she promised to meet me again at nine o'clock. I went to the beadle of the night-watch for advice what to do in it, and he told me, I had no occasion to give half a guinea, he would try and get my watch back, and it may be some of my money, for nothing. Presently the girl was in the street, at the beadle's door, and he took her up, and sent for a constable, and I swore to what I lay to her charge; and I am very sure that this is the girl.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you drunk or sober? - I was a little fresh in liquor, but not drunk.</p>
               <p>Had your ever seen her before? - I had not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How can you be sure to remember her person so well? - We had a candle all the time, and I was not drunk; I was with her in the room about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen your watch since? - Yes, she produced the watch that night after she was taken up, in a house where she was taken to; she either produced it, or ordered it to be produced. The man is here who brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you tell me, you was not sure I was the woman? - I always said, I was sure, my dear, you was the woman.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sober now? - Yes; I have had hardly enough to keep body and soul together; I have been obliged to pawn my coat off my back, and my working tools, for support.</p>

               <p>I am beadle of St. Sepulchre's Without; that night the last witness was robbed, he came into our watch-house, and staid all night. In consequence of his description of the woman, we went, I and the constable, and could not find her. About seven or eight in the evening of the next day he called again, and she came by, and I took her up. When she was in my custody, she desired to speak to a woman. I kept her there for three quarters of an hour. We thought it was time to take her to prison. I had occasion to go to the door, and there were two or three fellows about, and I thought that they wanted to pick my pocket, and they put the watch in my pocket, wrapped up in paper. The constable has it.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning I met this man in Cow-cross, in the open street; he tapped me on the shoulder, I turned about, and he said, that he believed he had been in liquor, and had been with me the over night, and he had missed his watch and some money, and that he believed it was me. I told him he was mistaken, I was not the person, and this brought a mob about us; and with that he was frightened, and walked off. He asked me to go a little way with him, and I did; and he said, if I could hear any thing of his watch he would give me half a guinea, and would make me a present for his money. He met me again at seven o'clock, and I told him I had heard nothing of it.</p>

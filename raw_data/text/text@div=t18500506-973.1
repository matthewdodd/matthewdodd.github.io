                  </hi>. I live at 5, Francis-street Old-street-road; I am a pros<lb></lb>titute, the same as Elizabeth Steers; the prisoners live in the house opposite mine. On Sunday, 10th March, William Steers came to my door between four and five o'clock in the morning—he knocked at the door two or three times—I did not let him in—I shut him out once or twice—at last he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the door open and came in—another man followed him in, and the female prisoner—they came in one after the other—William Steers went to the washhand-stand and broke the basin—he then went to the mantel-piece and dragged a picture down—he then hit a friend of mine, William Risley, who was there, and when he had done beating him, he came and beat me—I am not aware that he had anything in his hand then, but after he had beat me as long as he could stand over me, he took up this quart jug (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and broke it over my head—my head bled, and the blood is on the jug now—as soon as I could get from him I ran into the street and called the police—I said, "For God's sake help me, or else I shall be murdered"—the policeman happened to be just passing the door—as soon as he came up, I lost my senses—I do not recollect what passed—when I ran out into the street I do not know what became of the prisoner—I leaned against the wall—there was nothing done to me in the street that I know of—when I recovered, I found myself leaning against the wall—I do not think the policeman came into my house—when I crossed to the prisoner's place to give them in charge, the female prisoner pulled my hair, just where my head was wounded—they were both tipsy.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 71). On Sunday, 10th March, I was on duty in Francis-street—I saw Ward standing leaning against a wall—the blood was running from a wound in her head down her face and clothes—she appeared to be in a very bad state—she said, "For God's sake, policeman, come here, I shall be murdered"—she said that Steers and his wife had come and burst her door open, and had beaten her, a man who was in the house, and another female, with the poker and tongs, about the head, and likewise with a jug—I did not see the prisoners at that time; they were in their own house, and the door fastened—I did not see them go in—in consequence of what Ward said, I went and knocked at the prisoner's door—one of them made answer, "Who is there?"—I said, "The police"—a man's voice said, "There you are like to be"—I asked them a second time to open the door—he refused, and I then forced the door open—I was in my uniform as a police<lb></lb>man—I went into the house—I saw both the prisoners—I told them I wanted them—they asked me what for—I told them the charge; and William Steers</p>

               <p>said if I did not go out, be would serve me as he bad the rest of them—he refused to come out—I then took him by the collar and dragged him out—I then sprang my rattle, and got the assistance of another constable, Burns—I wanted him to go into the house and apprehend the other, but he said he would sooner take the one I had—I then gave him William Steers in custody—I then went into the house, but I returned and saw Burns on the pavement, and William Steers was on the top of him, with his left foot just above his stomach—William Steers had this leg of a chair in his right hand, and he was making a blow at Burns as I came to him—I did not see him strike him—he said, "I will stamp your b—y guts out"—I took hold of him by the collar and dragged him to the station with a great deal of trouble—Burns could scarcely stand when he got up—he could not assist me in any way whatever—Elizabeth Steers was there; she had the officer by the collar, or the arm, I could not see properly which, so as to encumber him—I had gone into their house the second time after another man who was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Monday, 11th March, I examined Burns—I found him very much injured about the head, and neck, and loins—the nape of his neck was very much contused and inflamed—he was suffering very severely—on the right side of his loins there was a wound as if made with some blunt instrument—the neighbourhood of the loins was very much swollen and inflamed—the blows on the head and neck pro<lb></lb>duced contusion of the brain, with epileptic fits—he is still under my care, and even now I have thought it necessary to have another man with him to watch him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The principal blow was at the back of his neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One of them was; the injury to the brain was from the blows on the head and neck—they would unquestionably produce the effects I have described.</p>

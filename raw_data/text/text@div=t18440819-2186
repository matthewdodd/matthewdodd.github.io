               <p>twelve o'clock on the 6th of July I was in Lambeth-walk—I saw the prisoners together—they turned down Regent-street—Fitzgerald went into one shop previous to his going to Mrs. Gadd's—he came out again, and they went down Regent-street—I saw Coombs standing out by a post—Fitzgerald went into Gadd's shop, and came out with the till in his two hands—they then both turned round the corner, and were out of sight—I have been in the police, and had seen both the prisoners before, and knew them—I pursued them at fast as I could—they ran down Dorie-street—there is a kind of bend in that street, and I lost sight of them, but just as I got near the corner I heard the sound of money rattling—I got round the corner, and saw these two farthings—the prisoner had got rid of the till, and had something in the centre of a handkerchief, and both of them had hold of it—I called, "Stop thief," but I could not catch them—I went to a garden at the corner of Dorie-street, and the persons said they had picked up the till—I got this till there—the pri<lb></lb>soners had passed that place as they were going—I am superannuated through injuries I received in the force.</p>

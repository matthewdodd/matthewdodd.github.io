After this, Siseland the prisoner came to my shop along with the constable, and enquired for these goods, and we brought them down; he said they were pledged at different times, but could not tell what they lay for, but guessed within a little; he was right as to the gown and petticoat for 17 s.</p>

               <p>Q. What said Barrill?</p>
               <p>Pain. He said but very little; I asked him while he was in the lodge at New Prison about them; he told me he had pawned one himself at a pawnbroker's in Wardour-street; I had Siseland and he handcuffed, and took them in a coach there, and there I found the gown as he had said; the pawnbroker let me have it very readily: his name was Hanse.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name was it pledged?</p>
               <p>Pain. It was pledged in the name of Barrill, for I think 6 s. (produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix) I found a bundle at a workhouse by Berkeley-square, by the prisoner Siseland's direction, there were a great many of them; I found another gown at another pawnbroker's at Knave's-acre, by the information of Siseland, (all produced and deposed to by prosecutrix) there was a gown the prosecutrix described, which I heard Barrill own he had flung away.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have got most of my things again.</p>
               <p>Barrill's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going home with my coach; just at the farther end of Great Russel-street, I saw something lying in the street; I got down to see what it was and found it to be a box; I took and put it into my coach and left it at Sifeland's house, and asked him if he would let his wife carry some of the things to pawn, accordingly she did.</p>
               <p>Siseland's defence.</p>
               <p>This man came and told me he had found a box and desired leave to leave it in my room, and I gave him liberty: I am a coachman also; I was then just come out of the workhouse, I had been sick.</p>

About three o'clock, on the 8th of September, the prisoner came and asked for change for a shilling—I drew the till out to give him change—he asked me if I would oblige him with a new sixpence—I said I did not think I had got one—he raised him self up, put his hand into the till, and took out three half-crowns—I caught hold of him, and kept him across the counter—I took two out of his hand, and the other he put under a four-pound weight—there was a young man going by; I called him, and kept the prisoner till I went round and got an officer—he said if I would let him go he would never do the like again.</p>

               <p>saw Pitts and Hands in a cart coming out of Marlborough Row—they turned to the right in High Street, towards Rye Lane—they drove about 100 yards, they then turned and came towards me—after they had passed me I called to Alpress, the other officer, and he stopped them—as he laid hold of the rein, I immediately got to the near side of the cart to prevent their getting out—another constable came up immediately—I asked the constables if they had seen these men, Pitts and Hands, before—they said, "Yes"—I then asked Pitts if it was his cart—he said no, it was one he had borrowed—I asked him for what purpose he had borrowed it—he said to give his wife a ride—I asked him where his wife was—he said that she was at home—I asked him what made him turn round so quickly—he said that he had taken a wrong turning—I said that it was strange that he should borrow the cart to give his wife a ride when he had got another man with him—he said that he had picked him up and given him a ride—I took Pitts and Hands to the station—I then went out and met Fitzgerald, who had got Brown in custody, and he was taken to the station—Gregory was taken afterwards—I went out and met Mr. Peterson coming to the station—I went to his house, and saw footmarks leading over to the second yard—they began at the back of Mr. Peterson's house—I saw the back parlour window open—the steps led from there across another yard at the back, and into a garden—there I saw the footmarks more plainly—in that garden I found these two coats, and following the footmarks, they led to the garden of an unoccupied house—I was then joined by the constable Phillips—in the un<lb></lb>occupied house I found nine remnants of cloth, two coats, a waistcoat, and some other articles—I compared the boots of Gregory, Hands, and Brown with the footmarks on the following day—Sharp was not in custody—I found the boots taken from Gregory and Hands corresponded with the footmarks in the garden—I made an impression by the side of the mark, and measured it very particularly—on Saturday last I saw Sharp in custody at Peckham Station—I spoke to him respecting this charge—he asked me if any of the others had pleaded guilty—I did not say anything about Mr. Peterson—I referred to what had occurred recently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live in Rye Lane. I saw the pony and cart about 15 or 16 minutes after 5 o'clock that morning—it was at the corner of Hanover Street, which turns out of Rye Lane and runs round into Rye Lane again—the cart remained there till about 10 minutes after 6 o'clock—that was the last time I saw it—I saw the same cart afterwards with the police—I saw a man there I cannot swear to, but I have no doubt Pitts is the man I saw on the opposite side of the road—I live next door to the empty house—that n No. 1, and my house is No. 2, and exactly at 5 o'clock that morning I heard a noise in the passage or shed of that unoccupied house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gregory. Q.</hi> Did the cart remain there till past 6 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I went to work at 10 minutes past 6 o'clock—I cannot say whether the cart was there quite so late as that—at a few minutes past 6 o'clock it was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of No. 2, Bond's Place, Rye Lane, Peckham. On 21st April, I went to bed between 12 and 1 o'clock—after I got to bed I heard a noise—it was very likely about 3 o'clock—I did not take particular notice of it—I had heard it previous to going to bed—I did not come down till about 25 minutes past 7 o'clock—I then found my house had been entered from the back parlour window—I cannot say that that window was secured when I went to bed, but it was shut down, and the shutters were closed—I found the cellaret open, and the drawers also—they contained wine—I went into my shop, and missed cloth and other things—this waistcoat was safe the night before in the same drawer with this piece of cloth—these other things were all safe, and more than these—what they took away, and what was moved, but left on my premises, was worth alto<lb></lb>gether about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

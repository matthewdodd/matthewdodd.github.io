            . I am a druggist, in partnership<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040011"></xptr>with John Gale and another; our warehouse is in <placeName id="t18281204-12-crimeloc66">Bonverie-street, Fleet-street</placeName>

On the 4th of November our warehouse was entered by thieves, and a large quantity of property taken away; in consequence of this we employed our porters as private watchman - they took their turns, and on Saturday, the 15th of November, it was the prisoner's turn, with another man, to guard the premises; nobody sleeps there; I left about eight o'clock- on Monday, the 17th, the moment I went there, information was given me; I found marks of violence on the laboratory sky-light, and from what I heard I had the prisoner apprehended on the premises, when he was at work - he lived at No. 42, Primrose-hill, and occupied two lower rooms, the kitchen, wash-house, and two bedrooms on the first-floor; we have too many articles to miss them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You would not have kept him six years unless you had a good opinion of him? A. It was owing to the character we had of him that we kept him, but I believe it was a false one - he did nothing to deserve a bad character with us before.</p>

            . I am one of the City marshals. I was sent for to search the house No. 42, Primrose-hill, Salisbury-square where the prisoner resided; I found his wife at home, but not him - I found some spices, soap, and other articles in the lower rooms; in the bed-rooms I found the articles stated in the indictment; the prisoner was present part of the time I was searching, and saw me find the things; some he said were his own, but all they brought away he said were Mr. Ward's - he said so voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was not at home when you first searched? A. No; he was sent for, and came in five or ten minutes - Mr. Ward was at the house then; nothing was said to him by Mr. Ward in my hearing - but on my finding different property, he said, I suppose a dozen times, that such and such things were Mr. Wards's - some of them were found before he was with Mr. Ward.</p>
               <p>MR. WARD. I held out no threat or promise to him; these articles are such as we deal in, and he had access to them.</p>

            . I am a surgical-instrument maker. I have known the prisoner in the prosecutor's service some years; on the 17th of November, I was at their warehouse in Bonverie-street, and heard an attempt had been made to enter the premises on the previous night; I advised Mr. Ward to give information at the Mansion-house - very shortly after that he, Mr. Cope, and I, attended at the prisoner's apartment in Primrose-hill; I saw all the property found -I did not threaten or promise him any thing; on finding about three - quarters of a hundred-weight of soap under the stairs, I said</p>
               <p>"Woollett, this is a very bad job, the further we go the more we discover;" he held up his hands in despair, and said "I hope the gentlemen will not deal hard with me."</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. I was sent for to look at the property found, and knew it to be master's; I knew the large quantity of soap, and a small quantity of other soap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it Castile soap? A. It is called so - it is a particular kind of soap; Gale and Co. are the only persons who sell soap of that nature - I have never seen any like it elsewhere; I do not swear masters are the only persons that sell it, but I believe so - and here is a quantity of soap of my marking and perfuming - here is one piece I can swear to, it was cut into bars, and here is where I cut out some dirt, it is then cut in pieces and stamped, but this is not stamped - one piece has the stamp on it, which we use; I swear to this piece marked "Old Brown Windsor Soap," we never sell that in London: it is damaged, and damaged soap is never sent out of our premises, but melted again - the damage was discovered after I stamped it, there is n white speak in it, it was locked up with others to'be melted; here is another piece, I can swear to, having cut a white speak out of it about six months ago- I cannot particularly say when I cut it out.</p>
               <p>MR. WARD. The value of all the articles found is about three guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Living on the premises for four or five years, I had the privilege of having soap and other things for the use of the house; my wife being in the habit of cooking, we had sauce and other things.</p>
               <p>MR. WARD. We dined there now and then, and he used to cook for us, but was not allowed soap or sauce, or any thing of the sort; he lived on premises belonging to the firm. <rs id="t18281204-12-verdict67" type="verdictDescription">

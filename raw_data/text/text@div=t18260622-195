               <p>WILLIAM BARCLAY. I live in Leicester-square. On the 22d of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the <placeName id="t18260622-195-crimeloc989">Hay-market</placeName>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prosecutor; the three prisoners and another went up to him; they then left him, and soon afterwards came up to him again, and one of them took the handkerchief; I told the gentleman, and then ran and overtook them in Coventry-street - I met another officer, and told him to follow me; we saw the four persons - they ran in different directions. I had first seen them following the gentleman in Panton-street. My opinion is that Crump took the handkerchief, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CRUMP. Q. You said at the office that you saw me take hold of the gentleman's pocket, and put it down again? A. Yes, you did the first time; I saw the handkerchief on the ground at the place where they all ran away. I did not see it picked up.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 22d of June, about eight o'clock at night, I received information from Gook, and joined him in pursuit of the three prisoners and another person - I seized one, and Gook the others - I saw the handkerchief lying on the ground; it was picked up by a by-stander and given to me; I had Terry in my hand at the time; I pulled him along after the other, but he could not run fast.</p>

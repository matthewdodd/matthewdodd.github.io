            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. On Saturday the 1st of October the prisoner, who had frequently called at my house to enquire for a relation of mine, came into the kitchen I remember about twenty minutes after four; the watch was hanging up on the mantle piece in the kitchen, and the prisoner was then in the room; I was called out by some person who enquired whether there were any lodgers in the house; I answered in the negative, and I staid only the time that might be spent in asking such a question and giving the answer to it; I then returned into the room, and then the prisoner took his leave; I went after him and fastened the batch; I turned into the kitchen and found the watch gone; I called after the prisoner but he was out of sight.</p>

             . I assist persons in distress by taking their goods out of pawn and selling them for them; the prisoner applied to me to assist to take this watch out of pawn; it was pledged for a guinea; I could not get more than thirty shillings for it, and I did dispose of it to Mr. Owen.</p>

               <p>I was in distress for money; I asked Mrs. Gorton to assist me with some; she said she had no money but she had a watch, upon which I might raise money; she delivered the watch to me to raise money to supply my necessities.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. Is that true?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, upon my oath it is false; I did not know that the watch was gone till the prisoner was gone out of the house and I returned into the kitchen.</p>

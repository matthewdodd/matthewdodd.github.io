I buy and sell beasts—I had a bay gelding—I came to Horsham on 16th Nov.; I stopped there over Sunday—on the 17th I went to feed the beasts in the field, about five o'clock in the evening; at seven the next morning I went to feed them again, and I missed the gelding—I got a description of it inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Police Gazette</hi>—on 12th Dec. I saw it again at the Castle Inn, in the Old Kent-road, in the possession of the ostler—it was the same that I had lost, but it had been altered; they had cut its tail since I lost it.</p>

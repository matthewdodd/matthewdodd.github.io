            . On the 15th of February, about three o'clock I was at the hustings, <placeName id="t18190217-124-crimeloc729">Covent Garden-market</placeName>

I was surrounded by a gang, and carried away into the middle of the mob; I kept my hands down to protect my watch - the prisoner was one of them; I kept my eye on him, and felt his hand in my pocket. I said,</p>
               <p>"You scoundrel take your hand out." I was then hustled ten times more than before - they pressed against me with their elbows, and I was almost choaked; one of them took my hat off. I was then quite of my feet, and felt a hand working my watch about - I had twisted it round, so that they could not get it out; both my pockets were turned inside-out.</p>

            . I am a piano-forte-maker. I was at the hustings; the gang were round the prosecutor; he said he was robbed. I saw his pockets turned inside-out - he was pulled about a great deal; he pointed the prisoner out. I secured him, and took him to Bow-street; he was searched - he had three handkerchiefs round his neck - one of them had a 1 l. note in it; two snuffboxes, and a cotton handkerchief were found on him - the gang tried to rescue him.</p>

                  </hi>I am the wife of John Wells, a pawnbroker, in London, and live in Upper Phillimore-place, Kensington. On Monday, the 23rd of December, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was with my husband in Piccadilly—I had received a cheque from him, and I had in exchange for it at the bankers a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I had 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.in gold, and eight shillings and two sixpences in silver—the gold consisted of so<lb></lb>vereigns and half-sovereigns—I placed the note with the gold in my purse in the front part of my pocket, which hung by my side—it forms a part of my under petticoat—there is a pocket-hole in the pocket, and also in my top petticoat, which is over the petticoat of which the pocket forms a part—I had the same gown on as I have now—it has a pocket-hole in it near the opening of my petticoat, but rather more forward—I had a large shawl on—it was a dirty day—I got into Hardwick's omnibus—I went with my husband from the bankers to Piccadilly—the omnibus overtook us—we required seats, and there was only one—I got in, and I was told my hus<lb></lb>band might be accommodated if he would walk on to Bond-street—when I got in the two prisoners were there—there was a vacancy between them, which I occupied—I rode on to Bond-street—two persons there got out, and my husband was taken up at the White Horse Cellar, and also a lad—my husband made an observation, and said, "Am I to sit here? " which was a place between the prisoner on my left hand and the door—the prisoner Jones said, "There is no other place"—Thompson was on my right, and Jones on my left—on my husband getting in, the conductor asked if any one wished to get out before we got to Kensington—no answer was gives—the conductor got on the box, and the omnibus went on—between Hyde<lb></lb>park-corner and Knightsbridge I felt my pocket move—I looked at the pri<lb></lb>soner on my right hand, putting my hand down towards my pocket—(as I came from the bankers I took my dress and my pocket, which had my purse in, in my hand, and when I got in the omnibus I took up the other side of my dress, but still having my gown and purse in my hand—I am quite positive I had my purse when I got in)—when I looked round st✗d fastly at Thompson, he was looking straight forwards—I thought from his appearance I might be mistaken, and that the jolting of the omnibus moved him against me—we went on to Sloane-street, and there Jones called to the conductor to get out, and at the same time Thompson got up, and went out—I thought that he had picked my pocket—I felt in my pocket, and my purse was gone—no one could have got at my pocket but the person on my right—I looked which way Thompson went—I said to my husband, "My pocket is picked"—he said, "Be sure"—I said, "I am robbed my purse is gone"—we stopped the omnibus, jumped out instantly, and went in the direction I had seen Thompson go, which was towards the corner of Charles-street, which runs towards Belgrave-square—my husband followed immediately, and a policeman came up to me—I told him what had hap<lb></lb>pened—he went the way I told him—he returned, and could see nobody—I was looking about there for a very short time—I walked towards London with my husband, and determined on going to the bankers-after walking some distance we crossed the road to make further inquiries, and I had scarcely set my foot on the pavement, before I saw Thompson getting into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>opposite the Fox and Bull public-house—the horse's head was to<lb></lb>wards London—I said, "There is the man that robbed me, " and we stop<lb></lb>ped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—my husband went to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>door, and both the prisoners</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184001060088"></xptr>
               <p>were seated in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—my husband said, "You got out of the omnibus just now"—Thompson replied, "What if I did? " in a hesitating and con<lb></lb>fused voice—my husband said, "You have robbed my wife"—Jones opened the other <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>door, ran out, and my husband after him, crying "Stop thief "—Thompson came out, and I followed him, crying "Stop thief"—he ran into Lowndes-square—I ran, and never lost sight of him till we got to the farther end of the square, and he was taken I think in not more than a minute—on seeing him I had no doubt of him—I saw Jones in custody of a policeman at the corner of Sloane-street, and I had no doubt of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Were you in the omnibus your<lb></lb>self? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, I went from Ludgate-hill to Kensington, the whole way—I cannot say how often we stopped letting people in and out—they stopped most often between Hungerford-street and Piccadilly, or from there to Kensington—I should think it stopped about three times from the corner of Piccadilly to Kensington—the two prisoners and myself got out at Kensington—I do not recollect any more—I do not recollect two people getting out; yes, three got out at Hyde Park Corner—two of them had sat on my right hand, and one on ray left—one was a young man about twenty-two years of age, full grown, and a gentleman above sixty years of age—none of them had to pass Mrs. Wells in going out—that I swear—Mrs. Wells was about four seats up the omnibus—the side holds six or seven persons—if any of the others sat above her, they must have passed her—nothing attracted my attention in the omnibus—it was broad day-light, and the jolting and jumbling of the omnibus knocks the people together when they are coming in and out.</p>

                  </hi>I am proprietor and conductor of this omnibus. I remember Thompson being in it on the 23rd of December—I am not so certain of the other prisoner'—I remember their getting out at Knights<lb></lb>bridge—Mrs. Wells go out after them, and complained of being robbed—the prisoners complained of my not being in my place—I made some paltry answer—I had asked before if any one got out before they got to Kensington, and I got no answer—I had no direction from either of them to let them out at Sloane-street.</p>

               <p>at Knightsbridge. On the 23rd of December, between one and two o'clock, the two prisoners came—they were dressed as they are now—they had cloaks on their arms—they first came into the tap-room, and then went into the parlour—after that they had a pint of porter, some bread and cheese, a glass of gin, and a glass of ale—they remained about ten minutes—one of them went to the back-yard—there is a water-closet there—he was absent three or four minutes—the common sewer rant by the side of it—a person can get up the step and look at it.</p>

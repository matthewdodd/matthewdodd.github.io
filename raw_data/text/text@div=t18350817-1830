I came in town on Monday, the 1st of June, and brought thirteen £5 notes with me, which I obtained at the Southampton Bank—I placed them in my portmanteau—I came to the New Slaughter's Hotel, St. Martin's-lane, kept by Hinks—I slept there that night, and left the room about nine o'clock on Tuesday moning—I took out of my portmanteau four £5 notes before I left my room—I then went down-stairs—I went up-stairs again, after breakfast, into my room, and did not take any notice of my port<lb></lb>manteau—it stood on a chair in the centre of the room—I left the room again almost immediately, and left the house—I returned at about half-past eleven o'clock, and went into my room again—I went to my port<lb></lb>manteau to take out some more money, and found that the lock had been picked, and nine notes, which I had left, taken away—it was shut down, but not locked—the notes were part of those I had brought from Southampton—I had received them about the 18th of May—I am certain they are part of what I received on that occasion.</p>

            . I am a trunk-maker, my premises adjoin Mr. Scambler's. On the 24th of January, a little after six o'clock, I was alarmed by my dog barking; he was fastened up to a place: I went backwards and saw the prisoner on a parapet of Mr. Scambler's stables, fifteen or sixteen feet from the ground: it was rather dark, I called to him, seeing him in a stooping position: he made no answer, but went further on to hide himself. I said if he did not come down I would fetch him; he then came scrambling down the tiles, I called to my son, and he was secured, as he dropped from the tiles; his arm was entangled in his coat, so that he could not extricate himself. We secured him, and found nothing on him; we sent for a constable and gave him in charge: I got a ladder, went on the stable with a light, and found a quantity of lead cut from the main gutter, and rolled up in 3 pieces; it weighed 32lbs.; the edges appeared bright - it could not have been cut many minutes, for the boards under it were quite dry. He begged to be let go, and said he had been told by somebody to go there, and get lead as he was out of work, and if I would let him go, he would tell the truth.</p>

The hall-door was latched, as usual, the last time that I saw it before the coat was taken.</p>

            . I am toll-collector at the turnpike near Mr. Kater's house; I saw three men near the house, the prisoners, who were two of them, went into the front garden together; Nightingale then came out of the garden into the road, and Allen went into the house, he stopped there about ten minutes; both the gate and door were shut - He opened them, and went in; he had nothing with him when he went in, but when he came out he had the tail of his coat up-the other prisoner was loitering outside. They then both went in to the middle of the road and ran up Nottingham-place; I immediately gave information to the servant. I have seen both the prisoners often up that road, selling wood, with a donkey. They were pursued but not taken at that time. I gave a description of them to the gentleman, as well as to the constable; I went with him in the evening, and saw them both drinking in a public-house, between eight and nine o'clock.</p>

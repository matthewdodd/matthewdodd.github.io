The prisoner came up and put her hand into my pocket, where I had three shillings, a sixpence, and threepence - I felt, and missed it, followed and told her, unless she returned it, I would give her in charge. The watchman secured her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You gave me a glass of liquor - A. I never spoke to her - she came up and immediately caught me round the waist. I never saw her before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took her in charge, she denied having any money. I took her to the watch-house; he said she had taken 3 s. 9 d. The beadle searched her, and found only twopence on her, but a sixpence fell from some pieces of paper which were in her pocket.</p>

            . I am the beadle. I searched her, and found two penny-pieces, and a sixpence fell from her; she had put some pins in her mouth. I put my hand to her mouth, and felt at least one shilling there - she threw herself back, put her fingers into her mouth, and pulled a pin out - I then saw silver between her teeth. I tried to thrust a key into her mouth, but could not get her jaws open - she then feigned hystericks, and afterwards said,</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On my word, I never saw his money; he gave me sixpence and twopence.</p>

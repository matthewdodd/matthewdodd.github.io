The occasion of my knowing them to have been stolen, I was informed by an officer of Worship-street that they had taken one of my servants with some lead; I went with them to the dwelling house of the prisoner, they had a search warrant, and on searching the house I found in company with the officer, ninety five guineas in gold, in two paper boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not yours, you had not missed any gold. - A. We found a number of things in iron and brass that I recognised to be mine; part of them I have sworn to be my property, they came from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the articles you found. - A. Brass bosses, parts of brass door knockers, and what we call bell carriages.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. These articles are not peculiar to your warehouse. - A. The bosses are old bosses taken out of a crane which I had taken out from Mr. Newman of Snowhill; strictly speaking they are Mr. Newman's property, but under my care till I had sent Mr. Newman my account, then I should have allowed for the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen these articles that you have been speaking of in Mr. Newman's house. - A. I saw them upon the arms of the crane in which they were placed, and I saw them in my house after they were taken out; and I had missed them for two or three days, they were laying on his vice board.</p>
               <p>Q. This man you say had lived with you sixteen years, you must have had a good opinion of him. - A. So much so, his father who died in my service, after twenty years servitude, bound his wife's son apprentice to me; there was fifty pounds left. I made him a freeman, and made him a present of forty pounds odd, because the boy was to be instructed by him. He was a man that I should have been glad if this had not happened, I should have been pleased to have sacrificed five hundred pounds for him.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. On Friday the 17th of October I was in company with Mason, a brother officer, going down Purl street, in the parish of Christ Church; I observed the prisoner in an old iron shop with a bag, and out of that bag he shot into a scale that was in the old iron shop, about seventy pounds of lead. I went in immediately with Mason, and asked the prisoner where he got that lead; he hesitated for some time, I informed him that I was an officer of Worship street; it was my duty to know. He at last informed me he was foreman to Mr. Marriott, and that it was his perquisite. I took him to the office; my brother officer went immediately to Mr. Marriott's, to know whether it was the truth. Mr. Marriott appeared at the office; I produce the lead.</p>
               <p>- BISHOP sworn. In consequence of a search warrant I went in company with Mr. Marriott, Mason, and Ray, to the apartments of the prisoner No. 5, Little Purl street. On searching his back room I found a quantity of brass articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the bosses that Mr. Marriott speaks of. - A. Yes, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriott. These are the bosses, they are those that have been worn by friction; these six bosses belonged to one frame, which composes the crane of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that they are those you took from Mr. Newman. - A. Yes, I saw them day by day; the prisoner put new iron ones in the crane for those he took out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give these bosses, or any other article, to this man, allowing them as perquisites. - A. Never in my life, nor ever heard of such a thing. I should have stated they were found concealed in the hole of a forge in a bag in a little shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It ways always a rule in the trade ever since I have been in it, that is almost nineteen years, to have the old brass and lead. If the right person had them they belong to Mr. Newman, Skinner street.</p>

             sworn. I always understood the old brass and the old lead, iron, or what not, belonged to the person who did the job.</p>
               <p>Court. You understand all the old materials belonged to the journeyman, and not to the master. - A. Yes, the old brass and the old lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in a shop where there is a great deal of work done, it must be worth something to a foreman, the old brass and the old lead must be worth two or three hundred pounds a year. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much then, he being the principal man, which would have the best place, the master or the man. - A. The master.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I was hanging some goods out at the shop door - I saw the prisoner come out with something under his coat - I told Mr. Dicker, and we went after him - we found him in the public-house - I told him he was my prisoner, for taking some dresses from the door - he said he had not, but he bought them of a man in the street - he delivered the dresses to me, and was afterwards taken; but before he was taken, while he was in School-house-lane, he threatened to knock us both down, and he took up a large stone and threw it at me - it struck me in the joint of the leg.</p>

I received the prisoner and these dresses - he said he bought them of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100081"></xptr>man, but he did not know his name, nor the street he bought them in; and I had taken him wrongfully, as he was taken before, when he had a pair of shoes in his pocket - he made no resistance.</p>

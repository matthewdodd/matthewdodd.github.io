               <p>Q. How did he leave you? - A. He was set to labour, as other convicts were, in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, as a bricklayer's labourer (our convicts are employed there), he escaped by disguising himself as a bricklayer's labourer; he went on the 9th of July; I am sure I saw him there about seven in the morning at labour; he was missed on that day by not returning to dinner; from that time I had not seen him till I was sent for to identify his person at the Police Office, Whitechapel.</p>

             on October 5th, 1805; he was then in custody; he was challenged as to the fact and he did not deny it; I told him he was apprehended for returning from transportation before his time; he said it was a fact, he was tried and convicted at the Old Bailey Sessions about six years ago, and he was sent to Woolwich for seven years; about eighteen months ago he made his escape from Woolwich; he told me it was for a robbery at the Saracen's Head, Aldgate, for stealing some sheets, the property of Mr. Freeman, and the chambermaid prosecuted him. Mr. Freeman does keep the Saracen's Head now, and he has for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Freeman here? - A. No: If Mr. Kirby was here he could identify him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here that can prove Freeman keeping the Saracen's Head at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. The evidence in this case is too defective. It is proved that this man was in the custody of persons at Woolwich as a convict, but as to the allegation that he was a person who was convicted on the robbery of Mr. Freeman, the evidence does not go to the length of that particular robbery; if Freeman had been here and proved that he had a house in St. Catherine's, and was robbed of sheets, that would have substantiated the fact, but for want of that it does not appear that he was the identical person that is contained in this certificate; and for want of specific evidence you must acquit him.</p>

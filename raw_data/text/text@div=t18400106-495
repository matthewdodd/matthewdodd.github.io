                  </hi>I am shopman to Mr. John Crowther Drew, of Bur<lb></lb>lington Arcade. On the 28th of December, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop accompanied by a young man, who asked for some silk handkerchiefs—I showed them some—I had reason to suspect the young man from his coming to the shop before—he held up one of the handkerchiefs, and I observed him move some handker<lb></lb>chiefs towards the prisoner, and she put them under her clothes—my em<lb></lb>ployer then came into the shop, and I requested him to c✗l an officer—the prisoner and the young man were given in charge, but the man got away—I never lost sight of the prisoner—she tried to get away, but I pre<lb></lb>vented her, and she went back to the counter, dropped the handkerchiefs, and said, "There are the handkerchiefs"—I had not then said any thing about handkerchiefs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Did not two females come down the stairs and say, "Now you have got the thief, " when you and your master were standing talking to me? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. They were my employer's wife and her mother—they came, hearing the cry of "Stop thief."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. This witness came round and told his master, and then the young man ran out—the beadle met him and brought him back—if I had dropped these they must have seen me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I saw her take them—the young man was brought back, but he escaped in his way to the station<lb></lb>house.</p>

                  </hi>I am an officer of the Arcade.

While I was ringing the bell at a gentleman's door there, the prisoner came behind me, and I turned my head, and saw him draw the handkerchief out of my pocket. I cried, Stop thief! He run away straight up the street. I followed him about twenty yards; he fell down, and I fell upon him. I charged him with having my handkerchief; he denied it; he stript for me to search him; I did, but could not find it. When I was bringing him back, I found it at the corner of Houndsditch; he had thrown it away. (The handkerchief produced, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>On Sunday night was week I was coming from Shoemaker-row; I saw this gentleman, he was running along. He stopt a lad, and said, you have picked my pocket; he searched the lad, but did not find it. Then he laid hold of me, and said, I believe it was you. He let me go then. About three hours afterwards he and another man took me behind a coach.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. No; I took him up. As I was carrying him to the Compter he got away.</p>

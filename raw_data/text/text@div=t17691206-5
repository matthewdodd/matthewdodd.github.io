Just by the crossing over, the little boy attempted to pick a gentleman's pocket. I saw the handkerchief was very visible. He not being quick enough, the prisoner stepped forward and took it, and was turning back. I said to the gentleman, You have lost your handkerchief. He felt, and said he had. I took hold of the prisoner, and said, Where is the gentleman's handkerchief? He said, he had none. I took it from between his waistcoat and shirt. I got him out of the mob and took him to the Compter. But I lost the gentleman that owns the handkerchief in the crowd. The Alderman thought proper to commit the prisoner and bound me over to prosecute. (A red and white handkerchief produced in court.) This is it. I saw the prisoner take it out of the gentleman's pocket. The prisoner told me he was a plaisterer.</p>

He is the sole owner of the <hi rend="italic">Resolution</hi>, which left in 1834, for the South Sea voyage—in the event of the will in question being genuine, Mr. Bennett would have to pay the wages of deceased—I did not know Martin Byrnes—on the 1st of August the prisoner called at Mr. Bennett's counting-house—he saw me, and said he called to inquire about a man named Martin Byrnes, belonging to the ship <hi rend="italic">Resolution</hi>—I told him the <hi rend="italic">Resolution</hi> had been home several months—I referred to the book, and that Martin Byrnes had died at sea, which I told him—he then said he had been acquainted with Byrnes's father many years, and that Byrnes had lodged with him when at home, and that he had left a will with him—I said, "Bring it over, and let me look at it"—he went away, and called again on Monday or Tuesday, the 6th or 7th of August, and presented me a paper, purporting to be a will—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—on Booking at it I observed a cross made to it, as the mark of Martin Byrnes—I referred to the ship articles, which are in Court, and finding Byrnes could write a tolerably good hand, without acquainting the prisoner, I asked him if Martin Byrnes could write—he said, "Yes, he could write, but had hurt his hand at the time, and therefore made his mark"—this excited my suspicion, and I told him I did not like the appearance of it—I gave him the paper back, and requested him to call again in a few days—he called again on Monday the 13th—I made a coramuni<lb></lb>cation to Captain Garbutt, and obtained from him a description of Byrnes—I went with him into the counting-house and asked the prisoner to de<lb></lb>scribe Byrnes before that gentleman—he said he was a shortish man, rather r stout, and fullish-featured—I told him he could not receive the pro<lb></lb>perty without administering, and asked if he had any proctor—I wrote Messrs. Jenner's address, in Doctors' Commons, and asked him to meet me there at eleven o'clock—I asked him if he knew the attesting witnesses—he said one was living—he knew one of them—I said, "Bring that witness with</p>

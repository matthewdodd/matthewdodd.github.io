This coat hung out at the door, on the books of the sun-blind - it could not be reached without the person jumping up; I saw it there a little before five o'clock - I was taking the goods down from the door, received information, and missed the coat; I ran, and saw the prisoner in a minute or two at the bottom of Middle-street, Clothfair - I crossed the road in Long-lane, and caught him with the coat - I charged him with stealing it; be caught hold of me, threw me down, and got away - I had not got ten yards before I was knocked down by one of his comrades, as I suppose; I was calling after him at the time - he was at last secured in Charter-house-square; I am certain he is the person.</p>

A man came up and said a person had run through the Park with it, I followed, and saw the prisoner drop it. He was taken by a soldier before I lost sight of him - the prisoner is the man who dropped it.</p>

            . I am a soldier. I was crossing Hyde Park about one o'clock in the day, and heard the cry of Stop thief - I turned round and saw the prisoner running; I stopped him, and asked what he had been doing? he said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing at all," but he was afraid of injuring his character. I told him to go back, he said he would not, and I took him back - we met Valentine with the bundle of linen under his arm. Tilling said he saw him take it. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

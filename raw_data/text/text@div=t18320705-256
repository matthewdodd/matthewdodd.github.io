             (Police-constable K 255). I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner together in Shadwell, High-street for some time; the prosecutor told me he had been robbed of all his property - I asked if he wished me to take the girls; he said, "Yes, I have asked them to give up the property, and they will not:" they were walking till they saw me, and then they ran off - I saw the prisoner throw a handkerchief to another girl, who has got off.</p>

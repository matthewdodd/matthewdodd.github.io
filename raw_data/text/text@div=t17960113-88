               <p>Last Wednesday night, I was coming down Bow-street, I heard the cry of "stop thief;" I met the prisoner, and stopped him, and asked him what was the matter, he was running; there were a great many people, some before, and some behind; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he ran for; he said nothing at all; I took him down Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him throw away any thing? - A. No; I felt him down, and found nothing on him. I carried him to the watch-house; he went very quietly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, at the time you heard the cry of "stop thief," there were a great many persons running; you searched the prisoner and found nothing upon him; he went very readily with you, and you took him to the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was not near the place at all; Mr. Phipps said, he should be glad to have me transported for the loss of the shoes; and instigated the boy at Bow-street to swear against me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Tippen.) Q. You say you saw the shoes drop? - A. No; I did not see them drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has had the shoes since? - A. I have had them in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. They were never left at a public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Phipps. There is a mark in them; they were bespoke shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before? - A. That evening; I had set them in the window just before.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Tippen.) You was before the Grand Jury at Clerkenwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any public-house? - A. Yes, one public-house, the Bell, at Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the shoes not left in the custody of the keeper of that public-house while you went before the Grand Jury? - A. No; they were in my possession all the while; they were in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Phipps.) You were at the Bell public-house? - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were at the Bell, did you put the property any where for security but in the boy's possession? - A. No; the Magistrate gave them to the boy, and he has had them ever since; the boy took them before the Magistrate, and the clerk of the Magistrate ordered them to remain in the possession of the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were at the public-house, were the shoes in the possession of any other person than the boy? - A. No; they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other shoes there? - A. Only a pair I made a present of to a man, because he had half-boots, and they were very clumsy, to walk up the steps; for no other reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man? - A. Macmanus.</p>

I knew Macmanus; and he told me he stopped a person with a pair of shoes; Macmanus and Phipps, and the boy, were drinking at the public-house, and he shewed me the bill of indictment; he had it in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What sort of looking thing was this indictment? - A. It was on a slip of parchment; he said it was for robbing Mr. Phipps of a pair of shoes; then Mr. Phipps produced the slippers from the little boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where had the boy got them? - A. He took them out of his pocket, the landlord was present; he said that he thought they might fit his wife.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who said that? - A. The landlord; he took them from Mr. Phipps, and carried them into the bar to his wife; his wife looked at them, and said she did not want any slippers; they were delivered to me, and I brought them back, and returned them to Mr. Phipps.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They were the very same shoes that were carried? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Whether the last witness is not clerk to the solicitor for the prisoner? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him there? - A. Yes; I went first from Bow-street to the indictment-office; I went and gave my instructions to Mr. Johnson; he desired me to wait a few minutes, and I went over to the Bell; he gave me the bill to put in my pocket, I had it in my pocket, I might pull it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew it to the last witness? - A. I shewed it to Phipps and the boy, he might see it as well as they.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Phipps pull the shoes out of the boy's pocket. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him deliver them to the man of the house? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him say they would fit his wife? - A. I did not; I saw them in Settree's hand, but never out of sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they carried to the bar? - A. I don't know that they were; I did not pay much attention.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Tippen.) Were you present with your master at the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body take the shoes to the bar? - A. Not that I saw; that gentleman asked to look at the shoes, and my master bid me pull them out of my pocket for him to look at them; he shewed them to that gentleman, they were never out of my sight all the time; I put them in my pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the landlord come up and say any thing about these shoes? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they carried to the bar? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have known it if they had? - A. Yes; for I was there sitting all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Phipps.) What passed as to these shoes? - A. I recollect this gentleman coming up, and saying, if I would emply Counsel, he would be bound I should be paid for my property; he said, what have you lost? I said nothing but a pair of shoes the boy has in his pocket; I am not sure whether he asked to see them; I believe the boy shewed them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the landlord say any thing to you? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing about fitting his wife? - A. Nothing at all.</p>

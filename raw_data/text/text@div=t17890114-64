My house was broke open, either on Friday night, or Saturday morning the 9th or 10th of January. I was in bed; I went to bed between nine and ten; I was not the last up in the house; a woman that takes care of my wife, was the last up. She is not here. My wife was in bed; she was very ill. The house was all fast when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Who makes fast the house at night generally? - Myself. I keep no servant; I fastened the door. There is one outside door that opens into the street; the window was fast when I went to bed. I was not disturbed till I got up to work, which was just after six; when I got up, the door was fast; I did not take any particular notice of the window. When I went out to work, I pulled the door after me; I did not lock it; it is not a spring lock, only a latch.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. In the street, just after I had gone half past three, the prisoner came by with this bundle in his hand; I asked him what he had; he said, nothing but what was his own. I took him to the watch-house; he wanted to stop by the way, at the watch-house. I found they were women's things; he said he was taking them to his sister, in Darkhouse-lane. He was locked up that night.</p>

               <p>About half after three, the watchman brought in the prisoner with this bundle in his hand, and said they were some things of his own property. I took the things, and opened them; he said they were his sister's; and he said she had no place of residence at present, but was at a lodging in Darkhouse lane, and he was going to her; I told him I should keep him and the bundle. The next day I enquired, and found the prosecutor had been robbed.</p>

               <p>All that I know of it is, I was confined up stairs from Wednesday night till Saturday morning, with a cold. On Saturday morning, I missed my cradle-quilt; and I found the casement open, and a pane of glass taken out of the bottom of the casement, and the lead broke; this was between ten and eleven in the forenoon; the first thing I missed, was a little curtain out of the window; we never heard any thing when it was done; then I missed the rest of my things; and the watchman came and informed me.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>This cradle-quilt I know by the piece, and what it is made of; my mother made it me out of the bits of two beds; the aprons, one of them is twice nitched in the selvage, and the other is tore in the binding.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Ratcliffe-highway about three in the morning, or between two and three, and I saw a woman and a man wrangling one with the other; they went away just before I came to them; and I picked up the bundle; the watchman stopped me; I told him I had some cloaths; I wanted him to look at them; he took me to the watch-house; I have followed the sea ever since I was nine years of age, and never did any thing that was bad.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Beswick. Where had these things been on the Friday night? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who was the woman that took care of you? - A young woman that is out of place. She was not there of the Friday night; it was a mistake of my husband's. I had nobody with me; nobody was in the house of the Friday night but a young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140092"></xptr>man that lodges with me, my husband and my three children.</p>
               <p>Who was the last up that night? - My husband.</p>
               <p>He says not? - It is merely a mistake.</p>
               <p>Where was the young man that lodged with you? - He was in bed in our house with my child.</p>
               <p>How is the window of that room fastened? - It is a casement with an iron button; the shutters were not fastened; my husband forgot them.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You did not fasten the window that night when you went to bed? - I am sure the window was fast; I forgot the shutter for two nights; I thought there was nothing in the house that any body would come in for. I did not trouble my head about the shutts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This woman has made her braggs about the neighbourhood, that she would have forty pound for me. I sent for some witnesses, and they promised to come; and the captain of the ship I failed with; but they are not come.</p>

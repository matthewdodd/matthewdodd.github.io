             sworn. - I live by the side of Mr. Bushnell's premises, where the wheels were taken from; I saw the prisoner and another man, on Monday morning, the 25th of March, coming from the premises of Mr. Bushnell with the fore wheels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person of Davis? - A. Yes, and the other was

            , each of them had a fore wheel; this was a little after six o'clock; they were about twenty yards from Mr. Bushnell's premises; when I first saw them, when they saw me, they were very much shocked; I work for the same master; they were ashamed to see me; one stooped down to tie on his shoe, and the other endeavoured to hide himself, taking the flap of his long coat up, holding it so. I did not know that they were doing any thing that was indecent till afterwards; the premises were searched and found to be broke open; Mr. Bushnell came to me, and I told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the two persons you saw roll the wheels along were the prisoner and Oliver? - A. Yes, they went up Park-lane, both in one direction; when I came to look at the premises, the boards were broken down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You knew Davis very well? - A. Yes, he is a wheelwright: I saw the felloes for him.</p>
               <p>Q. All the opportunity you had of seeing the wheels was, you were in the road, and they were on the foot-path? - A. Yes, I was at the gate paying the toll for my ass; I saw they were coloured a light colour, I did not search into them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say, that at the time you first saw them, they were coming from Mr. Bushnell's premises? - A. I did not see them come out; I saw them as soon as they were out in the road.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prosecutor.) Q. What is the value of these two fore wheels? - A. They cost us three guineas before they were painted.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you know the prisoner Davis? - A. I have seen him before, I know him by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever any dealings with you about any fore wheels of a coach? - A. I never made any agreement with him in my life; I bought them of Oliver on Monday, and I sent them back about Friday or Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What Monday was it? - A. I know it was on a Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know quarter-day - what time of the day was it? - A. About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen Oliver before? - A. On the Friday, when I bought the hind wheels of him; I had not seen him before on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Davis before on that day? - A. I saw Davis when I paid 
               <persName id="t18050424-117-person1105">Oliver</persName>
             the three guineas for the wheels, on Monday, in the tap-room; we both went together to the public-house that I use in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240095"></xptr>Q. How came you to pay him in the public-house rather than in your own house? - A. Oliver took me to the public-house, and there I paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat down and drank with him? - A. I do not think that I drank, I think there was a pot of beer called for, I sat down of course with him to pay him the money, I had not sat down above two minutes before I paid him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sat in the same box with you and Oliver? - A. Haycroft, a master wheelwright; the prisoner sat in the other box, on the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Oliver speak to him? - A. There was some of the silver that he rather disputed, and he called that man to see whether it was good; Davis said the silver was very good, and Oliver put it into his pocket; then he went and sat down in his former place; he sat by himself all the time I was there; I was not in the place above seven minutes altogether; I never saw Oliver before I bought the hind wheels of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Davis, besides being called to see whether the silver was good or not, had no conversation with Oliver? - A. No, it did not shew to me that he had any connection with Oliver at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you returned to Mr. Bushnell the very same two fore wheels that Oliver sold to you? - A. I did not take them home myself; Mr. Bushnell declared them to be the wheels that he lost; Oliver came down to me, and said, take care of those wheels, I have stolen them, and then he set off as fast as he could; the wheeler was then boxing them on.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for the hind wheels? - A. Three guineas and a half; they declared to me they sold them for a person in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give no more than three guineas and half for the hind wheels, and give three guineas for the fore wheels? - A. It appeared to me that there was a great deal more iron on the fore wheels than there were on the hind wheels.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. There cannot be more iron on the fore wheels than there are on the hind? - A. I was recommended by my own wheeler that they were sold entirely for distress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Oliver was the person you agreed with, and the man who avowed to you he was the thief? - A. It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You never agreed with the prisoner, nor never saw him at the time you bought the wheels? - A. He was at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Davis about the wheels? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was the third person in the box with you? - A. Haycroft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Oliver apply to Haycroft for his judgment on the silver? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I apprehended the prisoner at the public-house in Marlborough-street; he told me he was come to inquire after some man that was apprehended about some wheels; I told him I believed, through Oliver's interest, the matter would be squashed; I looked at Davis very hard, and, through the information that I had, I thought he was the man that I wanted; I said, is your name Davis; he said, yes, it is; you are a wheeler, are you; he said, yes, I am; then I said to him, you are the person that I want; O, said he, it is all very well, I am come to clear myself up with it; I took him before the Magistrate; I went to the place where the wheels were sold; I produce one box of each wheel, which I took out of Mr. Ellstone's coach-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So the prisoner at the bar, who is now charged with stealing these articles, found his way to this public-house, where he might be apprehended? - A. He was there.</p>
               <p>Q. He acknowledged that his name was Davis, and that he was a wheelwright, after you had the conversation with him that Oliver would squash the business? - A. I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been looking for him three days, and at the end of the three days you found him at the public-house where the people are put before they are examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had been looking for him two or three days? - A. I went one day to Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, looking for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where he worked? - A. I believe he left his place of work after this, I was informed so, I should have been very glad to have waited on him if I had known where to find him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) When was it that the two fore wheels were brought back to you? - A. I think on the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these wheels which were brought back to you are the same wheels that were stolen from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with a constable, and with a search warrant, to Ellstone's? - A. Yes, and I took away the boxes belonging to the wheels; I can speak positively to the boxes; I went after the prisoner to Mr. Hudson's, his master, where he worked (the prisoner worked for the man who made my wheels); I went after Oliver too; I never succeeded in finding him; I am sure they are my boxes by sitting the arm; they are made on the arm to fit, when they are hot; they will not fit another gentleman's carriage; it might happen that they might fit a hackney-coach; I will swear they are my boxes.</p>

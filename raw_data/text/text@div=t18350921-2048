Mr. Henry Budd is the proprietor—on Monday, the 5th of September, I was in No. 22, Woburn-place—I met the prisoner coming out—he said, "Can you give me a job?"—I said, "You rascal, you do not want a job, you have been at one, "—I had seen this plough, which is mine, fall at his feet, about two yards before I got to him—I had been working at the house, and said I would search him—he then drew back to the bench, and drew this saw out, which was James Virtue's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. At ten minutes after nine o'clock, from information I received, I went to Penn's house—I saw the prisoner Taylor with two women, standing near the back-door which leads into the yard—Taylor immediately went into the yard, leaving the women—I followed him, and found him in the water-closet—I could not see him, he being a sweep, and it being dark—I called out, "I want you"—he came out, and I took him to the station—I returned immediately afterwards to Penn's house, searched the water-closet which I took him from, and found this knife thrown down the water-closet, and on the blade of it are several pieces of putty—I can almost swear it was putty, from the state it was then in—I afterwards went up stairs into the room, and fitted the knife to some marks in the middle pane of a window, and the point of the knife corresponded exactly with the marks where the pane had been broken, by which means the robbery had been effected—the putty had been scraped out on one side, and at the bottom there was two marks on the edge of the frame—I saw marks of soot on the</p>

               <p>bed-curtains and on the mattress—I do not know any of the prisoners—Taylor was black, like a sweep—I saw marks of white on his knees, shoulders, and arms, at the station, such as a person would have by climbing up a white wall—there were also marks of black on the inside of Penns wall, such as sweep would make by getting up—marks of a person's toes—the wall is about twelve feet high—there is a urinal in the yard, a water-closet door, and a wall above, then the leads, so that it is like a pair of stairs—he could get on the leads very easily, and on that lead the window opens.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Whose feet would you swear made the marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear—they appeared to be marks of toes—I do not swear they were—I almost swear the marks on the knife were marks of putty—it is a common sort of a knife—I fitted it in the wood where the putty was scraped away, and it corresponded—no doubt any common knife would produce the same mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was at the station, about half-past seven o'clock, when a boy came—I was ordered to go up to Mr. Penn's house—I went, and Penn gave Ryan into custody—I took him to the station—I was going back to the house, and saw a brother constable with Donoghne, and assisted in taking him to the station—I went to Perm's house, and brought the goods to the station in a bundle—I have seen Taylor and Ryan before—Taylor is a sweep, and is generally black—I never saw Ryan with a black face before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Taylor's Defence.</hi> His statement was quite different at Union-hall; they convicted one another there; one of the boys said he saw Ryan throw things over the wall, and a man underneath in a brown coat caught them, and ran up to the van; one of the other boys said he saw Ryan throw them into the van himself; he did not say so at Union-hall; one swore it was a man in a brown coat, and the other said it was Ryan; I never had the knife in my possession; I had been in the house an hour and a half; I went backwards, and had not been there five minutes before the policeman came.</p>

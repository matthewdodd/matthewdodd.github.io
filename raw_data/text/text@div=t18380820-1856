                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jonathan Williams, and live in Red Lion-street, Holborn. On Saturday night, at a quarter past ten o'clock, on the 21st of July, I was in Church-street, Bethnal-green—I felt a twitch at my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner's hand in my pocket-hole—I had there a half-crown, three shillings, and some halfpence—I ac<lb></lb>cused her of picking my pocket—she turned to a companion she had with her, and said she had not—I examined my pocket, and all my money was gone—I had seen it there not two minutes before—I accused her again—she struck me, and ran away with a companion-an officer came, and took her.</p>

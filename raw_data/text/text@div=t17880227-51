               <p>On Saturday, the 12th of January, about half after six in the evening, I took the prisoner in Mr. Beek's empty house; I took him up stairs, and saw the lead rolled up in the first floor; he laid hold of me, and said for God's sake do not tell Mr. Beek! if you do he will transport me.</p>
               <p>Did it appear newly cut? - No; they had pulled it off, and rolled it up; I asked him where he had it from? he said, he would shew me; I followed him up stairs; he said, he got out and took the tiles off.</p>
               <p>Had you said, it would be better for him to confess it? - No; he asked me to help him put it on again; I said, I would not; it was taken from the gutter between the two houses.</p>
               <p>Do they both belong to Mr. Beek? - Yes; the prisoner had worked for my master; he is a bricklayer.</p>

               <p>Was there any mark when you laid it down by which you can swear to it? - Yes, three holes where the holdfasts went in to fasten it to the chimney.</p>

               <p>I was asked into this house; I went in; before I got up stairs, this man came with a candle, and a man ran down by us, and jumped out of the window; I knew nothing of the lead; I worked for Mr. Beek a great while, he will give me a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beek. I cannot say I ever saw any harm of him; I never knew him dishonest.</p>

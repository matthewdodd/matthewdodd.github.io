About dusk the prisoner Prosser came to the door, and felt these trowsers, which hung at the door - Edwards was behind him, and in his company. I went towards them, and saw him let go of them, and walk away. I then watched, and saw them go two doors off, they looked round to see if any one was watching. I then saw them plainly, so as to know them again. I returned to the end of the shop - a gentleman came in, and asked if I had lost anything. I then missed the trowsers, and went out, but could not find them; but on returning, found Austin in the shop. They were both taken that night. I am certain of their persons.</p>

            . On the 27th of December, I was passing through Shoreditch, and saw two persons looking through Gilbert's window. I watched them, passed on, and in a few minutes the prisoners ran by me, Prosser having the trowsers in his hand. I followed them to Webb-square, where a party of eight or ten joined them. I then turned back, and met Mance and Armstrong, and went with them round a different way; we met Prosser with the trowsers, and secured him. I knew Edwards before, and gave information - he was taken that evening.</p>

Austin gave us information - we went round another way, and in Wheeler-street, saw Prosser coming down, and laid hold of him, and took the trowsers from his arm, tied in a black silk handkerchief, which he said he had taken off his neck, and that he found them in a passage.</p>

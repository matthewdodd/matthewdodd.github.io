                  </hi>. I live at Hatton, in Middlesex, near Hounslow, and carry on the bone-cutting business. I was in town on Tuesday, the 20th of January, near Smithfield, at the corner of St. John-street—I met the pri<lb></lb>soner there—I never saw him before—he was alone—it was about two o'clock, or a little after—he asked me if that was Smithfield, pointing to Smithfield—I said it was—he asked me on what day the beast market was, and said he had come out of Lancashire to see his sister, and should like to know what day the market was held, that he might tell the conntrymen when he went back what day to bring their beasts there—he began con<lb></lb>versing about the price of corn, and asked me to go and take a pint of ale—I had told him I had come from the country myself—we went into the Rose, and in a few minutes another man came in, who said he had come from Gloucestershire on some law business, and he had above £1500 come to him—he showed some papers, like notes in his hand—the prisoner told me to persuade him to keep his money close and not expose it; he said, as he was a near countryman of mine, he would be persuaded by me more than him—I persuaded him not to expose his money in company, and soon after the prisoner said he had some paper, and he had better wrap up his money, and put it in his fob—he pulled some paper out of his pocket, and gave it to the other to wrap up his money—he wrapped it up, and then the prisoner said he would wrap up his own money—then he asked me to put it into his fob-pocket for him—he had got no watch—I pushed it into his fob for him—he then gave me a bit of paper to wrap mine up—I pulled my purse out, and was folding it—just as I had folded over one fold, he snatched it out of my hand, and said, "Let me do it for you"—I had shown my money to him before that—he saw the size of my purse—I had eleven sovereigns in it—I had counted them not half an hour before, and I am sure it had eleven sovereigns in it—after taking it out of my hand he wrapped it up, as I thought, gave me back the paper, and told me to put it into my fob—I said I had not got one, and put it in my side-pocket—I did not know but I had got my purse and money—it was in his pos<lb></lb>session not a minute, I think—I supposed I had got my purse and sove<lb></lb>reigns in the paper—the prisoner then said, "We will go now"—(this was within two minutes) and we went out together, and then parted just about where we had met—I was going to Wormwood-street, and turned back and left him at the corner of St. John-street—in about two minutes I pulled the paper out of my pocket, and examined it—I found in it instead of eleven sovereigns nine halfpence, and there was no purse—I had not been in company with any body but them, after they gave me the paper—I went to the public-house to see if the other man was there, but he was gone—I</p>

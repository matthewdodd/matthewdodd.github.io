On the 9th of this month, I lost three pieces of point gauze, value eighteen shillings, from a little shelf in the shop-window, near the door; I saw them there about half after seven in the morning; I missed them immediately on two of the prisoners going out of the shop; I do not know who took them; I did not see them taken; I saw the prisoners Matthews and Pank in the shop; the other prisoner did not come in; one of them asked for some thread to mend his breeches; then he would have silk; I went to the drawer, and could find none of the colour; he went away; I opened the door, and let them out; I missed the gauze immediately; I had nobody in the shop; I could not pursue them; they were taken in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I am certain to the persons of these two young men: the constable has the gauze; I cannot say whether both came into the shop together; they went out together.</p>

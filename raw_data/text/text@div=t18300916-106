               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. When you delivered the letter did you get the parcel at once? A. I suppose I waited twenty minutes - I presented the letter at the desk; I saw several of the firm: the person I gave it to told me it would be attended to - I said I wanted the parcel back; I was then sent backwards, to wait for it - it was made up in twenty minutes, and a gentleman, who seemed to take a leading part in the business, asked where I got the letter; I told him - he then said he had some doubt respecting the letter, and asked who I was; I told him, and said if he would trust me with the parcel I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160058"></xptr>take care the prisoner did not have it if he was not entitled to it - he trusted me with it on that understanding.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons might you see there? A. I suppose one hundred; whether the persons speaking to me were clerks or partners I cannot say - I do not know what the parcel contained.</p>

            . I am employed at the Blue Boat, Aldgate. On the 26th of August the prisoner came into the coffee-room, and sat there from two o'clock till atter three - he then asked if I could spare our porter to go to Fore-street; I said No, but would send for one - Brede was fetched; I saw the prisoner deliver him a letter, telling him to go to Morrison's, and bring a parcel back; the prisoner asked me if he could have a bed there - I said he could; he told me if any body inquired for him (Mr. Clayton) he should be in in half an hour - the porter brought the parcel back, and inquired if he was in; he was not - he staid nearly two hours, and then left the parcel; I had it sent up to the bed-room intended for the prisoner - he came in at eight o'clock that night, and asked if a parcel had come which he had sent for; I said Yes, and it was in his bed-room - I had it brought down, and asked if that was it; he said Yes, it was all right - I wished him to look at it; he said he had no doubt of its being correct, but he had not an opportunity of looking at it then, and desired me to send it up to his room again; I did so, and an officer came and took him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had seen the officer before? A. No - I did not know he was coming; I had seen a person from Morrison's, and suspected something was wrong; it was at another person's suggestion I showed him the parcel.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were directed to see if he would own it, and he did? A. Yes.</p>

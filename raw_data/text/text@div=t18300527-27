About half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday evening, the 17th of April, there were about one hundred and fifty handkerchiefs near the door - the prisoner came and took, them but dropped part of them; I followed him, and he dropped fifty-six handkerchiefs at the corner of Market-street, which is opposite - a drunken soldier reeled up against him, and stopped him; I took him, and brought him back - I was behind the counter; the door was on the opposite side of the shop to me.</p>

            . I remember the bundle of handkerchiefs lying about a yard within the door; I saw the prisoner come and take them - he dropped part of them just outside the door; I pursued him across the road, and he dropped these fifty-six at the corner of Market-street - I only lost sight of him while I picked them up, and swear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where was I taken? A. Just inside the market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Oxford-market, and heard a cry of Stop him! I turned round, and saw two persons pass me in a great hurry; I was then stopped, not by a soldier, but by two butchers, who said,"There is a call after you; Stop!" I said," It can't be after me, but I will stop;" the first witness then came up, and charged me with taking these handkerchiefs - I have not been in Europe for fifteen years, and never in my life committed an offence of this kind; why these two young gentlemen should he so positive that I entered the shop and took them, I do not know; my situation in life has been very different from shop-lifting, and I will say, if it were the last sentence that ever passed my lips, I am not guilty.</p>
               <p>EDWARD MEREDITH. I never lost sight of him at all; he dropped part of them at the door, and I followed him directly - I did not see any other person running; there was a soldier who was drunk, and he reeled up against him - he said, "Here he is, take him, and hang him."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It would have been very easy for that soldier to have been brought. Witness. The Prisoner said he had a wish to bring the butchers forward.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How soon after he dropped the last bundle was he taken? A. Directly - he was not then above fifty yards from my master's door; I certainly lost sight of him while I was coming across the counter - I saw him take the handkerchiefs from the door; when I got to the door I saw him running, and knew he was the same person.</p>

               <p>What sort of a noise was it you heard? - A great noise with the window up stairs in my chamber, which was over the kitchen, the noise was like forcing the window open; when my mistress spoke, I took the candle and went up stairs, but nobody was in the room, and the window was wide open, it was a casement; I went up about eight to shut it, and it was shut, and the glass was whole, but they had taken a pane of glass out to open the casement; I saw some ribbons hanging out of my box, and the things were gone that are mentioned in the indictment; I looked out of the window to see if I could see anybody, but I could not; I went down and told my mistress, and my master got up, and we went down stairs and could see nothing; the lead of the window was laid quite back with a knife, to get the pane out of the window; we mistrusted the prisoner, he lived in the same alley, and on Saturday, his door was open, and I went up stairs, and his room door was locked, and I pushed it open, and I saw very handsome china bowls, and candlesticks, and pictures, but none of my own things; I went down and told my mistress, because we have been robbed four times.</p>
               <p>Where did you find your own things? - He went by about evening, and my master took him before a Justice, there he owned he had pawned my gown.</p>

            . I am a tailor. I was in Smithfield about five o'clock on the evening of the 23d of September - I saw Collender there - the prisoner, who was near him, took the handkerchief from his pocket - I informed Collender, and the prisoner was seized, but whether the handkerchief was found or not I do not know.</p>

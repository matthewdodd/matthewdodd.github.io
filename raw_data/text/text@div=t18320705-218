               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man came with a woman to my house, and begged I would send for something to drink - they got a pot of beer; I then said it was no use to sit there, they must go into the next room - I never left my chair till I heard our door bang; I went out - the prosecutor was coming out of the room, and said he had lost his watch - I said, "Good God! which way is the woman gone?" I ran out, but could not see her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist, and live in Wellington-terrace, Waterloo-road—I occupy some rooms on the second floor of the house. On Thursday, the 18th of July, the prisoner Harrison called on me—my landlady came up to me, and then Harrison came up—he said he had heard the report of the work of the Duke of Sussex—I had published a portrait of the late Duke of Sussex—after half an hour's conversation about the Duke of Sussex, he said, "I can give you a job to do of my own"—he said the name of Hatton had introduced me to him—I did not know such a person—I said I should be very glad to do the job if it was in my line—he went down stairs, and said he would bring me an answer in two minutes' time—my curiosity led me to the window to see where he went, and it was into the Waterloo-road, which is just before my door—I saw the other two prisoners communi<lb></lb>cate with him—he came up stairs in a minute's time, presented to me this paper marked "A," and asked if I could do 350 the same as this genuine one—I said I should think I could do it—he asked how much I wanted to have for 350—I said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "I have nothing to do, I must go down stairs, and ask the others"—he went down for two minutes, came back again, and said, "You can make, instead of 350, 500 for the same price"—I agreed to that—he asked me what time he could have the first impression—I said he could have one on Friday, but, being my Sabbath, I asked him to</p>

               <p>me when they came for it—on the Thursday evening I received some more proofs from Owen—these marked "F" and "G" are them—on the same Thursday evening Valler came, and produced an envelope, containing this card, with the name of Harrison on it, but no address—I asked him if he knew German—he said, "No, I know a little French," and asked me if the 500 were ready—I said I could not get them ready, because they were not dry—I said I had received a proof, and I showed him the proof which Owen had brought that evening—he said, "That will do, it is very correct"—I said it was a difficult job, as Harrison had told me to say, and asked him a sovereign more—I could not in my conscience ask him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he said, "Well, you shall have 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;," and gave me a sovereign on account—he took the proof away with him—on the Friday evening Harrison and Valler both came to my room, rather before seven—I told them the copies were not quite ready—part had been printed, but not the whole—I promised him faithfully to have them ready by Saturday evening at that time—Valler was very vexed and discontented that they were not done—I promised them faithfully for the next day, at six o'clock—on Saturday, about five o'clock, I received a quantity of copies, made up into five parcels, in brown paper, from the sergeant of the police—I also received the original coupon, and a block or two—I opened the parcel con<lb></lb>taining the blocks—these are them—I tied the parcel up again, and about seven o'clock Harrison and Valler came—they asked if the job was done—I delivered to Valler the five parcels I had received from the police, with the original coupon on the top of the others—he opened the parcel, and showed it to Harrison—they looked at the impressions—Harrison made no further observation, Valler, saying that for the future I should have plenty of work to do quite in another style, he seemed perfectly satisfied—Harrison said nothing, but seemed as well pleased—Valler then paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the re<lb></lb>mainder of the money—when I handed the paper containing the blocks to Valler, I said he should take that away with him—he said, "I shall leave it with you"—I said, "No, you had better take it with you," and he took them away, with the 500 impressions—these are them—Valler left the room first, and after he had left, Harrison sat down in a chair, and said, "Now settle with me as well, let me have for my own trouble the money"—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and told him he had better call to-morrow for the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but he said, "Never mind, pay me now;" and I paid him—I was acting in concert with the police and the Consul all through.</p>

Salati on that—Fielitz tried to imitate it—Valler said he was quite satisfied, and what he would give him to do, the signature he wanted him to do would not be so long as Salati—he then produced this (F), and said that was the work, and he wished him to put a full name similar to that, and he should have fifty for him—he appointed next Saturday to call at the house at eight in the morning to come to my residence—he never came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Prussian, and an interpreter by profession; I live in Cecil-court, Leicester-square. I know Gallico—he introduced me to Valler, who told me he had something to write—he showed me a passport and spoke to me about imitating that signature—he asked me if I could write the same as that—I said, yes I could—I wrote just the same, and he was satis<lb></lb>fied, and said, "That will do"—some time afterwards he took out his pocket-book, and showed me some coupons—this is one—he said he wanted the name of the clerk of the banking-house to be written on it, he should want forty-five or fifty done, and said there would be 100 or 200 to do—I met him in</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant.</hi>) I accompanied Thornton on Friday, the 26th, to the York-hotel, Waterloo-road, and saw Enrico sitting on the end of a cask looking out of window—he could command a view of the road—Thornton and I separated—I went a short distance down the road, and saw Enrico come out, and stand at the door—he remained there about a quarter of an hour, and was joined by Harrison—Harrison went to Rosenthal's—I at last joined in taking them—I searched Enrico and Harrison—on Enrico I found a pocket-book containing two or three cards with an inscription on them—he gave his address, No. 4, Trafalgar-place, Gibraltar-row, Lambeth—I went to that house, and went all over it—there are two rooms down stairs, and one up—I found nothing but two or three letters.</p>

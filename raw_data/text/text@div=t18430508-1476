                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in the Strand. On Saturday morning, the 25th of March, at a quarter-past nine o'clock, I missed a piece of brown superfine cloth, measuring forty-five yards and a quarter, worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but being damaged, it cost me 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen it safe between seven and eight the same morning—I found a bat left in the shop—on the Wednesday week following I saw the cloth at Mr. Dempster's shop—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have the care of a suite of chambers in Buckingham-street, Strand. About nine o'clock in the morning, on the 25th of March, I was standing at No. 3, in the same street, next door to the public-house, which I had a full view of—I saw the prisoner come out of it with a roll of cloth, rolled up much tighter than it is now, and without any paper on it—he brought it out in his arms, put it into a cab, which was coming down the street, and got in himself—he had no hat on, nor any with him.</p>

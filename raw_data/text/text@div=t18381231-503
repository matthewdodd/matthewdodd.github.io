                  </hi>. I live in Henry-street, in the parish of St. Anne, Middlesex. Nobody but my wife and myself live in the house—on Thurs<lb></lb>day, the 27th of December, I went out at eleven o'clock, leaving my wife at home—I returned between half-past six and seven o'clock—my wife was with me then—I found my back gate open, and the back-door on the jar—my wife missed some things—the prisoner was brought to me next day—I have known him twelve or fourteen yean—I do not know where he lives—I asked him for my tickets, meaning the duplicates of my articles—he said, "What tickets?"—I said, "It is no use, I want my tickets, and if you don't give them to me, I will give you in charge," which I did.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife—he went out before me—I went out about half-past four o'clock—I left nobody in the house—I bolted the top bolt of the back-door, locked the street-door, as I came out, and put the key into my pocket—I had seen the prisoner between one and two o'clock that day, (<hi rend="italic">before I left the house to go to my husband,</hi>) in the Freemasons' Arms, near my house—he called me on one tide there, and asked me to lend him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him I had not got it—my husband was coming out of the beer-shop opposite at the time, and a young man said, "Here comes <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—the prisoner put up the curtain, and saw my husband go across the wooden-bridge-field, towards the Ben Jonson—I then went home, secured my house, and went to my husband—I returned with him, and found the back-door a-jar, and broken open—the windows had been all safe, and the street-door locked—the latch of the back-door was bent, and the top bolt was open—it must have been slipped back with something—I found my box, which had been under the head of the bed, at the foot of the bed—I missed from it a coat, waistcoat, and trowsers—the cloak was on the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in straw-plait. On the 21st of May I came from Halstead in Essex—I got to town at half-past four o'clock in the morning—I came to sell some plait and get some more, and fell in with the prisoner at past twelve o'clock that night—I asked if she could tell me where I could get a bed for two or three hours, as I was too late for the waggon—she took me to a house, and said I should have a bed for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she got a light and showed me up-stairs on the first floor—she left me there five or six minutes—I pulled off my coat and waistcoat, and laid on the bed—she returned in a few minutes, and took the coat and waistcoat and the candle, and said she would take care of them in the room up-stairs, but instead of that I heard her go down, and followed he down into a room, where there were ten or twenty people—I asked them if they had seen her, and I would pay them if they would tell me where she was, but I could not find her till she was in the station-house, on the Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 22nd—it was on the Saturday night, the 21st, that I first saw her.</p>

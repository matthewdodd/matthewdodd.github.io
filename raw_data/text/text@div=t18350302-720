                  </hi>. On the 14th of February, I was fit the service of Mr. Walton, a jeweller, at 24, Ludgate-street, in the parish of St. Gregory by St. Paul. About half-past seven o'clock in the evening, about five mi<lb></lb>nutes after Mr. Walton went up stairs, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked if we kept common metal watches—I told him "No"—he pointed to a silver watch in a case, and asked what that was—I said it was silver—he asked the price—I said, "Ten guineas"—after pausing a little while, he said that was the watch for him; and looking lower down the case, pointed to a gold one, and asked if that was not metal—I said no, it was gold—he asked me to allow him to see it—I took it out and gave it to him—he told me to go up stairs, and ask Mr. Walton if he had any common metal watches—I said I was sure he did not keep them—he said the gold watch was a very old-fashioned one, which it was—he went to the door, and called out "George," and nodded his head, as if he wanted somebody to come and look at it—he ran off with the watch, and I ran after him—he ran straight across the road, down St. Paul's Church-yard and Dean's-court—I heard the watch drop from him in Carter-lane, just as the watchman stopped him—I did not pick it up—I saw him secured—I am quite certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Cripplegate. On the 16th of De<lb></lb>cember I was in Addle-street, between five and six o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner with a case of umbrellas on his shoulders, walking at a quick pace—I followed him by the wagon-office, where I thought he might be going in a hurry to book it; and after he got by them, suspecting that he had not come honestly by it I stopped him—he said he Had just found it—I asked him where—he said he did not know, as he was a stranger about London—the direction on the case was "Boyd and Co., skinner-street"—this was a mile, I suppose, from Skinner-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter to Joseph. Barber, of Galley Quay, Wharfinger. This case came from Ipswich to Galley Quay—I had it in a cart to deliver—I stopped at Leaf and Co.'s in Wood-street to deliver' something there—the case was then in the cart—when I came out again the cart and case were both gone—I can swear this is the same case—I found the cart in Addle-street, about three doors from Leafs, close by where I had lost it—the case was under Mr. Barber's care for the purporse of delivery.</p>

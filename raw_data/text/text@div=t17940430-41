             went out and left my wife; she had come to nurse her while she was laying in, she had been in the house from the Friday evening before; she went out about four o'clock Monday morning, and was gone some time, and then I came back again; I left the house Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return to the house? - I returned to the house the next day; I was at work in Bridge Water-gardens, pulling up beer for Messrs. Cox, King and Curtis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go home then and find these things missing? - Yes, and I went down to the public office, and took a runner along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at your house when you went there on Monday?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300059"></xptr>- No, I did not, I went in search of her, but we did not find her that evening, but I found her on Wednesday morning, in Allen-street, Goswell-street, laying on a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room where she was laying on the bed? - Yes, I said to her you must get up and go along with me; she said for what? what had she done? and the runner insisted on her coming along, and we took her to where I live, to my house, when I found her she had one of my handkerchiefs on her neck, a white muslin handkerchief, and a white pair of cotton stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the stockings before you took her home or after? - I observed the stockings as she was laying on the bed; I asked her about my spoons and buckles; she said she had done nothing with them, but gave them to another girl to pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise? - Something of that sort, the runner desired her to tell what she had done with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the runner tell her it would be better for her? - I never heard any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what you meant by something of that sort? - There were many words passed between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any words that imported promise of favour? - No promise of favour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention the name of the other girl? - The name of Robinson, I think, and he said he should go and look after that other girl; I left it to the runner; he asked her where she had done the things? and she said she did not know, she had given them to another girl to pawn; then he asked what she had done with the other pair of buckles and silk handkerchief? she said she had pawned them in St. John-street, and we went to the pawnbroker's the same day, Higgs, in St. John-street; we took her there, and we found the silk handkerchief, and a small pair of child's buckles, and at Mr. Lowe's, the pawnbroker, in Clerkenwell-green, we found the spoons and the other pair of buckles; they are small womens buckles, my wife's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - A check apron at the pawnbroker's, in Barbican, Mr. Burrows, who delivered that up as soon as the runner went in.</p>
               <p>Q. These then were all the things you lost? - There was a black silk cloak that we found laying on a little table in the room, in which we took her from.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that these things were in your house at the time that the prisoner absconded? - I had pulled out the child's buckles out of her shoes when she went to bed on the Sunday night before, and I laid them on the top of the table, in the room where my wife sleeps, I have but one room; I cannot say that the other things were there on Sunday evening, I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. But do you know them to be your property? - The spoons are marked W. M. P. the child's buckles, one of them, has been soldered in two different places, the spoons were in the drawer, I had not seen them for three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The cotton stockings were they your own or your wife's? - My wife's. The silk handkerchief is like that on my neck, I had not bought it above a fortnight, and had never worn it. The apron is an old check apron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said, when he came into the room, that he had missed these things, and in short, I must have them, and if I would tell him where they were, he would not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never promised her any favour, nor heard the runner, nor any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300060"></xptr>body else, I did say to her mother before I found her, that if I could find her, and get the things again, and find out where they were pawned, I would not trouble her any further about it.</p>
               <p>Q. But then she did not come to you voluntarily, but you found her out? - I found her out.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a pair of child's buckles and silk handkerchief at one Higgs's, in St. John-street; did she tell you they were at Higgs's? - She went along with me to Higgs's herself, and she went and took I and the runner to find the other girl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The runner told me if I knew any thing of the things to tell him of it, for it had better be cleared up before I went to the justice.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Worship-street. The prosecutor came to me on Monday the 21st, and he told me that his wife's nurse had robbed him of several things, I found nobody on Monday, he came to me again on Wednesday the 23d, and told me that he had an information where she was, I went with him to Allen-street, Goswell-street, I went up into a first floor, and I found the prisoner in bed along with a man, and woman with her clothes on, as if she had been out all night, except her shoes and cloak. I told her to get up, and when she got up I searched her and found one duplicate about her; I asked her where the rest where? she said, she did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What promise of favour had passed between you and her? - I never promised her any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not the prosecutor say any thing to her? - Never. I asked him if he knew any thing that she had on? he said, he was not sure; and I took the woman to the wife's, and I took the handkerchief off her neck, the wife said, this is my handkerchief, the prisoner said not a word to it, I asked the woman if that was her cloak? - she said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that cloak on her when she was laying on the bed? - No, it was laying on the table, about a yard from her, I told her to pull the stockings off and show the woman her stockings, and she did, and the woman said they were her stockings; she then said that she did not pawn the buckles and spoons, but Sal Robins had.

               <p>I live in Mutton-lane, Clerkenwell Green. This girl came to me about half after five o'clock, Monday morning, when I was in bed, and she asked me to take these buckles to sell for her mother; I had seen her about three or four months before that, I never spoke to her above a dozen times in my life; she brought a pair of silver buckles and half a dozen tea spoons; I told her she had better not sell them, she had better pledge them, then she might redeem them again, and I took them to Mr. Lowe's, Clerkenwell Green, and had eighteen shillings on them; I pledged them in my own name, she desired me.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I goes out to work; and I got my pocket picked of my money and all my duplicates; I don't remember I gave her the money; I don't know what I lost, for somebody took me home and put me to bed, it was seven o'clock when I awoke.</p>
               <p>(The things produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Sarah Robins where she got the silk handkerchief and spoons, that she gave me on Monday morning, on Clerkenwell Green.</p>

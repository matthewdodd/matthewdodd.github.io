               <p>Had he a bundle? - No; I saw Taylor at the time, he said, a man had taken his bundle, and given it to the prisoner; I saw the bundle about two minutes after the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Should you know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that bundle, is that it? - That is it; Taylor said it was his bundle.</p>
               <p>Who produced it in the street? - I believe Mr. Read.</p>
               <p>To Read. The bundle you picked up, was shewn to the prosecutor? - It was opened by the boy at the watch-house, and examined by him; but whether this is the bundle or not, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>To Taylor. Is that the same bundle you examined at the watch-house? - Yes; the breeches and shirt are marked with my name; I am sure the things are all mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You did not see the contents of the bundle till you came to the watch-house? - No.</p>

               <p>How do you know that it was the same bundle that was opened? - I laid it down on the table in the watch-house, and it was opened and examined by the boy.</p>

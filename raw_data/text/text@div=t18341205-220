                  </hi>. I live at No. 38, Bridgewater-gardens, Barbican, and am a basket-maker. On the night of the 4th of December I was in a room overlooking the factory of Mr. Plummer, in Golden-lane, at twenty minutes before nine o'clock—I observed a bag of cotton wool drop from the premises—the prisoner Leonard picked it up and put it on Baumer's back—it was dropped from about twelve or fourteen feet high into a court which leads into Golden-lane—after Leonard placed it on Baumer's back, I saw Jordan drop from the gates—I came down stairs to the door, and saw Jordan pass by me as close as eighteen inches—the other prisoners came by, and they joined company—I went out at my front door, down Brackley-street, and met Baumer with the bag—I gave him in charge of the watchman, and at that moment I saw Jordan standing opposite, in Golden-lane—I went to Mr. Plummer's directly.</p>

The back of my premises looks on the back of the prosecutor's warehouse—they are about eighteen or twenty feet from it, across the way, not more—it is a little to the left, not directly opposite—I suppose it is from nine to twelve feet to the left—I got the watchman to take Baumer—I saw Jordan standing on the opposite side at the time, but I could not take him, as I had the bag to carry—the watchman could not take the boy and carry the bag—there were people passing—I did not require their assistance—I knew Jordan so well, I knew I could take him at any time, if I wanted him—I did not say before the justice, that I knew Leonard because he wore a blue coat—I said he bad a blue coat with gilt buttons—I knew his person, but I did not know his name—I have nothing to get by this—I have no object but the mere purpose of justice—a sovereign was given to me before the magistrate by Mr. Plummer—there was no one in my company when I saw all this—the boy went down Ball-alley, into Golden-lane, and I went down Bridgewater-gardens—I lost sight of them three or four minutes—there were two gas-lights at the end of the court—it was a very clear night, not foggy at all—it was not what I call a foggy night—it was not so clear as it is sometimes—it was neither foggy nor clear—it was not a bright night—I could distinguish clearly what I have sworn to—I have had nothing more than a sovereign, nor do I expect any more—I know nothing of Baumer—I have seen Leonard before—I saw his face that night, I swear, and Jordan's face also—I know them by their faces and dresses—I told the magistrate I knew Leonard, by the blue coat which he wore.</p>

               <p>years—I did not meet any person as I went along from my own house to Golden-lane, to my knowledge—the foreman told me three months ago, to stop any body with a bag, if I saw them—I have been watching near about three months—I did not receive any thing for it—I swear I only received one sovereign, which was on the day I was at Guildhall—I had received no<lb></lb>thing besides money—I had not agreed what I was to have if I took any body—I had received nothing at all—I was only looking for a quarter of an hour that night—I began to watch when the factory left off work.</p>

            . A woman came to my shop, three weeks or a month ago, in the afternoon and asked for a small diamond ring; my apprentice shewed her one, she seemed to approve of it, and said she would bring a person next day to pay for it; she went away leaving the ring. The next day in the Afternoon the prisoner came to my shop alone and asked to see the ring; the young woman had looked at before, I reached him that ring among several others in a box: it was a diamond cluster ring, the prisoner did not like the ring the woman had approved of the day before; but said, he would fetch her to fix upon another: he went and brought her and they left the shop without buying any thing; just as they went away, a great number of customers came into the shop, so being in a little hurry, I put back the rings into the shew glass from whence I had taken them: I did not then in my hurry observe, that any ring was missing; it was about a week after this before I had any occasion to look at my rings again; then I missed this ring. Two or three days after I had missed it, I saw an advertisement from Sir

I told him I had none; he shewed me a ring; I asked him where he got it, he told me he found it; I asked him if he knew the value of it, he said he did not, I told him I could not pretend to buy it upon my own judgment, and added, that as he had found it, it was not his property, I should stop it, and bid him come the next day; he did come and then I appointed him to come on the Monday following; upon this I went to Sir

I told the prisoner on the Saturday I would advertize it; he said, he had advertized it three times himself, and desired me to give it him again. On the Friday evening I did at the prisoner's request let him have a guinea upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the ring worth?</p>
               <p>Hope. I believe it may be worth 35 guineas.</p>
               <p>Question from the prisoner. Whether you did not offer to buy it of me for 35 guineas.</p>
               <p>Hope. I never did offer to buy it, on the Saturday, I wanted, to have my guinea back and return the ring, because I thought I should get into some trouble about it; but the prisoner had not the guinea to return.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Farringdon. I was on duty on Saturday night, the 26th of April - I saw the prisoners together - Dixon took a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and gave it to Lewis - I had known both the prisoners by sight before - I watched them some time - there was another person with them - when I saw the handkerchief taken, I called to my partner, and we took the prisoners - I spoke to the gentleman; but he did not give his name.</p>
               <p>Dixon. He came to me and said I had picked a gentleman's pocket - I stood till the gentleman came up and said he had lost nothing.</p>

            . I am an officer of Farringdon Ward. Farmer called me - I went up and saw the two prisoners - I caught hold of Lewis, and he dropped this handkerchief out of his hand - the gentleman came up and said he had lost his handkerchief, and this was it - we told him to follow us to the watch-house - he followed us to the end of Cheapside, and there we lost him.</p>

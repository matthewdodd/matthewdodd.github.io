             sworn. I am a fish monger's servant, I live with Mr. Bayley, Newgate-street; I had been in Portland-street, Oxford Road; coming back I saw the prisoner at the bar and another after picking a gentleman's pocket, then they went down <placeName id="t18060521-52-crimeloc275">Red Lion-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the person. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was I when I took the copper from the boy. - A. In Red Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness to the contrary; it was in Eagle-street, the boy asked me to carry it for him into Holborn.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. In consequence of information, I followed them into Eagle-street; the prisoner at the bar was carrying it on his head; they were walking very fast, they turned into Dean-street, and when they had got a little way down Dean-street, I came up to them. I immediately collared the prisoner at the bar with the copper on his head; the other person ran off, I asked him how he dared steal the copper from the door, he said he was employed by the person that was with him; in the scuffle he got from me and the copper fell off his head, with assistance I took him again; he never was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shewed him the boy who hired me to carry it, and begged of him to take him.</p>
               <p>Court. You know him I suppose. - A. I never saw the boy before.</p>
               <p>(The copper produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness that saw the boy call me to carry it, that was coming by at the time he hired me.</p>

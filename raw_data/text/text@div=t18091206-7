               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live with Mr. Welch in the capacity of a <rs id="t18091206-7-deflabel43" type="occupation">footman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18091206-7-defend128 t18091206-7-deflabel43"></join>. - A. Yes, on the night of the jubilee we had some company: the prisoner slept with me that night; we went to bed about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed, do you know what money you had in your pocket. - A. Yes, perfectly well; I knew all was in my purse: on Tuesday night I had reckoned what money I had in my purse, and I had not any occasion to take any money out of my purse. On Wednesday night, between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, and when I went to bed, I felt my purse: in the morning we both got up at six o'clock; he went down before me; he left the family at eight o'clock; he had no leave of me, nor the colonel was not up. I missed my purse at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information that you received, did Butler give you the notes. - A. Yes, he gave me two notes: these are the notes; they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of these notes to be yours. - A. Yes; the one pound note, I recollect the number, it was 13428, Dr. Dick gave me that note on the evening of the 24th. I kept that note for the purpose of laying it out in the lottery; that made me remember the number. I accused the prisoner on the morning of the 26th of robbing me of my purse, and the two notes which I had received from Lady Mulgrave's footman: Colonel Welch asked him who gave him them notes, the prisoner said his wife.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's foreman. I employed the prisoner to assist in carrying these bottles from the barge to the warehouse - eight men were employed, the prisoner was one. I observed that he missed his turn, which made me suspect him. I saw him return, and asked him why he was absent? he said he went for a shovel. 158 prickles were delivered from the barge, but only 156 brought to the warehouse.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a Common Councilman. About half-past three o'clock in the afternoon I was going home, and saw the prisoner in Chequer-yard with a prickle of bottles. I was landing bottles at the same time, which induced me to watch him, as he was walking fast. I followed him over Dowgate-hill into Elbow-lane, which is considerably out of the way to the prosecutor's warehouse, which is in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What dress had I on - A. Either a black or dark coat - I have no doubt of his being the man - I knew him well, being in the habit of employing him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I deny being in Chequer-yard. I took the bottles to the warehouse.</p>

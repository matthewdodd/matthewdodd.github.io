             (police-constable G 86). I took the prisoner from the prosecutor - I found some pence in her apron - the prosecutor said she had robbed him of 5s. worth of copper - the prisoner said, "Here it is" - I said,"Give it me" - she untied her apron, and gave it me - the prisoner did not deny it at the time, but when she got to the station-house, she said it was part of the change of two bad half-crowns she had passed that day.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that as she was passing, the prosecutor accused a woman with robbing him, who run on to a public-house; and he seized her by mistake.)</p>

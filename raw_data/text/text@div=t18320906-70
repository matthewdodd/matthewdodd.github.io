            . I am a gardener, and live at Chelsea. I was standing at the corner of Bridge-street - I saw Mr. Todd standing for a cart to pass; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from his pocket - I am certain of his person; I saw him throw it down and run away - I followed him down Bride-lane, into another street, and the officer caught him: I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Were you there accidentally? A. Yes, waiting to cross - several persons stood there waiting to cross; there was not a crowd - the prisoner went away immediately; I pursued him, and saw him taken - I had lost sight of him; nobody but him was running before me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was standing in Bridge-street, and the prisoner came running down Bride-lane - he crossed the street; Odoud then came down, crying Stop thief! I ran across Bridge-street, and took the prisoner - I saw Odoud and Mr. Todd in about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any other persons running? A. Several - he was running first, and directly Odoud came up he said, "That is the person."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A young lad was before me - there was a stoppage; I saw the lad behind the gentleman - he threw the handkerchief down; I took it up - the gentleman turned, and laid hold of it; I then ran away, conceiving the lad had done something wrong.</p>

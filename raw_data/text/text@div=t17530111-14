The prisoner came to my shop last Friday night about six o'clock, and I was all alone; he wanted to see some silk handkerchiefs, so I shewed him two sorts, and he desired to see more ; I told him I had none that would do better; he agreed to give me seven shillings for two, I cut them off and put them up for him; at the same time there came in a black boy; the prisoner desired me to give him a dram as it was Christmas time; I said, after he had paid me, I would give him a penny or two-pence to buy one; then he desired me to send the boy out for a dram; I said, I did not chuse it; then he took up the handkerchiefs and threw me down about sixpennyworth of halfpence and ran out of the shop as fast as he could; I ran out and alarmed the neighbourhood; he was taken and brought back; he said he knew nothing of the shop, he had not been in it before; the handkerchiefs were picked up in the street and brought back again; when he saw them, then he owned it and said, it was the first fact he ever committed, and begged me to forgive him; then I sent for an officer and had him secured. The constable has the handkerchiefs, but he is not here.</p>

               <p>I was in liquor, and went into that shop to buy the handkerchiefs, but finding I had not money enough to pay for them I flung down what I had, and took the handkerchiefs.</p>

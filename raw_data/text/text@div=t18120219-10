               <p>- WHITE. I am an extra constable of the city of London, I apprehended Nias. On Saturday evening last, about half past six, I met my brother officer, Groves, and he said there were two or three lurking fellows hanging about Bishopgate Street, and immediately we went to the Magpye, Nias and Happy came in there, they were in company together, Nias had a piece of bacon in his left hand when he came in, and he throw'd it in the off box and sat in the seat alongside of the bacon, I said to Groves, there is something that is not right, he said, we will watch them. After that Happy came and spoke to me in Skinner Street, he came to me again the second time and spoke to me, a little girl went out and Nias went after her just in Skinner-street, and just in Skinner-street, Nias gave a woman a piece of bacon, I ran after him and stopped him, I asked him what he was doing there, he got away from me, I lost him, and I apprehended him again on the Monday morning between the hours of ten and eleven in Swan-street, Shoreditch; I told him I took him upon suspicion of stealing some bacon, when I brought him to the Mansion-house, I told Mr. Sapwell that I had got a person that was along with Happy, and Mr. Cooper came out and said, he was one of the men that was concerned in this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him. - A. No, I did not,

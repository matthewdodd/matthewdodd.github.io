               <p>Q. What have you to say against the Prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Gilley. On the 15th of October last, between five and six in the evening, the Prisoner came into my shop to buy two yards of ribbon, which she had and paid for it, she pretending to look up to the candle to the colour, and in that time conveyed two half pieces of ribbon into her pocket; then she wanted two ounces of thread, and after she had paid for that, my apprentice said she had put two half pieces of ribbon into her pocket. I turned her apron aside and she had under that a pocket apron, out of which she took with her own hand two half pieces of ribbon, my property.</p>
               <p>Sweeting Richards. I am an apprentice to Mr. Gilley.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the Prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Richards. The Prisoner came into my master's shop on the 15th of Oct. in the evening to buy two yards of ribbon, and I served her, whereupon she took a half piece in each hand, and held them up to the candle, and conveyed them by one at a time into her pocket, then I whispered to my master, and he went behind the compter and stayed till she was served every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take those half pieces from out of her apron ?</p>
               <p>Richards. Yes, my Lord.</p>

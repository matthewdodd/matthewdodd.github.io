            . I live with the prosecutrix's aunt. I was there when the prisoner came - my cousin went up stairs with her, and then she went away; she came again about four o'clock, and said the lady approved of the terms, and that she lived servant with her, at No. 23, Brompton; she ordered tea, and I got it ready; I put four tea spoons and the sugar-tongs on the table, and the napkin was on a table in the next room; she said she wanted two spoons, which I let her have - she asked for some small plates, which I got and then lighted the fire; she then asked for another spoon for the salt which she had - she came down with me, and asked for a plate to fetch some butter, which I gave her - she then ran up stairs for her bonnet, came down and went out; I went up stairs directly she was gone - I missed the spoons, tongs, and napkin; I came down and went after her, but could not find her till she was taken up - she said I had not occasion to prosecute her, and she would tell me where the things were - but when she got to the watch-house she said she could not recollect where she had pawned them, and then said a companion of her's had pawned them.</p>

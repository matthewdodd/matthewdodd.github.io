            . I am an officer. Field described two persons to me very minutely; I recollected seeing such persons in St. John-street, watching carts. I went next morning with him, and he identified the prisoner, who was there without his coat; he was desired to put it on, and then he had no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know that there was placards about, describing the person - A. There was some out after he was taken, offering a reward of 10 l., on conviction. I heard of the reward before I went to take him; I should have gone before, but I waited for Field to come and identify him.</p>

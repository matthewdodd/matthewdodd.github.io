On Tuesday, the 30th of August, I was instructed by him to go down there, and found the lead which goes from the front kitchen to the back one gone; I was there two or three days before - it was then safe - it had been fresh cut the whole length, and then hammered down to prevent the water coming in; the escutcheons were gone from the key-hole of the door - the holdfasts were taken.</p>

            . I am a Police-man. I was informed about half-past ten in the morning, that the prisoner had come out of an empty house in the Kingsland-road, with a basket tied up; I followed him into a beer-shop, about three-quarters of a mile from the house - I asked what he had got - he said some lead - I asked where he brought it from; he said up the road - I asked if he had brought it- he said he had; a person said, in his hearing, that a lady had seen him come out of an empty house, and he had followed him from there - I said he must go back, and show me where he had bought it - he said, "Why, what is the use of going back? I did come out of the house;" I took him to the station-house - I found a handkerchief, escutcheons, hooks, a pair of pinchers, and a knife on him; on going to the office, he said somebody had been there before him and taken the sink.</p>

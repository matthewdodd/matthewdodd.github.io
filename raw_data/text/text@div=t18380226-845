We lost two pairs of trowsers on or about the 9th of January—they were outside, on the window—I saw one pair of them about five or six weeks after—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at a pair of trowsers</hi>)—the others are lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. In the early part of January the prisoner brought this pair of trowsers to pledge—I stopped them—I believe it was after the 9th of January—I asked her who they belonged to—she said her brother had had them made the Saturday previous—but I saw they had been in a shop, and were soiled with gas—I asked her her brother's name—she said Perkins—I said, "You must leave them and bring him"—she left them, and came again in a day or two, and wanted them back—I said she should not have them but in the presence of a policeman—she then made off, and I did not see her again till she was in the station-house—I am sure she is the person.</p>

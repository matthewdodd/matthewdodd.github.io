                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was at St. George's church about seven o'clock on Friday morning, the 27th, and the prisoner gave a woman in charge for robbing him—he was drunk—I said I must search him—I found 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his waistcoat pocket—he said he had got no more money—on searching him further, I found in his trowsers pocket a bag containing two sovereigns and five half-sovereigns—I asked if it was his own—he said it was, and he had worked for it—he was locked up for being tipsy—he gave his name and address, No. 7, Little Suffolk-street, Borough—I went there and saw the prosecutrix—she immediately went to her box—I returned to the station-house, and found on the prisoner a key which fitted the prosecutrix's box—it appeared as if it had been filed and altered to fit the box—he was asked by the Alderman where he got the money—he said he had got it from his uncle, on the Tuesday.</p>

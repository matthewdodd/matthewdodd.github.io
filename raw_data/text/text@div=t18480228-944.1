                  </hi> I am gunner in the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich. On the morning of 13th Feb. I was at the barrack-room, No. 81—I had a purse, with two sovereigns and two shilling in it, in my trowsers pocket—one sovereigns was a Victoria, and the other an old one—I laid my trowsers on the bed—I turned to the room once or twice, but did not apply to the trowsers for three-quaters of an hours—the purse and money was then gone—I have not seen it since—the prisoner's bed was next to mine.</p>

                  </hi> I am a corporal in the Artillery. I was orderly of the battalion which the prisoner and the prosecutor belonged to—on 13th feb. I went to the barrack-room, 81—I saw the prisoner standing behind Barrett's bed, with a pair of trowsers in his hand—he knew me, and turned quite pale, fancying I had detected him, but I had not—in a quarter of an hour afterwards I heard of this loss—the prisoner was then confined to the barracks.</p>

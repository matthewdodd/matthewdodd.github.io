             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Cawthorn: On Friday, the 1st of this month, I was going up stairs, between three and four o'clock, and met the prisoner at the bar coming down; I asked her what she wanted; she said she wanted one Mr. M'Carthy, or somebody of that name; I told her no such person lived there, and there was a bell at the door, if she wanted any body she should ring there; having something in her apron I had rather a suspicion of her, and asked her what she had in her apron; she said it did not belong to me; with that I pulled her apron on one side, and saw these skirts which I knew to be my mistress's; I asked her how she came by them; she kept saying, how stupid, how stupid, let me go; I called for assistance, and asked her if she had got any thing else about her, belonging to me; she said she wished God might strike her down dead, if she had any thing else that belonged to me.</p>

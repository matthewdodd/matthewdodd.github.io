            . On the 28th of August the prisoner was brought to the watch-house - I searched him, and found some matches and a short pipe on him; I went to the house, and found twenty-two squares of glass in the back room, and four sashes broken to pieces; I found the lock of the street door broken. and lying in the passage - it had been broken evidently by force from the outside - I received these two screws from Fuller; I compared them with the holes in the door where the lock had been taken off, and they fitted exactly.</p>

               <p>I thought the woman was a virtuous woman, and I offered myself to her as a servant, I thought 5 l. a year would be acceptable to me, as I am a poor widow; she sent me out for a pint of brandy, and gave me a glass of it; many fellows came in, porters and chairmen; I began to think I had got in a wrong place, I heard such words that a modest woman could not bear; I asked her how she could do so; she said, do you for me, and I'll do for you. She went and painted herself, and bid me put some of it on mine, and go and walk in the Park in that gown of hers, and I should sooner get a guinea than slave for 5 l. a year; so I went away to shun the evil.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Benjamin Edwards, a jeweller, in Shoreditch. On the afternoon of the 16th of April I was in my master's shop—the prisoner came to ask for some wedding rings—I took the glass case out of the window, and put five or six rings on the counter—he looked at them, and tried them—some were too large, and some too small—he then put his hand into the glass case, and said some of those would suit him better—he took out three, tried them, and then made an attempt to put them down, but he only put down one of the three—I saw the other two pass quickly into his left hand—he then tossed up a sovereign in his hand, and pointed to a ring on the counter, and said, "What is the price of that one?"—I took the rings off the counter, and put the glass case on a work-box—he was going to the door, and I taxed him with having two rings in his left hand—he stood for a minute, and said, "So I have one;" and when he was taking that, I saw part of the other one—I tried to lay hold of him, but he drew back, and ran out—I jumped over the counter, and ran after him—I called, "Stop thief," and so did he—I ran 600 yards, and caught him—I then saw the other ring in his mouth—I took him back 200 or 300 yards towards the shop, he asked me to let him walk quietly by my side—I objected to that, and took him back to the shop, and taxed him with the ring being in his mouth—it was a minute or a minute and a half before we attempted to take it from him, but could not—I should say he swallowed it—he then had a sovereign in his hand, which he tried to get into his mouth, to make it appear that it was that he had—when I would not let him put the sovereign into his mouth, he said, "Did you know I wanted to pay you for the ring?"</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Benjamin Edwards. I was in the parlour at the back of the shop when the prisoner came in—the parlour door was open—I heard him ask for some wedding rings—Bradbury showed him some—I heard him charge the prisoner with taking two wedding rings, and having them in his left hand—he said, "Oh, have I? I do not know"—he said, "So I have one," and threw one down on the counter—Bradbury said, "You have another"—he said, "No, I have not"—Bradbury tried to pull him—he ran fast out of the shop, and Bradbury after him—I watched him outside the door—I heard Bradbury cry, "Stop thief," and the prisoner cried as well—when our rings were shown to him there were seventy, and when he left there were only sixty-eight—I counted them myself, and know the stock well—when he left he put back one ring on the counter—I took it up, and put a mark of my own on it—my father's marks were on it before.</p>

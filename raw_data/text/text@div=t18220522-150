On Wednesday the 22d of May the prisoner came into my service, and on the Friday following as she was going out for some ham I stopped her in the passage with a bundle, and asked her what was in it - she said none of my property, and forced herself out at the door. I followed, and stopped her at the corner with it; I found it contained a new sheet. She said she did not know where she was going with it. A pair of stockings fell from the bundle. I found other property in pawn.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I saw the prosecutrix pursuing the prisoner; he took the bundle from her, it contained the articles stated in the indictment - she said she did not know how she came to take them, but if her master had not stopped her, she dare say she should have brought them back. I saw one of her stockings pulled off, and in that was a cap and some duplicates.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched, and found three duplicates on her for a handkerchief, a pair of stockings, and three shirts. I asked her about some linen, which was missing; she said she hoped G - d might strike her dead if she knew anything about it, but that it might have fallen from behind the drawers. I found part of it behind the drawers, and the rest of it was found on her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you told us all the transaction? A. Yes, as far as I have been required; I know Fell's two brothers - they are respectable; we had a pint and a half of porter for supper that night - he had been very dull for several days, and that night he was very cheerful, and we sat up till about twelve o'clock; I swear he slept in the same room the night before, and I and Pever in my master's bed - I went into Fell's room for the light after he was in bed that night; I sat down on the edge of his bed and we sat talking there - I swear that I and Pever were not laying on his bed; I only laid on the edge of the bed - I was not there an hour; Fell was in a very merry humour - we did not lay down on the bed; we might have joked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290021"></xptr>on the bed - I had my gown on; I was not in my nightgown - Pever put, her night-gown over her things.</p>

            . I am a friend of this witness, and slept in the house with her for about five weeks, in her master's bed, and Fell slept in her bed in the next room. On the morning in question, the creeking of the dressing-room door awoke me, and I heard a person go down stairs- I awoke the cook, she rang the bell, and ran into Fell's room; I got on my gown and went to him; he said,"How frightened you look;" I said, "There is some one in the house;" he said, "Nonsense, it is only the cats;" he got up and we went into the dressing-room, and found the drawers all opened - he went to the window, and found it was unfastened; I can take my oath it was fastened the night before; the cook then called the Policeman, and Fell said, "Stop a minute, if you think there is any one in the house let us go down and see;" and he took a poker and went down - the cook called the officer in; McPherson never slept there while I was there - I never saw him till last Tuesday; when we got down we found the kitchen door wide open - the bells had been taken down and put on the table, which must have been done by some one in the house; Fell was given into custody, and when we went to make his bed, at eight o'clock, we found a hat under his bed, which had not been there the night before, as I had cleaned out the room that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you married? A. No; Fell had slept there almost all the time the family was away; I went into his room that night with my night-gown on over my clothes, and so did the cook - she went in because some of her things were in that room; she had pulled her gown off and slipped her night-gown on - I did not lay on his bed; I sat in a chair by the side of the bed - I know nothing about the cook; I had all my things on but my gown, and I put on my night-gown - I never said that we two ghosts intended to sleep with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Fell go out in the course of the evening? A. Yes, to get some tobacco; one of the three pairs of trousers which were missing from the house, was found in the garden, by the officers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was the state of the doors? A. They were open when I saw them - the woman called Police! I desired them to come and open the door, which they did - the garden is in front of the house.</p>

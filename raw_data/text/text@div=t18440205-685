                  </hi>. I am principal warehousekeeper of the town ware-house of the East and West India Company—I have been so thirty-nine years, and have been familiar with the warehouse the last eight years—the preparatory steps to selling tea are, on the receipt of an order from a broker, to lay them down for inspection and sale—the lids are taken off the packages, and are laid down in numerical order—the broker attends, or some one, for the purpose of going through the teas, to give them a character for the governance of the trade, and samples are handed up by the servants in trays, each containing samples of three chests; then catalogues are issued—the trade are furnished with a card by the committee of brokers—the names and measures by which they are to sample are determined by that committee, over which the Company have no control—it is then the duty of the parties coming for samples to produce their card, and that card states which number of tin they are entitled to sample by—these are the tins—it is permitted to be piled and coned up as high as they can—it is the duty of the Company to take an equal return, according to the sample they have taken, and the tea is required to be as near the quality of the sample as pos<lb></lb>sible that we may lose nothing—the persons who come to sample bring tea in bags, according to the tea they are about to sample from—it is the duty of the servants to see that no persons sample tea who are not in possession of the card, and who produce the same quality and quantity that they take—John<lb></lb>son is overlooker, and Green a labourer—they were so employed that morn<lb></lb>ing—the samplers are not allowed to assist themselves—Green was a labourer under Johnson—Redman was a labourer, but his duty that day no way placed him in a position to be at the sample room—I did not know anything till that day of Harman or Neale—I had never seen them before—after they have got their samples, this list is on the table, for the purpose of registering their names as the persons belonging to the houses for which they register, which is signed by them, also the number of samples and the size, and the initials of the persons who take them—it would have been signed by Harman and Neale on that occasion, not by the labourers, they have only to see that they do sign when they take away their samples and bags—in consequence of information, on the 10th of Jan. I directed the gates at both ends to be watched—the mode in which the teas are to be obtained, and the mode of registering the person's name afterwards, are well kuown to Johnson and Redman—a little after two o'clock, on the 10th of Jan., I went to Fenchurch-street-gate—I saw Harman and Neale under the gate, with two empty bags—in consequeuce of a com<lb></lb>munication made to me, as they entered, I turned round, and followed them up</p>

               <p>stairs into the warehouse—that is the show-room—they took their seat at the remote table from the door, where the merchants go for the purpose of sam<lb></lb>pling—Green was in the room where the table was—there were no persons at the table but Harman and Neale—Johnson was near the entrance door of the room, where he had ample means of seeing what was going on—it was the duty of both of them to see the card—if two persons came together, it would be the duty of Green to see one card, and Johnson the other—they were not both to see the same card—Redman was down in some of the alleys, marking the lots on the chests—Johnson moved across the landing, from door to door—after Harman and Neale had taken their seats, Green brought up samples of tea, which was his duty, to the table where they were sitting—while Harman and Neale were in the room I went into the room to ask for the ware-houseman, Mr. Hitchings; and I went into an adjoining room, where I could command a view of the men and the tray—Green continued to hand the sam<lb></lb>ples up to Harman and Neale at the table—I saw the signing list on the table in the room where Harman and Neale were—after they have got their samples it is the duty of these persons to see that they sign the paper, and that they bring an equal quantity of tea for what they take—I saw Green lay the list on the table—Johnson then directed Harman and Neale down a staircase which would not have given them egress into the yard—it was a different staircase to the one they came up—before they left I saw Redman come up to them, leaning his hand upon the table, and stooping over, holding a conference with them—Johnson was still at the door on the landing—when Harman and Neale got up from the table to go, they each had two bags full—Johnson directed them down the staircase with the bags full—going down that staircase would take them into the street by a way that they would not pass me—I came out, and went up to Green—the list was on the table at the time—I asked him who those parties were, and whether he had seen their cards—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what the number was—he said he did not recollect—I said, "Then show me where they have signed the list"—he turned it over three or four times, and could not find it out; and as the thing was so recent, I rubbed my hand over to see where the ink was wet, and there was not any—he did not give me any name—I could not find the name of Weedon on the list—I then gave Green, Johnson, and Redman into custody—I was afterwards shown a bag of tea by Davis—when I saw Harman in custody of Davis I asked him if he had any card—he said he had not—I after that saw Neale in custody—I have examined the loose tea in the bag—it is congou, and such as we have is the warehouse, and not sample—this (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) is the largest measure by which they sample—I sent for Johnson, Redman, and Green, to be brought down to the place where Harman and Neale were—I desired Johnson to look round the room, and see if he recognised anybody, with the exception of females, that he had seen at the warehouse—(Harman and Neale were close by at the time)—Johnson said, "Do you, Sir?"—I repeated the question, and re<lb></lb>ceived the same answer—I repeated it the third time, and his answer was, "I say, do you, Sir?"—I put the same question to Redman and Green, while Harman and Neale were close to them—they said they did not know them—in the course of the business which Redman had to perform in numbering the chests, he had no business at the table where the samples were—nothing could call him there—his duty would not call him at all to communicate with Harman or Neale; but he came up to the table while they were sitting there, before they got up to quit the room—I saw Johnson in the act of tearing up a piece of paper at the time I gave him into custody—I took it from him, and have it here; and here are three pieces of paper that were picked up at Redman's feet when he was searched by the officer.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is access to that room from one staircase, where the prisoners are supposed to have entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that staircase is about the centre of the two ways from Fenchurch-street and Crutched-friars—there are two other modes of coming down from that room, but the other two entrances were locked—they might go from the second to the first floor, but if they went further it would lead them to a door that was locked—there was but one entrance to the tea show—two doors were locked and one was open—the staircase that Harman and Neale went down led them to the floor below—there was one staircase for them to go upaod the same to go down—they had no right on any other floor—there are boards up to direct persons which way to go—the staircase down which Harman and Neale went, is a direct communication to the room below—I did not tell Johnson to send persons down that other staircase.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Johnson. Q.</hi> On that day you and Mr. Hatch came, I told you great inconvenience had arisen from persons going down that staircase, and you told me to direct them along the first floor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told you no such thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not going along the first floor be a more ready mode of proceeding, than going down the first staircase? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not—I do not consider it would make any difference—they would haw to go down one staircase to the first floor, but if they went along the second floor they would go direct down at once—there is sampling on the first floor sometimes, but not at the end of the building.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had any of the prisoners any business to transact on the first floor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—the sample room is on the second floor—that was the room to which the public had access—if they had gone along the length of the sample room, they would have gone out straightway—I should say there was no necessity for their going along the first floor.</p>

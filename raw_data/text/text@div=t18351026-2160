                  </hi>. My husband is a carman, and lives in Manchester<lb></lb>mews, St. Marylebone. On Saturday, the 19th of September, I placed four sovereigns in a purse, and put it in a box in my room—the box was unlocked—nobody lived with us—it is the stable—my husband lived there with me—on the Sunday evening I left the house from half-past six o'clock to a quarter to seven o'clock, to go to church—it was then light—I locked the room door—my husband went out before me—I put the key in a loft, where I always place it—I shut the loft door—the room window was a little way open—there is a door which goes into the mews from the loft—I remember shutting that—a small person might get in at the win<lb></lb>dow—I cannot be positive that I bolted the loft door, but I shut it—I re<lb></lb>turned at about nine o'clock—my husband unlocked the stable door—I per<lb></lb>ceived the loft door a little way open—the room door came open before I turned the key, so that it had been opened—I went into the room and found two pieces of white paper on the table, which had been in my tea<lb></lb>chest—I went to my box, the purse and money were gone—my husband had come home with me from church—I found the safe door open, and missed a pudding out of a dish.</p>

On Sunday night the 20th of September, he came to my house at about half-past eight o'clock, and said, "Will you come with me?"—we went to the top of North-street, and he pulled out a sovereign, and then he called me to give me a piece of pudding—when he shewed me the sovereign he said, "Will you come and change it?"—he said, "We will go to the cook's shop in Holborn, and buy some<lb></lb>thing—he went into the cook's shop, and bought a knuckle of ham, some beef, and potatoes, and changed the sovereign there—we then went into a coffee-shop in Union-street—I asked him where he got the money form—he said, "Never mind that, come with me"—we eat the beef and ham with carrots and potatoes in the coffee-shop, and then I went home—next morning, the 21st of September, he called me at about six o'clock, and I went to Billingsgate with him—we had some coffee, at a coffee-shop there with the change of the sovereign, and then we went to the Thames<lb></lb>tunnel, but did not go into it—he then said, "We will go to the Surrey Theatre," and in crossing the bridge he pulled out a purse, took out two sovereigns, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the purse over Westminster-bridge, with a stone in it—it was a brown purse with a little ring, and thick ring.</p>

On Saturday the 1st of May I went to the prisoner's lodgings; the prisoner was not present at the first search. I afterwards told him what I had found, type and paper belonging to me. He made no reply respecting the types; the paper he said he considered as a perquisite.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow any such perqisite - A. No, it is not our custom to allow taking any paper.</p>

            . I am a police officer. On the 1st of May I was sent by Mr. Blanshard to take the prisoner into custody. In his apartment I found three or four hundred weight of type, and about a coach load of paper, printed and unprinted. I brought the paper to the office, and shewed it to the prisoner. He said he took them at a sheet at a time; he considered them as perquisites.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheets are there - A. As many as would fill a coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanahard. This is part of the paper I took from the prisoner's apartment. These are books which are printed by our society for the use of the society, which nobody does but ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. How many reams of paper are there - A. About ten or twelve reams.</p>
               <p>MR. FIGGENS. I have examined the type; I cast it for that printing office. The type is what we call Three nick; the face is No. 4, English. I never cast No. 4 upon this body for any other than the Methodist society.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These types I bought at sales. I had a license to be a master printer in the year 1801.</p>

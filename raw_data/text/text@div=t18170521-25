I looked very hard at him, and felt my pocket and walked on. When I had got some distance, I looked back, and saw him about twenty yards off. I walked on about thirty yards, and thought no more of him. I put my hand to my pocket, and found my handkerchief gone. I looked round but could not see him - I ran back, and overtook him at Puddle-dock; he was then going the reverse way - I stopped him, and asked him why he took my handkerchief - He denied it. I found it inside his coat, under his arm - He said he picked it up. It was a dirty day, but the handkerchief was quite clean.</p>

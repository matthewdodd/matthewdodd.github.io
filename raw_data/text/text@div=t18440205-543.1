About twenty minutes past six o'clock I was on duty in St. John-street, and saw the prisoner, who I knew before, passing through Smithfield-market with a horse and cart at a smart trot—he came to nearly a walk with it—I ran, caught hold of the horse's head, and asked whose horse and cart he had there—he said his own—I said, "I don't believe it is"—he said, "Well, if it is not mine, it is a friend of mine's"—I said, "Where is your friend?"—he said, "At the Bull's Head, Smithfield"—I said, "I will go as far and see"—I went, and the Bull's Head was closed—I said, "I am convinced now your friend is not here"—on the way to the station, he said that previous to being at the Bull's Head with a friend, he had been at the Dark-house, Newgate-market; whilst there he treated his friend to a glass of brandy-and-water, and while drinking it the cart drove away—I showed the cart, horse, and harness to the prosecutor—he immedi<lb></lb>ately identified it.</p>

             sworn. - I am chamberlain at the Bell-savage: The prisoner came on Saturday the 30th of August, in company with a person that she said was her brother, and applied for two beds, stating, that they were going by the Salisubry coach the next day at four o'clock, they sat at the head of the stairs and had two pints of wine, which they paid for, and went to bad about eight o'clock, in separate rooms, they were to pay one shiling each bed; on Sunday morning, the 31st, about ten minutes past five, as I sat at the bottom of the stairs, the prisoner came down stairs, and delivered the key of her room into my hand, informing me to desire her brother, when he came down, which she supposed would be in an hour, to wait till she returned; her bundle appearing to be rather-large, I was suspicious there was more in it than she ought to have; I immediately went up stairs, and found two sheets, a pillow-case and a counterpane, missing; I went in pursuit of her as quick as possible; when I came to the end of the gate-way, I perceived her going up Ludgate-hill, near the Old-Bailey; I sent a man after her, desiring him to bring her back, and the man brought her back; she said, at first, she had not got them; she afterwards said she had them, and begged I would take the property and release her; I sent to St. Bride's watch-house but there was no constable attending; I took her to the Compter, and had her searched by the constable there; the counterpans was tied up in a black handkerchief, which she had under her cloak, the sheets were under her petticoats tied round her, and out of her bosom was taken the pillow-case; they are Mr. Gray's property, and the pillow-case is marked R S G.(

             was my servant, Mr. Blackborough sent two of his people with some locks, desiring me to look at them, they had been found in a house that he suspected for stolen goods, I knew them immediately to be mine, they were patent locks, and had my marks on them, I went to Mr. Blackborough, he asked me some questions which led me to suspect the warehouseman, he was a weekly servant, and we agreed that when he went home in the evening, he should be followed and his lodgings searched, they followed him, and in a short time they returned with him, and a considerable deal more property than had been taken that evening, in taxing him with it he was a good deal moved, and frankly confessed that he had robbed me of several things, then he equivocated by and by, and said he intended to pay me two guineas which he had borrowed the next morning before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Council for the Prisoner. I beg that Mr. Oldham may be stopped as to any thing that the other prisoner said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oldham. After these people were taken up, the prisoner Jones came and appeared to be very busy in getting these people off.</p>
               <p>Are these part of the locks of which Lennard was convicted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- ISAACS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, I produce these locks, they were produced on the trial of Lennard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood to Prosecutor. You sell vast numbers of these locks? - Yes Sir, I do, but I have the numbers down of all of them.</p>
               <p>Did you know these were lost before Lennard was apprehended? - These locks were marked and put into a particular shew-glass for gentlemen to see, they have been stolen out of that shew-glass, and have never been sold, and they were hudled together with wrong keys.</p>
               <p>Mr. Isaacs. On the 21st of October a person came to Mr. Blackborough's office for a search warrant to go to see for some property that had been stole from him, I went where I was directed to Mr. Dunn's in Turn-mill-street, I found nothing there that I went after, but on looking in a closet,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100131"></xptr> concealed, I saw a quantity of these locks, I asked Mrs. Dunn whose they were.</p>

             for Prosecution. He must tell his story.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I will apply to the Court whether this man is to tell us what Mrs. Dunn and Mrs. Brett said.</p>
               <p>Court, No, Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. When Jones was present what did they say? - Mrs. Brett declared she had the property of Jones, and Jones has repeatedly at my house, offered Redgrave and me five guineas a piece not to say any thing about it, and that we might do what we would with the locks.</p>
               <p>Where does Jones live? - In <placeName id="t17831210-105-crimeloc546">Fleet-lane</placeName>

               <p>You knew him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had no information on the subject of these locks? - No.</p>
               <p>Your information was against Mrs. Dunn or her house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In which house Jones did not live? - No.</p>
               <p>In which house he had no shop? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>And in which house Jones did not carry on any business? - That I do not know, he might.</p>
               <p>You and I have very different accounts of this offer? - Very likely.</p>
               <p>Where did this happen? - At my house, he was a prisoner then.</p>
               <p>In what way do you mean? - He was taken for receiving these things by Mrs. Brett's declaring she had these things from him.</p>
               <p>Was this an offer to suppress the evidence against Jones, or an offer of commiseration to Mrs. Brett? - It was to suppress the evidence against Jones, he offered to give Redgrave and me five guineas apiece not to say any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg Mrs. Dunn and Mrs. Brett may go out of Court? - Court. It is too late now.</p>
               <p>Will you swear this man was in custody at that time? - Yes, it was after he was committed.</p>
               <p>Did not he say he would rather give five guineas? - There was no saying rather five guineas at all about the matter, he positively declared he would give five guineas apiece, if we would say nothing about him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was there at that time any intention of prosecuting Jones? - Yes, he was then committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oldham. I had then taken a warrant out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Isaacs. When was it? - The 22d of October, I believe it was three days after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. The offer was after he was in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not you know that Jones himself went to Mr. Blackborough's, and was there discharged? - That was on the night of the 21st.</p>
               <p>He went voluntarily to the Justice's? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>You did not take him there? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor any body else to your knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he went voluntarily? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What do you believe? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>When did you apprehend him; on the 22d, 23d, or 24th? - I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Come think a little, we must have it; did he come to your house, or did he nor, Sir? - I believe he came to the office, but he was taken at home at his own house.</p>
               <p>That is the question that I asked you just now, and you could not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What was that about handkerchiefs?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will your Lordship hear that.</p>
               <p>Court. We have nothing to do with that.</p>

When Jones was before the magistrate, who did she say she had them from? - From Jones; Jones came the same night, and denied she had them of him, he came the next morning to Mr. Isaacs, he said he would make an acknowledgment provided we would stifle the matter; he said all these things should be delivered up provided the matter was settled, and no prosecution had.</p>

               <p>Jones came to that house, I suppose, as a friend to Mrs. Brett? - I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Then he wished to serve the woman who was in custody, he himself being at large. - I cannot say whether he wished to serve her or himself; he was at large, he came to the magistrate's and denied knowing any thing of the things.</p>

               <p>Do you know from your own knowledge who she had them from? - No.</p>
               <p>How came they to be brought to your house? - Mrs. Brett told me she was going in the country, and asked me to be her leave them there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Pray Mrs. Dunn what may you be? - What am I?</p>
               <p>Aye, what are you? - My husband is a bricklayer, I keep an iron shop.</p>
               <p>The same way of business as the prisoner? - I keep a bit of an iron shop.</p>
               <p>Your's is only a bit of one; who is Mrs. Brett? - Who is she, Sir, she is a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Does she carry on any business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A bit of an iron shop too, perhaps; well, the officers came to your house about some other business. They found nothing but these things that belonged to she.</p>
               <p>What were they brought to your house for? - Till she came out of the country.</p>
               <p>Was you to do nothing with them in the mean time? - Nothing Sir, she thought her house was not safe enough, for the lock she had on her door was not a good one, and any body could get in, and she was afraid of being robbed.</p>
               <p>Did she bring all all her property? - That, and a great deal more.</p>
               <p>Did those officers take the rest of her things? - Yes, they took them all.</p>
               <p>This was not old iron that wanted such safe custody, may be there was a little plate? - No, no plate.</p>
               <p>A little linen? - I suppose that gentleman knows what there was.</p>
               <p>We would rather have it from you, what there was that belonged to Mrs. Brett? - I cannot tell you what they were, I did not examine, and they had nothing belonging to me.</p>
               <p>These people took you away I believe? - I was obliged to go to say how I came by them.</p>
               <p>I suppose you mean just what I said, that they took you away? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Had not they a warrant against you? - That I do not know.</p>

I have known the prisoner four or five years—I met him, on the 12th of February, at a few minutes after two o'clock, close* to Angel-lane, Ham<lb></lb>mersmith—he beckoned me, and asked if I could lend him a shilling, as he wanted it particularly—I said I had no objection to lend him a shil<lb></lb>ling if I had some security—he had this tea-pot in his hand, and I had it to hold till the next day—the next morning I heard he was taken, and I went to his residence, and found the officer there—I stated this, and gave up the tea-pot.</p>

I had got the gout and could not run very well, but I cried out stop thief, and some People stopped her: when I came up to her I took hold of her by the arm, she said, you will hurt me, take hold of my collar, said I, You have nothing to take hold of there, and I said, Child, I will not hurt you, but I am resolved to prosecute you, then she cried and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman wanted to pick me up and would have given me a shilling and I refused it; but he still came after me, and because I would not do as he would have had me, he charged me with stealing his handkerchief. <rs id="t17440912-38-verdict202" type="verdictDescription">

I said, it is no matter, where is the bundle? a gentleman went in search of the bundle, and brought it; I do not know who it was; I kept sight of the man, though he out-run me, for I had a bundle; I did not see him drop the bundle; I am sure he never was out of my sight, but he run too swift for me; there was no other person in the street till he was taken; the gentleman who brought the bundle did not say where he found it.</p>

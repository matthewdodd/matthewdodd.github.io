               <p>GEORGE CROSBY. I work for an army-accoutrement maker, at Westminster. On the 20th of July I agreed to sell the prisoner an old coat for 7s. - he gave me 3s. as earnest; I knew him before by sight; he did not pay for it for two or three days. I asked him when he meant to fetch it away? He called at my lodgings a few days after, gave me a 1l. bank note, and told me to take the price of my coat out of it; he asked me to get it changed. I went to a publican, whom I knew, he said it was forged. I took it back to the prisoner, who remained at my lodgings. I called him at the door, but he did not come down; I went up, gave the note to him, and said, "How came you to send me with a bad note?" He said he did not know that it was bad, having just taken it of a Jew, and that a person was present who saw him take it. An officer came in, and took the note out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the officer that you knew there was an officer following you - A. I said I thought so, and called the prisoner to the door to give him the note before the officer - He followed me from the public-house.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 20th of July, I was at a public-house, in Tothil-street, Westminster; Crosby came and offered a note in payment for a glass of gin. Jones returned it to him, he went out with it - I and Betts followed him to his house, in New Pye-street - Betts was before me. I saw Betts take the note out of the prisoner's hand; we both marked it, this is it (looking at it).</p>

            . I was with Silvester. When Crosby got to the door he called somebody, no person came. He went up, I followed, and heard him say it was a bad one; I found the prisoner in the room, and took the note out of his hand. I took both of them into custody. I went to No. 10, St. George's-place, St. George's-row, Chelsea; but could find nobody of the name of Smith there.</p>

Last Saturday morning I went out over the way for a halfpenny worth of brick-dust. I pulled the street-door too, but the spring lock did not catch. I was not a minute when I got on the step of the door where I was going. I looked back and saw a man go in at our door, I run back as fast as I could, as the rest of the servants were below. I met the prisoner coming out on the second step of the door; he was putting something in his right hand pocket: I followed him, and said, You impudent man, what have you been in my Mistress's house for? He changed pale, and ran. I run after him as fast as I could, and called, Stop that man! He was taken in Ormond-yard. I told the mob to bring him to our house, and ran back to shut the door. They brought him, and the snuffers and stand also. I know they were in the parlour when I went out.</p>

On Friday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 15th of March, within five minutes of six o'clock, I received information of the state of the premises—I found them as described by the porter—I examined the store-room and missed the articles stated—the small window leading to the porter's lodge was taken off and slid back, and by means of a crow-bar or chisel the beading had been forced out—this crow-bar was lying by—a padlock was forced off the small wicket door and was lying on the ground—in the middle of the same day I was at the White Horse public-house on Great Saffron-hill—the prisoner Lill was there, and I believe Baxter, but I am not certain—there were two bundles on the table—they had two women in their company—I gave Lill in charge—on their bundles being examined, they contained loose tea and sugar and several pieces of cheese—on my giving Lill in charge he threw off his coat and put himself in an attitude for fighting—he was not sober; he was strongly under the influence of drink—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles</hi>)—I should not like to swear to them; they appear to be the same, in all respects, as what were lost—Lill had been an inmate of the workhouse for some months, and Baxter also for some time, but he had left some time—Lill had left on the 11th of March, at his own request—this pair of trowsers—(<hi rend="italic">looting at a pair</hi>)—are the same kind and description as we lost—there is no mark on them, but the contractor's mark of the size.</p>

I told I would not advise him, he must use his own discretion, and he said no more about it—I took Brown into custody the same day, at his house in Laystall-street—he keeps a marine store shop there—I found the pair of trowsers, which have been produced, in a box in the first floor front room—I asked him where he got them; he said he bought the duplicate of a man he did not know, and took them out of pledge at a shop at the top of Eyre-street-hill—there is a pawnbroker's there; this was on Sunday, the 17th, as the robbery was on the 14th—I produce a waistcoat which I received from a person named Parr on the same night, before I went to apprehend Brown—I watched Parr into Brown's house, with Baxter—they came out together—I saw Baxter go into Gray's Inn-lane, where I took him, and Parr afterwards gave me the waistcoat.</p>

               <p>I am an hostler, I was going by, and I saw the prisoner come out of this man's parlour window, between the hours of twelve and one in the morning, I went to him and laid hold of him with my right hand, and asked him what business he had there? immediately I called out for assistance, and the prosecutor came out of his bed; and the skirt of the prisoner's coat catched hold of the window somehow, and he could not get off; he had the prosecutor's coat under his own coat, we took it from him, and I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

I told him what was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150076"></xptr>that to him, and he called Mr. Young, and told him I had come out of a window, and they took me to the watch-house.</p>

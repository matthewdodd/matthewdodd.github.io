            . on the 6th of July, at the Three Compasses in Little Wild-Street. On the 20th of October last Mr. Tew came in at the Three Compasses; he asked me if I knew a watch-maker that wore his own hair tied behind. Mrs. Harrison said, do you not know his name? He said he did not; nor did he say what he wanted him for; then he went out. Soon after he returned again, and asked for one Baynham. We said he was not there; then he went out again. He came several times that day (that Baynham with his hair tied behind is my first cousin) Mrs. Harrison said, that man, meaning Tew, came about a rape; which she heard was mentioned at justice Cox's to have been committed at her house. I then went down to Brook's-Market to my cousin, and told him that a lawyer had came about a rape said to have been committed at the Compasses, and that it had been talk'd of at justice Cox's, and the lawyer inquired for him; he said he knew nothing of it, and that they could do nothing to him; he then came with me to the Three Compasses, and had some oisters and beer. Then Mr. Tew came in again, and said is Mr. Baynham here? yes, says I, my name is Baynham, what do you want with me? says he, you are not the person I want; he then said if I would stay a little while, he would soon put an end to it, to clear me, and save himself the trouble of coming again. Accordingly I staid: I think, but am not certain, that Raminger came with Tew; he went out, I think, and return'd; I know he brought

She pointed to me directly; after that, Raminger said I'll go and fetch the other girl; no, no, said I, you shall not go by yourself, let some body go with you; then one Watkins, a friend of mine, went with him (I can't find him now, or I would have had him here.)

Then said they let her sit down; she did, next to Broadbent, and did not speak for a great while, only looked upon one and another. (There were a great many people in the house.) I saw Hannet stoop down to buckle her shoe, and I heard words pass between her and Broadbent; she would not mention any body then, but got up on her feet; we all got out of the box, and I stood by the fire. She went to Raminger, by the cellar stairs, and there were some words past; said he, is that the man, pointion to one and another; is that the man with a pot in his hand (one had a pot in his hand) I observed Raminger and Tew were together by the cellar stairs when Hannet pointed to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing?</p>
               <p>Baynham. They seem'd to be whispering together. I don't know what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the pot in his hand?</p>
               <p>Baynham. That I believe was my cousin. At last she came and touch'd me; then Raminger collar'd me directly, and said her was a constable, and left me in Mr. Tew's care, till such time as he got a warrant. When he came back with the warrant, he collar'd me, and took me to St. Martin's Round-house, where I lay all night, and from thence to justice Cox's; after which I took my trial here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was Hannet in the room before she fix'd upon you?</p>
               <p>Baynham. I believe 25 minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ravish either of the girls?</p>
               <p>Baynham. No. I never saw either of them in my life before, to my knowledge.</p>

That Broadbent did not examine the other people at all, but directly pointed to him, which he believed was with directions, Mr. Tew having hold of her under each arm at the time; but did not see Mr. Tew give her any directions. That when Hannet came in, he push'd him into a box, and sat down by him. That if he had spoke when Broadbent and Hannet were whispering, Hannet would have thought Broadbent had fixed upon him; and as it would have been a direction to her, was the cause why he did not attempt to hinder it. That it was Mr. Raminger that said, let her sit down and rest herself. That there were five or six people in the room.</p>

            . I went to live servant with the prisoner the Tuesday before Whitsuntide last; and staid there something above five months. I had given warning to go away, but could not get my wages; he used me but indifferently towards the latter part of my time, for he turned me out of his house at twelve o'clock at night, two days before my month's warning was up. He said the girls had told him I had rob'd him. I wonder'd what there was that I could rob him of, he having but very little. I desired he would lock me up in any room in his house, and not turn me out at that time of night; he then repeated my robbing of him, and said he had promised the girls I should go out that night. I said I had no money; then he gave me a shilling, and I went up to the Round-house. In the morning I went to him again for my wages; then he said there was a rape committed, and began to accuse me with he knew not what, and kept me a prisoner in his own house, without a warrant. He then took out a warrant, and carried me before justice Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. What was due to you for wages?</p>
               <p>S. Clifton. Almost 3 l. I had had a shilling at a time two or three times. When I came before the justice there was a robbery laid to my charge. I was carried to St. Martin's Round-house that night. The next day he charged me with the robbery and two rapes on Broadbent and Hannet; they were both there. I said to them, I have been as good as a mother to you, consider what you are going to do; the girls said they had been out with me, the same as they swore on the trial afterwards. I was then sent to Pridewell. At that time I had never seen

             in my life; the first time I saw him was in Newgate; where Mr. Tew came to see me, and sent for me down. I said, Sir, I don't know you; he said no, I suppose not; he ask'd me to drink a glass, and said he came from Wiesenthall. I said what will you please to have with me? He then said here is a rape committed, and as you certainly are concern'd, you must find the man; said I, you may be the man for what I know, for I never knew a man that did such a thing. He said it should be the worse for me, if I did not tell who the man was. I said, if there is never a man found till I find one, you will never have the man. Then I went up stairs aga in to my apartment; and soon after a soldier (named Jones) a country-man of mine, came with a full-pot of beer, to see me; then came Mr. Tew and took him up for the man that ravish'd the girls. This was all the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in Newgate then?</p>
               <p>S. Clifton. I believe I had been there about nine days. I never was out of St. Clement's-Lane, where I lived, on the 6th of July; it was Sunday, and I was ironing all that day. I remember I had a pewter dish and six plates, which we had borrowed at the White-Hart, in the lane, and I carried it home that day, and was there when the two girls came with a great nosegay, between eight and nine o'clock. I had been at Mrs. Harrison's about three times during the time I lived with the prisoner; she and I were old acquaintance in the country, and she had been at the prisoner's house, and gave the girls some money to be good, and mind their business. Broadbent once went with me to her house to borrow some china; but I never was up stairs, or knew where the stair-case was, in my life. When I went home with the girls that Sunday night from the White-Hart, my master was sitting with his right leg across his left, at the end of the table; he asked Broadbent and Hannet how they came to stay so long; they said they had brought him a nosegay, and were tired. I cut them their supper, and they went to bed; he had nine apprentices, and these were two of them. I had one of the apprentices with me, named Ann Forbes, and my master's daughter, when the others called on me coming home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with your master before he suspected himself to be rob'd ?</p>
               <p>S. Clifton. Yes, a great many. One was, he was poor, and wanting an usurer, he sent me out to see for one. When I returned, there were two or three Germans (his countrymen) in the kitchen; they had been playing with the girls, and had dirtied the kitchen. I said, no such things should be while I was there. My master the next morning ask'd me whether I was master, or he. My master had sent me to South-Audley-Street, to inquire after one Brailey, a woman whose character I found to be very bad; and he set me to watch if such a woman came about his house at nights. I once saw an old woman, and looked out of the window, but she was not so tall as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280026"></xptr> her in South-Audley-Street. He sent me to Mr. Williams, at Mr. Cox's, to desire he would be so good as to come up and examine the girls, saying, he fear'd they were naughty girls; he bid me tell him he would not be against making him a present of a pair of ruffles. These I took to be all shams, for he had hardly any thing to be rob'd of; I went to Mr. Williams, and he seemed not to be willing to come. I said to him, I wished I was out from amongst them; he said then, why don't you go away? I said, because he owes me wages; he then said, why don't you arrest him?</p>
               <p>Q. What is a pair of Dresden ruffles worth?</p>
               <p>S. Clifton. I don't know; I sold a pair once for a woman for 14 s. Mr. Williams and another gentleman did come; at that time there was not a charge laid against me for a rape or robbery either. Mr. Williams examined the girls; and the next day it was that I was turned out of the house, and carried before justice Cox; where the two girls charged me with a rape, the same which they did in court; there I was call'd old b - ch and old b - wd, I don't know that any body missed calling me somewhat; the justice said I was a bad woman, and I was not permitted to speak for myself. When I was at the justice's, my master was there, who said he was a piece of a doctor himself, and insisted upon going up to examine the girls, and he and a woman went up. Mr. Williams said, when I was going to bridewell, it was hard for a woman to go there without money in her pocket; and my master gave me four or five shillings. Mr. Tew was there. Then Mr. Cox did insist upon my having my wages, but he never paid me till I got an order from the court; for he never intended to have paid me till after I was hang'd, I suppose. My master once had some friends on board a ship, and he and his sister went there to see them. The next morning I sent Broadbent to her master's door for a candle; she came running back again, and said, my master hath got a woman in bed with him. Then I went in, and found it was his sister, and her cloaths were lying by.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever observe any familiarity between your master and any of the girls?</p>
               <p>S. Clifton. No, I did not.</p>

He then ask'd me if I was a lawyer, I said yes; he said to the man that keeps the taphouse, I order you to keep this man, I will swear that is the man that was concern'd with Mrs. Clifton. I was detain'd there about three hours and a half, in the taphouse. He returned in about two hours, and brought a constable to take me to the Compter. Then Clifton's master (as they told me) and a little girl came; the little girl said she never saw me in her life. Then I ask'd the master if he ever saw me before; he said no. Then I was let go about my business.</p>

Soon after, as we were going down to dinner, I took them all into our bed room, and made it known to every one of them; there were nine of us. They would hardly believe it; so as we were going by the door I took two of them in, and shew'd them the bed, where master had serv'd me so. They all came in, I believe one after another. After this, master proposed to me to swear it against Clifton and another. This was on a Friday. I remember, that afternoon Mr. Williams (who is Mr. Cox's clerk) was sent for. When I came into the parlour, he ask'd me who was the man that had lain with me, for master had been and told the justice two of the girls had been lain with, and that there was also a robbery committed, and somebody had lain with me, but he could not find the man out. He had bid me say so too; I was very much afraid of him, and dared not do but as he bid me. We went the next day to Mr. Cox's, and he wanted me to swear a robbery against Clifton. After this, when we were to go about the rape, he bid me stick close to it and not say he had lain with me, but it was a tall pock-frecken man. He did not mention his hair then. I ask'd him if I must swear. He said, yes.</p>

I went into one room and Broadbent into the other. At that time we agreed upon the room where there was a bed. We had seen the curtains.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body advise you to six upon that room?</p>

               <p>R. Hannet. I do not know that they were. We went after this to the Three-Compasses. Soon after Raminger had been for Broadbent, he came for me; there was a little man with him.</p>

I sat a good while before I did. I believe he saw her pull my sleeve, because he spake about it at justice Cox's, and Mr. Raminger said it was no such thing. Mr. Raminger ask'd me if the man was in company. At first I was afraid to speak, and did not for a good while; at last I fix'd upon Baynham.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you sure that was the same man you should fix upon?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. Because I saw him go out of the box, and go to the fire-side; after that we went to justice Cox's, but he was a bed. So we went the next day, when my master bid me stick close to it. I believe Raminger had told him what had happen'd at the Three Compasses; they used to talk German together, and my master laughed that night, and told his sister I had pitch'd upon a pick-house taylor. I had a good mind once before the justice to tell the truth, when Baynham down'd on his knees, and said you know I am not the man that lay with you; but master look'd hard at me, and

             pull'd me by the sleeve. The justice took us up stairs, and said he would do all he could, to see whether we would own it, because the man said he was innocent; he ask'd us if we were sure he was the man; we both said yes. I was at one end of the room, when he examined her at the other. We stood to it. After this my master kept us very close, he did not let us go out of his house, but when he was with us, till we came to the Old-Bailey; he told me I should go before a heap of gentlemen at the Old Bailey, and I must swear there what I had sworn before justice Cox, and at Hick's-Hall, where I swore that Baynham had committed a rape upon us, and Clinton had hold of our legs; my master ask'd me when I came out what I said, and what I swore, which was the same as that at the Old-Bailey. That morning, before we came out, he took Broadbent and me into our room, where we all lay; he first examined her, and she came even; he then examined me, but I did not come even; then he huffed us sadly, and we were afraid we were going to be kill'd; he then said for God's sake don't lay any thing to my charge, for if you do, it will bring me into trouble; and as we were walking along, he bid me not to hammer, stammer, but speak the truth, for else they would be clear'd, and we should suffer; this was as we were coming out of the Baptist-Head, near the Old-Bailey gate, just as a man had came and said our trial was coming on.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by the truth?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. That was, what we had said already; and when I came here, I swore the same I did at Hick's-Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any remorse of conscience while the two prisoners were upon their trial for their lives ?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. I was sadly affrighted. I thought to myself I would say what was the truth. Broadbent and I quarrel'd sadly. I wanted her to own the truth at the Baptist-Head; she said her master would kill her if she did. I said it was better for her to be kill'd than to take two innocent lives away, I'll not take their lives away; she said you had better do it, no body will know any thing of the matter. There was a midwife near us, she that search'd us along with my master at justice Cox's, who said, what is that you will not take away?

               <p>R. Hannet. They said they could not understand me, but they did.</p>

               <p>R. Hannet. It was not false about my going for the flowers, and going in at the alehouse in Clement's-Lane and having strong beer, but it was false when I said I had some gin, and that Mrs. Clifton assisted

               <p>R. Hannet. Not till two or three days after I had been first at justice Cox's; then it was given out that somebody had lain with me; and he bid me lay it to a pock-frecken'd tall man, and not upon him. Mr. Tew took Broadbent, and Mr. Raminger took me to the Three Compasses, first to six upon the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Had any body bid you and Broadbent six upon one of the two rooms at the Three Compasses ?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. Master bid us say we were lain with up stairs, in a room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did justice Cox desire you by all means to speak the truth?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. He did, over and over, and said if I swore false, I should go to the Devil.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Which was you most afraid of, your master or the Devil?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. I fear'd my master most.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Harrison. There was a piece of evidence came out from this witness unexpectedly; do you remember this girl coming to your house with Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger, before they were brought to find out the man that ravish'd them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harrison. The first time Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger came by themselves, and told me that two girls had sworn a rape to have been committed at our house, in a room where was green furniture, and that Clifton brought them there. I said, if you bring the girls, they will find themselves mistaken in the house. So they did bring the girls a day or two after, and went up stairs into the room; but my curtains are blue. This I believe to be two or three days before they came and fix'd upon Baynham. I went to justice Cox's when Baynham was taken up. The girls there said, I was the person that brought the pot of beer up. The justice asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280030"></xptr> if I could recollect where I was; then I said I was at a Chrillening that day, and I got a certificate of the child's being christen'd at that time.</p>

            . We said we were very dry, and call'd for a pint of beer; we drank it, and went home together. This house was not above five or six doors from my master's house, but on the other side of the way. When we got home my master ask'd us what made us be so late. We said we staid a little later than ordinary because it rain'd; I told him we were just come from Putney.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel betwixt Clifton and your master at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I can't tell whether it was that week, or the week before that they quarrel'd; my master had been rude. I went one morning into the parlour where my master lay; there was his sister in the bed by him; I told Clifton of it, and she gave warning, and said she would not stay; then my master did not like her, and said he would do her an injury some time or another; and said he had rather see the Devil than see her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever hear him say so?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I don't know whether she did, but I heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. How had your master behaved to you before this time?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He behaved pretty well before then; but when Clifton gave warning, he persuaded us to it. Clifton said she could not bear to be in the house, because there was such rudeness done in it?</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had been at Putney did you hear of Clifton's taking away goods?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was about a week after; he said that was to turn her away. We were to say that she made us steal things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you particularly mention'd as one of the persons that was to charge Clifton ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. Master desired me to steal them, and lay it on Clifton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, according to what your master desired, hide or take away any of these things ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. At first he took and bid some of the things himself, behind a barrel in the beer-cellar, which was a napkin; and Hannet found it. We did not see him put it there, we only imagined he put it there himself. Neither of us had taken a pin's point from him, and I believe Clifton never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it that she was turn'd out of doors?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I believe it was on a Tuesday. She return'd the next day for her wages, and what things she had left, when he accused her of stealing his things, and making us steal his things to ruin him, and said she should be taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any thing of a rape then ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I don't know that he talk'd any thing of a rape then; he took her up, and she was carried before justice Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time after she was turn'd out of doors, that you heard of a rape being committed upon you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. Master took me down out of the shop, and ask'd me if ever any body lay with me. I told him no.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. This was a day or two after Clifton was turn'd out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason why he suspected any man might have lain with you ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He ask'd me first; he said if there has not, then you shall lie with me to night. I said, I never was in any man's company in my life. That was to be the rape; and he would lay it to Clifton and a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention at that time the man he intended to accuse?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He said, I'll take up Clifton for it, and a man named Baynham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Baynham at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, I did not. I had never seen him with my eyes, or heard of him till master mentioned him. Then he said he'd call Rachel down, after he had done with me, and make her do the same; he put his hands down my bosom: this was in the morning. I was sent up stairs, and I believe he did call Rachel down; she went down I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass that day about his intention to charge Baynham and Clifton ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He said he would do so, and swore to it. He ask'd me if I knew any house thereabouts. I said no, except Mr. Harrison's; then said he, that is the house, if you know no other; he said some more words, which I have forgot now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he talk with Hannet that day?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280031"></xptr>E. Broadbent. No, not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he oblige you to go to bed with him that night?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, Rachel was lain with first, and I remember afterwards she came up crying with a penny in her hand. I ask'd her what was the matter. She said, I'll tell you by and bye, and told us she was ruin'd for ever. Presently after my mistress went down, and she told us every thing. The night after this, because I would not lie with him, he threaten'd that I should go to Newgate for stealing things. I kneel'd down and cry'd, and said I hoped he would forgive me for what I had done. He sent his sisters and Rachel to bed after supper, about nine or ten o'clock, then took me in his lap, and said he would make me go to bed with him, and kissed me. Then he fetch'd a bed down into the two pair of stairs room, and said to the girls that lay with me, you shall not lie with her any longer, for you will make her as wicked as yourselves. He made me undress myself, and then tied a handkerchief about my mouth. I said, pray Sir don't, for you'll ruin me for ever. He said I shall not hurt you, I will do you no harm.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you call out?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He had lock'd the door, there were three of them; this was in his own chamber. After this he took me under my arms, push'd me into bed, and lay with me most part of the night. Then he got the other bed out it is a German bed, one over another; and laid it in the fore room, where I lay till mistress came and call'd me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this was it that he began to talk with you about the rape?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He talk'd to me about it every day, and bid me not to forget a word, and be sure not to backen it; and he told me once that two lawyers, Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger, were gone to seek after this man, that they were gone to the Three-Compasses in Little-Wild-Street, and if they came for me, I was to say the man was in the tap-room; and if there was a tall man named Baynham there, wearing his own hair and a blue coat, I was to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say John or

                  </persName>
            ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, he did not say either; he told me very often to say that he was a tall thin man, pitted with the small-pox, and I must say he had his own hair on when he ravish'd me. Raminger and Tew return'd, and said they believ'd they had found him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you to go and shew them the house that the rape was supposed to be committed in?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. Yes, I did, on a Monday. He had told me any home that I knew, and I said, I knew none but the Compasses. Then he said six upon that. I shewed them the house. Hannet was not with me then.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you shew'd Raminger and Tew the Compasses, did Hannet come there ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, not the first time. I shewed them the house, the entry and stairs, as I stood at the step of the door. Hannet went with me and them the second time, when I went into the fore room above stairs, and Hannet into the back room. Mrs. Harrison open'd the back room door with a key, where we saw the bed. We said that was the room, that there were green curtains to the bed and window, and that the bed was removed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in that room before then?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, never in my life. After that, I was brought by Mr. Raminger to that house, in order to fix upon somebody. I believe this was a night or two after.</p>
               <p>Q. What instructions did your master give you, or did he give you any, in order to fix upon the man?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. That day he had been out, I know not where. When he came home he call'd me into his room, and said, you are going I believe to the Three-Compasses, to take up the man that did the rape.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the word rape?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He said, that say with me. Said he, there is a man in a blue coat, a tall man, named Baynham, pitted with the small-pox; you are to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go thither, in order to fix upon the man?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was after we had left work, at 9 o'clock. When Raminger brought me in, Tew was sitting or standing by a man. I look'd round, and saw there was never a man there but he that was tail and thin, and I took him for the same man that master gave a description of.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself, when you had fix 'd upon him?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He ask'd me if ever I saw him in my life, and whether he ever lay with me. I said yes, he was the man. There were a great many people in the tap-house at the time; but I had never seen Baynham before in my life. When

             came, she look'd affrighted, trembled, and stared about. I believe Mr. Raminger brought her in. Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger were going to take me out of the tap-room, but Baynham and all the company said, it was not fair to take the girls out. Mr. Tew was going to speak to me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280032"></xptr> stoop'd down, when they all said, let the man have fair play.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you, when he was going to speak to you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I was just at the tap room door. Hannet was desired to look about, and see if she knew the man. She look'd very hard about her, and came into the box where I was; and then attempted to buckle her shoe. I was by her, and gave her a pull by the sleeve of her gown, pointing with my other hand under the table to the man who sat in the box by the fire side.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she see you point?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I can't tell that. It was a great while before she fix'd upon Baynham. She was frighted, and ran backwards and forwards; the tears were in her eyes, and they asked what was the matter. Mr. Raminger I believe was by me, and Mr. Tew and she were by the bar, when sh e fix'd upon the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you gave her the pull before she fix'd upon the man?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was about a quarter of an hour after. The people would not let her and I be together, saying it was not fair; but I kept looking at the man, and looking at her. She trembled every limb of her, and cry'd. After she fix'd upon him, he was taken into custody, and carried to the watch-house; we went before justice Cox the next day, where I said he was the man that ravish'd me. In the morning before we went before the justice, my master told me not to seem to be frighted, saying, if I cried it would shew me guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Guilty of what?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It would shew that he was not the man; and then they will ask you, said he, and you will confess he is not, so I shall be brought into trouble. After this he never let a day pass but he bid me keep to the truth, and that if I did not stick to it he would murder me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he call the truth?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. That was, what I had said before I must stick to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you, before you went to Hicks's hall to find the bill, what would become of this man?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He said he believed it would hang him, but said he you shall never want, I will take care of you. After that I went before the grand jury and was sworn, where I said the same that I did afterwards in this court, that one Baynham was the person who ravish'd me, and that

             stood at the feet of the bed and held my legs. He gave me directions to be sure to stick to it, and to say that Clifton put us on to ruin our master. He said, I have not money to pay her her wages, and if she is not hang'd for this I'll take care to transport or murder her. I remember I was at the Baptist head, near the Old-Bailey gate, before the trial came on, and that going from thence to come to this court he said, Mind, Betty, say nothing but the truth, stand to the truth; meaning, that which we had sworn to before. He said the same to Rachel, and told me at home he would mention this to me at the Baptist-head; he said, speak the truth, and consider what you are going to do, or else you will be hang'd, looking very down. That very morning he called me down stairs, and asked me whether I could say what he had taught me, and bid me tell it over. I tried, but could not say it right; then, said he, you will cast yourself and me too.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you fail in of your lesson ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I said the man had a red cap on, and I was to have said a white one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you mention'd here at the trial the same as he bid you say?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was. He said, if they ask you whether or no he had a wig on, say you saw him pull off no wig, but he put on a cap over his hair or wig; tho' I have now forgot some words he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which you swore here true or false?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was all false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Hannet say her conscience was very uneasy at coming to swear against two innocent persons?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. She did. As she was standing on the stone steps belonging to this court (the tears being in her eyes) she said, Bet, I am frighted within me for going to swear against these poor innocent persons. I said, Rachel, we can't help it, stand to it, stand to it, or else we shall be hang'd; this was before we gave our evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Hannet at any time tell you her master lay with her?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. She told me and the other girls of it the very day he lay with her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When Clifton left the house, how long was it before you went to justice Cox's?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was a day or two after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any thing of charging her with this rape before you went to the justice's?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280033"></xptr>E. Broadbent. My master told me of it, I can't tell whether he told Hannet or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what a rape was?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I ask'd him what he meant by lying with a man, and he said, if you don't know you shall lie with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him to explain the meaning of a rape ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, I did not; but he said that lying with and debauching a person that had never been lain with before, was a rape.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after Hannet had been lain with that he was concern'd with you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I believe it was the night after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the justice speak to first, Hannet or you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I believe it was me; he said, Are this man and woman innocent or guilty? This was the time when Baynham was taken up, not the first time I went to the justice in order to charge Clifton with thieving.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the rape to be introduced there, as it was not the charge you went to make?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I can't tell, I believe my master told that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know your master go to the Three Compasses?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been up stairs there before you went with Mr. Tew?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the situation of the house ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I went there once with Clifton, who said she had a friend lived there; she also went thither with me for some china.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you imagine you could punish your master, if he used you ill in lying with you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I did not think of that then.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason could he give for a white cap more than a red one?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I said it was a red cap, which he said was wrong, and that if I said so in court they would condemn him and me too.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger carried you out of the house, to go to the Three Compasses, what did they say to you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. They asked me if I could find out the house, and I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any mark being left on your linen, by your master's using you ill?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. Yes, there were marks. I was examined by a midwife, and by my master, who when we were going up stairs told Mr. Cox he was a surgeon, and asked leave to go up with us. The midwife said, if that is not the man that is below, speak, and tell the truth. I said I had. She said I had been pressed upon by a man, and said the same by

               <p>Mr. Ford. After the trial of Baynham and Clifton, the court suspecting there was a perjury, ordered these two girls to two separate compters; the morning after I had directions from many of the magistrates to do the best of my endeavours to find it out; to which purpose I sent for the keeper of Wood-street compter, and made use of a pious fraud in order to come at the truth. I desired the keeper who had Hannet in his custody, to acquaint her that Broadbent had discovered the whole truth. I went after that to her in the compter. She fell on her knees, and said she was ready to discover the truth, and gave an account which took up about three quarters of an hour; having received that from her, I came from thence to this court, which was sitting; my Lord-mayor went into the next room, and Broadbent was sent for; as soon as she came into the room, in order that she might discover the truth, I desired

            . I was employ'd by Mr. Raminger to enquire into this matter. I don't know that I ever had seen the prisoner then. Mr. Raminger told me these girls had rob'd him of thread and things; and he beg'd I would be concern'd, and go to the justice about it. He said a woman had been committed upon suspicion of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Tew. I believe it was about the 15th of October. When I came there, I heard a good deal about it; I can't charge my memory to say they were brought up at that time; but some days after there was a discovery that a woman had enticed the girls to these facts, and she had committed a rape. Upon my going there, the girls Broadbent and Hannet were examined one by one, Mr. Raminger was with me; the girls told their story, and what a number of things they had been assisting in to rob their master, and in throwing them ou t at the window. I went then to justice Cox's, and told him the affair, and he was clear of opinion there were a robbery and rape committed. I ask'd the girls, and they said they knew the house where they were debauched; and told how they had been at Putney, and call'd in at an alehouse in Clement's-Lane, and were taken from thence by Clifton. I took two persons with me to the Three Compasses, and ask'd the woman if she knew the girls; she said no; one of them said to her, Madam, you know me very well, for I have been here for cups and saucers, and you brought beer to us up stairs, when we were here. The girls went up stairs, and said there were five girls in the room at the time; they look'd at the curtains, and said they were sure that was the room. The man I found had been described before justice Cox. We ask'd the people if they knew any such person. That very man was there. Broadbent said upon seeing him, that is the man that committed the rape upon me. I said, that man's circumstance does not appear to be capable of giving you money; she had told me, that he had given money to her and Mrs. Clifton too. At last they began to threaten me, and I began to think my life was not safe, because I had heard a great deal of the people before.</p>
               <p>Court. There has been inquiry made, and Harrison and his wife bear good characters.</p>
               <p>Tew. I never believ'd Baynham committed the rape. After that the girl and the man sat down; then Hannet came and sat herself down by Broadbent. I observ'd one to stoop, and said, what are you at? then Taylor (one that went with us) got between them, and after a considerable time the girl said, that is the man. I desir'd him before justice Cox to give an account where he was at that time. He at last fell down on his knees to the girls, and said, consider my youth. The girls said, you are the man.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you imagine the girl's intention was by stooping down?</p>
               <p>Tew. I thought it was to give the other intimation of whom she had pitch'd upon.</p>
               <p>Council. Then upon the improbability of the story you thought Baynham was an innocent man?</p>
               <p>Tew. I told Baynham's friends that I thought him innocent. After that they told an account of one Jones a soldier, who came there and whistled, and that they threw things out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you still think the man innocent or guilty?</p>
               <p>Tew. Upon my word, I as much believe him innocent as I myself am innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this soldier (

            ) whether you did not charge him with committing the rape?</p>
               <p>Tew. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Is this the man that charged you in Newgate with committing a rape, and kept you two hours and a half till he brought a warrant?</p>
               <p>Jones. This is the man.</p>
               <p>Justice Cox deposed, the girls and Baynham were before him, that he examin'd the girls above two hours; that he took them separate from each other, and did all in his power to come at the truth; and that the rape was attended with such unaccountable circumstances, that he could not give into it; but upon their positive swearing he did commit Baynham and Clifton, and that he granted a warrant against Jones the soldier for a robbery, or receiving goods knowing them to have been stolen.</p>

               <p>Mr. Williams. In the beginning of October last Mrs. Clifton came to me, and said, her master owed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280036"></xptr> her some money, and she did not know how to get it. I ask'd her the sum. She said about forty shillings. I said, the best way for you is to take out an action in the Marshalsea-Court. Said she, I'll go and do it, or they will do something against me. After that the prosecutor came, and said the girls spoilt his thread, and did things wrong, and desir'd (as I bound them all to him) I would call in. I said, the first time I came that way I would. I did call, and told Broadbent and Hannet that their master complain'd of their spoiling his thread, and with being guilty of some little pilfering tricks. The girls owned they had taken a tablecloth and other things, and threw them out at the window to Clifton. Then I advised the master to take Clifton up, and he applied to Mr. Cox for a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they impeach any body else ?</p>
               <p>Williams. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear of the rape?</p>
               <p>Williams. I first heard of that upon hearing of the felony.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you hear it of first?</p>
               <p>Williams. It came from the girls I imagine, but I can't be particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of the rape at the time you was at the prosecutor's house?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a warrant being granted against a soldier, upon the information of the girls?</p>
               <p>Williams. There was.</p>

            . I remember this soldier (meaning Jones ) was stop'd in Newgate by Mr. Tew, I believe it was concerning the children; he accused him of committing a rape. He charg'd me with him, and I told him I had no right to keep him a prisoner without a warrant. Said he, be it at your peril to let him go. I went to Mr. Newman, and ask'd him what I had best to do; he went with me to the soldier who was in the lodge, and ask'd him if he was willing to stay of his own accord. Said he, that I will; I will stay, for they are mistaken in the man; I have a brother very much like myself. After that Tew went away, and brought a girl. She look'd at him, and said, this is not the man. I saw no warrant at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newman. About the month of November, Mr. Tew came to me in the office of Newgate, and said, there was a person in the lodge against whom he had a warrant for a felony, and shew'd it to me. I look'd at it, and said, I did not think he had any right to detain the man, it being a warrant to apprehend him in Middlesex. He insisted he should be kept there, till he went to my Lord-mayor and got one. I said to the soldier, tho' they charge you with felony, you are no prisoner of our's, unless you are willing to stay of your own accord. I went to ask advice about it, and when I came back, Tew came with the girl, who said she did not know him, and he went about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Tew. Did not you go to Mr. alderman Dickinson, to get the warrant back'd?</p>
               <p>Tew. I did; it was for receiving of goods knowing them to have been stolen.</p>

            . I know Broadbent and Hannet. The Tuesday before Clifton was committed, in the evening, I heard them both say they had rob'd their master, by throwing the goods out at a window, and that Clifton receiv'd them. And Clifton said to me, Mr. Symonds, you see what little devils they are, what chance do I stand amongst them? I once heard the master call one of them into the room, and desir'd her to speak the truth, and no more than the truth.</p>

            . I remember there was a charge against Clifton about a robbery by the prisoner, and I recommended him to go and tell the affair to justice Cox. We went together, but Mr. Cox was not at home. We then went to one of Mrs. Clifton's acquaintance, for him to come and speak to the girls. He came, and the girls were examin'd. The girls own'd the robbery, and that Clifton had receiv'd the things out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Bready. This was the night before Clifton was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you?</p>
               <p>Bready. I am a German.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to visit there?</p>
               <p>Bready. I did sometimes.</p>
               <p>Council. You used to go into the kitchen too, I suppose ?</p>
               <p>Bready. I have been once in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dowse. The prisoner once came to me about a robbery said to be done by Mrs. Clifton, who was an acquaintance of mine originally, when she kept a cook's shop in the Haymarket. I went to him about eight o'clock in the morning, and two or three of the children were examined. One whose name was Bolteram said, she threw things out at the window. I heard the prisoner often bid them be cautions how they swore, telling them the danger<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280037"></xptr> of forswearing themselves. Broadbent said that one watch'd, while the other threw things out at the window to Clifton.</p>
               <p>Ephemia Wiesentball. I am sister to the prisoner, and lived with him at the time these things happen'd. I know there was neither lock nor key to the door where he lay; the outward door to the other room had a lock to it, but the key was broke. I heard him tell these two girls, that if they would speak the truth he would forgive them. They said they stole the things, and threw them out at the window; and they asked his pardon.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear these girls complain of your brother's having lain with them?</p>
               <p>E. Wiesenthall. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the circumstance of a bloody shift ?</p>
               <p>E. Wiesenthall. I am ashamed to speak so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody tell you about a shift of one of these girls ?</p>
               <p>E. Wiesenthall. Yes, Rachel did; but nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear Rachel say?</p>
               <p>E. Wiesenthall. I can't speak it in English.</p>
               <p>Q. Speak it in your own language.</p>
               <p>E. Wiesenthall. I should like better to speak it to a woman; it is not fit to be mention'd in the hearing of a man.</p>

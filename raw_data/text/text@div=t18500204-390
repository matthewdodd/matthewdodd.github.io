On the morning of 7th Dec, after having jumped out of bed, and gone to my dressing-room, and put on what I first found, I ran down, and found the drawing-room open, and a great number of the drawers out of an old cabinet strewed about the floor—I ran out of the house to the station, and gave notice to the police—I had gone to bed about twelve o'clock the night before, I came down a little before twelve, and found the cook was up—I sent her to bed, and soon afterwards went to bed myself—I had then five snuff-boxes, a brooch, a powder-horn, and the other articles named in the indictment—they were all in the drawing-room or hall, and I missed them the next morning—I know these two boxes and this knife; they are mine—I believe this box was on the back drawing-room table on the night of the 6th, and this other box was in the drawing-room—this box is not in the state it was; the lid of it is now off, and this miniature was inside the lid—it had a gold lining, and that has been removed—I saw them safe on the night of the 6th—I do not know where this knife was—the value of these is about five guineas—they are all my property—I have had the knife about three or four years—there is no mark on it—I have had this box fifteen or sixteen years, and this other about five years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3. Great Ormond-street, Russell-square; it is my dwelling house, and in the parish of St. George the Martyr. On 4th Feb. I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock, leaving the house door on the latch—I sleep in the back parlour—when I had been in bed three or four hours, I heard some one going along the passage, and saw a light in the back yard—I then heard some one come in from the yard, and go down into the back kitchen—I saw the lights flaring on the yard wall through the back kitchen window, and I heard a slop-pail moved—I then got up, and went to the top of the kitchen stairs, and saw a light in the back kitchen—I called out to the lodger, who I thought was below, to know who was there, and no one</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280076"></xptr>
               <p>answered—I then stepped back about two feet from the top of the stairs; I thought I heard some one move, went to the head of the stairs again, looked over, and saw a man, who is the prisoner Kipling, standing at the bottom—there was a candle burning in the back kitchen; I could not see where it was, but from the light there I could see—I was about ten feet off Kipling; I am quite sure he is the person—I said, "Who are you?" or, "What do you want?" but he made no answer—I then stepped back again; I did not get so far as the parlour door, when they came up, and I caught Kipling in my arms—I did not see him at that moment, because I turned myself round, and caught Smith; and while I was struggling with Smith, Kipling returned, and struck me in the eye—Kipling then went to the front door, and I saw his face at that time; I am convinced he is the man—Kipling then went out, and the other one after him—I did not see his face, but he was about the size of Smith—my eye was cut down about an inch; it did not bleed very much—I think it was done with a brick—I bad left my wife in bed—I followed the prisoners to the door, and called, "Police!"</p>

When I got there it was about five o'clock in the afternoon; I pulled off my great coat, and put it on a chair in the hall. I left my hat and my brother's hat and coat on the chair. About ten o'clock in the evening the waiter came in and asked us whether we had come with hats and great coats and gloves. I went to the place in the hall where I had left them; they were gone. The officer came in about ten minutes after the waiter; he had got my great coat and hat, and my brother's great coat. I remarked at the time that I had a pair of gloves in my pocket; he went and fetched them.</p>

I remember Mr. Moxon being there, and near ten o'clock I missed the coats and hats off the chairs. I had seen them on the chairs. I went into the room, and asked the gentlemen if they had missed them; they said, no. I recollected in the course of the evening seeing two persons coming and making some enquiries, but whether they were the prisoners I cannot say. That was about nine o'clock; it was dark then. While we were enquiring, Nicolls the officer and some others came in with the coats and the prisoners. The prisoners were taken to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was the person that brought the great coats into the Bath hotel. On the 10th of November I was upon duty that evening; I was at the Gloucester coffee-house, seeing the mails off, as we generally do of a night. We attend regular from eight o'clock to a quarter past eight. The two prisoners passed the Gloucester coffee-house. I am sure of their persons; I knew them well; that induced me to follow them: they crossed over to Harlington-street to the door of the Bath hotel; they walked by the door several times; they entered the avenue; that is the covered way of the street door, before you come to the glass door; they then went round to the other door in Piccadilly, they went into the passage there; that is an open<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010016"></xptr>passage; they returned back into Harlington-street, and at that door they watched there for some time in and out of that avenue, until there was an opportunity. I saw one of the prisoners push the door open, and go in, and the other held the door until he came out. They both then came away together, as close as if they were arm in arm together. I followed them down Harlington-street; I had placed Payntington and Jones at the corner of Harlington-street, to prevent their escape. When I got near to to them I called out to Payntington and Jones; I then saw something drop from one of the prisoners. I cannot say which of them, nor could I tell what it was until I came to it. When they came out I perceived a bulk in one of their arms; which of them had it I cannot swear. It dropped from one or other of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw something drop from the prisoners - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not swear what it was - A. Not till I came to it. I saw the hat roll into the kennel; Payntington and Jones turned round the corner, and took the two prisoners into custody immediately; this was all in my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the two men Payntington and Jones took, are the same men that you saw come from the door of the Bath hotel - A. Yes. I picked up the coats and the hat.</p>

The next morning I saw the gloves that Jones found in the necessary; they were the same gloves. Chambers asked me for the gloves and handkerchief I found in his pocket.

               <p>JOHN JAMES TIMBRELL. I am twelve years old - (the witness appeared perfectly to understand the obligation of an oath). I live in New-cut, Blackfriars-road. On Saturday night, the 14th of January, between seven and eight o'clock, I was going to get a spencer out of pawn from Shoreditch, and in <placeName id="t18260216-4-crimeloc18">Bishopsgate-street, opposite Acorn-street</placeName>

I missed a purse out of my basket, with a sixpence, eight pence, six half-pence, and a duplicate in it; I followed, and did not lose sight of him till he was stopped. I saw Morris pick up the purse, with the money and duplicate in it, in Union-street. The top of the basket lifts up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see it taken? A. No, but I ran after you; I was in the road, and did not lose sight of you.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Newman's-place, Bishopsgate; the tobacconist's is opposite our gate. I heard an alarm, ran out, up Union-street, and the prisoner was taken - the boy was crying. I saw the prisoner drop the purse from his hand - I told the officer, and found it on the spot, between the kennel and curb stone.</p>

            . I am an officer. This tobacconist's shop is in the City. I was at the corner of Sun-street, heard a cry of Stop thief! several people crossed into Union-street, and a man seized the prisoner; I collared him, and the boy who was close by, crying, said he had robbed him; Stannard called out that he had dropped something, and on the spot we afterwards found the purse.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The lady brought her daughter to swear to it at the Mansion House, but she would not; the mother always said it was not her's. I was in Bishopsgate-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! my cousin said somebody was robbed; I went to the lad with my cousin - I had not got many yards before I was stopped; my cousin asked what they took me for, and they took him as being concerned.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTRIX. On my oath the purse is mine, and the duplicate I know also.</p>

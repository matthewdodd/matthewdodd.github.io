                  </hi>. I live in Goswell-road. On 7th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in London-wall, and saw the prisoners behind a gentle<lb></lb>man, and saw Efferance put his hand into the gentleman's pocket—Schofield fell back, so as to screen him as much as possible from my observation—the gentleman turned into Basinghall-street—I went after him, and asked if he had lost anything—I then ran after the prisoners, when they saw me they began to run, and I called out "Stop thief!"—I kept them in sight down Philip-lane, Addle-street, and Aldermanbury, where I lost sight of them for a few minutes, and then Efferance was taken by Hodges—I went to Moor-lane station, and gave tin? charge, and Schofield was brought in.</p>

                  </persName>. I am the rector of Allhallows, London-wall. On 7th July, I was in London-wall, I turned into Basinghall-street, and the last witness came to me, and in consequence of what he said, I found I had lost a silk pocket-handkerchief, which I had when I left home, a few minutes before—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I know it by its general appearance—I turned round when Larke spoke to me, went into London-wall, and he pointed out two men to me, who were walking along the pavement towards Wood-street, a little distance before us—Larke called out "Stop thief!"—the two men instantly began to run, and I saw them run round the corner of Philip-lane, and the mob followed—I went down Philip-lane, and saw a woman holding up a handkerchief—I went, and saw it was mine; I took it, and gave it to the police-sergeant.</p>

               <p>JAMES GEORGE. I am a Bow-street patrol, stationed at Palmer's-green, Edmonton. On the 8th of June I saw the prisoner on the road leading to Edmonton, with a bag on his shoulder - I stopped him, and found three fowls in it; he said his aunt gave him them from Hadleigh - he first said her name was Webb, and then Webber; I found on him a pair of stockings, seven keys, two phosphorus-boxes, and a bit of candle - in his hat I found some children's things; I went to where he said his aunt lived, but could not find her.</p>

I locked up the hen-house on the over night; the next morning it had been opened and the lock broken to pieces, and two hens, four chickens, and a rabbit were taken - the lock of a duck-house was broken, and the slaughter-house door was open; I know these fowls to be mine.</p>

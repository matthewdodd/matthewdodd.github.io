               <p>In town? - In Birmingham-row, in Worcester; when this man was going away, I told him he had taken my pocketbook, and I wished him to return it; it was in my left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you intoxicated? - I was middling, I remember losing it, and calling in the landlord.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it usual to carry such a property as you have described, to the amount of some hundred pounds, about you? - That was the twentieth year I had had that book, and I always carried it; I had a great many more notes with me then, in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you occasion to pay these notes? - I came to lay them out; I lived 14<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040010"></xptr> years at Worcester; I came to town for the purpose of buying goods, I paid some money in Spitalfields about 350 l.</p>

               <p>Court. You say the prisoner was in your company and you missed your pocket book? - Yes, my pocket-book was in my left-hand pocket buttoned up.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner left the place then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in that dozing situation you described? - I had been a little time, I felt my pocket-book going before, and I said the minute he was gone away, you have got my pocket-book, I called and told the landlord.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he run away? - No, he went out and said he had seen no such thing, and I had brought none there.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do afterwards in consequence of that? - I went to my inn at the Bull and Mouth.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you pursue him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you take no steps to pursue him? - No, I did not, I stopped and told the landlord what had happened, and it would be an injury to me, the loss of my pocketbook, as well as my memorandums.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire of the landlord of the house who the prisoner was? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any account of him? - He did not say much about him then, I gave a man half a guinea to search the bog for my pocket-book, and it was found there in the bog at Mr. Golding's house.</p>
               <p>(The pocket-book produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any marks now remaining in that pocket-book that you can swear to? - Yes and every paper in it.</p>
               <p>Was any body in the room with him and you? - Another young man, I did not perceive him touch me, I missed my pocketbook directly as he was going away, I told him he had got it, but he put it up; there was the remains of one note or two, there was the small part of a note that was drawn by an attorney, one Bradstock, upon Mr. Sheppard, in Carey-street, he refused the payment of it, there was the stamp and part of his name, and a little bit of the thirty pound note.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the pocket-book, when it was found, delivered to you? - It was delivered to me and the company, I examined it, and found many of the things there.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the Running Horse a house you frequented? - No, my Lord, I never heard of it before, but I went in because I thought I could eat some bread and cheese.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got the notes again? - They are in the possession of Mrs. Orde.</p>
               <p>Have you seen any of the notes in the indictment since you lost them? - Many times, they were lodged in the possession of Mr. Davison, of Temple Bar, and upon his going into the country, he left them with Mrs. Ord, I was not well the next day, I sent my brother-in-law about them, who went to some of the people; on the Monday night by some means or other it got wind, and they found me in bed at the Bull and Mouth, they came up stairs, there were Mr. Griffin, to whom one of the notes was payable, a clerk belonging to Mr. Thrale, one Humpage, and another man, they came and asked me if I had been robbed, and they produced me seven notes, I looked at them, and saw the pinholes in them, and others without any indorsement, they left me a direction to go to Bow-street the next morning, which I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I beside you? - I don't say you was, you was very near me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was on the other side? - Yes, yes, but I found my pocket-book go.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say that you felt him take your book, and you immediately followed him, he went out of the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him return into the house? - No.</p>
               <p>And yet the pocket-book was found in the privy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he there the whole time, till he went away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was the necessary searched? - On the Tuesday after, this was on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>Court. What is your way of life? - I keep a public house, I know the prisoner, he worked for Mr. Seddon in Aldersgate-street, he owed me about fifteen shillings, and desired me to take what he owed me; I said, I did not understand the note, I told him to leave it till the morning, he said, then will you keep it, I said, yes, then he said, take these others (they were wrapped in a bit of paper) and keep till I call: I asked him how he came by the rest of them, he said he had found them, and the one he said his brother had sent him; he did not come very early in the morning, and when Mr. Thrale our brewer's clerk came, I asked him if it was a good note, and he said it was, and I will give you five guineas for it; I told him how the note was left with me, and he gave me the money; he said he was going to Charing Cross, and would enquire at the bankers, he called there and got cash for it, which he told me in the evening, I said I had several more of them: I saw no more of the prisoner, till one of the men from Bow-street came about four in the afternoon of the Monday, and asked me, if I had not some notes of William Hall's, I told him I had, he asked me to let him see them, I said if he would give me any account of them I would, he said he could not, he said would I chuse to bring them to Bow-street; I went there and shewed the rest of the notes, he said here is one drawn on a gentleman in Fleet-street; by this we found out the owners: we went to Mr. Griffin, he said he knew the note, and the person was there on Saturday night for the money for the note; but he was in liquor, and he did not chuse to pay him the note, he said he was afraid the gentleman was murthered, he told us that the prosecutor lodged at the Bull and Mouth, when he was in town, and the prosecutor was in bed when we went there.</p>
               <p>Court. You positively swear that the prisoner at the bar was the person that deposited these notes in your possession? - Yes, Sir, he worked at Mr. Seddon's.</p>

               <p>Was he in the same room with the prosecutor Mr. Lowe? - Yes, it was in the and Mr. Lowe came in.</p>
               <p>During how long time did they continue in the same room? - There were more people in the room, there were two men that dined with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the prosecutor seem to be in liquor? - Yes, he rather looked as if he had been drinking a good deal.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he charge the prisoner with taking his pocket-book? - He came into the bar, and said, he had lost his pocketbook, I said, I don't think you could lose it here, it must be lost somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there was no charge made on any particular person, nor any pursuit after the prisoner at the bar? - No, the necessary was searched on the Tuesday after; the prisoner came back, and lodged in the house; the same night there was a sailor that slept with him, but he knew nothing of what had happened.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoner at the bar left the room, before the prosecutor left your house? - I think he had, he came to his lodging on Sunday night, he met with some of his acquaintance of the glass grinders, he is a glass grinder, and they went away, and about eleven he went to bed, and on Monday about eleven he went out, and did not come home on Monday night; I did not see him till he stopt in a coach on Tuesday morning, with some of the Bow-street people.</p>

               <p>I dined at this house on Sunday, off some potatoes and mutton, and this gentleman came in whilst we were at dinner, he began clauming the meat about with his fingers, and he had some potatoes with us, and he had some beer, and afterwards, when we were paying for some beer, I saw the pocket-book laying underneath the table; I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it not probable that it might slip out of your pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did you not alarm the house? - I called the landlord.</p>
               <p>Jury. And went about very unconcerned? - I wished my brother to seek after him.</p>
               <p>You could not know what you was about? - Yes, I am very clear as to that part of the business, as to not going after him, I was not very well the next morning, I did not seek after him, but I wished my brother in-law to seek after him, as some of them were his drawing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ord. I never heard any thing against the prisoner before, I have known him two years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Golding. He behaved very well in our neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Jury to Lowe. Had you a handkerchief or any thing in your pocket, that you could pull the book out with? - I had lost both my handkerchiefs before.</p>

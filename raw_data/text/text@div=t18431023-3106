                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, and live in Great Suffolk-street, Southwark. I have seen a cask of white lead in the prisoner's possession, which is my property—I know it by the weight and tare marks on the cask—I had such in my shop on the 23rd of Oct., at six o'clock in the afternoon, and missed it about half-past six or seven next morning—I noticed some marks, which appeared as if some cask had been rolled away—I traced it up the court, at the back of my premises, then went into my shop, and sent for a policeman—I showed him the marks, and fancied he would find my lead by them.</p>

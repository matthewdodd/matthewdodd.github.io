            . I live in Middleton-street, Spa-fields. I was in Fleet-street, and saw a number of people apparently together, shoving about, or hustling, at the corner of Water-lane, close to Mrs. Jones - I saw the prisoner run forcibly against her; he almost shoved her down. I had my family with me - my suspicion was excited; I watched him, and the moment he left her, I asked if she had lost any thing from her muff - she at last missed her bag, the strings of which still hung on her arm; I saw the bag in the prisoner's left hand, five or six yards down Water-lane - he was trotting away; I overtook him, and told him to stop - he immediately turned up Crown-court; I called Stop thief! and he was stopped by another person; he dropped the bag a few seconds before he was stopped; it was picked up by Bidmead, and taken to the watch-house.</p>

I was in Fleet-street, and saw several persons turn the corner of Water-lane - there was a cry of Stop thief! and seeing a young man, far beyond the appearance of a thief, turn up Crown-court, I went to the other end of the court - the prisoner ran out, and several persons after him; I followed, and got nearly up to him he made a bit of a slip in Shoe-lane, and finding himself closely pursued, he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out this green reticule, and dropped it - I told a boy to pick it up - I pursued, and caught him at the corner of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110018"></xptr>Harp-alley; the bag was brought to the watch-house; Mrs. Jones claimed it, and produced the other part of the string.</p>

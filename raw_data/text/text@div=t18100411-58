After the prisoners left my shop, I received information from Solomon who lives on the other side of the way.

            . Q. Did you serve these women. - A. No, I was close to them, I saw them come in in company together, Williams served them. After they left the shop Solomon's boy came in, I followed them and overtook them in Denmark-street, about fifty yards from the shop. They were together standing against a wall; they both were holding some print in their hands, Smith was assisting Brown to put it under her gown. I took the print from them, and told them it was my master's property. I told them to walk back. I laid hold of Brown, and the other followed after. When the constable came my master gave charge of them for having stolen that print, then they begged to be let off.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BROWN. Q. Were you sent for to take charge of these two women - A. Yes, Mrs. Davis accused them of stealing this piece of print; they said they had been into the shop to buy half a yard of calico, they said they had not taken it, and that they were much in liquor, they appeared sober; Mr. Davis told me I should take them away, they cried and ask'd forgiveness.</p>

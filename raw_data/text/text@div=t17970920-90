             sworn. - I am the patrole of St. Bride's; about ten o'clock in the morning on the 12th of August, I was going past the prosecutor's door, and he called me in and gave me charge of the prisoener at the bar. (Produces the property.)</p>
               <p>Read. This is my property, it has my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A.Twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have more cottons of the same sort, I take it for granted, in your shop? - A. No, I have not; this is a gown-patch.</p>
               <p>Q. These shawls have your private mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And when they are sold, you do not take out your mark? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then such a shawl might get into the world, and into another person's hands? - A. It might, but it is very unlikely.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had some meat and some plumbs when the gentleman laid hold of me; the gentleman said, that as the shawls were stained, I must have had them, for the stain of the meat had come through my apron on to the shawls as I stood at the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

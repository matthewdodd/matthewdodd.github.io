             sworn. - I am a porter, in Bell-yard: I had occasion to go through Temple-bar, on the 14th of August last, about half past four o'clock, for some tobacco; I saw a stage-coach, I did not observe what stage it was; when the stage got under <placeName id="t17980912-48-crimeloc273">Temple-bar</placeName>

               <p>Q. It was pretty heavy, I suppose? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same man that you saw take the box? - A. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that the box you saw afterwards was the box you saw him take from the stage? - A. I am positive; I secured him and the box too.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was on the other side of Temple-bar that you first saw him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the County of Middlesex? - A. Yes, where I first saw him.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see his face? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say, that you saw him take the box off, but that you saw it in his hand? - A. I saw him lift it from the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not stop him at that time? - A. I had no suspicion that he had stolen it till after I saw the strings dragging on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a very good opportunity of getting away while you were gone to Fleet-street again? - A. Yes, he certainly had.</p>

Last Wednesday week, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoner take down the cloak from inside the door; he ran away, and I after him, and took him in a minute and a half, in Newman-street - he had not got the cloak then, but I got it after I took him; I am certain he is the person who took it - he was not running when I stopped him; he had made a little halt.</p>
               <p>JOHN UNDERWOOD. I am a cabinet-maker. I was going up Newman-street on Wednesday, the 6th of January; the prisoner came in contact with me, and had the cloak under his arm - I took it to be a coat; he threw it into an area, a few yards from me - I saw him stopped, and afterwards took the Police-man to the house, and there he got the cloak.</p>
               <p>MARY ROUTER. I am a servant in Newman-street. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and found this cloak in our area; I gave it to the Police-man.</p>

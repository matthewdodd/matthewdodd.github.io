               <p>I am a coach-maker in Camomile-street; on Friday the 30th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning I observed the prisoner passing my house with a quantity of coach glass under his arm.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - Yes, I have known him twenty years, he is a journeyman coach-maker, having heard but an indifferent character of him, I suspected him, and watched where he went to, he turned into Mr. Dick's a joiner, about half a dozen doors from me, I went there but he was gone, he had left the glasses; Mr. Dick was not at home.</p>
               <p>What glasses were they? - Two carriage-door glasses and some broken pieces, I desired he might be stopped when he came again; in the afternoon he came and told Mr. Dick he was very well known to me, and Mr. Dick brought him to me, I asked him how he came by the glasses, he said he had them of his son-in-law, I asked him what business his son-in-law was, he said he was in the horse-hair manufactory, I told him I thought it was strange such a person should have coach-glasses to sell; I told him he could have no objection to Mr. Dick's keeping the glasses till he fetched his son-in-law, he said he thought it perfectly right, and he went away; he came again on Monday; in the mean time I heard Mr. Wheatley had lost some glasses, and he was stopped on the Monday, and taken before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dick confirmed the evidence of Mr. Eades, and deposed, that when the prisoner came again on the Monday, he brought a young man with him, who said he had used him ill in stopping his property, but not the person that he pretended was his son-in-law, that he was then taken into custody.</p>

               <p>To Wheatley. Have you any mark by which you can know these glasses? - No, but I have some of the broken pieces that were left behind (producing them), the edges of which when laid together exactly correspond with those the prisoner left at Mr. Dick's.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On the Thursday night I went to Oxford Road, to an old master of mine, to endeavour to get into the Charter-house; I met a coachman that I had known fourteen years ago, with these glasses under his arm; I bought them of him for a guinea, I thought I should get a shilling or two by them, though I did not very well know the value of it. I have worked with Mr. Eades when he was a journeyman.</p>
               <p>To Wheatley. Did the prisoner ever work for you? - No, he had worked at the next shop below mine.</p>
               <p>Where were the carriages standing from which the glasses were taken? - In the shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250029"></xptr>Jury. Was the door broke open? - No, the prisoner had been seen about the shop over night, and in the morning the shop door was found open, we had heard a great noise in the night, and I got up, and searched the shop, but among such a vast number of carriages as we have, a person might easily conceal himself.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to prove that? - No, I did not wish to take his life.</p>
               <p>To Seeker. Whereabouts was it you saw the prisoner that morning? - A very little way from Mr. Wheatley's shop, he was going towards the city.</p>

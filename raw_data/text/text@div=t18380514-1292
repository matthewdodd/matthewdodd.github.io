                  </hi>, I am a police-sergeant. From information I re<lb></lb>ceived, I went to No. 10, Kelso-place, Lisson-grove—I went up stairs, into the front room, and saw the prisoner Edward Harding, handing a pot out at the door—I said, "I want you respecting the robbery at Mrs. Heavi<lb></lb>sides"—he said, "Very well"—I passed him, and went into the room and found the other two prisoners and three females—the two prisoners were lying on the apparently asleep, and the girls with them—I saw this bottle on the mantel-shelf, broken as it is now—I said, "Halloo! how comes this here?"—Edward Harding said, "I do not know any thing about it"—I examined a cupboard in the room, and in it found this clock—I them went to the bed, shook George Harding by the leg awoke him up, and said, "How do you account, for this clock being here?"—he said "A young man brought it her in the morning"—I said, "Who is the young man?"—he shook his head—Elliott said he did not know any thing about it. he only lodged with them—I looked under the bed, and pulled a box out, and there saw some keys—I then went to the window, and beckoned to Reardon, my brother-officer, who was close by—he came, and I left him in charge of the room—on searching Edward Harding in the room, I found son him this piece of paper, which is used to light phosphorous matches—it has been used on the wrong side as if it had been used in the dark—I then handcuffed, them, and conveyed them to the station-house—as we were going along I said, "Who belongs to the room?"—George Harding said, "I do; and my brother lodges with me"—I afterwards returned to the room, and found these six keys concealed on a ledge up the chimney, also this small file, and something which has the appearance of gold-dust—among the ashes I found a screw of tobacco, and in the cupboard a lancet and a box of lucifer matches.</p>

                  </hi> I am an attorney's clerk, and live at 4, Primroac-street, Bishopsgate—I was acquainted with Mrs. Rachael Folks, who is since dead—she lived with the prisoner Marks, who occupied a house, No. 16, Barker-street, Houndsditch. On 14th of last Oct. I accompanied Mrs. Folks to Messrs. Currie's, the bankers, in Cornbill, and there saw her receive a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, seven 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and some cash, for a check for 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have a memorandum of the numbers of the notes, which I took directly after—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were 43649 and 46350, and 18430 to 34—I have no number of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—it was changed immediately, at the Bank—at her request I marked, each note at the corner—she went home with me—she sewed the notes up in her pocket with several papers, one of which I remember in particular—it was a paper I had given her back, relating to a matter of business with reference to her son, who had lately died—this is that paper—(<hi rend="italic">produced by Webb</hi>)—it is signed by Marks' late husband, and is an authority to apply for a certain sum of money—I saw Mrs. Folks about nine days before her death—on the morning of 9th Feb. I received information from Marks' servant, in consequence of which I went and found Mrs. Folks perfectly insensible—she remained so till she died—she was about fifty-nine or sixty years old—I asked Mrs. Marks whether she had sent for any medical assistance, and asked how long she had been ill—she said she had been insensible from the middle of the night, and she had not sent for any medical assistance—I sent for Dr. Brown, of St. Mary-Axe, who had attended her before, and also for Louise Jones, who is accustomed to attend persons of the Jewish persuasion—I and Dr. Brown searched the room for property, as much as decency would allow, but found nothing—I did not see Bambard on that ocssion—I expressed my surprise to the female prisoner that no money was found—she said she knew nothing about the old lady's money; she never knew she had any, except when the rent was paid to her; she believed if she had any she must have left it in charge of some person in the Commercial-road; that she came home the other night, having fallen down in the street, and was covered with mud, and she might have been robbed then—I said it was very singular that they should rob her of pocket and all, and every farthing—she said she did not know anything about it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184804030118"></xptr>
               <p>and did not care anything about it; she was engaged to be marred, and she would soon be out of that—I called next day, and found Mrs. Folks still insensible, and on the 11th—she died about eleven o'clock on the night of the 12th—there was no investigation as to the cause of her death—I went to the house again on 26th Feb., found the two prisoners there, and said to Barn<lb></lb>hard hard it was a very serious thing about the old lady's money; a very unpleasant affair—he said he did not care about it, what was that to him? and many expressions of that kind; and at last he said he wished he could find any one that would say he ever had anything to do with the old lady's money, and if he was worth powder and shot he would bring an action against them.</p>

On 9th Feb., at nine o'clock in the morning, I was called in to attend Mrs. Floks—I found her in a state of insensibility, produced by apoplexy—I have no means of judging how long she had been in that state—I continued to attend her till her death, on the evening of the 12th—she did not recover her senses at all, only so as to utter indistinct words, but nothing that I could make out—I was present when Barnett searched the room for property—nothing was found—Marked said she had been taken ill between eleven and twelve on the pre<lb></lb>ceding night—she said they had not sent for me, because the deceased had a great objection to medical assistance—I had attended her, a month or two before, for influenza—she expressed a very great objection to having a medical man then—she was a stout woman, and seventy-four years old-in my judgment, her death proceeded from natural causes—I am not aware of any fall that she had—it is possible that might have accelerated her death—her pulse was very small—there was a state of depression when I first saw her—her extremities were nearly cold, and I ordered warmth to be applied—her pulse got up a little the symptoms of apoplexy increased, and in my judgment that was the cause of death.</p>

I received further information from the Bank of England, and after I had traced the notes, I took Barnhard into custody at Marks' house—she was not present when I first went in—I searched him, and said, "You knew Mrs. Folk"—he said, "Yes, I did"—I said, "There has been a great deal of talk about her money; it is very singular it should vanish in this manner"—he said, "I know nothing at all about her money; I did not know she had any"—I said he must consider himself in custody for stealing seven 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-notes, her property—in going along Houndsditch, he took me by the collar, and said, "Will you tell me what you know about these notes?"—I said, "I will tell you of three, that you gave to Mr. Seal for a diamond ring"—he said, "How do you know that?"—I said, "I traced them to Mr. Seal, and he informed</p>

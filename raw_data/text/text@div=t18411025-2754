I went to Charlton fair on the 18th of October, with Catherine Potter—I was looking at a show about two o'clock in the afternoon—while I was looking at the horsemanship I saw Lock at the side of us—she lifted up my gown, and then took my purse out of my pocket—it was safe there before—there was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—Bar<lb></lb>ker stood aside us, with another man, and Lock was in the middle of the two—they all then went away together—when I went through the booth Barker said how dare I accuse his wife—I had charged both of them—the two men pushed me, while Lock got away—she ran off.</p>

I was in company with the prosecutrix—directly we went into the fair we stood at the bottom of the fair—the crowd was in front of us—Lock went in front of us, and looked in both our faces—she came and placed herself on the side of me—Barker was on one side of Lock, and the other man on the other—the prosecutrix's gown was lifted up—I did not see Lock lift it up, but she stood close to me, so that no one could do it but her—she was covered in between the two men, so that no one could see what her hand did—the prosecutrix felt something, and put her hand down to her side, and her purse was there, but the mo<lb></lb>ment after the gown was lined up the purse was gone, and the prisoners escaped.</p>

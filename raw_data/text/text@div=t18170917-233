I was looking for a friend, and was hustled by about a dozen persons; I felt my seals and ribbon pulled at, and seized the prisoner's arm with my right hand - I collared him, the rings broke-my watch was nearly out of my fob; I never let go the prisoner - the others tried to rescue him, they rushed on each side of me to make me let go, and struck me several blows, but I still held him. I have never found my property. I got away from them, and gave the prisoner in charge. We had to go three-quarters of a mile to the watch-house, and the gang interrupted us all the way.</p>

            . I was with Pascall. I ran up to him, and found the prisoner in his custody; there was a dreadful scuffle to rescue him - We were obliged to take the prisoner into a booth. The gang followed us all the way to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM ANGEL. I am a headborough. I took the prisoner in charge, and assisted in taking him to the watch-house-the gang attempted to rescue him. I took him to the watch-house with great difficulty, they knocked me down, and called out "D-n his eyes, kill him;" we took him into a booth, and they still attacked us-the watchman presented his pistol, and they then drew back.</p>

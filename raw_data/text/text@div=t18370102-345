                  </hi>. I live in Kingsland-road, opposite Mr. Lawson's floor cloth manufactory. On the 18th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was at home, and saw two men three or four yards from the shop conversing together—in a short time I saw them go nearer the door—I saw one man go in, and return with a roll of carpet which he placed on the other man's shoulders—they crossed the road with it to the side I was on—I know the prisoner to be the man who carried the carpet—I spoke' to a butcher's boy named Abel about it, and he went the shop door—Mrs. Lawson came out of the shop, and in about ten mi<lb></lb>nutes the carpet was brought back in a truck; and in about five minutes the prisoner was brought back in the custody of Spencer—he had a kind of snuff-coloured coat, and a white apron, and long hair under his ears, and a hat on—I had never seen him before—I had seen both of them for three quarters of an hour about the shop—I suspected them, when they got near the shop—I saw them then for ten minutes—I was very near to them.</p>

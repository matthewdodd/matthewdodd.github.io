            , I am servant to Mr. Sparks. About three o'clock in the morning, of the 1st of January, I was going to his cow-house, and found the lock off the door - the watchman was close behind me; the prisoner came out in a great hurry, we seized him and took him to the watch-house. I called my master up, and we went to the cow-house; I had left the saddle-cloths and bridles hanging up in the loft - they were gone. I found them on the dung-hill, about fourteen yards from the loft, covered with straw. I found the lock of the door inside the premises; I found a crow-bar and a piece of the binding of a hat in the loft.</p>

I took a flint, a steel, and a piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120010"></xptr>of candle out of his pocket, with some tinder and matches. We searched the loft, and found a piece of leather.

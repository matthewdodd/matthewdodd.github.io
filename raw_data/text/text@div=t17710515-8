            . I am a watchman, my stand is in Watling-street. On the third of April, about twenty minutes after four in the morning, I took Cleghorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day light then?</p>
               <p>Wright. It was not broad day, it was light. I met two, Cleghorn and another, between the Fleece and Mr. Currie's house; they were going through George-yard, which leads into Bow-lane; they went into Bow-lane, and there parted; one went down Bow-lane, the other into Bow-church-yard. Cleghorn went into Bow-church-yard; I pursued him into Cheapside; he had a bundle flung across his shoulder, which made me suspect he had it. I took him when he had got about forty yards in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the bundle then?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; I asked him how he came by the bundle; he said very honestly. I said from where; he said Ironmonger-lane: I said I am not certain, but I believe you came out of a house in Queen-street. I took him to the watch-house; coming through George-yard, he broke away from me; I pursued him thro' Cheapside, and Honey-lane-market, and into Milk-street, and took him in Mumford court. I said I had a brother watchman joined me in Cheapside. When I took him the first time, he threw the bundle down in George-yard, when he broke away from me. I gave him in charge of a constable. I searched his right side coat pocket, and took out two large spoons and a candlestick, and two clasp knives.</p>

               <p>Q. What fort of a window is it?</p>
               <p>Barber. There is two doors, and a plank lets down upon the ground.</p>

I know him, and knew the other prisoner was sometimes with him. I went and found Aldrich in Cow Cross. I took him to the gentleman's house; I searched him, and in his pocket was this silver spoon, and three keys, and he had a hat belonging to one of the gentlemen, which he had on his head. (Mr. Curric. These are my property, all but the hat.)</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Currie, can you explain how these people got into the house?</p>
               <p>Mr. Currie. There was a defect in the curves in the windows; there are two planks come out and make part of the footway. I never knew till after the robbery that these planks were not fastened. I thought they had gone into a grove or something, so that they could not have been slid on the outside; but when I came to examine them the day after I was robbed, I found it was possible to slide them out of their places so as to get down.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was there not a fastening they call an iron dog?</p>
               <p>Mr. Currie. No; it appeared to be quite solid, but it was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember coming up to assist when Cleghorn was taken?</p>
               <p>Heath. Yes; I took the bundle to the watch-house, and gave it to Mr. Foster. (The bundle produced, containing two great coats, thirteen pair of shoes, one shirt, one neckcloth, two silk handkerchiefs, one white apron, three coarse aprons, a jack towel, three check aprons, and a red and white handkerchief.)</p>
               <p>(The above goods were deposed to by the different owners, as mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>- Davis. There is all the plate that has been produced, but the spoons in this bundle that has now been opened. There was a toothpick in his pocket.</p>

            . Aldrich called him out; he did not go voluntarily, but upon his calling him, Aldrich came to him about twelve, and desired him to go out; they were very much in liquor.</p>

            . I live in Plow Court, Holborn. I know Cleghorn by sight; Aldrich lodged in the house about three months, Cleghorn only lodged in the house that night. Tucker lodged there, and brought him home with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go out that night?</p>
               <p>Wegborough. When Tucker brought this man home he asked for Aldrich then for his wife; she was not at home. Then he came to bed in the next room to where I laid; about three Aldrich came home. I heard him make a rumbling up stairs, as if he brought some goods or something; then he went up to his wife, and came down and knock'd at Cleghorn's door, and asked him to go out with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is his wife?</p>
               <p>Wegborough.

               <p>Wegborough. No; to neither of them. About four in the morning Aldrich came home, and asked me if I heard the young fellow come in; I said, No. He answered, then he is took up.</p>
               <p>Aldrich's Defence.</p>
               <p>As for what Cleghorn has said against me I am as innocent as a child unborn. I have nothing to say but I beg mercy of the court; what Cleghorn has said against me is as false as God is in heaven. That is all I can say; <rs id="t17710515-8-viclabel47" type="occupation">I am in service in a publick house</rs>

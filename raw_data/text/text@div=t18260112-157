I came to England in June, and when I left the ship I packed up all my articles in my chest, which I locked - it contained eighteen shirts, a coat, four silver spoons, some trousers, and a silk handkerchief - it was taken to my lodgings, at No. 13, Norfolk-street, Strand - Mr. Frampton lodged there likewise, and he sent down my chest to his ship by mistake in November last - a witness stopped it at the Dock-gate, and took charge of it; I have seen two silver spoons which I know were mine, and were locked up in my chest last June.</p>

No. I am certain these spoons were in the chest before it left my house, I do not know the prisoner; it is usual for masters to give boys old clothes or money when ships are discharged, but not spoons.</p>

On the 19th of December the prisoner brought these two spoons to sell; he said the mate of a ship gave them to him for carrying a chest up to the Saracen's-head, and he had had them six months; he came a second time in about half an hour, and I detained him - the officer came and took him.</p>

I found these three handkerchiefs in the prisoner's hat.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

            . I am lighterman to Mr. Staples and company; every lighter that is loaded, I send a note with it; and when this lighter was unloaded, there were four sacks missing. I then took up Bennet, and had him before justice Hammond; there he acknowledged, that he and Cox stole the corn, and that Cox told him he could sell it to Pursley, for he used to deal with him. I had a warrant to take up Pursley; I went to the house, and told him I had a great suspicion he had received four sacks of wheat which were stole, and that he must go before a magistrate. He said I was welcome to look all over his house; for as to Mr. Cox, he knew nothing of him: after that he said, he knew Cox as a neighbour; at first he denied he had any dealings with him, then he was ask'd, whether he thought Cox could come honestly by four sacks of wheat. He said no, he did not believe he could; then we carried him in order to go before Esq; Hammond; he was not at home; so justice Browning committed him for farther examination, and in the evening we carried him to justice Hammond, where at first he stead-fastly denied it; said Esq; Hammond, what will you say if I bring the man to your face, and he says you bought it? [ Cox was brought out of a room to him. ] Said the justice to Cox, do you know any thing of four sacks of wheat that you stole out of Mr. Rouse's lighter? yes, said he, I stole them, and sold them to Mr. Pursley. Mr. Pursley was in a rage, and said, I wonder you should serve me so: said Cox, you need not deny it; Cox said, he had received 35 s. and 5 s. in bread of Pursley; at last Pursley was very sorry, he said, for what he had done, and made a few excuses; Pursley then said, he paid him 40 s. for them, but he never saw the wheat. I have known Cox for 15 years; he was servant to a miller, and used to work his boat up and down the river; but for some time past he has been a boom-boat man, selling gin upon the river.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think them 16 bushels of wheat were worth at that time?</p>
               <p>Rouse. These four sacks of wheat cost my masters 50 s. and they bought a great quantity together at Bear-key, it cost 24 s. and 6 d. per quarter, and lighteridge and other charges, makes it amount to that money. I heard Pursley say, he paid Cox for them four sacks of wheat.</p>

            . The price at Bear-key, at this time the wheat was stole, was 24 s. and 6 d. per quarter, and according to my own opinion, I think Mr. Pursley must know the wheat was then worth more money than he gave for it. I was by when he acknowledged he paid 40 s. for that wheat, he at first denied he had had any dealings with Cox, and at last he did acknowledge he had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Simpson. At the time I bought this wheat, there was no wheat at Bear-key worth so little as 20 s. a quarter; except it was damaged wheat.</p>

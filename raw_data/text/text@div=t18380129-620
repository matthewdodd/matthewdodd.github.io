                  </hi>. My husband's name is Joseph Albert Tunks—he is a German, and lives at No. 9, May's-buildings, St. Martin's-lane—he works in Hungerford-market—I keep a ladies' wardrobe. I had two sheets and two shirts lying on the counter, about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, on the 31st of January—I was in the back parlour, and heard the latch of the door open—the front shop door was then shut—it was opened gently—I looked out, and saw the prisoner put his foot against the door, and keep it open, while he took these things off the counter—I will take my oath he is the same person—when he had taken the things he stooped down—I threw my baby on the bed, and hallooed, "Stop thief"—he ran and shut the door—I ran out, and a gentleman said, "Has he got a white bundle?"—I said, "Yes"—I ran down Bedfordbury, and he dropped the things—I took them up—I am sure the prisoner is the man—he was brought back in five or six minutes after I returned home—I had no one at home—I knew him immediately, and have not the least doubt he is the person—here is my property—it was dropped in the street, and here is the mud on it now.</p>

            . On the 13th of December, there were twenty-eight bags of pomentoe on Botolph wharf. I employed three men to carry them up to a warehouse in Cross-lane, at so much a bag. The prisoner lent them a hand with them upon their shoulders; there being an odd bag, he desired I would let him carry that. I told him, I would give him a pot of beer. It was put on his back, but he never took it to the warehouse. I took him in Old-street, about a month after, and charged him with stealing it. He owned that he did steal it, and said he sold it at two places. I went and enquired at both the places, and both the people are off; one was a man over the water, and the other, a woman in East-Smithfield.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Allenbury. On the 3d of April, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was coming down stairs to open the door to a lady, and saw the prisoner and another man walking backwards and forwards - I went to the door to look out; they passed again, went as far as St. Swithin's church, and waited there about a minute. The prisoner then turned back, went into Mr. Hare's warehouse, came out with a roll of carpet under his arm, and turned up the other way, towards Abchurch-lane-the other man followed him. I went into the warehouse, and told the porter - He went after him, and brought him back without the carpet. I am sure he is the man who brought the carpet out of the warehouse.</p>

            . I was standing at the corner of Green Lettuce-lane, and saw the prisoner turn down Abchurch-lane, with the carpet under his arm. Presently after, Mr. Hare's porter inquired if I had seen any person go by? I told him I had, and went with him. As we turned the corner, to go to Abchurch-lane, we met the prisoner returning, without the carpet. I am sure he is the man - I had taken particular notice of him. I noticed his carrying it an awkward manner.</p>

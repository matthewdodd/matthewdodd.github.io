             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Johnson, I live opposite the gates; coming out of my house, I heard chains, and the backbands rattle in the yard, it was as dark as it could be, I had a lantern; going to the stable about five o'clock, as near as could be, I asked who was there, two or three times, and received no answer; I was going to Stratford, for my master, and thought he had sent somebody else; I went round to the stable, and saw the accompting-house broke open; going into the stable, I found the back stable door broke open, I went into the yard, and heard the chains gingle still; I followed the found of the chains, and by the lantern, I had a glimpse of two men; I asked Davis what he wanted there, he asked who I was, and what I wanted, and said, if I came any further, I was a dead man, he would run me through; I took up a stone, and threw it at him, and hit him on his bank; I believe I took him with the iron back bands, the other got away; I called my master up, and he desired I would take him away to the watch-house, when I came to the watch-house, the watchman was gone; I called Griffiths the officer up, and delivered him to him; they had undone the gates to get at the wicket, which was latched, they came over the wall, or some place to unbolt the gates; Davis said, they were going to sell the things to a lusty woman in Cabell-street; Griffiths and I went there, and took the other prisoner with the fowls and other things upon him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Johnson.) How was your place broke open? - A. I don't know, only undoing the latches.</p>
               <p>Q.How did they get into the yard? - A.Through the gates, they were all open, as my man told me; the desk in the accompting-house, which was locked, was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was last in the yard that night? - A. I cannot tell, sometimes one, and sometimes another of the men are last.</p>
               <p>Kingsland. I was the last that fastened the gates; I went with the team, I fastened the stable, I bolted the gates, and went out at the little front gate, about eight or nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure no one went in afterwards? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.How could they unbolt the gates? - A. They They got over the wall, I suppose; the back gates come to the back part, and the front gates into the fore part.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your fellow-servants here? - A.No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160054"></xptr>Q.Might not they come in after that? - A. No, I always see them out.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Johnson.) Suppose I was to come to your house, I could come in at that gate? - A. Not without ringing, unless you know how to open the gate.</p>

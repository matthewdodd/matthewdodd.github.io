               <p>between eight and nine o'clock, Edensor came to my house and made a statement to me, in consequence of which I went to a house, No. 2, New<lb></lb>way-court, kept by the prisoner Manning—I there found the deceased, Eastwood, in the parlour, in a chair by the side of the fire—Mrs. Manning was with him, standing in the room—Eastwood said he was very bad, sat asked me to take him home to his brother's—I said I would, and told him it was an unthankful office to take anybody home that had been robbed—it was in consequence of a communication made to me by Edensor that I said that—he said he would be very thankful if I would take him to his brother's in Strutton-ground—I got him out of his chair with the assistance of Edensor—he could hardly stand at all—Manning offered to lend him a stick, which she brought him—that was too weak—I fetched a stronger one, then assisted him to his brother's, and left him in charge of a lady who was there.</p>

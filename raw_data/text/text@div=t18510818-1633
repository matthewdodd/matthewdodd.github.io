                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Thomas Booker, of Rupert-street, Leicester-square—the prisoner was employed in his printing-office for five days as a machine-boy, to attend the printers—he came in the morning to work, and went away in the evening—we leave work at 7 o'clock—on Friday evening, 11th July, I and my master left the premises about 8—I did not see the prisoner—we were the last persons on the premises—no one slept there—we locked the doors—there is an office, a warehouse, a composing-room, a press-room, and a machine-room—the upper part of the dwelling is a warehouse—the office is on the second-floor—I went the next morning at a quarter-past 7 o'clock; I was the first person there—I unlocked the door of the house, and when I got up to the office I found it in the greatest possible confusion, almost every thing was turned over—I know the door of the office had been locked the night before—there was a key in the door in the morn<lb></lb>ing—the door was shut, but unlocked—the key of the door was on the pre<lb></lb>mises, but it was not that key that was in the lock—the proper key was still there—there was a drawer broken belonging to a desk in the office, from which I missed several articles, which were found on the prisoner—this case of mathematical instruments, and two French books, which I had seen on a shelf the day before.</p>

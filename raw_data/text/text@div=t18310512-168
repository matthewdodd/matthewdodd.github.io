            . I work for Mr. Astley, a wharfinger, at Stone-stairs, Ratcliff. On Friday, the 8th of April, I was at my master's wharf, and saw Baxter the prisoner, about half-past six o'clock, but I did not then know his name - a person they called Mr. Rogers, who had a black coat, came with Baxter; they wanted me to get ready to land a piece of timber for them, and Rogers, who appeared to be the owner of the timber, said he was in a hurry for it, for the sawyers were standing still, and the building was standing still - they were both together; I did not see any timber at that time, but in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, Foreman brought a piece which appeared to me to he Memel timber - it was floating; I noticed the race-mark of thirty-four feet - I did not see in what direction it came; I was getting the handles and things ready - the tide was then coming up, and I consider if it had been half an hour later it could have been landed more conveniently, but they would make me get it up; I told them I thought it was a pity to land it then, to drag it through the mud, but Foreman put the dogs to it - I saw no cart then; we had it landed before the cart came - Mr. Rogers then asked me what was the charge for landing it; I said was he the gentleman that had been at my master's last night, and said he had some timber coming - he said Yes; I said, "You need not pay this now;" he said he would rather pay it now - they then walked with me down to my master, and I said they had landed thirty-four feet of timber, how much was it? my master called out, "One shilling, Jem," and Mr. Rogers asked Baxter for 1s., which he gave him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure they did not both pay the shilling together? A. It was very much like it - I have had conversation with Mr. Dixon about this; I have only seen him once before, when I went to Lambeth-street - we landed this timber as quick as we could, as it rained very fast; I do not think there were any more men about the wharf - I would not have been there if these two gentlemen had not persuaded me; I opened the gate, and they asked who was the person to get the timber through - I said I was; it might be five or six minutes in landing - the dogs are at the end of the iron chain which hangs to the crane; the tide was not then up - the prisoners took the dogs as far as the bank, and pulled the timber out; it was some distance from the wall - it was then from half-past six to seven o'clock; I did not see it first come in sight - I was in and out, getting the handles and things ready: I did not see Foreman bring it- the first I saw of him was when he came to put the dogs - I cannot tell the length or width of it; there was thirty-four cut in it, with a race knife - there was other timber there, but we had none come in that night, or the day before; there was no single piece came in for a week before, or a week afterwards, I am certain - Mr. Dixon did not tell me the mark on this piece of timber; I took notice of it, to give an account to my master - I did not know either the prisoners or Mr. Rogers; I heard Mr. Baxter's name at the office - I knew them by their clothes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What day was this? A.One Friday morning - to the best of my knowledge, five weeks last Friday - I do not keep account of the days; Rogers acted as master of the timber, as it appeared to me; I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.What became of the timber? A. The carman came, and the prisoners and Rogers helped it into the cart.</p>

            . I am a carman. On one Friday in April, Baxter and Rogers came to me, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, and asked if I would take a piece of timber down to Poplar; it was a very wet morning, and I said it was almost too bad to go out - they hurried me on, and said they must have it done, as their men were standing still - they both spoke together; what one said the other heard - they asked what we would do it for; I sent a lad up to ask master, and he said 3s. 6d. - I went to Mr. Astley's, Stone-stairs wharf; the timber was landed, and we all helped to put it on the cart - I suppose it was then a quarter-past seven o'clock; it still rained very fast - I took it just beyond North-street bar, Poplar; I do not know whether it is Mr. Baxter's ground or not, but he told me to take it, and said he would meet me there; I did not take notice of the timber - it was only one stick; Baxter paid me on the ground - he had one foot standing on the log when he gave me the money.</p>

            . I am a soldier and a blacksmith. I know Mr. Baxter, and I know several buildings he has going on in the East India-road, and some cottages at the back of the road. I went to the North-bar, to look for work one Friday morning, about the 8th or 9th of April, I think about half-past six o'clock - I saw Baxter and Rogers there, in conversation with each other; I cannot tell what about - I saw by and by a stick of timber brought there, and it went into a small gate; Allen was the carman who brought it - it was put into Mr. Baxter's yard, and he rubbed his foot on the ground, and then rubbed it on the timber, about the centre of it; I heard Rogers say"Baxter, you have no occasion to grumble, you have got that timber cheap enough;" and he said, "It came by this," holding up his fingers in a booked direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long did you look at the timber? A.Perhaps ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - Baxter was building some premises, or he was the master of some buildings in that neighbour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120090"></xptr>hood - he rubbed his foot on the ground, and then on the timber, probably to take the dirt off his shoe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You heard it was cheap enough, then of course you understood that some price had been paid? A. Yes, some price.</p>

On Saturday, the 9th of April, Foreman was taken into custody - I looked at my stock of timber, after returning from the East India-road; when the Policeman came to me I went with him to where the deals were, and from there to Baxter's -I saw Baxter on his premises, near the North-bar; I said,"Is your name Baxter?" he said Yes - I said, "Of whom did you buy the deals?" he said, "Of Rogers;" I said,"Have you bought any thing else?" he said No - I said,"Have you bought any thing else of him at any time?" he said No - I asked him again; he then said, "I bought some laths of him about a month ago;" I questioned him again if he had not bought any thing else of him at any time - his answer was No, using the word in a positive tone; I then said, "Where did you get the piece of timber from that lies over the way?" he said, "Oh, I bought that of Rogers yesterday;" I went into the yard, and saw the piece of timber of the thirteenth float, thirty-four marked on it, and three strokes, then a cross, and my name raced in with a knife, by Foreman - the letters were robbed out, as if with road dirt, not the mud of the Thames - I rubbed it off with my hand, and then saw the letters plainly; they were about the middle of the timber - we generally mark it there, that none may be cut off; I bought it as Memel timber, but I cannot swear to that - it was Baltic timber; Rogers had worked for me as a lath-render, for about four months, but not at my wharf - Baxter told me he had known Rogers for five years; I asked Baxter what he gave for it - he said 5l. a load, which would be 2s. a foot - that would be 3l. 8s.; I bought the whole float of the timber - he told me afterwards that he gave 2l. 5s. for the piece; that was all I heard him say, except before the Magistrate - it was after I saw Baxter that I examined my stock, and missed a piece of thirty-four feet; I had not sold any timber of the whole float - I had had it about three months.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.From whom did Foreman receive orders to carry out timber? A.From myself only, and then not without a note - I have a young man, but he does not give orders; Foreman never attends to any thing he says - I am the only person who ever gives directions for the removal of timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you went to Baxter's, did you make yourself or your business known? A. I asked of whom he bought the deals - I did not tell him my name; I did not mention the name of Rogers - I knew nothing of Rogers with regard to this transaction till he told me - I could not tell whether Foreman or Rogers took them; he said he bought the laths of Rogers, but I did not tell him he was my lath-render - I believe Rogers has absconded; I have not seen him since -I have offered a reward to find him; as I was going down the road to Baxter's, a carpenter pointed out the piece of timber to me, and said there was a piece which had come very suspiciously into the yard - that called my attention to it, and when I asked Baxter he said he bought it of Rogers; I believe Rogers was a thief, but not the only one - I do not recollect that I have said that Rogers was the thief; I will not swear I have not - the piece of timber was thirty-five feet cubic measure; I gave 5l. 5s. a load for it - I gave 3l. 11s. for this piece; it was not a damaged piece.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, mind, I warn you, do you swear it was not a damaged piece? A. No, Sir, it was not; there was at one end what we call a blee, which was owing to the frost stinting it in its growth, but it would not be considered a blemish - it would sell for quite as much, and, this being a clean piece, would be preferred to many other pieces - it was in no respect injured; I did not apprehend Baxter -I gave him notice to come against Foreman, to attend and give evidence relative to the piece of timber; the Magistrate had let him go, after two examinations, but we got additional evidence after that - we did not take him before the Magistrate again; the Magistrate said he would not retract his steps. I must take him before the Grand Jury -I had then got the witnesses, White and the carman. Allen; they were not examined till the fourth examination - Baxter was not apprehended at all, when we went before the Grand Jury - he was taken at his own house yesterday - he was discharged after the third examination; I told him, in his own yard, that I should prefer a bill against him, and asked him the reason he did not attend at the office - he said he had no order but mine, and he should not attend to that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Foreman had lived with you three or four years, and Rogers as many months? A. Yes - I offered a man 1l. to find Rogers; Foreman did not tell me where to find Rogers - I do not think Rogers worked on his own account; he was very much distressed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know where Rogers lived? A. No, I do not exactly. This timber was taken from my Limehouse premises - Foreman was principally engaged there - he was all that Friday in that yard; no timber sold on my account has been removed from my premises, only little trifling things, of a few shillings value - Rogers had no authority to sell; he had no authority over the other workmen.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BEAL. I am a Police-constable. I apprehended Baxter at his own house yesterday.</p>
               <p>Foreman's Defence. On the Friday morning I was going to work, and went and got 1d. worth of coffee down by the dock-gates - I there met Rogers, whom I had not seen for some time before; he said could I do a job for him - I said I could not, it got too near six o'clock; he said I might as well earn 1s., which Mr. Dixon allows us to do - he said, "Get a boat, and take that timber, and I will go and get the crane ready at Stone-stairs;" the tide did not set till a quarter to seven, and he came twice to me to say what a while I was - I said if he could get a man to do it quicker I would go on; he said, No, as I had the job, I might go on - I took it up when there was water, and then I was asked if I could not book it on; I said, No - I staid a quarter of an hour; they then asked me again, and I put the books, and they took it up, and paid the man for it, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120091"></xptr>believe - I then asked Mr. Rogers for the 2s. he was to give me, and he went to Mr. Baxter, whom I had not known before, and got some money of him; he then gave me 2s., and said he would in the afternoon give me a drop of gin. and gave me the 6d. to pay the lock-man - I went and got my breakfast, and went to work, as I had lost a quarter of a day, which is 9d.; I leave it to the Jury to say if I should be guilty of such an error to be torn away from my wife and family, as I have been - Rogers was in the same employ with me, and he had hired a cart of Mr. Dixon, to carry bricks to some buildings of his.</p>
               <p>MR. DIXON. He did request that a man might go and get some old bricks, and I told the man to go and do it -Foreman was not at liberty to do any work without asking leave; he must have seen my name on the timber.</p>
               <p>Foreman. If I had known it had been Mr. Dixon's I should certainly have stopped it - I was glad to earn 1s. for my wife and family.</p>
               <p>Baxter's Defence. Rogers came to me on the 7th of April, and asked if I wanted any timber - I said I did, but I had bought of Christopher and Son for many years; he said, "I have some timber I obtained from over the water, by exchanging laths" (I knew he was a lath-render) - he said he wanted 3l. 5s. a load, and it was good Memel timber; I said, "Where can I see it?" he said, "It will be at Rain's wharf to-morrow morning, at half-past six o'clock;" I went there, and waited till seven, and then it came - I went and helped to land it; I measured it, and there were thirty-four feet - I gave him the price he asked me; it came to 2l. 2s. 6d., and 2s. carriage - it was taken to Poplar, and unloaded in an open yard, next to the East India-road; I know nothing of the timber, except what he told me, that he had obtained it by exchanging laths for it.</p>

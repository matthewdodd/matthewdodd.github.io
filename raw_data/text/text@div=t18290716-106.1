            . On the 7th of July, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was in bed; my landlady called me, and said that two boys had taken a silk handkerchief out of my hat, which stood on a box in the room; I dressed myself, and went out - I met Bain; I went on with her till I saw the prisoners, and she said they were the persons; I took them - they both denied it; I have never found my handkerchief.</p>

            . My mother keeps this house. On the the morning of the 7th of July, I saw the prisoners come and look in at the shop window, while I was standing at the parlour door; they went away, and returned immediately - I am sure they are the boys; I had not seen them before - I saw Collins put his arm in, and take the handkerchief out of Mr. Pitt's hat; I told my mother - she told me to go after them; I did not see what they did with it - I am sure they were in company, and close together; I met Pitt near the Yorkshire Stingo, and went with him after the prisoners.</p>

I was at the corner of Circus-street, and saw the prosecutor collar one of the prisoners; the other was going off, but I took him - they denied having the handkerchief: I asked where they had been that night, or what brought them out so soon in the morning - they said they were going to look for work; Collins said he had slept at home, but after I had locked them up I went to Collins' mother, who said she had not seen him for a week.</p>
               <p>Collins' Defence. I met this young man at the corner of Stingo-lane; we came down Circus-street, and were going to look for work; the prosecutor and girl were standing there - the girl said, "I think that is one of the lads."</p>

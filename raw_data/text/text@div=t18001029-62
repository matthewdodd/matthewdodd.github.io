             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cliston. I am a furniture-printer in Tavistick-street; I have supplied Mr. Snell with printed furniture for some time: On the 6th of October, in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Jones's, and there I saw a remnant in his window, a yard and three quarters of a new pattern, of which I had sold four or five pieces to Mr. Snell.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you sold any of it to any other person? - A. I had only sold one other piece, which is properly accounted for.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you mean to swear positively you had sold no more? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>- JONES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a piece-broker in Wych-street; Mr. Ovey applied to me; I delivered to him some pieces of furniture, which I had bought of a woman.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You do not know the prisoner? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cliston. I went with Mr. Snell and Mr.Ovey to the lodgings of the prisoner, where I found these things(producing the property); we took the prisoner with us from Mr. Snell's shop; his wife was at home, and a little child; I found part of the things between the bed and sacking; he confessed that he had taken them.</p>


               <p>Q. Were any promises or threats made use of? - A. No; this piece of ticking I found under the bed; it is four yards of striped linen.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing about the piece found at Jones's? - A. His wife said; in the presence of the prisoner, that she took it to Mr.Jones's</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an upholsterer, in Hanover-street, Long-acre; the prisoner was my foreman; I trusted and reposed every thing in him; he had a guinea and a half a week, besides the liberty of making any thing at over hours, which amounted in all, I am sure, to more than a hundred guineas a year; I went to his house, and found these things, which Carpmeal has produced; they are all my property; this piece, found at Jones's, is also mine; I was present in the room when he acknowledged his guilt, and begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that a voluntary confession? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of these articles being your property? - A. No more than of my own existence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever suffer him, or give him authority, to take such articles home? - A. No; he did work for me at over hours, but never such things as these; I had not the smallest suspicion of him till the morning before. <rs id="t18001029-62-verdict349" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man. I recollect seeing the prisoners many nights before this—on the 19th of December I saw them for half an hour previous to the theatre breaking up—they were in company, attempting several gentlemen as they came down—trying their pockets—that induced me to watch them—I saw them following a gentleman, (I cannot say it was the prosecutor,) and take something from his pocket—they turned up a court, and Jones showed Harrison what appeared to me to be a silver snuff-box—I followed them up the court, but did not meet a policeman till near the top of Drury-lane—I then told him, and he went and took them both—Harrison began to make some resistance, and I took hold of Jones—the handkerchief and snuff-box were found on Jones.</p>

I was on duty, and Phillips told me of this—I crossed and took both the prisoners—Harrises resisted—I got Phillips to hold Jones while I searched Harrison, and while I did that, Phillips produced the snuff-box from Jones's pocket—I then took them to the station, and found this handkerchief in Jones's hat.</p>

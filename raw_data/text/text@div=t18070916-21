            . I live opposite of Mr. Alexander. About seven o'clock in the evening Mr. Alexander came to me and told me he had been robbed: we both of us turned down Church-street, we saw the three women that had been in the shop; I saw Holmes walking about ten yards before them on the same side of the way; I asked Mr. Alexander if that woman had been in the shop, he said no; I walked before Holmes, she was holding her apron up by the two corners, as if she had something in it. I let her go on till she came into Shoreditch; I then went up to her and said you have got something that is not your own. At that instant Mr. Alexander came up and took it out of her lap.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the three women and Margaret<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160013"></xptr>Holmes together. - A. They did not seem to speak at all to Holmes.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKREY. I am an officer of Worship-street. I produce a piece of Irish linen, and four pieces of ribbon. The Irish linen was taken out of her cap at the office, and the four pieces of ribbon I took out of her pocket; I asked her where she got these things, she said they were given her by a woman in the street whom she did not know. The other woman was brought to the office afterwards by Hancock.</p>

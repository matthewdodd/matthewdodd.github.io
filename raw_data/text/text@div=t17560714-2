               <p>Q. Had you your tankard then?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. I never miss'd it at all. The prisoner went out of the house, and I happening to be on the other side of the way saw her hustle something out of her left hand under her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she by herself in your house?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. Yes, all the time she was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. I never saw her before. I ask'd her the reason of her staying so long; she said a young man had promised to come by eight o'clock, and as he did not come she would stay no longer. I mistrusted she had got my tankard, and call'd out, Mistress, Mistress, thinking that if she had it she would discover it by running away. She ran away, and I after her; I saw her stop'd by Mr. Spencer: we were almost all together. She drop'd the tankard, and he took it up in my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the prisoner when it was taken up?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. I believe I was about 5 or 10 yards from her when I saw it drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her drop it?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. She was the nighest person, I saw her drop it. She ran, after the tankard was taken up, but was soon taken. I got a constable, and charged him with her. [The tankard produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>

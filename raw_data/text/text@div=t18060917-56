               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he was not in liquor, and he gave me the watch to go and sleep with him all night.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutor) What time of the night was it. - A. Near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you in liquor. - A. I was not, perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to know what you were about. - A. Perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer her the watch at all. - A. Not in the least; so far from it, when she was taken to the watchhouse she said I gave her two shillings. I wish you to use as much lenity as you can.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am a patrol; the prisoner at the bar and the prosecutor were brought to the watchhouse (the watchman is not here), he charged the prisoner with picking his pocket of his watch, I searched the woman, I could not find any thing upon her; the watch was at the front part, I saw her handling herself there when the watch was taken from her, then she said that the gentleman gave her the watch to have connexion with her; I took it from her front part under her petticoats.</p>

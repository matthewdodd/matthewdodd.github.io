                  </hi>. My husband is a printer. Inglis hat been lodging at our house for ten months—I believe him to be honest—he keeps good hours, generally speaking—I never heard anything against him in my life—it is about half a mile from my house to Union-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What house do you keep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. 11, Russell street—Inglis is not married that I am aware of—he had a key of our street door—I do not know who washed for him—I know nothing about his linen—he is a printer and pressman, in Fleet-street—I know that he wore socks by seeing them rolled up in his cupboard, when I have gone to it—another young man, a compositor, lives in the room with him—Inglis may have stopped out once or twice of a night and I not know it, as he had a key.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>), <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I saw Inglis before 2 o'clock in the morning in a public house, of the sign of The Old Fish, Baldwiu's gardens; it was on the night of the 15th—he was with Berkley, Marley, and several others—they were all drinking in front of the bar—that is close by where I took Marley and Inglis—a woman named Jackson keeps the house—Marley was in bed with a woman in the first-floor front room when I took him.</p>

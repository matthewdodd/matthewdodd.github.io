                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Leicester-square. It is a house kept for the purpose of play—I am waiter and also an assistant in the house—I know the prisoner—I have seen him at the house on two or three oc<lb></lb>casions—he played on two occasions—I first saw him there eight or nine days before the 29th of December—I saw him on Monday night, the 28th, about half-past twelve o'clock—I was in the billiard-room when he came—he asked me if there was any play—I said uo—he asked me to go up and play with him—I did so—there was nobody else there—be<lb></lb>fore we began to play he asked what bank there was, and I showed him 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in Bank of England notes, in the cash-box—that was all the money that was in the bank—we began playing at hazard—he lost 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he paid in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country bank-notes—he went away, and returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and proposed to play again—we played at hazard—he lost 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he paid in country bank-notes, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and among them was one of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Air. Thompson, who is the pro<lb></lb>prietor of the house, came into the room while we were playing, and as<lb></lb>sisted at the table in gathering the counters—he came in during the time he was playing on the first occasion, and was present on the second occasion, but went away after the prisoner left a second time—he was there all the time of the second play—after the second play the prisoner asked, if he went and got some more money, whether we would play with him again—I said it was late, it was past our hour, which is twelve—it was then five or six o'clock in the morning—he went away, returned in about twenty minutes, and I played with him again at hazard—he lost 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the third occasion—he paid it in a bank post bill of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then went away and did not return again—he lost altogether 525<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put the notes he had given me into the cash-box with the Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land notes—there were no country bank notes there before—Mr. Thomp<lb></lb>son was gone when the prisoner came back the third time, and the house was shut up—I was going to bed, and was partly undressed—I told him it was past hours, and we could not play; but he said he would have satisfaction, he had lost a good deal of money, and I had a right to give him a chance to get it back again, and he produced a pocket-book, and said, "There is money in that;" so we played—I put the whole of the money into the bank—it is a mahogany box—I took it from the box about</p>

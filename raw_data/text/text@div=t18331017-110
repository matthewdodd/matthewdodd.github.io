            . I am the wife of Michael Baker; we live in Mill-yard. I know the prisoner - on the evening stated I left my house to carry some work home; I saw the cart standing in a yard which I had to pass through, and I saw the prosecutor there with the prisoner; he was very much intoxicated, and she had her right arm round his neck, and her hand in his pocket - a lady said, "That gentleman has been robbed;" the prosecutor then took hold of me, and said he would not let me go till he had procured a policeman; I saw the prisoner take something from the ground, and she ran very quickly away towards Mill-yard, where she lives -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170065"></xptr>the prosecutor would not let me go till I took him to the station-house where we got the officer - I went with him to Mill-yard, and showed him the house in which the prisoner lives - the prisoner was not at home, but the landlady produced the watch.</p>

             (police-constable H 150). I went to the house in Mill-yard; we knocked but there was no one there; we waited about five minutes, when the landlady came running up; the door of the house is in a nook next to a chapel, and she could not see us till she came to the door - she then asked me what I wanted, and on seeing the prosecutor, she said, "O, I know what he wants, he wants his watch - he left it on the bed, and I suppose if he gets his watch he will not proceed any further" - she produced this watch to me in the house, it has a bruise on the back of it, and it was all over mud.</p>

                  </hi>. I live opposite Mr. Delany. On the 20th of June I saw a boy, who I believe to be Duffy, run off, with four pocket-handkerchiefs in his hand—he had just left the shop-door—he ran down Adam-street—I gave an alarm to a young man, who alarmed Reardon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Joseph Delany, a pawn-broker, in Church-street, Rotherhithe. I heard an alarm, and missed a red, yellow, and blue handkerchief, which had been safe inside the shop five minutes before—I ran out, and at the corner of Adam-street, I saw Duffy turn the corner shop with a bundle in his hand—I could see a red handkerchief—I followed him for half a mile—he got into some alleys—I lost sight of him—he turned into Rotherhithe-street, and I gave him up at last, but I saw him close to the water side, with the prisoner Hands and another in a boat, rowing away as fast as they could—I called to them—they turned and looked at me—I called to the waterman to bring him back, but they rowed on—I got into a boat and followed them—I gained on them within about three yards, and saw Duffy take the handkerchiefs from his bosom, double them up, and I could distinctly see my tickets pinned on the corner of them—he put them into the water, and Hands took the scull and tried to sink them—I followed them, and Hands jumped out and swam ashore—Duffy got out into a coal wharf—I secured him—I returned and Hands had hid himself—he got into the boat I had been in—I gave them both into custody—I have lost the handkerchiefs altogether.</p>

               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. On the 7th of February, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, Swan, waiting about in St. John-street, for a quarter of an hour - I watched him, and saw Wilkins come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180019"></xptr>from Mr. Fish's shop - I knew he was a servant there. Swan joined his company immediately as he came out, he beckoned Wilkins down Parson's-court. I there saw Wilkins give him something, they immediately came from the court and repassed Mr. Fish's shop; I saw Swan had something bulky in his pocket, which he had not when he was waiting in the street; I followed them to the Bull in St. John-street, where they had a glass of something to drink. Wilkins said, I shall see you to night. Swan said, I will meet you there - They parted; I followed Swan up Charterhouse-lane, and asked what he had got there - He said, what was that to me. I said I insisted upon knowing what it was - He said, he would see me d-d first; with a great deal of persevance I got him to the watchhouse. I asked him to pull it out of his pocket; he said, he would not. I pulled one pound and a half of tobacco out, and told him I would fetch the man whom he had it from. I went to the shop and brought Wilkins to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I had been watching opposite the shop for a quarter of an hour.</p>

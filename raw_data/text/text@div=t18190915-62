            . I am an officer. I was in Skinner-street, and saw the prosecutor on the other side of the way, followed by the prisoner and two others - the prisoner let his apron down. They began to walk very fast; I watched them to the end of Fleet-market, where they closed up to him. The prisoner opened the gentleman's pocket with his right-hand, and with the left took the handkerchief out, put it in his side-pocket, and crossed the street towards the market - upon seeing me he ran. I laid hold of him as he turned the corner, and gave him in charge of two gentlemen while I fetched the prosecutor, who had got as far as Ely-place. I took him back, and produced the handkerchief, which he claimed.</p>

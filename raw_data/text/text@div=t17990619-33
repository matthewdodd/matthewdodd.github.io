             sworn. - I am a linen-draper, and was coming down Holborn; before I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw the prisoner standing by the window of the prosecutor's shop, and he took the trunk very deliberately, and walked off; I concluded he had stolen it, upon which I gave the alarm, and he began to run.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was not in a state of mind to know what I was about, therefore, in consequence of that, I did not suppose it could be any injustice to any person, as I really did not know what I was doing of; I have no witnesses just at this moment, not knowing my trial was coming on; I should have supposed that Mr. Harrington, knowing my father and myself, would not, therefore, have brought me here, and when he takes sums of money, as he does from my father, or have come forward in such a way; my witnesses will be ready to come forward on Saturday, some respectable witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Harrington). Q. Do you happen to know his father? - A. I served him about fourteen years ago, and from that time I have never seen him. When the prisoner was a boy, I believe I have seen him; I did not wish to bring him here, but wished to get him abroad, and he would not go.</p>

I gave my coat to Andrews, telling him to take care of it, for there was something valuable in it. I then went to get a cup of coffee with a gentleman who asked me, and staid about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour; after that, I felt in my great coat pocket, for I wanted a ten pound note out of it, and then I missed the notes.</p>

            . I received from the last witness his great coat; I took it, and rolled it up, and laid it on a bench in the parlour, by the side of the clock; there was nobody in the room at that time but Dale, the prisoner. The people were mobbing him in the yard, saying he was an informer, and I took him to get a glass of gin, and to get him out of the row; I took him into the parlour, in which I had laid the great coat; I left him alone for about five minutes to enquire something about him; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060011"></xptr>on my return, he was gone, before Hine came.</p>

            . I lodged in the same house with the prisoner and his wife. Before the 10th of October, I had means of knowing that they had no money. Before the 13th, they purchased some new cotton at thirteen pence halfpenny per yard. Mrs. Dale said it was her money, and that she had taken it for her first husband's pension at Somerset House. The prisoner said that it was not hers, for it was his, and that he had a damned good run at a coachman for it, who owed him twenty pounds, and had paid him the best half of it.</p>

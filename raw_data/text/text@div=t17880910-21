               <p>Prisoner to prosecutor. Pray what mark have you on those cups and saucers? - There is a mark on several of the things.</p>
               <p>What particular marks? - There is no particular marks, only they are mine.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to prosecutor. Was not the door of the house locked, and did not your other man keep the key in his pocket? - No; it was only bolted, the lock was spoiled, and could not be used.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of August last Mr. Davis came to me to take charge of the prisoner on suspicion, which I did; he had a hearing, and was remanded for the next day; I went with Davis to his washerwoman's, and found these things; he said, that morning he got up at six, and went to carry his linen; this is the property; the Alderman asked the prisoner how he came by them; he said he took them from his master,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100019"></xptr>and meant to have brought them back again unknown to his master.</p>

               <p>Those things I never stole, I bought them at different times as I went through the street, to make them a present to the woman; I should have bought them of my master, but I understood when I was going to live with him, that he would take no person who had any acquaintance in London; and the first question he asked me was, if I had any acquaintance; this man, who says he saw them in my pocket, came and told him; he took me on suspicion; I have no witnesses; I am quite a stranger, and therefore he is doing all he can to hurt me; he cannot swear to the goods.</p>

            . I live with my father (who is a watchman) in Cowheel-alley, Golden-lane. I have known the prisoner about a month - he used to go into the next house to where I live, and I used to see him come out again about eight o'clock in the morning; I knew his person very well. On this Sunday night I was lying down at my father's door, and saw him run into the next house - there was another with him, whose face I did not see; the prisoner ran as hard as he could, with his right hand in his breeches pocket; the prosecutor came by two or three minutes afterwards, and said he had lost his watch and seals; there were some persons standing at the window; I was afraid they would come and beat me, or I should have told him what I had seen; I saw the prisoner again about ten minutes after; Mr. Pledger was gone; he came out of the house - he had the watch in his hand, and was shewing it to the persons who stood there; he said to them, "We have got it now - it is all right;" I had seen those persons before; they do not live about there; Mr. Pledger saw them when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110089"></xptr>he came up, and they sent him the wrong way - about a dozen of them stood there; the prisoner went into Golden-lane, with the man who had run into the house with him. On Monday I saw Harrison, the constable, take him out of the same house as he ran into; I am sure I saw the watch and seals - there was a key to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you outside the door? A. I was resting my head on the step of the door - I saw the watch in his hand quite plain; the face of it was up, not the back; I cannot say whether it was gold or silver; I was lying down when he ran by, but I got up and looked round the corner; I was standing up when he held the watch up - he held it quite low down; I told my father at one o'clock in the morning, when he came off watch; I cannot tell the colour of the key or seals; I saw two seals; there was a gas-light.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, I went to the next house to Farrow's, in Cowheel-alley, and found the prisoner there; I told I took him for stealing a bundle of linen - but at the watch-house I told him it was for a watch; he asked at Worship-street what time it happened; I told him at half-past nine o'clock; he said he could prove he was at supper at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you tell him it was about linen? A. Three or four men were round, and in that neighbourhood if I had told him the charge, he might have been rescued.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had no charge for linen? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I work for my brother in Blue Anchor-alley. I took a walk to Horusey House, returned at eight o'clock, and went to Oliphant's, the Hare and Hounds public-house, St. John-street, with a young man; we drank some half porter and half ale - it was then half-past ten o'clock; I bid him good-night, and told him I had to get up soon next morning; I went to work next morning - and as I came from breakfast I ran into this house in Cowheel-alley for a little dog, when this man came and took me; I saw the officer and his father with the boy saying, "Mind you say this and this;" I could not hear exactly what.</p>

            . My father keeps the Hare and Hounds, St. John-street. I first saw the prisoner two or three months ago; on the 7th of this month I saw the prisoner there about eight o'clock in the evening, in the taproom with three young men and a young woman - he remained there till half-past ten o'clock, and was not out of the house till then; I knew him by seeing him at the house before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know his name? A. Only by what I heard others say last Sunday week; one of the two who sat with him said, "Andrew Strahan, take hold of the pot and drink," that was all; I was never in Cowheelalley; on that evening I was sitting close to him; our waiter's name is Andrew Young and I said to him, "That is Andrew Strahan, not Andrew Young;" I did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell him you could prove where he was? A. His brother came on Monday, and asked my father if he knew the young man Andrew Strahan; my father said, "No, I do not by name, but perhaps my son may, as he is generally in the tap-room;" he called me, and said "Andrew Strahan;" I said Yes: there was a man here last night; they were in the left-hand room called the tap-room - it was called the parlour before my father took the house; several people were there - one named William Thomas.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember your young master making any remark about that? A. No; he went away about half-past ten o'clock; he could not have left before without my secing him; they had been drinking porter, half-and-half, and ale, he has been there several times before.</p>

On the night of the 22nd of September, a little after nine o'clock, I saw two men at the door of the house Mr. Stockdale formerly lived in, I saw them open the door in a curious way, they first looked about to see if any body noticed them; I saw them go in and shut the door very gently, I immediately went to Mr. Stockdale at the next door and gave information, after I had alarmed Mr. Stockdale, I got several people, the porter unlocked the door for us, we went in, Mr. Stockdale remained outside and several others, I was about the fourth man that went up stairs, on my going up the stairs I heard a running in the first floor, we immediately holloed out take care of the windows; I ran down stairs, and before I could get into the street these two men were secured.</p>

I had a candle in my hand; his back was towards me; I cannot swear to either of the prisoners. On the second step of the second floor I found these seven skeleton keys and this stick.</p>

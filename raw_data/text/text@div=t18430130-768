I drove the prisoner's cart—I first saw him between Wood-street and Milk-street—he was talking to somebody—he asked me to go with the cart and the boy—I refused to go at first, but afterwards consented, from the persuasion of the prisoner's brother—I went down Cheapside to the corner of Queen-street.</p>

I says to him, why don't you shew me the light? and as soon as they got me inside they locked the door on me, and it was all dark, and there were three bars at the windows; I was used very cruel, I saw the bar at the window in the morning and four or five padlocks on the door; that was a pity!

            After you was put into the coach how long were you in the coach before you got to Whitcomb-street? - A good while, half an hour or an hour, I believe it was; in about half an hour I arrived at Whitcomb-street, and when I got into the house I began to fight in the house before I would go up stairs; they wanted me to go up stairs; why should I be kidnapped in that manner? and when I shoved one of them from me, there was a rope slung about my neck, threw down stairs, and I catched it, as God happened, in my left hand here, and they dragged me up stairs by it; then when they dragged me up stairs they got about and stripped me start naked, and them two men were holding me, and the rest were stripping me; one of them was an agent in my time, and the other was the landlord of the house; they were two wicked ones. Was it not a shame, gentlemen, to serve me so? They took away my property, they took my watch and my clothes, three silk handkerchiefs, two pair of silk and cotton stockings, two cotton shirts, and my pumps all that I had.</p>
               <p>"Q. How long did you stay in this house in Whitcomb street? - A fortnight, locked up and to with bread and cold water.</p>
               <p>"Q. Were you locked up in that room all the time? - I was, in the back part of the house up stairs.</p>
               <p>"Q. And you never was permitted to go down stairs? - No, never.</p>
               <p>"Q. You said that you never was out of the kidnapping house from the time that you came in it, till the time they put you in the coach to carry you to Banbury? - Never.</p>
               <p>"Q. During the time you were in this room, was any body permitted to come in the room with you? - No, nobody but that jailer, and he left a pot of water with me and a bit of foul bread.</p>
               <p>"Q. So you was in this room for a fortnight and nothing to live upon hue bread and water; saw nobody hardly during that time? - No, only the turnkey.</p>
               <p>"Q. Look towards the bench, and see if you recollect the face of any person that sits there just by my lord. (Justice Kirby) - No, I never see the man in my life.</p>
               <p>"Q. You never went before any magistrate to be attested, in your sober senses? - Never in my days."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is possible to make a mistake in the hurry of a trial such as this was? - It is possible to mistake a word, but at this time I was desired to be particular in taking the evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Though it is possible to make a mistake in a word yet are you certain that what you have read is the substance and sense of what he swore? - Most certainly it is.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did this man stay at your house? - Near a fortnight, or some where thereabouts. He came quietly to the house, and sat down in the tap room and they had two or three pots of beer, he came there in a red jacket and white trowsers; a red regimental jacket. When the surgeon came he went up stairs and was examined, and then joined the rest of the recruits in a large room that is appropriated for their use, that they might be by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he go up to this room? - He followed the doctor very quietly up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a rope round his neck, or any violence used to make him go up stairs? - No, no such thing ever happened in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. During the fortnight he staid with you how was he dieted or fed? - We used to dress a joint every day for the recruits, and those that chose paid one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man the full liberty of eating and drinking as any person in the house might do? - Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. And what was done with those that did not chuse to dine? - They sent out for meat for themselves, and dressed it as they pleased; they had a gridiron and other things proper in the room.</p>

            About his drink, what drink had he? - He was in the habit of drinking gin; I hardly recollect his drinking any other liquor; he used to come down fourteen or fifteen times a day and have pennyworths of gin at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever to you, Mr. Kerr, or to your hearing and knowledge, complain of being locked up and confined, or complain of being prohibited of any thing but bread and water? - I never heard of such a complaint.</p>

            Were do you live? - In East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Pretty near this place? - Within twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this man had a watch or no you cannot say? - I cannot, but he asked me if I would sell him one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My friend asked you whether you ever saw this man before. Had you an opportunity to observe his person? - I was in the room with him about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any other part of his dress? - He had on a red jacket, and a pair of muscato trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his shoes? - He had a pair of regimental shoes, and he offered the old ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he buckles in them? - He had strings in them, and he was going to pull them out of the old one to put in the new ones; I told him he had no occasion to pull them out, they were not worth taking away, I left all but the jacket and shirt, they were not worth taking away.</p>

            Was that person examined before the magistrate, before he took the oath? - Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a person as far as you could judge of his state of mind, intoxicated or not? - If a person is in liquor the magistrates in general send them back, and if I perceive it I always turn them back.(The attestation read.)</p>
               <p>Court. Do you recollect the person of the man at all? - I have not the least doubt that he is the man, but I cannot swear positively, as far as my belief can go, I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say as far as belief will go, you will swear to him; I suppose that there are a great number of recruits attested before Mr. Serjeant Kirby? - A great number.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that this man attracted your attention more than any other? - Yes, he talked very wild, telling a story about meeting some lady</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe him to be sober though he talked so wild? - Yes, I did.</p>

            Be so good as to look at this attestation? - This is my attestation, and it does appear that such a man did come before me, and if he had had the least appearance of inebriety I should not have attested him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to form a judgment to a certainty, that you examined this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180104"></xptr>person? - It is my constant practice, in order to prevent misrepresentation.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of the person of the man? - Not the least on earth; but I have great reason to believe this to be the man, there was a man according to my recollection, that I conceived was concealing the truth, and that he belonged to his majesty's navy; and if he did I certainly should not have sworn him in; therefore I examined him very strictly; and I remember a man's telling a story of his coming to town, his landing at Deal, his going into the Hospital for three days or thereabouts; I asked him how he got money to come to London? he told all that story when he came here at the last session; and there are a great number of the other circumstances that I do remember being related by a recruit that I did attest, and I do remember this circumstance to have happened but to one man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp addressed the jury on the part of the defendant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been serving his majesty ever since I was seven years old, and for the honour of God send me back again.</p>

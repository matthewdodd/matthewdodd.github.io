               <p>I live in Bridge-street, Black-friars. On the 13th of January last, I was walking from Cheapside, into Bridge-street, in company with a gentleman; we heard a scuffle behind us, which was occasioned by Gobytus, the next witness, having taken the two prisoners into custody; we stopped to enquire the reason; and a person handed my handkerchief to me who was passing by.</p>
               <p>Who has the handkerchief? - Gobytus, the witness; I did not see the prisoners take it.</p>
               <p>Did you look to see if you missed your handkerchief? - Yes, I did, and it was gone; I know the handkerchief; there is a mark on it, J. D.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 48, Howland-street, Fitzroy-square, and am a printer. On the morning of 16th Jan., about twenty minutes to one o'clock, I was coming over Hungerford-bridge, from the Surrey-side—I had taken a glass of rum and water, a drop of porter, and a cigar, but I was perfectly col<lb></lb>lected, and knew what I was about—I had not got more than fifty yards from the toll-bar, when the prisoner Flood accosted me, and walked a few steps by me, and then pressed me so tight against the wall, that I was unable to extricate myself—I did not see Smart then—when I rescued myself a little from her hold she gave me a violent blow in my face, which sent me right across the bridge with great force, and knocked me down—I was stunned for a few minutes, and immediately afterwards Smart made his appearance, raised me up, wiped my face, and accused me of taking improper liberties—I was unable at the time to make any defence—I know nothing more till the officer came up—I told him I had lost my watch, which I had safe in my pocket three minutes before I went on to the bridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter, and live in Granby-place, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—I was passing over Hungerford-bridge on this morning, at twenty minutes to one o'clock, and saw Bates, with his back against the side of the bridge, and Flood close to him, apparently pressing him—I was about eight yards from them—I was going towards the Surrey-side, and had not arrived at where they were—I thought them not in a proper position, and crossed to the other side, meaning to pass them unnoticed—when I had passed them about three yards, I heard a sort of blow; I instantly turned round, and saw Bates in the act of falling—at the same time, I saw a man, who I had not seen before, come from the recess on the left—he was in the act of rising when I first saw him—the woman rushed past me to make her escape to the Surrey-side—I called out" Police" and "Murder" till I saw the toll-man come out of his box, and saw the shine of a policeman's hat in the centre of the bridge—the woman was taken on the bridge—I had lost sight of her for more than a moment when I turned my head—I did not see her face when I first saw her with the man—when I advanced, I kept her in sight, constantly crying out "Police" and "Murder," and she was stopped—about eight yards before she got to the gate, I saw her hand in a raised position—I accompanied the policeman to where Bates was—Smart was there then, apparently supporting him—I swear positively he is the same man I saw rise from the recess—I accused Flood of knocking Bates down, and said, "That is the man that came from the corner," putting my hand on Smart—he instantly began to <hi rend="italic">bounce</hi> me about with a sort of <hi rend="italic">domineer</hi> or threat, and said, "No; you must be mis<lb></lb>taken"—I said, "I am positive you are the man;" but from his continuing to <hi rend="italic">bully</hi> me, I began to be fearful I might be mistaken—the woman immedi<lb></lb>ately said, "Do you mean to say I am the woman who knocked the man down"—I said, "Yes; I swear it," and clapped my hand on her shoulder—she immediately gave me a desperate blow in the eye, which nearly sent me over—I continued to call out "Murder" and "Police"—I rushed down to the toll-house, and begged the toll-man to spring his rattle—a policeman was there at the time, and had charge of Flood—I met two people, and begged them to go to the policeman's assistance—the prosecutor was then bleeding; but I was in too excited a state to think about him—next morning he ap<lb></lb>peared in a dreadful state—I never saw a man so dreadfully beaten about—his eyebrow was cut; and there was a hole or cut in the forehead, and one under the eye, which, I think, must have been done with some instrument—I pointed out to Bradley, the policeman, the place where Flood raised her arm—I should say that is nearly a hundred yards from where I first saw Bates and Flood.</p>

I then saw the prisoner running down Exeter-street - I pursued him, and called Stop thief! he took up the flaps of his coat, and ran on - he dropped one lock; I still pursued till he was stopped - I took him back to No. 15; he then gave up the other lock, and took two screw-drivers from his hat; the house belongs to Mr. William Bromley, for whom I work - it was not in habited; we had lost twenty-seven locks the Saturday before.</p>

             SUTTON. I am a carpenter. I had been repairing the locks, and putting them on, at No. 20- these are two which I had fitted on two of the doors; I have tried them, and they fit in every respect - I am sure they are two that I had put on, and left safe on the Saturday; I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

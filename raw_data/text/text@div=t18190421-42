             here in February Session - he was convicted. On the 30th of January I missed these goods, and went with an officer to a person's house of the name of Macintosh, where I found the prisoner at work; I asked him if he had received any goods from Elliott, my servant? he denied it for sometime, but on pressing him further, he said he had received them. I gave him in charge. He said they were at his lodgings, which were a few doors off. We went with him, and found the articles stated in the indictment in his box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. He said if he had known that Elliott had stolen them, he would not have taken them in.</p>

            , JUN. I am an officer. On the 30th of January I apprehended Elliott, and went with Mr. Eland to Macintosh's, where we found the prisoner at work, as a tailor. Mr. Eland gave him in charge, and accused him of receiving the things from Elliott; he denied it for sometime, and seemed much alarmed. Macintosh said,</p>
               <p>"if you have any thing belonging to Mr. Eland, you had better show them where it is." We went to his lodgings, which were about two doors from Macintosh's, went up to the room where he lodged, and he unlocked his box - he took the key out of his pocket, and in the box I found the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. ELAND re-examined. I live at the corner of Sun-court; my back window looks into the court, where the prisoner lodged.</p>

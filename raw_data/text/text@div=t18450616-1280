On the 5th of June, about ten minutes after seven o'clock in the morning, I came down stairs from my bed-room, and opened the shop door—I did not take down the shutters—I went into the parlour to make a fire, leaving the door between the parlour and shop open—while making the fire, I heard some one walk into the shop—I took no notice at first, thinking it was the milk-boy—I afterwards heard a tapping noise, as if some one was sounding a chest of tea—there was a large tea-chest there full of tea—I directly turned my head, and saw the prisoner standing on the tea-chert, with his hand on a bag of coffee that stood upon it—I saw him sounding the chest of tea, as if to see whether it was full or empty—I directly ran into the shop—he took the bag of coffee up in his arms, and ran out at the shop door—I ran after him as fast as I could, and told him to put that coffee down, it did not belong to him—he dropped it on the cill of the shop door—I stood in the middle of the pavement, and kept calling out, "Stop that man, stop that boy, that is him!"—he had not got past one shop window when I first called out—he ran very fast, and almost ran over a witness—I should think he dropped the coffee about three or four yards from where he took it up—he ran down Brick-lane, up Garden-row, and Plant-street, and up John's-row again—I called out both ways, but no one would stop him—I saw Mr. Clark—he would have caught him had I called out "Stop thief," but I had not presence of mind, I was too much frightened—this is the coffee—it is the property of Mr. Ward Slaten.</p>

                  </hi> My husband is under-foreman at a saw-mill, and we live at No. 2, Cottage-grove, next door to the prisoner's. On the morning of the 5th of June I went into his mother's house, about half-past seven o'clock, as near as I can guess, I will not say to five minutes—I went into the room—there are but two rooms, and they join each other—I saw the prisoner in bed, and spoke to him—I saw him lying in his bed, talking to his sister's baby—I am no relation of theirs.</p>

I serve Mrs. Morton with milk—on Thursday morning, the 5th of June, I served her, between half-patt seven and eight o'clock, I cannot tell to a minute or two—I heard the prisoner at home—he was in bed—he said, "Is that you, Mrs. Tucker?"—I said, "Yes; are you not up yet?" and he called his sister to take her baby.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. William Hayhow; he lives in High-street, Shadwell - these boots are his. -On the evening of the 14th of September the witness called my attention to what had occurred, and I ran into the street; I saw the prisoner running, and followed him - he got to the bridge; I cried Stop thief! and two men attempted to stop him - he threw them off - as soon as I got three yards on the bridge I collared him; he said I was as wrong as ever I was right to take him, as he had done nothing - I shook him; he said, "Don't ill use me."</p>

In consequence of an anonymous letter, we employed Clinton and Sergeant to watch our premises; and in in consequence of a message which Sergeant sent me, I went to the Lion and Lamb, public-house, Golden-lane, and there saw Ridout; it was about a hundred and thirty yards from our premises. Ridout and his wife were present when we searched the house, and found a paper parcel under the counter in the bar; it contained five pieces of paper-hangings, of rather a common sort, worth 22 s.; I knew it to be our property. We had sent none of it out by Long that day; it is a pattern which only ourselves make.

            . I am a city officer, I was applied to watch the proceedings of Long, I began to watch on the 5th or 6th, I saw him go from his masters' to the Lion and Lamb public-house, he dined there with Ridout, and his wife and Wayman; I saw him go in there and dine on the 8th also. On the 7th, I saw him carry something there, which he brought out of his masters' house, when he got there he put it under the counter, in the presence of Ridout and his wife, and left it there. On the 12th, I saw him go again, he brought something from his masters, house, and left it with Mrs. Ridout, in Ridout's presence. He took it through the door-way, into the private part of the house. On the 13th, I was on the watch, and at a quarter before nine o'clock, I saw Long come out of his masters' house, he looked up and down the street, to see if he was watched; I was out of sight; he then returned into his masters' house, and came out in a minute or two with a bundle of paper under his arm; I and Sergeant followed close behind him, into the Lion and Lamb public-house; he put the paper on the counter, to Ridout, who put it on a shelf under the counter; Long then went out of the house. I called for a glass of beer, and sat down opposite the counter; waited while Sergeant, the officer went for Mr. Cox, the paper remained under the counter. Ellis and Sergeant came in with a search warrant. When Mr. Cox came, I opened the wicket, and went behind the counter; no person was there but Ridout. I asked him, if he was the landlord; he said Yes; I put my hand to the parcel, and asked who it belonged to; he said, he did not know. I asked if it was his; he said No; his wife came into the bar; Ridout said to her, "Do you know who this parcel belongs to - "she said, No; I said, It was nonsense denying it, for I had seen him receive it. I gave it to Sergeants, and told him to go into the parlour with the prosecutor, to see if it was his property; they were a short time there, and Ridout left the bar as if to go up stairs. I said the officer had better go up with him, they went, and I said below with the prisoner. I went into the back yard, and saw a colour-pot full of colouring; I said "I believe that is something like the colour-pot which Long brought here the other morning." Ridout's wife said, in his hearing, she believed it was, Long brought it on the 9th, and she had put some red lead in to colour the white, it had been white lead. Ridout said, "That is my property, I bought it and paid for it." Long lived at the corner of Addle-hill and Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Addle-hill is a long way from the prosecutors - A. Yes; Long did not go there to meals, as a journeyman would.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it is the custom for publicans to take care of parcels - A. I do not know, it was concealed under the counter. The house is a resort for all the common women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Were you near to Long - A. Yes; I am sure he was carrying paper.</p>

We went up stairs, and found in a cupboard in a front room, four pieces of paper hanging, a quantity of remnants, and two or three pieces of canvas.

               <p>MR. COX. In consequence of information, I went to the Lion and Lamb, public-house, on the 13th of November; Ellis had a search warrant; Ridout and his wife were in the bar, his wife said to him, "You are a ruined man, I wished you to have nothing to do with Long," I and Ellis went up stairs, and in the front room on the first floor. I saw Wayman in bed, we told him we suspected he had some of my property there, he said we might search - Ellis found a parcel containing four pieces of paper, and a large quantity of remnants, in Wayman's room, and some hessing; we went up stairs, and found a large quantity of hessing there, it was all put together, and brought down stairs, there was thirty-seven yards of hessing. On Wayman's seeing we had got the hessing, he said "We have bought these of Long, and gave him 4 d. a yard for it;" Ridout's wife said, "No, we gave 5 d. a yard for it," she said she had bought it, and paid for it, and it was entered in the book; they had no bill of parcels of it. The lowest price we pay for it, is from 8 1/2 d., to 10 1/2 d., a yard to sell again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. The house was papered - A. Yes. Wayman's room was newly papered with my paper, it was perfect paper - the remnants were pieces which were cut off; the hessing is not used in papering, it is for packing. Wayman produced a bill for papering the rooms, and said Long sold it them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. When he said they bought it, Ridout's wife was present - A. Yes; I cannot say whether Ridout was present then.</p>
               <p>MR. AOLPHUS. Q. Did Wayman say who Long was - A. No. The whole pieces of paper were in Wayman's room.</p>

            . I was employed by Messrs. Cox, to watch the proceedings of Long. On the 7th of November, a little after six o'clock in the evening, I saw Long come out of his master's house with an iron pan, and a large bundle, which he took to Golden-lane, it was very heavy, and in canvas - I followed him into the Lion and Lamb, public-house, he opened the wicket of the bar, and put the bundle down behind the counter, and sat himself down; he took his apron, and wiped his hands as if they were dirty; Mrs Ridout gave him a glass of rum and water, and two or three more glasses, before he left the bar; Wayman came into the bar in his shirt sleeves, Long nodded to him, and he (Wayman) immediately stooped down, and picked up the parcel, and carried it out of the bar; he put his foot behind him and shut the door after him - in about half an hour after, Wayman came out of the house with a two gallon stone bottle on his shoulder, and went up Golden-lane. I staid there till a quarter past nine o'clock, when Long left. When he came from behind the bar, he called for a glass of rum to keep the cold out. On the 13th I went there again, and kept below till Mr. Cox came down, and said in Ridouts presence, that he was afraid Wayman would get away, I went up, and found him leaning with his arm on the pillow; I said, "I am astonished you should lay there, we cannot leave without you," he said, "I know that gentleman perfectly well, it is Mr. Cox, and I know his brother, they are respectable gentleman living close by here." Mr. Cox said, "These are officers, and must do their duty." I found a paint pot below, containing white lead, with red lead added to it - I asked Mrs. Ridout if it was not the pot Long brought that morning, she said Long brought it on the 9th, Ridout immediately said, "No that is mine, I bought it, and paid for it." I went and apprehended Long.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. All this property could not be in that bundle - A. No; it was the colouring tied up in hessing. Mrs. Ridout swept away the dirt which came through it.</p>

            . On the 13th of November, I went to the house; and went into the room where Wayman was in bed, and in the cupboard of one of the front rooms, I found two pieces of hessing, four pieces of paper-hanging, and a quantity of remnants. While he was dressing, he opened a drawer in which was another piece of hessing, I asked where he got it, he said he had had it sometime, and bought it of Long for 4 d., a yard; he afterwards admitted that he knew Long to be Mr. Cox's porter. On his coming down stairs all the articles were shewn to him, and he was brought away - I told Mrs. Ridout in his presence, that he said he gave 4 d., a yard for it, she said, "No, we gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050069"></xptr>5 d.," she then said to her husband, "I advised you to have nothing to do with Long, you are a ruined man".</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Wayman put in a long written defence, stating, that Ridout had the care of his business, and it was usual for customers to leave parhels to be taken care of; that Longs parcels were always in wrappers, and he never knew the contents. and that Long offered to paper the house, stating that his master allowed him a profit on it.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. COX. Q. Were the rooms papered with the same pattern as the four pieces - A. No; the remnants might be the same pattern.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 53, William-street, Regent's-park. On the 2nd of July I was employed at Mr. Halfyard's, cutting out work, but between twelve and one o'clock a gentleman called on me on my own business, and I saw the prisoner come off the step of Mr. Halfyard's door with a pair of shoes in his hand, which I had cut out and made myself - he was a stranger - the shoes had been in the window; he could not take them without going into the shop - I was standing outside, talking to a gentleman; I thought he had bought them, but next morning I understood they were missing - he had been in the course of the same day to be measured for a pair of shoes, and afterwards came back and stole these - next morning they told me a pair of shoes were missing - they said me the prisoner lived at No. 7, Clarence-gardens; I went there, and told him I had come for the pair of shoes he had taken from Mr. Halfyard's the day before - he said he had seen no shoes - I said, "Yes, I saw you with a pair in your hand, which I made myself" - he said, he had not - I said, "I can swear it, and you must consider yourself as my prisoner" - he then cried, and said, "I did take them; a big boy, who was waiting outside, persuaded me to go back and steal them" - I took him back to Mr. Half-yard's, who insisted upon knowing where they were - he took me to Albany-street, to a boy named Stevens, where I found them - these are the shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not go back and take them - I had them instead of a pair I was measured for, and I paid for them.</p>

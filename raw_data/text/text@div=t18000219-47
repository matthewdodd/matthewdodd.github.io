             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, servant to Mr. Bunn, the corner of Wood-street and London-wall: On Friday, the 31st of January, I had information of a gold watch having been stolen; and on Saturday, the 1st of February, about four in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar offered me a gold watch to pledge, which answering, the description I had received, I detained the prisoner, and carried the watch to Mr. Witke's lodgings in Union-court, Broad-street; upon seeing the watch, he immediately said that was the watch he had lost; the came back with me to the shop, and gave charge of the prisoner; she wanted six guineas upon it; I did not ask her how she came by it; she said it was her father's; I asked her how long her father had had the watch, and she said, he had not had it long; I asked her if she knew what her father gave for the watch, and she said he gave twelve guineas for it; when I went to Mr. Witke's, I left her in the back shop with one of the boys; in the mean time Mr. Bunn's sister came in, and she pretended to her that she was very ill, and begged to go out for the air; and she, not knowing what she was detained for, let her go; but I came in before she had been gone three miniutes, and went after her, and brought her back; I am sure she is the same person.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; (produces the watch;) upon searching the prisoner, I found this purse, containing a gold pin, which Mr. Witke claimed; and this handkerchief I took off her neck, which Mr. Witke claimed; In taking her to the Compter, I asked her how she came by the watch; she said, it was given her to take care of for another person.</p>
               <p>Smith. When she brought the watch to me, she told me her father was lately dead, and she was under the necessity of raising six guineas upon that watch, for that she had him to bury.</p>
               <p>Witke. This is my, watch, but not the chain; this is a woman's chain; mine was a string, and two gold seals; I have not found the seals; the pin is mine, and the handkerchief.</p>

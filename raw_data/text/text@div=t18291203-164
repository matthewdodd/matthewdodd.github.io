               <p>JOHN TRAYS. I met the prisoner in the Old Kent-road, with these articles; he said they were given him at that house, and I took him there - he was five miles from there when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had them given to me by Tyler, an invalid; I had been robbed of my prize-money for the storming and caption of Bhurtpoor - I spoke to the landlord about it, and Tyler said he would make up half a sovereign; he kept me a long time, then brought out this bundle, and gave it me; I belong to the 59th regiment, which is now at Weedon.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NORMAN. Tyler was taken, but he denied it.</p>

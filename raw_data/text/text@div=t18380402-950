                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. On Thurs<lb></lb>day evening, the 29th of March, I went out of the shop on a message, and returned about twenty minutes to ten o'clock—the shop was then shut up—I tried the door and it was fast, and I went on my way home—a short distance from ray master's shop I met somebody, in consequence of which I turned back and passed the shop, and stopped talking to him for about a minute—I saw the prisoner at my master's door—I saw him stoop down to the lock, which you must stoop to undo, and use both hands at the same time—you cannot open it except you hold it, and use the key at the same time—he stooped as if he was opening the door—he opened it, and went in—I then ran to the door and rapped—I received no answer the first</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020042"></xptr>
               <p>time—I knocked a second time, and the prisoner opened the door to me—I immediately asked him if Mr. Peyton was at home—he said, no, he was not—I asked him where he was—he said, "Round the corner"—I asked him who he was, what was his business, and who had sent him—(I had a strong suspicion, because the night previous the house had been tried)—he said Mr. Peyton had sent him—I told him he must be wrong, and he must please to stop there till Mr. Peyton came and released him—he did not appear to know me—he said I need not alarm myself, that Mr. Pey<lb></lb>ton's young man had sent him as well—I then said to him, "I am his young man, and I am sure I have not sent you"—that caused him to be frightened—he made a rush forward—I had got hold of him by the coat—he struck me a violent blow on the head, and ran away—I followed him—I saw him put his right hand back, and pull something out of his pocket, which I thought to be a life preserver—he immediately struck me on the hat, above the head—he happened to hit the soft part of the hat, not the part next my head—I still followed him, and cried out "Stop thief"—a watchman ran off the pavement, and endeavoured to stop him in the middle of the road, and he knocked him down—another young man rushed for<lb></lb>ward directly and stopped him, and as soon as I saw him encountered with another, I rushed forward and helped to secure him, and he was given into custody—I afterwards returned to my master's shop, and found some shoes and cloth boots on the floor—some were packed in a bag lying on the floor—they were removed from their proper places of deposit in the shop—the bag did not belong to my master—there was a second bag lying close by it.</p>

            . I am a mealman. On Sunday night the 22d of March, about ten o'clock, I was going with my brother to a neighbour's, about 100 yards off. As I went out of my gate, I saw the prisoner and two others pass - I suspected them; the prisoner had something under his great-coat, and was a few yards behind the others; the other two kept their faces hid from me as much as possible, which made me suspect them the more. I told my brother, that I thought they were after no good - We passed them again; I saw the prisoner very plain; when I got to the house where I was going to, I let them pass again, and saw them nearer together; I live about a mile from the prosecutor. About six o'clock next morning, I went to Shepherd's-bush and saw the prisoner; I told my brother he was the man that passed my house the night before; immediately as I spoke five pigs came into the road-the prisoner was driving them; I said, "Halloo, my friend, you seem as if you had drove those pigs a great way," and asked where he brought them from; he said, from Chertsey, and was going to take them to town; I got out of my chaise, and told him he was the man who passed my house at Drayton, the night before; he said, he was there once. I asked if the pigs belonged to him? he said, they were his and his brother's-that they bred them, and that they lived near Chertsey - They were overdrove; I told him they were stolen, and secured him.</p>

I said, "You have taken this gentleman's handkerchief;" he said, "I have not got it, search me;" I said, "That is of no use, you have parted with it."</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the prosecutor? A. With his face towards the crowd; there were some persons behind him; the prisoners were two of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How far were you from the prisoners? A. They stood close to the gentleman, and I stood close to them - I did not take them immediately; there were many persons - I might have been knocked down; I do not suppose they observed me - they moved away; I took one, the other went a few doors he then stopped, and turned round; I swear they are the persons I saw behind the prosecutor - I did not see the handkerchief in the prisoners' possession, till the prosecutor said he had got it; there were eight or ten persons, but they did not watch them as I did.</p>

            . On the morning of the 14th I heard a noise at the door; I went out, and saw the prisoner with a check apron in his hand carrying it off - there was another young man with him; I saw them untie the bundle, and put in our bell, which had been safe at eleven o'clock the night before - both the men ran away; I followed the prisoner, and took him- the other got away; the apron was picked up by Clark- our bell was in with the rest; this is the spring of our bell, and matches it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How far was I from the gate when you first came out? A. About one hundred yards - you had the apron in your hands; there was a person with you, and he put the bell into the apron.</p>

               <p>JOHN CLARK. I saw the bundle of bells in this check apron by the side of the road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young man asked me to carry the bundle; the witness came out - I went away, and left the bundle there.</p>

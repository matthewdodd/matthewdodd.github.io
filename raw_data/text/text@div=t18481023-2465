Was the prisoner the only person who had change of the property in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he had the whole power of disposing of the property; he had to dispose of it in the best manner he could for my interest—I understand he had opened another shop three months before, but I did not hear of it till three days before the 17th July—I took a person with me to take stock on the 17th July—I found the deficiency was 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made the charge against the prisoner on that day—I used to give him an account of what the stock ought to be, and he said it agreed—I have supplied him with stock every week, and he said it was correct—I sup<lb></lb>plied him with about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stock at the commencement—if I had the books here I could tell you—I only attended on those premises now and then, once in two or three weeks—he gave me an account every week of what goods he sold, and handed me over the money—on taking stock 1 told him he was so much short—I did not give him in charge.</p>

I was shopman to Mr. Towers—tbe prisoner was also a shopman—he conducted the business of one shop, and I another—I went to the prisoner's shop, in Lambeth-walk, with the policeman—I found some pro<lb></lb>perty there, which I believe to be my master's—these two pairs of shoes I believe to be my master's, by their particular make and the private mark—this is not my mark—here is one pair that have my own private mark on them—I have seen them in my master's possession—this tree is my master's; we have the remaining portion of it, and the same with respect to this other piece of the tree, I found the whole of them in the prisoner's house.</p>

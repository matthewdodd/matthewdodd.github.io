            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was in Bishopsgate-street, near Mr. Windus'; my attention was attracted by seeing a party of persons round his shop - I went there, and saw the Lord Mayor's carriage - I did not see Mr. Ryder to know his person; the first I saw was Henley turning up the cuff of his coat, and Cochrane close by him; they looked me full in the face - I did not know them before, nor do I know that they have ever seen me - suspecting them I went a round about way, and came to the house - I went into a public-house directly opposite Mr. Windus', and had a clear view of the prisoners, through the glass of the door - I saw them attempt the pockets of several persons, and the baskets of females; they moved away from the spot several times, and talked together; I saw them both press against a person, whom I suppose to be the prosecutor - I saw Henley draw a handkerchief from that person's pocket, at Mr. Windus' door; he put it under his coat, without putting it into his pocket, and ran off, followed by Cochrane - I crossed the road, got before Henley, seized him round the waist, and took the handkerchief - Cochrane was rather before Henley, and as soon as he saw me take Henley, he turned back - I called Stop him! and he came towards me - I took him into a tobacconist's-shop - Mr. Ryder's name is at full length on the handkerchief in ink - I found him out by the Directory, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HENLEY. Q. Will you swear you saw the handkerchief taken from that gentleman? A. I saw it taken from a gentleman; he had a dark coat on, either black or olive - I could see your countenance for twenty minutes; when I called Stop him! Cochrane stopped directly, and came to me; my partner was with me; we were going to see his son, who is in service, and he went into a sadler's-shop at the time this happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. Why not tell me you had another officer with you? A. Mr. Hobler did not think it proper to bind him over, as he did not see the transaction - directly I called Stop him! Cochrane turned round, and came to me - Henley was certainly the most active person; they both pressed against the prosecutor; I suppose it to be the prosecutor. I have been an officer for five years.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HENLEY's Defence. I was coming up Petticoat-lane, and saw a Jew with some clothes, and the handkerchief; he offered it as a bargain, for 4s. - I said I had but 2s. 6d.; he would not take less than 3s. 6d., which I gave him - I put it into my breast, as another person might; it has now become a fashionable way; I was going along Bishopsgate-street, looking at the carriage; this lad came up, and asked what was the matter; the pressure was so great, I could not get near to see - I pushed into the crowd and saw it was a carriage - I walked on, and the officer came and took me; he called to the prisoner, who was crossing the road, and he came to him.</p>
               <p>Cochrane received a good character.</p>

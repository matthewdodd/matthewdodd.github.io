               <p>I am a watchman; at half after one, on Tuesday morning last, the prisoner came past me with this basket of things; I run over to him and asked him what he had there; he said, what is that to you? I took him by the collar to the watch-house; I have kept the things ever since.</p>
               <p>DANIEL DUNNING sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; I was crying half past one on Tuesday morning last; the last witness called for assistance; I helped to take the prisoner, and he had this basket; and the prisoner would not let him examine it.</p>
               <p>Do you believe that to be the same? - I cannot take my oath to it, but I believe it.</p>
               <p>Court to Flowers. Did you leave the basket at the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you observe it by to know it again? - The handle, and the cloth round here at the time; it was not moved at all off the shelf, at the watch-house; I took it off the next morning myself; there are two holes in the handkerchief, I observed them over night, when they were taken from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I had this basket from a woman, she was in liquor enquiring the way to Tower-hill; I carried it for her, the watchman took me.</p>
               <p>Jury to prosecutor's wife. Were any of your other things moved out of the house, in consequence of the fire? - No, none of the goods were moved.</p>
               <p>Court to watchman. What did this man say to you when you took him? - He said I had no business to look what he had at all; I said it was my place to look; he did not tell me from whom he had it; there was no woman with him.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you that a woman gave him the property? - No, when first I stopped him, he said he would not let either of us look at them; I said we would take him to the watch-house; he said he wanted a lodging; he did not say a woman gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ask him how he came by them? - No, we did not.</p>
               <p>Was there a woman with him? - There was a woman followed him.</p>
               <p>Was that woman in any conversation with him? - Not a word, I asked him if he knew that woman; I thought she might have been a partner; he said he never saw the woman with his eyes before, that she did not belong to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Flowers. In your presence, was that prisoner asked about any woman? - I saw no woman, but the other watchman said he saw a woman, and he asked him, and he said that woman did not belong to him at all.</p>

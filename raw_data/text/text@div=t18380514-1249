                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Hanrott, of Queen-square, Bloomsbury. On the 19th of April I was standing at the back kitchen door, and heard somebody moving the plate on the tray—I ran into the kitchen, and saw the prisoner Osborn run out of the kitchen with the plate, and run up the area steps—I followed him, and when I had got my hand almost on him, he dropped the plate, and ran off with the milk-jug—I followed him to the corner of the square—Mr. Norcutt stopped him—he dropped the cream-jug—I took it up, and also the other plate which he threw away—Stevens came to my assistance, and he was taken to master's house—the other prisoner was standing at the top of the steps, and when he saw me run up, he ran away—while we were bringing Osborn back, the policeman joined us—I did not observe anybody else.</p>

When I got home I missed twenty-three out of a bundle, which contained forty-seven - I think they were taken near Acton. Next day I saw one at Wise's, the pawnbroker - the mark was picked out. We found three more at Lee's lodgings; his wife was there; I left town about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and got to Acton a little after eight.</p>

            . I lodged in Buckeridge-street - I was in distress, and did needlework; I have known Lee near a twelvemonth. I was at Lee's appartments, No. 29, Tower street, Seven Dials; he only lodged there two days - his wife lived with him; I used to go to clean up the place. On the 26th of March, I got there about seven o'clock in the morning; Mrs. Lee desired me to pick the mark out of a table-cloth - the prisoner was present; one of the marks was N, I do not remember the other. While I picked the mark out of that, Mrs. Lee picked out the mark of two others - I saw twenty-two table-cloths there. Henry came in between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and looked at eighteen of them; Lee asked 4 l. for them? he examined them, and offered 2 l. 15 s. for them, which was agreed to, and he took them away. He said he was a dealer in oranges - he staid about an hour.</p>

Mrs. Lee sent me to pledge one at Wise's - the prisoner was present; I pledged it in the name of Lovel, which was her maiden name - I knew she pledged things in that name; I got 6 s. for it, and gave her the duplicate.

            , I am a constable. On the 26th of March, I received information, and went to Bainbridge-street, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and found Hall at Lee's mother's house, where his wife's sister lived; the girl directed me to Lee's lodgings, No. 29, Tower-street. I went there about a quarter after nine o'clock, in the one-pair front-room, and found four or five Gipsies there. I sat down, and in two or three minutes, Lee's wife came running into the room, put her hands together, and said to her father,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, put away the table-cloths, for Furzeman has taken the girl." I shut the door, and called out of the window for Kendrick, and the prosecutor to come up. I searched the room, and found three dirty table-cloths in a drawer - Lee's wife claimed them. I took her, with her father and brother-in-law, to the office - they were discharged. About a fortnight after Lee was taken into custody at Bow-street; I had been looking for him without success; I found them both in custody on another charge. They were brought to Marlborough-street, and Hall pointed them out.</p>

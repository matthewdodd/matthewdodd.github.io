               <p>Q. How soon had you seen or felt the pocket-book before - A. About ten minutes; I had Bank notes in my pocket-book to the amount of one hundred and twenty pound, and among the rest, that check was in my pocket-book; I had it of Lady Burton. In consequence of my loss I sent to my bankers', and I communicated it to Humphreys an officer of Bow-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that check, is that the check that was stolen at the identical time that you lost the pocket-book - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any communication made to you on this subject, did you go to Messrs. Coutts and Co. and when - A. On the morning of the sixth of July a little before nine I went to the bankers', and after I had been in the shop about two minutes, the prisoner came in and presented the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the check he presented - A. That is the check. I asked him how he came by it, he said that a gentleman in the street told him he would give him a shilling if he would go and get it cashed, the gentleman was in black, he knew nothing of him, he was at a distance from the house. I left him in the care of the clerk, I went out to try whether I could see the person that he described; I went a little way in the Strand, I saw a person at a shop window that I suspected; I took him in custody, and took him back to the prisoner and asked him if that was the man that gave him the the check; he said, no. I took him out; I saw another person, I asked him if that was the man; he said, no; I asked him where it was that he received this check from, and the person that he said gave it him, he said at the bottom of Catherine-street in the Strand. I asked him to look round if he could see the person; he said he could not. I took him to the office; he there said, that the very man I first brought into the banking-house was the man that he received the check of. I have not been able to see that man since.</p>

               <p>Court. What makes you swear to the day - A. I did not recollect until it was mentioned to me; I only recollect the last day he was in our house, he came in twice; I cannot speak to the day.</p>

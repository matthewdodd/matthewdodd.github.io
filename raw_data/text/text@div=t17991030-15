             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I attended Mr. Ford as his laundress: On the 29th of September I left Mr. Ford's chambers, about half past six at night, as near as I can recollect. Q. Was it light or dark? - A. It was not very light, or it was not very dark; it was between both; the lamps were lighted in the passage; I secured the doors and windows of the chambers when I left them; the door locks three times; I am positive I locked it three times that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the chambers upon the ground floor? - A. Yes; when I returned it wanted a quarter to seven by St. Dunstan's dial, I live just by Temple-bar; I turned down Middle Temple lane, and went to the chambers; I went to put the key in the door and found the door was unlocked; with that, I opened the door, and found that the middle door was open; that alarmed me very much, and I instantly clapped to the outside door and put my back towards it; I then screamed out, finding the chambers were broke open, and a man immediately run out; it was not so dark but I could see the people passing; the person that was inside pushed three times against the door; he then pushed me quite back against the staircase, and ran out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you, in the hurry of the moment, enabled to see who that man was? - A. Not at that moment; but I saw the colour of his clothes; I cannot say I saw the colour of his face; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300014"></xptr>dressed in a light coloured coat, dark coloured breeches, and light coloured waistcoat; his hair was powdered, and a round hat, half boots, or gaiters, I will not be sure which.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a soldier's dress? - A. No; he ran up the middle of Temple-lane; upon my screaming, Morgan, one of the Temple porters, came to my assistance; Morgan then went into the chambers, I said in the passage, and the prisoner at the bar came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a considerable crowd at that time, I suppose? - A. A very great mob indeed; the prisoner asked me what I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner dressed in the same manner as the man that you had seen before? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that you had seen before? - A. I cannot say, only that he had the same fort of dress on; he asked me what I had lost, and I told him I believed he was the man that robbed my master; he made no reply, but immediately altered his countenance and went away; his countenance changed; I afterwards went into the chambers and observed my mistress's clothes lying upon a great coat in the bed room; shirts, shifts, and waistcoats, and other articles of wearing apparel, all spread upon a great coat; Morgan rolled them up in the great coat, and I saw them afterwards at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At the time you left the chambers you might see the face of a person exceedingly well? - A. Yes, if the face was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back, then could you have seen the face of any person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the man go out, you only saw his back? - A. He went out side ways, and I saw his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. He went out very fast, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A crowd assembled, and in the crowd was the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he did not stop in the crowd but came up the steps to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say your suspicions fell upon him, did you desire any body to stop him? - A. No, I had no thought of it; he did not run, he walked away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am porter to the Middle Temple: On the 28th of September, from ten minutes to about a quarter before seven, I was alarmed by a woman crying, and a dog barking; I saw the last witness standing at the entrance of No. 5, Brick-court; upon her information, I ran up the lane after the man, but did not see him, and I returned to the chambers and got a light; I went into the sitting room first, but saw no mark of violence there; I then went into the bed-room, and saw a great coat lying, with a quantity of clothes upon it; upon turning round, I found to my right hand, a set of drawers, there were five drawers and every one broke open, and the drawers emptied; there was scarce any thing left in the drawers of any value; I then searched the chambers over but found nobody; in the pocket of that great coat was a pocket-book; I opened the pocket-book, and the first thing I saw was a soldier's furlough,

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What was said was taken down in writting? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. I was present, and it was not taken down.</p>
               <p>Morgan. He partly owned the great coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present at the second examination? - A. Yes, he then denied it; he said the great coat was not his; he said the pocket-book was his, that he had lost it through a hole in the pocket of the coat that he then had on; upon trying the hole, it could not have been dropped out at that hole.</p>
               <p>(Produces the pocket and the pocket-book.) It was handed to the Jury.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Mr. Ford) You were present at the examination? - A. I was; the prisoner then said that the coat was his, and he said the pocket-book was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time about having lost a pocket-book? - A. No, he did not; he said he had lost his great coat, on the Friday preceding the Saturday, with the pocket-book in the pocket; at the second examination he denied the great coat to be his; but stated that he lost the pocket-book on the Saturday evening, about five o'clock out of the right hand pocket of his close coat, and said he was not in the Temple that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You and Morgan give us a directly opposite account? - A. I cannot help that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know any thing about the prisoner wanting to have his furlough renewed? - A. Yes; on the 28th of September, we were together at the Blue Anchor, in Feather's-court, Drury-lane, and had some beer together; during that time, he asked me if I could speak to serjeant Morgan, to get his furlough renewed for a few days; his furlough expressed the third day of October, he pulled out his pocket-book, and I read the furlow myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the furlough? - A. This is the furlough; this was on the Saturday; I told him I could not do it then, but I would speak to Mr. Morgan about it; then he went to the Conduit, in Conduit-street, to see a serjeant that was very ill; I stopped an hour and went away; I left them there together about five o'clock in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Thames Police. On the morning of the 31st of October I saw the three prisoners come out of Messrs. Master mans' premises, in Broad-street, Ratcliff—I live about 200 yards from there, in Harris'-court—the prisoners passed me at my own door—Brown said to me, "Good morning, we are just going home"—Brailey was carrying a basket—I stopped him, and found six bottles of stout in this basket, four bottles underneath his apron, and one in each coat-pocket—the other prisoners went away—I detained Brailey—I after-wards went to White's house—he came home while I was there—I told him what I came for, and asked where he had left Brown—he said he had not seen him since Saturday night—I asked him what time he got up in the morning—he said, "At four o'clock, for the purpose of going mush-rooming"—I then went to Brown's house, but did not find him at home—I searched the house, and found one bottle, with a portion of porter in it—Brown's wife told me she had got the bottle of porter in on Saturday night, to drink—I then went to Brailey's house, and there found nine bottles of stout, seemingly of the same quality as that I found about him—I asked him at the station how he accounted for the bottles I had found in his house—he said he knew nothing about them—I said, "If you know nothing about them, I must take your wife into custody"—he then said, "Well, if you must know, if I had not taken them there, they would not have been there; that will do"—I found two keys in Brailey's pocket—I asked where he got them from—he said he did not know—I then went to the prosecutors' premises, knocked the foreman up, and found they were the keys of the outer and inner gate of the prosecutors' premises—I asked Brailey how he accounted for the keys, and he then said, "Why the keys belong to the brewhouse"—I said, "Are you allowed to keep keys?"—he said "Yes"—I afterwards apprehended Brown at the brewhouse—I said, "Brown, I want you respecting this robbery, with Brailey, of the bottled porter"—he said, "Mr. Yeoman, I know nothing about it; can't you leave me till to<lb></lb>morrow, and let me do my work to-night?"—I said, "No, you must come with me now."</p>

Mastermans' gate—I saw them come out of the wicket-gate, which is attached to the large gate of the premises—it was about a quarter to five o'clock—Brailey told me he was allowed the keys to go into the brewhouse—he had an apron on with a bib to it, and the four bottles were in that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutors' employ, and live on the premises—I was called up by Yeoman the officer, at five o'clock on the Sunday morning—I came down and found the wicket-gate open, which it ought not to have been—I also found the inner door unlocked and open—Brown had no business on the premises at that time in the morning—He was employed as a labourer in the brewhouse at other times—White is Brown's father-in-law, and is a carpenter—he had no business whatever</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am bottle foreman to the prosecutor, and have charge of the bottled beer—the key of the padlock of the vault ought to have been on a nail outside my counting-house door—I hung it there on the Saturday—on Monday morning I found it in the padlock, and the door unlocked—I left the premises about eight o'clock on the Saturday—I do not know whether Brown and Brailey were gone then, they were not in my department—they could get to where my key was by getting round through the brewery—I found a deficiency in one bin, five, two, five, and half-a-dozen—I have tasted the beer found in one of the bottles which the officer took from Brailey, and have no doubt it is the same quality as the beer in the bin—a lad named Peter White is employed in my department—he is the prisoner White's son—he had access to the key during the hours of business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

            . I am thirteen years of age. On the 13th of May, I was sent by my master with some skins to Messrs. Hawkins, Printers, Fetter-lane, Holborn; I was overtaken by the prisoner - I am quite certain he is the person; he was alone - he asked if I would go into a shop for 6 d., and ask for a portmanteau for Mr. Jones - I went into the shop and left the parchment and my umbrella for him to take care of - I stopped in the shop but a minute, it was in <placeName id="t18240715-126-crimeloc685">Skinner-street</placeName>

I did not see him again till I met him in Cheapside; I ran past him and saw it was him - I turned round to look at him, and he looked round too. I followed him down Queen-street and he came into Cheapside again - there was a person with him, who asked me what I wanted; I said if I knew where there was a constable, I would tell him what I wanted; the prisoner was near enough to have heard that; he then went into Newgate-street, and I met a man and asked him if he could tell me where I could get a constable; he then ran down Bagnio-court; I got a constable in Butcher-hall-lane, and he was taken in Bagnio-court; he was then taken before the Lord Mayor; the person who had been with him was gone before the constable came. I am certain the prisoner is the person, though I had not seen him from the time he took the goods till I met him in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. How many streets did you walk together, five or six - A. Yes Sir.</p>

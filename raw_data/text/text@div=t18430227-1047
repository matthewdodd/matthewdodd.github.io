                  </hi>. I am in partnership with John Smith—we are woollen and Manchester warehousemen, and live in King-street, Cheapside. Coward was our porter—on the 6th of Oct., he was desired to take two trusses of silk and wollen which were to be returned to Mr. Norton—they were called waist<lb></lb>coatings, and I believe Coward went away as though to take them—I do not remember his returning—I should think about five or six days afterwards, I questioned him about this parcel delivery book—I asked him how it was the two trusses had not gone back—he said they had—I said, "It appears they have not, and beside that there is only one in your entry for them"—I had asked for the book when I heard the trusses had not gone back—this figure which is now a 2 in this book was then a 1, and the word "One" is written un<lb></lb>der it as being received by Pickford—the prisoner said, "I tied the two trusses together"—that satisfied me that it might be so, and that they had been taken as one by Pickford—on the 8th of Feb., the officer showed me these goods which are here—I than looked at Coward's book again, and found the figure I had been altered to a 2, but the word "One, Pickford and Company," re<lb></lb>mained—I have examined these two pieces of waistcoating which are here, and they correspond in pattern and quality with the goods I expected to re<lb></lb>ceive from Mr. Norton—I do not know whether the trusses had been opened or not, but I received the invoice, and I said, "Let them go bank"—these are precisely the description of goods which I had ordered, and which I desired might go back—they amounted to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—Coward had access to the warehouse—his wife and him slept there.</p>

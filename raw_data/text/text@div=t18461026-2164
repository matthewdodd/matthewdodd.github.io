                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the prosecutor—it is my belief this piece of doeskin formed part of the stock—I noticed it in the stock on Thursday evening, the 3rd of Sept.—there is no account of its having been sold—this satin I believe to be hours—I know the mark on the roller—I saw the satin-roller safe on Saturday evening, the 5th of Sept.—I saw the serge the same evening—I had them both in my hand—I believe it to be the same—on Monday morning, the 7th of Sept., I went out a few minutes before nine—just as I got outside the door I met the prisoner Franklin—I noticed him particularly—he was within a few doors of the house—I went on my way, and he went into our shop door—I had come out of the warehouse door, and locked it myself, and left the key in the lock—there are two outside doors; we only use one—he had gone in at the outer door Which we use—when you pro<lb></lb>ceed a little more than a breadth and a half of the outer door there is a break in the partition, you turn to the right and there is the warehouse door, which is an internal door—I had left the key in that door—I had only got a few yards when I saw him—I do not know how I came to notice him—I turned round and saw him go in, and saw him come out again in about a minute, bringing nothing with him—he went in the direction of the London-read, passing me again—there are plenty of public-houses there—I turned up the Borough-road—he was in long enough to have gone to the warehouse door and seen the key in it—both the partners live in the house, which is in the parish of St. George's, Southwark.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you went in at the outer door and looked in, would not you see the key? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you must turn to the right a little more than the breadth of the outer door—a person in the retail shop cannot see the warehouse door, unless he is exactly opposite the door—I re<lb></lb>turned about half-past five in the evening—I then went into the warehouse, and missed nothing then—I was there on Tuesday, and missed nothing—we have nine young men—we had only one piece of that kind of doeskin, or of the satin, on the Thursday—we had a good deal of black cloth—when Franklin passed me the second time I was a very few yards further—he passed and repassed me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many pieces of goods have you, as you did not miss these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have generally a good many pieces and half pieces of all sorts in the stock—we might have forty or fifty pieces and half piece—that was the only piece of serge in the warehouse, except a small remnant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MELLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time is the warehouse locked up in the evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When the shop is shut up, sometimes eight, some-times half-past eight or nine, we have not persons employed to walk up and down—we have nine men—they go backwards and forwards between the shop and the warehouse—the door is not open except some one is inside.</p>

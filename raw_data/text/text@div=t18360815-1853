                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live in Cornwall-place, Holloway. On the 20th of July, at ten minutes after nine o'clock in the evening, I was in High-street, St. Giles's—my attention was called by somebody, and I missed my handkerchief, which was safe twenty minutes before—I saw it in the policeman's hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury. On the even<lb></lb>ing of the 20th of July I was in High-street, St. Giles's and saw the prisoner, in company with another one, older than himself, following this gentleman and two ladies, and in passing by Lawrence-lane, Bainbridge-street, I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief from Peile's pocket, and I secured him directly till the constable came up—he put it inside his jacket and dropped it behind him; the policeman came up directly and picked it up.</p>

About ten minutes to nine o'clock I saw the prisoner and a taller one—I followed a little distance from them—I saw them close in behind the prosecutor and two ladies—Mr. Last caught hold of his arm, and I saw the handkerchief fall down from his hand behind—a hatter took it up, and gave it to me—I am certain the prisoner dropped it.</p>

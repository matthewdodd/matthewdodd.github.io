                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Islington. I was called to the house by Constable, about half-past five o'clock in the morning—I knew the deceased; I had been attending her professionally, for asthma and difficulty of breathing—her name was Sarah Johnson—she was about sixty-three years old—I had seen her about two o'clock on the day before—she was in feeble health; she suffered principally from debility and cough—I found her dead body in the back-parlour on the ground-floor—that was where the prisoner worked at his trade of a shoemaker—I believe they had a sleeping-room over it—I examined the body; it was warm, but the legs, arms, and face, were cold—I should think she had been dead at least two or three hours; I cannot say exactly—the face was very much swollen and contused; the eyelids swollen and blackened; the whole of the scalp was very much swollen, and the hair, which was long, was matted with blood, so as to prevent my making a minute search—there was a lacerated wound on the angle of the right side of the mouth—the skin was rubbed off the left elbow and both knees—the body laid on the right side, with the legs drawn up—the whole of her face was smeared with blood, and there were splashes of blood on her hands—her left shoe and stocking were off—with that exception, she was perfectly dressed, as for the day—her cap was off, and lying under her head; it was a day-cap—there was a smell of liquor; but whether it arose from the body, or had been spilt on the ground, I do not know—there was a stocking near the fire-place, with a needle in it, as if she had been at work; and a cloak near the head, saturated with blood, as if it had been used to wipe blood up with—I asked the prisoner how it happened—he said she had had a fit; that he heard a noise, as if she was falling about—I told him it was a very suspicious case—he said he was sure he did not do it—I think he said at that time that he had lived with his wife for forty-one years—I had been attending her about ten or twelve days—I had not known her before that—she had not complained to me of liability to fits, nor had I observed any</p>

               <p>tendency to it—I made a post mortem examination of the body next evening, and found a wound on the left; side of the head, two or three inches above the ear—it wounded a branch of the temporal artery—there was great extravasation of blood between the scalp and the skull—there were two ounces of blood under the dura mater, pressing on the brain—that was underneath the wound, which had penetrated completely through the scalp to the bone, and stopped there—the extravasation of blood and the internal congestion were not caused by that wound—the blood effused on the brain came from a rupture of the middle menengeal artery, which was caused by external violence, blows, falls, or kicks, and not, I should say, by the violence attending that wound—I attribute the death to com<lb></lb>pression of the brain, occasioned by the congestion of blood on it—inde<lb></lb>pendently of that, I do not think the wound itself would be likely to hare caused death; it might have done so in her weak state, from the hemorrhage—there was a great deal of blood about her, quite a pool—I examined the other organs, but found nothing to throw a light upon this inquiry—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the table, about a yard and a half from the body, covered with human hair, of a greyish colour, very much more than is on it now, and some on the handle—I compared it with the wound; it corresponded with it exactly—I think it is a shoe<lb></lb>maker's knife.</p>

I reside in the same house as the prisoner and his wife did—there are four rooms in it and a wing, which is two rooms added, but they are occupied—I have only one room, that is. on the ground-floor—the prisoner's parlour was on that floor, separated from my room by a partition—their bedroom was on the floor above—the prisoner is a shoemaker, and worked in the parlour adjoining mine—there are other lodgers. On the Saturday night before Mrs. Johnson's death, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in my parlour, and heard the prisoner speaking very angrily in his parlour, apparently to his wife—I heard no other voice—I heard him say, "I will do for you, you b——y b——r"—I heard no answer made to that—I heard a noise in their room, as of things being thrown about—that continued about half an hour—I could distinguish the prisoner's voice and his words, repeatedly saying the same—I thought from his voice that he was dreadfully intoxicated—I had not seen him that evening—I have seen him drunk before—the things seemed to break as they fell—I heard something heavy fall, and then all was silent—the room became quiet a little after twelve—I can distinctly hear, persons moving from one room to another, and going up<lb></lb>stairs—I heard no person go up-stairs from the lower to the upper room after the disturbance ceased—I went to bed about a quarter-past twelve—I did not remain awake very long, but I awake at the least noise, and should have heard any person coming up-stairs—between six and seven, or it might be before, I heard somebody in the next room on the ground-floor—I was disturbed by the police.</p>

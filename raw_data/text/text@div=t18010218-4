             sworn. - The alarm was given by a smith that a person had taken the property out of the shop; I saw the prisoner about two doors from Mr. Gwillim's, and I followed him and laid hold of his collar, and he dropped a part of the carpeting upon the ground, and the other was under his arm; Smith came and picked it up; the whole property was delivered up to Smith, and he brought it back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gwillim. My shop mark is on this carpeting, and my son's mark, and here is "Lot 120," which I bought at a sale.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was out of employment, and was standing up Fleet market, and a genteel man came up to me and asked me if I would carry the carpet for him, I took it up under my arm, and I missed the man all at once; I am innocent of the robbery; I have a wife and family.</p>

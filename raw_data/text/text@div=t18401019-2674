                  </hi>. I am a shipwright. I had the care of the <hi rend="italic">Courier,</hi> to repair her—I was on board on Friday evening last, about a quarter to six o'clock, when the people all left—I had that morning received some sheet metal and nails from Moss and Co., and some the day before—I saw them put down in the fore-cabin that evening, and left Wright in charge—I was knocked up next morning, went on board, and saw a police<lb></lb>man there—I went into the fore-cabin—I did not take any nails out of the vessel—I saw Wright in custody at the station-house, and some new and old nails and new metal, which exactly corresponded with those on board,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190199"></xptr>
               <p>especially the old nails, because they were washed the day before, and left rusty, and they were wet when I saw them—I do not know Cridland or Benbrook—I desired Wright not to leave the ship, or allow any person to come on board.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LUCAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were these nails washed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between three and four o'clock the afternoon before—it was a quarter before seven o'clock next morning that I saw them—they had remained wet all that time—I cannot say they might not have been made wet from being overboard—I am employed to do all the shipwright's work—I order all the things in, and employ the men—the bills are made out to the cap<lb></lb>tain and owners of the ship—I do not know whether there is any log-book—I believe all the nails came in on Thursday, and the metal on Friday—I think there was 632 sheets—I suppose 450 might have been used, and the remainder was in the fore-cabin—the mate lived on board—he was on board—he is not my officer, but when I have a ship in charge, of course I look after the mate, and tell him what to do—if a mate of mine were to take persons on board I should soon put him out, but I am sorry to say it is too much the practice to do so.</p>

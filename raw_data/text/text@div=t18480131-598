                  </hi>. I am a police-officer. On 15th Oct. I went with my brother, and two or three other constables, to 8, Queen-street, Soho—I knocked at the door—it was opened, and I proceeded to the third floor—I struck the door with a hammer, knocked it open, and saw Kauffman standing at the head of a small table—his face was towards me—he had a pair of scissors in his hand—Friedeburg and Aaronson were standing on my left, at the table—they were only looking on—these printed papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were on the table—I immedistely secured the prisoners Kauffman, Aaronson, and Friedeburg—in a bed in the room, between the clothing and the bed, I found this parcel of notes, and in a cupboard in the room I found this parcel—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I found this other parcel in the lining or pocket of Kauff<lb></lb>man's coat—I was obliged to cut it out—this printing-presa was open in the room, and several stones, which my brother took charge of—there were a great many other things brought away, most of which I believe he also has—I found a key on Friedeburg, which opened the door of 45, wardour-street, Soho, where he said he was lodging—on pulling off the bedclothes there, I saw some printed parcels, which my brother took possession of—this type</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographic artist, and carry on business with my father, in king William-street. I have had put into my hands a stone bearing the reverse side of a Russian note—the impres<lb></lb>sion was then scarcely perceptible—it had been washed out with turpentine or oil, I cannot exactly say which; both would do in lithography, and covered with a composition to preserve it, as occasion might hereafter require—that is the ordinary course adopted to preserve an impression—if the stone is wanted for another purpose, the lithographer must grind the impression off before he could put another on it—if it was not entirely ground off, there are means by which he could revive it—after a critical examination of the small stone, I found it had gone through that process, for the purpose of pre<lb></lb>serving that which was under the composition—I removed the composition with a piece of flannel and a little turpentine; with the aid of the prisoner's roller, rubbed the stone with it, and brought up the original impression in the state in which it now is—I afterwards proceeded to take impressions from the stone, having taken it home for that purpose—it certainly was not a worn stone—I suppose the composition was put on to reserve it—that is the rule—I produce some of the impressions I took from it—I took about half-a-dozen on paper, and more on parchment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Friedeburg's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>) I am a furrier by trade, and was carrying on the same in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe. Five weeks previous to my being arrested on the present charge, a man came to me named Beek, residing at 5, Ebenezer-square, and recommended a man named Max, as a worker in my trade. I wanted a man at this time to assist me. I went to Hounds<lb></lb>ditch with Beck to see Max, and engaged him to come and work. Max commenced work with me the next day, and continued in my employ ten days. During his being with me, he was visited every day by two persons named Rochelt and Kauffman; I inquired of Max who they were, he answered me, <hi rend="italic">"One (Rochelt) was a partner of his, and Kauffman came with him (Max) and</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801310032"></xptr>

                  <hi rend="italic">"Rochelt together from France to form a lithographic establishment in this coun<lb></lb>try;</hi>" I took little or no notice of this. Every day during the time of Max being in my employ, he and Rochelt were continually saying that me trade of a furrier would prove far more lucrative in France than in this country, and Kauffman promised to give me numerous recommendations to respectable houses there, and tried to persuade me to accompany them to France. Being anxious to avail myself of any honourable way of bettering myself. I thought it might prove advantageous for me to follow their advice. A difficulty how<lb></lb>ever presented itself, my passport was only good for Holland, not for France; I showed them the passport, and they answered me, <hi rend="italic">"Never mind, Mr. Friedeburg; we have travelled many times between France and London, and we have many friends in France, and if you will wait a fortnight, till we get let<lb></lb>ters and money from our friends, we will certainly take you to France with our passport.</hi>" I finished the work I had on hand, and not having any more to go on with, I went and took a room in Newton-street, Holborn. At this time Max and Rochelt were living in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane. The day before I took the lodgings in Newton-street, Kauffman came home and said he should be much obliged if I would take lodgings so that he might come every night and sleep with me, as he was badly accommodated where he was, and he would pay me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for the accommodation; Kauffman seeming a respectable man, and having promised to give me recommendations for my work in France, I agreed to the proposal. I occasionally visited Max and Rochelt, and Max and Rochelt visited me. I asked them every day when we should go to France, as I was anxious to be working at my business again, having nothing to depend upon but my labour. He answered, <hi rend="italic">"Don't hurry, we shall soon have letters from France, and then we shall go immediately.</hi>" I asked Kauffman what business he was following in this country. He said, the same as Max and Rochelt had told me; that he was trying to form a lithographic establishment in this country, and that he expected his presses from France, and as he could not speak English, he asked me to go with him to a lithographic printer and borrow a press for him for a fortnight. I accord<lb></lb>ingly went with him to a lithographic printer in Holborn, and he borrowed one, agreeing to pay him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the loan of it for a fortnight, and agreeing to leave 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a deposit. I bought of the same printer a stone for Kauffman, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I asked Kauffman if he had the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him; he said he had not, but he had a friend, a gentleman, who would come with him to-morrow and pay the deposit. <hi rend="italic">I then</hi> said to the printer, <hi rend="italic">"I will come with this gentleman and pay the deposit.</hi> " The next day Kauffman came to me with a gentleman whom he called Aaronson, a countryman of mine, who had resided five years in Paris, and had only lately come from thence; Kauffman then said, <hi rend="italic">"Mr. Aaronson will pay the deposit if you will go with us to the printer and see it paid.</hi> " I went with Messrs. Aaronson and Kauffman, and saw it paid. Kauffman took the press to the lodgings of Max and Rochelt, in Short's-gardens. Kauffman was there the whole of every day, and came to sleep with me at night. I called several times to see Max and Rochelt, and asked if they had received the expected letters, and when I should go with them to France. At those times I did not see Kauffman, he being, as I understood, engaged in his own room. I asked Max and Rochelt, <hi rend="italic">"Where is Kauffman?</hi> " He replied, <hi rend="italic">"He is very busy.</hi> " I did not take any notice of this, thinking he was earing money for himself in his own business. The fortnight which Max and Rochelt wished me to wait, passed away. I then began to be uneasy, as I wanted to be working at my business again. One morning, Max and Rochelt came home, and said, <hi rend="italic">"Mr. Friedeburg, we have received letters from</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801310033"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">France, and our wives say they cannot send us the money now; but in twelve days or a fortnight we shall have it for certain. Now, Mr. Friedeburg, if you will wait that time, we give you word of honour that you and us will surely go to France; and in order that your expenses in waiting that time may be less, it will be better for us three to live together for the next fortnight.</hi> " Having waited a fortnight already, and being without work, and depending upon their promises, I consented to wait the time they mentioned, and went and took two rooms (one on the first floor, and one on the third floor,) in War-dour-street, Soho. We lived there together. Sometimes I slept on the third floor with Max, and sometimes I slept on the first floor by myself. During the time I lived in Wardour-street, Kauffman came every day to see Max and Rochelt. Kauffman, at this time, had left the lodgings in Short's-gardens, where he had lived with Max and Rochelt, and had taken others in Queen-street, Soho. I sometimes called at his lodgings there, having spare time on my hands, and found him unemployed, at which I was surprised, and asked him if he bed not any work to do. He replied, <hi rend="italic">"I expect work every day.</hi> " When I had lived a week in Wardour-street with Max and Rochelt, they gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to which I added 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went and paid the landlord the rent, taking a receipt, and at the same time giving him notice of my in-tention of leaving the lodgings at the end of the week; it being my design to go back into the City to obtain employment in my trade, should Max and Rochelt fail to fulfil their promise of taking me to France at the expiration of that time. On the Friday following (the 15th Oct.,) in the morning, Mr. Aaronson came to visit me. I was at the time in the third-floor room, with Max and Rochelt, where I had slept that night, Max having slept on the first floor. Max and Rochelt said to Mr. Aaronson and me, <hi rend="italic">"Mr. Friede-burg and Mr. Aaronson, the Frenchman, who lives in Queen-street, Sohe, would deem it a favour if you would call upon him this morning, as he has something very particular to say to you.</hi> " I was not dressed at the time. Mr. Aaronson, said, <hi rend="italic">"Go and dress yourself, Mr. Friedeburg, and we will go and see what the Frenchman wishes to say to us so very parlicular.</hi> " I went down to the first floor to dress myself, and while I was doing so Max came in and brushed his clothes. I finished dressing, and went up stairs to Mr. Aaronson, leaving Max in the room. Shortly after I came down stairs with Mr. Aaronson, to accompany him to see Kauffman. Passing by the first-floor room, I saw the door open, and no one inside, the key being in the door. I locked it, and took away the key with me. When we got to Kauffman's lodgings, I said to him, <hi rend="italic">"What is it you wish to say so particularly to Mr. Aaronson and myself</hi> " He seemed very much surprised at my question, and said, <hi rend="italic">"I never told Max and Rochelt to say anything of the kind.</hi> " When I got into his room I saw lying on a table many papers, having <hi rend="italic">some resemblance to</hi> Russian bank-notes. I took up one sheet, and said, laughingly, <hi rend="italic">What fool has been spoiling paper in this way?</hi> " and asked Kauffman where he had got so much rubbish. He answered, <hi rend="italic">"I got it yesterday, from</hi> Max and Rochelt, <hi rend="italic">to cut it for them.</hi> " He then requested that I would not tell Max and Rochelt that I bed seen the papers, as they had requested him not to let me see them, and said, that if Max and Rochelt asked him if I had seen the papers, he should tell them that I had not. We remained in conversation about ten minutes, when, to my surprise, Messrs. Forresters burst into the room, and declared us to be their prisoners.</p>

I had no money to pay my lodging; I went about to every shop to look for work, and could not find any; I told Max I should go; he said, if I went he should make the greater fortune; he said he should make four hundred francs; I said I would stop two days; I had in my possession the stone, the press and other materials; Max took all the materials, except the stone and press, to his lodgings; Max had the press in his possession five days; I could not work without it; all the things belong to Max; it is all owing to him and Rochelt; they brought me here, and then left me.</p>

                  </hi>. Friedeburg lived at my house, and followed the business of a cap-maker—I have seen fur caps—I saw two or three persons, at differ<lb></lb>ent times, in his room—I have no recollection of seeing a stout man there—I have seen two young men, who worked up in his place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 45, Wardour-street, Soho. Friedeburg took two rooms there, of my wife; one was a small room on the first floor, and one a larger room, on the third floor—he paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—he came in the evening, by himself, with a truck—I was in the shop at the time, and he left the things with me, and went up into the little bed-room—he said he expected two men to come and ask for his room—I showed him the room on the landing; he took his tea, and went to bed—I understand that Aaronson took the lodging for him, in my absence—he afterwards told me he expected two of his men to sleep in the front attic, but did not know whether they would come that night—Friedeburg and the two men used to eat together, up in the attic, where the two men slept.</p>

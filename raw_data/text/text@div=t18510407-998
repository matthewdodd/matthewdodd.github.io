                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich. On Friday night, 21st March, I was at Captain Standish's room in the Barracks, and had a gold watch and chain in my waistcoat-pocket—I saw them safe at ten minutes to eleven—I left Captain Standish's room a little before twelve o'clock, and at ten minutes past one when I was in another lieutenant's room I felt my watch safe—about eleven the following rooming I missed them—I do not know whether they were safe when I went to bed—I saw the chain again the</p>

               <p>I keep a house. On the 11th of January, between the hours of seven and nine, in the evening, I was robbed; I came home about a quarter past eight, and found my house broke open and my drawers; my house is full of lodgers, the upper part, but not downwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you lock up when you went out? - My back parlour and the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the part of the house you live in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out? - Between two and three o'clock, but I had a brother that called at my house at seven and it was all safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not lock the outer door because the lodgers were in the house? - I did not. When I came home I found the door broke open and the lock bent, bursted off, the hold fast of the door bursted off in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You go through your shop to the parlour? - No, through a passage to the parlour. It was my parlour door that was broke. When I got in I found my drawers had been rifled, some were left half shut and some open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you locked them when you went out? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss out of your drawers? - Four silk handkerchiefs, a gown, a pair of breeches, a shirt, five muslin aprons; all the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any of your things again? - Mr. Richardson that lived in the same street where we do, had a search warrant to search this

               <p>Q. Of all the articles in the indictment you identify but the under waistcoat? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure all the things in the indictment were in the room when you went out? - Yes, every thing was safe when we went out, and they were missing when we came home.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 91.) On the afternoon of the 9th of October, I was in Bainbridge-street, about five o'clock, and saw the prisoner following a gentleman—he put his hand into the gentleman's pocket behind, and took this handkerchief, and turned up Jones's-court—he then held it up, put it into his right-hand jacket pocket, and walked away—I ran after him, seized him by the collar, and said, "Here, I want you"—he said, "Then you won't have me"—he struggled, and in the struggle I took</p>

               <p>the handkerchief from his pocket, and put it into mine—he got into a potato shop, took up a two-pound weight, and said, "Now, you b----, will you let me go?"—I said I would not, and he threw it at me, but it missed me—a mob of about three hundred collected, and he struck me in the face seized me by my * * *, and said, "Now, you b----, I will tear you * * * out"—he struck me, and bit my hand—I bled from the blown from his fist—I was four days under the doctor's hands, and had not my brother constable come up to assist me I should have been murdered by the mob—I called on a housekeeper to assist me, but he would not—I was dreadfully knocked about—I did not see who the gentleman was—he went on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in High-street, and went to Church-street in consequence of information—I saw a crowd round the officer—the prisoner struck him two or three times in my pre<lb></lb>sence before I could get to his assistance—the mob were assisting the prisoner.</p>

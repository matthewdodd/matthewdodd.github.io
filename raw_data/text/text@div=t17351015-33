               <p>Henry Dun. Having been taking a Bottle on Sunday Night, and being a little merry, I met the Prisoner near <placeName id="t17351015-33-crimeloc141">Charing Cross</placeName>

I had stood but a little while before I found her Hand in my Pocket, upon which I felt for my Watch, and it being then safe, I staid a little longer, and then we parted; but soon after I felt again for my Watch and it was gone. I described her to the Watchmen, and they found her on the Friday Night following. She confest before the Justice that she had the Watch, and by her Direction it was found at the Pawn-brokers; she says indeed that I gave it her, but this is the common Pretence of such Creatures to make People ashamed to prosecute them; but I knew better, and I hope others will follow my Example.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He picked me up, and took me into the Alley, where he offered such unseemly things that it is a shame to speak of them. He said he had no Money, but if I would oblige him he would pledge his Watch with me; and as he supposed I was commonly to be found thereabouts, he would redeem it the next time he saw me. <rs id="t17351015-33-verdict142" type="verdictDescription">

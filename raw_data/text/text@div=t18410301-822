                  </hi>. I live in Palmer's-gardens, Holloway. On the 15th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soners, in the field adjoining the Manor-farm, about half a mile from Cornwall-place—I stopped them—they had two baskets, with lead in them—Jones said they had bought it—I called Partridge to my assistance—Jones then ran away, and Partridge after him—he was stopped—I held Crate, and gave him to a man who let him go—when I came back I found the baskets on the ground, with the lead in them—a policeman took charge of the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cornwall-place.

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Claremont-cottages, Cornwall-place. On the 13th of February I had some men at work in the next cottage to mine—I am engaged to repair these premises for Richard Howard—the leaden sink and pipe was perfect on the 13th, when they were locked up—on the 15th I went into the washhouse, and found the door broken open, and the lead which lined the sink, and the pipe which supplied the water, gone—I have compared the lead and pipe found in the prisoners' possession with the place, and am positive it is the same as was on the sink, and the brass tap also—the lead had been wrenched from the sink—the bolt was forced off the washhouse-door, and an inner door broken from the hinges.</p>

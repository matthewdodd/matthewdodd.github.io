A little before three o'clock in the morning, on 14th March, I assisted in taking Webb and Graston, in Montague-court—I found on Webb three sovereigns, twenty-seven shillings, 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, King's Head-court, Shoreditch; the prisoner Webb lodged there, at my mother-in-law's house. On 13th March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw all the four prisoners there—Wilson came in with a coat under his arm, and after he had been in about five minutes he began feeling about the pockets of the coat—I went out, and returned in about five minutes, and Wilson and Feary were disputing with each other, saying that Webb had taken from them a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and Webb and Graston had gone out—a young man, a lodger, named Darby, stepped up to me, and said, "If you like to step out with me, I think I can find them"—we went, and looked in several public-houses, till we came to the Fleur<lb></lb>de-lis, in Magpie-alley—Webb and Graston were in there—we waited, and they came out—Wilson and Feary came up, and they were together three or four hours—I followed them to Mr. Isaacs', in Petticoat-lane—Webb and Graston went in first—they passed through the bar into the parlour—I and the young man with me followed them—Webb called for a pot of porter, and he took up some cards, and began playing at all-fours—Wilson and Feary then came in—Wilson called Mr. Isaacs, and whispered to him—directly after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185004080063"></xptr>
               <p>he had done whispering, Mr. Isaacs came to Webb, and said the two boys (Feary and Wilson) had been telling him all about it, and that he (Webb) had better give the boys something, for they were beginning to turn <hi rend="italic">nasty</hi>—Webb made answer, and said, "It was a bad note, no good"—Mr. Isaacs then called Webb into the private parlour, and they were in there alone about four minutes—when they came out, Mr. Isaacs said he would not have them in his lace—he said he would not be taken out of his place for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he forced them all to go out of his house—we got up, and went out after them, and followed them to a beer-shop in Whitechapel-road—they all four stopped there about half an hour—they came out, and went down Whitechapel and Leadenhall-street, to Bishopsgate-street—Webb and Garston then ran down Sun-street and Long-alley, and by their running they lost the two boys—the next house I saw them go in, was a public-house, at the top of Holy well-lane, there they had a pot of porter—they came out, and went to the London Apprentice, where they had a pot of porter, and two or three quarterns of gin—they came out, and went to a public-house in Church-street, Shoreditch—they had half-a-pint of gin there, and they were forced to come out, as the house closed—they then went to the Sun, and came out of there with two prostitutes, and went up a court in Bishopsgate-street that I do not know the same of, to a brothel, and there they were taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson. Q.</hi> Did I partake of any of the beer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you told them if it were a bad note you would take it back; and you made use of this expression, that if you did not have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it, that Was not much, you would rather get <hi rend="italic">lagged.</hi>

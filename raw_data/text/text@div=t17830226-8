               <p>Court. Why? - I thought it was secreted there with intent to be taken away at night.</p>
               <p>Whose sack was it? - My master's, there was verdigrease in it, I thought it might weigh about a quarter of a hundred; the next morning, while the prosecutor went to the Corn Market, Evans and me went and counted over the parcels which came in the day before, and there was but forty-nine, and we concluded that must be one; we cut a piece out of the sack, which I wrapped up, I put it into the place again, it was there till Friday a little before 12 at night; I went home before the other man, Evans.</p>

               <p>Why so? - It did, because I never saw him up before; I said I was affraid we had a thief in the house, I went to see for the sack and it was gone; it may be from ten minutes to a quarter past eight when the man went out, and I went instantly after him; I had been in the cellar before in the course of the day, but I had not observed the place where the sack was; I informed Mr. Chapman it was gone, we went to the prisoner's lodgings, and took him up, and upon the stair-case we found the property; he lodged up one pair of stairs in a court on Saint Dunstan's-hill, at the house of one

               <p>Mr. Chapman. My Lord, before I got quite down, the prisoner had disengaged himself from Mr. Pack, and he slipped his two arms out of his great coat, and ran away; I saw him run down the hill, and called out, Stop thief! and he was stopped on the keys of Billinsgate.</p>

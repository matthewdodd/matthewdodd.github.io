               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you last saw them safe in your room - A. About seven o'clock, as near as I can say. I left my room at seven o'clock, and did not return till-nine; I left nobody in the room; when I went out I locked the door. When I went out, Logan was not at home; each of us had a key of the room. I came home about nine o'clock; I found the room door wide open; there was no marks of violence on the door; it had been opened by a key, or a picklock. The first time that I saw the things was here, in this court, in April last.</p>

We went in, and brought out the bed; we brought out the bed on the left hand in the room, sheets, blankets, two quilts, a bolster, and a pillow. The street door was shut, and latched; we lifted up the latch. The parlour-door was locked; we opened that with a picklock-key; we brought out the bed and bedding, and took them to Mr. Saunders's, in Dudley-court, Crown-street; he declined buying them. He told us to go to Whitfield, he would buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he - A. A farrier. I and Brown went to Whitfield, the prisoner; I and Brown had the bed, sheets, blankets, quilts bolster, and pillow. We found Whitfield up stairs in the first floor, he lodged there. Brown and me knew him before Brown went up and told him what we had; I staid down stairs. Brown and Whitfield came down stairs to me; we asked him whether he would buy the bed and bedding; he said, bring it to the shop, and he would look at them in the work-shop; we took them in his work-shop up the yard. We shewed him the bed, sheets, blankets, and quilts; he looked at them all. He told us to go to the King's Head public-house, and he would come to us. He asked us to tell him what part of the town it came from; I told him it came from St. James's, about Peter-street. He said, if he knew what part of the town it came from he should know how to dispose of it; then he told us to go to the King's Head public-house; I and Brown went, and left the bed and bedding there. He came to us in five minutes; he asked us what we asked for it; we told him two pound. He said, he would give us twenty-three shillings, that was all he would give; we agreed to take it. He gave me and

            . I live in Green's-court, St. James's. When the property was found in Whitfield's room, I was with the officer. I am Mrs. Smith's sister, the wife of Mr. Smith, who owns the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this house in Green's court - A. Yes, and I am acquainted with the furniture. I made the beds every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the coverlid of the bed now produced - A. Yes, I have no doubt of it. The value of the bed and bedding was about three pounds altogether.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At Queen-square Mr. Smith could not speak to the bed; he said he would send his sister.</p>

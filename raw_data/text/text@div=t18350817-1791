I rent a cottage there—on the 28th of July it was broken open—I left at about seven o'clock in the morning—I left nobody in it—I fastened it; I locked the doof, and took the key with me—the windows were both fast—I returned at about seven o'clock at night, and found a square of glass taken out of the window, which was half open, and the door burst open inside—the neighbours had alarmed me before I got to the house—I missed the property stated in the indictment—I had seen them safe that morning, before I went out—I gave information to the policeman—I saw the prisoner pass me on the 8th of August, as I was at work, with one of</p>

On Tuesday, the 28th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my mother's house and asked for some water to drink—I gave him some; he drank it and went away—he had nothing with him then—I saw him again about half-past three o'clock, with a bundle; not a very large one—it was wrapped in a cross-barred light handkerchief—my mother's house is about 150 yards from the prosecutor's—when he left our house he went towards Hagger's house, and when he had the bundle he was coming from there—I did not know him before—I am sure he is the person—I am quite certain of him.</p>

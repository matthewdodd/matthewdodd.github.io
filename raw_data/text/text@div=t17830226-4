               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I belonged to the Earl of Oxford at Gravesend, and coming from Gravesend to get some employment, along Rosemary-lane, there was a parcel of cast cloaths women, and I bought these stockings for seven pence halfpenny; I got in liquor, and two or three girls met me, and stole my jacket and trowsers; I was taken up for this affair, I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. We have been deliberating, whether the prisoner could be convicted of a capital offence, though not of burglary; but I think the same answer will hold to this part of the charge, because it is essential in an indictment to state whose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260013"></xptr> house it is; and upon this evidence it is not proved, that the prisoner has stole any thing out of the dwelling house of

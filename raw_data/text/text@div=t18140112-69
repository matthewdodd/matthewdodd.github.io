            . On the 1st of January, I was going up Holborn, I saw the two prisoners in company with one another; the prisoner Finch was standing at a door before you come to Mr. Wiggins's shop; Johnson was walking backwards and forwards before the door; I passed them, and went as far as Kingsgate-street. The prisoner Johnson ran after me, he came right in the front of me, and stared me in the face; I recollected I had seen him before; I thought it strange of his turning round and looking me in the face. He immediately went and made water. I immediately crossed the road and went on the other side of the way; Johnson returned back to his companion. I went to a potatoe shop as if to conceal myself for a few minutes; I then saw Johnson and the other prisoner walking backwards and forwards by the door of the prosecutor: a coach passed; I then saw Johnson with this piece of velveteen under his arm; I kept on the same side of the way. Johnson came over to me; I catched hold of him with the velveteen under his arm. The prisoner Finch was crossing over to where I was, but seeing I had got hold of Johnson he made his escape.</p>
               <p>Best. This velveteen is my master's property, James Wiggins.</p>

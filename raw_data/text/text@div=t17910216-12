On Monday, the 31st of January, between seven and eight in the evening, I was on duty in Hyde Park; I saw three men pass at a distance towards Grosvenor-gate, a very small distance from Lord Harrowby's; the hindmost man appeared to have something on his head; I immediately went after them, and stopped the last man, which is Rees, and sent Cridland, the other patrole, to go after the other two; the man I stopped, had his coat buttoned, and a smock frock over it; he had this lead under his coat: Brothick, another of the patrole, was with me, and took this piece which was on his head; Cridland brought back the other two men, and I secured all three; the third man was discharged, no lead being found on him; I went with Mr. Banner the plumber, the day after, to Lord Harrowby's; and we fitted the lead together with Mr. Serjeant; we found it exact; it was not half a quarter of what was wanted; I found a knife on Goodman.</p>

               <p>I am a plumber. On the 1st of February, I was seat for to replace some lead that had been stolen from the flat in Lord Harrowby's kitchen; I found five sheets had been cut, part of which was taken away; and I understood some lead was at Bow-street; and I ordered that the lead on the flat might not be removed till I had been in Bow-street; I went there, and was shewn some lead; and Mr. Shallard and me took the lead; in a coach to Lord Harrowby's, and opened it on the flat in four separate pieces, which matched; three of them to the lead that was cut, and one of them to the knot in the board, by a mark of turpentine; as the lead lay there, matched to the others with a knife, I cut off these two pieces with a knife which was found in Goodman's pocket, the shape and strength of which was very convenient for the purpose; I have not the least doubt but that lead was cut from this flat: I suppose, at least, twelve hundred pounds weight was taken away; this is a gross hundred and eighteen pounds, which is one hundred and thirty pounds weight; there is an open railing into the park, through which the lead might be handed.</p>

               <p>I had been at Kensington with a letter; I was coming back; and close by Lord Bathurst's house, I saw these three pieces of lead lay; one was tied up in a handkerchief; I picked that up, and opened the handkerchief, and saw it was lead; and I took the other piece and put under my arm, to find the owner; and just by the bason in Hyde Park, Goodman passed me, and bid me good night; and another young man passed me afterwards, and bid me good night; in two hundred yards I saw Sir Sampson's officers stand by the bason; and that gentleman, Shallard, immediately asked me what I had there? I said it was lead; he asked me who the other two men were? I told him I did not know; I told him there was another piece behind; and I asked him to go the bason again, on the night this was missing; I was about thirty yards off.</p>

In November, 1741, I saw a Gold Watch with two Diamonds, which the Prisoner showed me; says she, I have got a Chance, and if you help me to a Chap for it, I will satisfy you; said I, Let me look at it; as soon as I saw it, I told her there were twenty Guineas Reward offered for it, and advised her to carry it to Mr. Dubammel ; she said, she would not, for she could make thirty Guineas of it. There was one Harris who kept her Company, but is gone off, said to her, You will come to be hanged for this Practice. Oh! says she, I am not afraid of that by Jesus God, as that is their Irish way of talking.

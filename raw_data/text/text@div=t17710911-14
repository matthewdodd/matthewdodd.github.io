Last Saturday was fortnight bread fell short; he said there was too little made; we afterwards missed more bread. About six o'clock on the 29th, as I was sitting up, I heard a rattle twice at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110011"></xptr> the window shutter; then the prisoner came up with four quartern loaves; he set them on the window. I came out and stood on the landing place of the stairs, and watched him; he opened the door, took the shutter down, and put it into the place, turned back the shutter, and the woman took the four loaves into her apron. I came down naked and catched her in the street; I was in my shirt; she had the four quartern loaves in her apron: we found were the woman lived and there they found these two saucers, 3 towel and a bag with flour. (producing them.) Before the justice she said she had paid him. He said she had not, and he thought she was going to pay when she ran away. There was not a word pass'd between them. I had but about a dozen steps to come down. I was standing three steps down when this happened.</p>

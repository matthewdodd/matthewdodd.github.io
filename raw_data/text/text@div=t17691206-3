On the 22d of November, at night, before I went to bed, the doors and windows were made fast, and the bells put up to the windows. I went to bed about a quarter after ten. My lady was out of town, so there was only a woman, that my lady hires by the week, in the house, when she is out, and myself. After the watch went half an hour after five, I heard a noise; imagining the woman was up, making fires all about the house to air the rooms, as my lady was expected home that morning. I heard the bells ring, and I thought I heard a poker fall. After that I heard a very great noise of a fall, which shook the bed I lay upon; which I found afterwards to be an iron chest which they had brought out from a water closet in the parlour, which could not be removed there by one man. When I got up in the morning, which was about a quarter before seven, as I was coming down, the woman was rather before me (this noise continued till almost seven). I said to her, Pray, have you been up stairs to make the fires? She said no. Then I said the house is robbed. We found the street door open. I ran down to see how they got in. I found they had opened all the doors below stairs. I found the back door open, the bells all taken off, and thrown into the area (the kitchen is below-stairs ). When I was in the housekeeper's room, that opens into the area, I saw how they got in. There is a press, which had been broke open, and a great deal of linen strewed about the floor; the window-shutter was broke which looks into the street, rather<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060004"></xptr> under the area: it was an inside shutter: the screws were taken out where it was fastened down, the sash up, and a quarry near the place seemed to be cut out with a diamond. The screws I found in the coal-hole. There is no outside shutter, but there is a bar goes down across the inside shutter, and it is fastened with a thing that turns round. I believe they must pull their clothes off to put their hand in to turn that thing. There were a great deal of table linen and fine sheets taken away. I mist my own silver buckles, two tea-spoons, one table-spoon, and my hat. My buckles I had left in my shoes, at the bottom of the stairs, when I went to bed. I then went up stairs, having heard a noise there; where I missed a table-clock, and some tea which they had taken out of a tea-chest. They had bent up the lid of the iron chest, and finding it contained only writings, they opened it no further. As soon as I had cleaned myself, I went to the watchmaker, and got the clock described; then I went to Sir

            . We had repeated informations concerning these things of Lady Middleton's, and we had a suspicion of the prisoner: hearing where he lived, we acquainted Sir John with it: he lived in a court in St. Martin's Lane that comes out into Bedfordbury. I believe he is a jeweller. Sir John ordered Wright and I to watch both ends of the court last Thursday was sevennight, the day after Lady Middleton's house was robbed. Wright was there about twelve, and I about one. When I came, he told me there were four people went by him, and went into that court, all people of ill fame, and they had taken two in custody, but the other two were gone. We waited till six in the morning, he at one end, and I at the other. We set two people at the door where Cave lived, to watch that no body came out. There was an old man like a porter going out to work; I said to Mr. Wright, We had better go now, and if there is any thing, we shall find it. We went up and knocked at the door. The prisoner came and opened it. We went in, and in searching a box, I found these thirteen napkins, and other things, in a room where the prisoner and his wife were in bed. We took him in custody: searching his wife's pocket, I found a watch. We sent them to Bridewell. I found also a dark lantern, a tinder-box, and some matches. He said he bought the napkins of a Jew when before Sir John.</p>

My house was broke open on Sunday evening, the 12th of November, between six and seven o'clock. My family was all out at the time. I went out about ten minutes before six, and returned about nine. We did not fasten the outward door, there being lodgers in the garret, and also in the kitchen; but we fastened the shop door that opens into the entry. When we returned, we found the staple was forced out, and that the bolt had been forced.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060005"></xptr> The door was cracked across, and burst open. We missed the till, lock and key, and some half-pence out of the shop. (I keep a chandler's shop.) Out of the next room to the shop I lost three silver tea-spoons, a pair of wooden tea-tongs, and a petticoat of my wife's; and in another room beyond that, we lost all our clothes that we pulled off, two pillows, two pillow-cases, a work-basket with new work in it, and a small deal box with a great many things of my wife's in it; also a large pier glass. The two doors to the back room we left open: they were on the ground floor, and no other way to them but through the shop. I have put nothing in the indictment but what was found again. When the prisoner was taken up, I went to his lodgings, and there I found my two pillows and pillow-cases on his bed, the work-basket, and some more trifling things of my wife's.

On the 11th of November, in the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, my shop was robbed of a white flowered saque and coat, a pink sattin night-gown, a gray watered tabby gown, all unripped and put together, in order for dying; three yards of blossom-coloured silk; this was brought to me, in order to dye with this gown, to match in colour, which has been found in the prisoner's possession. There was a pane of glass that had some cracks in it, which I found was taken out. The shop was not shut up. There was a candle on the counter. I suppose they put in their hands, or other instrument, in order to draw these things out. My shop was left without any body in it. I had called my apprentice to me backwards, for it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. These things lay in the window, upon a shelf, under where the pane of glass was in part taken out. Some of them stood upright. I sent my boy out of the dye-house from me on an errand, and as he went out at the door, a neighbour's apprentice said to him, Sam, I am watching two men that I saw put their hands into your window. The boy immediately came back and called me into the shop, saying, Sir, there is a piece of glass out of one of the panes, and here are some things missing. I soon missed three of the things, and found the pieces of glass out. I immediately went up to Sir

(The remnants of silk produced in court, with a waistcoat.) This is the silk, and here is a waistcoat, which Mr. Bond will give an account of. The front of it was made off from this very same silk. (He puts the silk to the waistcoat, and it exactly fitted to the cut of the upper part of the waistcoat; so that he was very able to swear the front pieces of the waistcoat were cut off the same piece of silk, they being indented, as it were, to each other.) I swear it very safely, the fronts of the waistcoat were cut from those pieces of silk.</p>

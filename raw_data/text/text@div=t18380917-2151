                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Benn Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Long Acre. Between one and two o'clock, on the 30th of August, I was in the shop, and was informed that we had lost a coat—I went out, looked round, and saw the prisoner running away, up the street, with something in his arms—I pursued, and overtook a policeman—I ordered him to run after him, which he did, and captured him; but he</p>

I was in Long Acre, and Whitworth told me the prisoner had stolen a coat—I saw him running up with something in his arms—I pursued him, and in running through Wild-court, he threw the coat into the passage of the door-way—I took it up and then ran and took him.</p>

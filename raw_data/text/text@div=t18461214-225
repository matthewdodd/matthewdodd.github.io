                  </hi>. I am shopman to Ebenezer Howard, a poul<lb></lb>terer, in Leadenhall-market. On the 5th of Dec., about half-past eight o'clock, I watched the prisoner—he had the basket, which the policeman has now, hanging on his shoulder—he looked through our shop, and drew four fowls off the board—he put them into the basket, put it on his shoulder, and walked away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Stover, who is a shoe-maker, and lives in Whitechapel-road. About half-past four o'clock on the 3rd of Dec. I was out on an errand, and saw the prisoners together nearly opposite the prosecutor's—I had seen them about the road in company for about three weeks or a month, and I knew them to be acquainted—I heard M'Phin say, "Let us cross the road "—they crossed, and passed the prosecutor's shop—I watched them, and Castle walked by the shop two or three times—a lady came to the door—Castle watched her in, and then he took a pair of boots off the hook by the door-post—the other two prisoners were a few doors past the shop, and their heads were turned from it—they were near enough to have seen the shop—Castle gave the boots to M'Phin, and he and Boggis crossed the road, and began to throw stones at one another—they then went down St. Mary's-street, and ran off together—Castle ran on, and a policeman caught him—I saw Mr. Yates come out, calling, "Stop thief!"—I gave information of what I saw, and the next morning I saw Boggis pass my master's shop, which is opposite White-chapel church—I knew him again, and gave him into custody—I saw. M'Phin. again on Wednesday evening, and gave him into custody—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoners are the boys I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Phin</hi>. When he saw Castle give me the boots why did he not tell Mr. Yates where I was, and why did he not give me into custody; while I was picking up stones? he had time to give me in charge.</p>

I am a shoemaker, and live in Whitechapel-road—I was at my cutting-board at the back of my shop on the 3rd of Dec.—a little child of mine gave an alarm—I ran to the door and pursued the pri<lb></lb>soner Castle—I could not catch him—I called "Stop thief!" and the policeman caught him—when I first went out, Castle had a pair of boots in his hand—he gave them to a boy taller than himself; but I could not swear to the boy, as my attention was directed to Castle—when Castle was stopped he denied it, but Clark came up and said, "I know all the thieves, I have watched them for the last three weeks, they have been about our door watching the boots and shoes; if you will keep it quiet I can take them all;" and he did—I missed the pair of boots from the shop</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar; I met him at the head of Old Gravel lane, with the lead in a sack, on the 21st of November, about four in the evening; I asked him what he had got there; he said, a bit of blue; that is slang for lead; I do not know whether any examination was taken in writing before the magistrate; he said he had had it seven months: at the public-house he said he had an estate in Hertfordshire; the lead has been kept in the office under my charge; I marked it with a W.</p>

               <p>Turner. I was convicted of an assault, and confined in Newgate; it was upon a girl, for striking her; it was not for an attempt to commit a rape.</p>

I lost these things on the 26th of February, out of my box, which was in the loft, at Mr. Woodwards, where I live; it was about seven o'clock - I was feeding a team of horses at the door, and heard a noise in the left; I went and looked up, and saw the prisoner coming down; I asked what he did there, he said he went there to lay down - I asked what he had got under his frock; he said, his shirt - I took it out, and it was this property of mine; he was a stranger - he struggled, but I called for help, and he was secured.</p>

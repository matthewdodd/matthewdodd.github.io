                  </hi>. I have a freehold house in High-street, Homerton—I had a stove fixed there, and a copper which was up in the garret, to catch the water that came from the roof—they are here—the copper I am sure I mine—the stove I cannot be positive to—the copper was there on the Sa<lb></lb>turday previous—I can only say I think the copper is mine—I have no mark on it—I know it—I lost it fourteen years ago, and bought it back again, and it had water in it part of the way up.</p>

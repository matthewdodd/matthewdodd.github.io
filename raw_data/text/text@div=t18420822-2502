                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Cannon-street-road. The pri<lb></lb>soner brought me a copy of this bill, which the officer has in his posses<lb></lb>sion, and asked me if I could get any thing of that sort done—he said he had had a very serious conversation with his father, and that his father had agreed to accept a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill for the benefit of himself and his sister, who held some money in the Accountant-General's hand in the Bank of England, and she was to repay it when she became of age—I knew that the prisoner was living at home with his father under great difficulties, and in great distress—I had it for a day or two, and applied to several of my neighbours, to know if they could do any thing of the sort—we knew the young man not to possess any thing, and so I represented to Mr. Alsford—it was done on the strength of the respectability of the elder Mr. Layel—I applied to Mr. Alsford on Saturday morning, the 21st, and said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220229"></xptr>
               <p>"Here is a young man who has been, like a great many more, rather wild at home—(I knew that, and expressed it particularly to Mr. Alsford)—the father seems inclined to serve them, as the sister has got some money, has brought me a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, which he wants discounted"—he said, "If you had come last night, and it is a real thing, I could have done it, but I have paid all my money away, and have not got above 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I met him again on Saturday afternoon—I had no idea at that moment that the bill would be done—however, we were to make inquiry, to get news of the elder Mr. Layel—I had not the slightest doubt of the prisoner's representation, that his father would do it—I told Mr. Alsford, that the best way would be to depute some one to go to Mr. Layel's house, and make inquiry, and he asked me to do it, as he was rather busy—I went, and the prisoner was standing at the street-door in his shirt-sleeves, and his tooth-brush in his hand, as if just up—I said, "Good morning, I have come to see the old gentleman"—he replied, "Oh, he got so terribly <hi rend="italic">lushy</hi> last night, when we had company, he is not up yet"—he asked me into the parlour—the place seemed all in confusion, and it seemed feasible that company had been there—he went up stairs, knocked at a door, came down again, and said, "The old man is too <hi rend="italic">lushy</hi> to get up yet; sit down"—I said, "No, thank you, I will go and get a glass of beer"—he said, "I will have breakfast, shave myself, and come down"—I went to a public-house, and stopped there three-quarters of an hour, and as I was coming away, hardly intending to go back again, I met the prisoner near the end of the street—I said I was just going—he said, "Well, I can't help it, I have been out some little way; come in, perhaps the old man is about now"—we went into the parlour, and his sister came in—he said, "Martha, go up and tell the old man (or "father," I will not swear which) that the person is come here about the bill"—she went up, and in a short time came down with a piece of paper in her hand; with "The Bill" written on the outside, which was the envelope, and gave it into the prisoner's hands—he said to her, "What did the old man say?"—"Why," she said, "all he said was, 'There it is, don't make a fool of it'—I said, "Oh, is that all he said?"—the prisoner opened the envelope, and wanted to show it to me—I said, "I am not going to do it"—"Oh," they said, "it is a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, with two months' date on it"—he put it in the envelope, and put it into his pocket—we then walked up to London together, went to the Duke of Gloucester, had dinner, and a little brandy afterwards—at three o'clock we went to Mr. Alsford—I had promised to go to him in the middle of the day, to tell him the result of the inquiry I made at the house—we had three or four tumblers of brandy and water, but that was afterwards, be<lb></lb>tween five and six, and we had something at the Red Lion—Mr. Alsford went with me to the Red Lion—I should think the prisoner was drunk at the time Mr. Alsford came—I judged so from his writing that he made, a memorandum—he was quite capable of taking care of himself—he had drank enough to make his hand shake.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And when he was drunk he agreed to take £20 for the present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not consider he was very drunk—there is a good deal of difference in what is called being drunk and <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—he was not so drunk but he knew what he was about—I told him Alsford had not got the money—he said, "You know my situation; I am very short; I don't want people denying me; I want a few pounds"—I think he was drunk when he wrote the agreement, and he certainly was when he uttered the bill—I consider Alsford was sober, but I had been drinking myself, and I never know after I take</p>

               <p>a drop of grog—I was in a drunken state—I did not think it a strange proposition if the father was a good man, to pay £20 for the use of the money for two months, for I had heard several accounts of the old gentle<lb></lb>man as being very eccentric, and a man that never paid any debts without giving a bill for them—the prisoner scarcely knew who was going to dis<lb></lb>count the bill, and he said to me in the morning, "I hope it is not going into any Jew discounter's hands, for my father has been punished so much through them with me"—I most decidedly thought it was a good bill—if I had not thought so, I should not have recommended it—the daughter brought it down, as if the father had written it up-stairs, otherwise it would not have been done by my recommendation—I believed it to be a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> transaction.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you know that Mr. Alsford would do the thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know that he would—I scarcely had any idea that he would when I went to him—I shall have to resign Mr. Alsford his money that he gave me—it has not been a good thing for me—I could have earned almost the £100 in the time, besides the trouble and the anxiety it has put me to.</p>

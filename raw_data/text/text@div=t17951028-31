               <p>Q. Are you any relation to Diana? - I am son. My mother is an infirm woman, of seventy five years of age, and lives with me. I support her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her losing a gown? - It was missed on the fourth day of October. It was a cotton gown. We found it the next day, the fifth, at the pawnbroker's. The maid servant of mine had seen it on Thursday, and from her information I found it was missed on Sunday. The prisoner came to a lodger that was in my house, that lay in there. She was taken in my house, and the duplicate was found on her. The gown is here, and here is a piece of the same.</p>

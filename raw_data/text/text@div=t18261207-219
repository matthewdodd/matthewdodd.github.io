On the 3d of November, at a quarter past eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in Southampton-row, with this trunk on his shoulder; I asked where he was going with it - he said,"To No. 10, Maida-vale," and that he had brought it from the White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly - but as he was not going that way, I sprang my rattle, and secured him; I took the trunk to the office, and produce it here.</p>

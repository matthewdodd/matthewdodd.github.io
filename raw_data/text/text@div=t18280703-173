I lost three fowls from a shed in my yard on the 30th of June; I went to bed at ten o'clock at night, and was called at half-past eleven; the fowls were then in the next yard, with their heads cut off; I knew nothing of the prisoner till I saw him the next morning; he then said he knew nothing at all of them - he had gone through a passage into the yard, and could not get out, for a dog barked - the woman went and bolted the door, and he could not get back.</p>
               <p>ISAAC TERRY. I live in the next house to Mr. Bell. I found the prisoner the next morning in my privy, with my stockings round his body; I asked him what he wanted there - he said he came up the passage; I told him to go along, and he tried to get out, but the door was bolted; I then looked further, and found two blankets down the privy.</p>

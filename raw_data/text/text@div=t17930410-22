I saw him cut at Mr. Bunny across the neck; I asked does the man want to rob you? Mr. Bunny said, yes, he has got a long knife behind him; I immediately laid my head on one side to look, and he immediately shoved it into my jackets, which with that I said, O Lord help me! for I am done; I then said I will take you now; with that he ran about twelve yards or so, and I ran up to him and pushed him to an hedge, and we took him; going along to the magistrate he tried to pick the knife out of my pocket and when he could not do that he tried to get another knife out of his own pocket, says, he I am done; now says I, what must my wife and family have done had you killed me? says he, I might as well have killed you and saved myself.</p>

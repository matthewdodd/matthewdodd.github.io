               <p>Q. Do you yourself know, that the premises were secured? - A. Yes; I went to bed on the night of Tuesday the 3d of February, about eleven o'clock, the shop windows were barred, I saw them safe; between six and seven o'clock the next morning, we were called up by some people going past; when I came down, I found the window frame<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180029"></xptr>wrenched out from the brick wall, they got in between the brick wall and the window frame, they had attempted at another place, but did not succeed, at the window next the water-side; one part of the house fronts the river Thames, and the other part is in French-street; upon examining the goods, we missed the articles mentioned in the indictment; I found a dark lantern that they had left behind them, in a passage, coming from the upper warehouse to the door; the warehouse and shop are all one, there is a step-ladder goes from the one to the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Shall you be able to speak to the goods, when they are produced? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JOHN RUSSELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am constable of Hampton: On Wednesday the 11th of February, Mr. Bushell brought me this bundle, containing eleven shammy leather skins, and in the afternoon I went to search the house of Barnes, at Kensington, Thorpe and Mr. Bushell went with me; we found Mrs. Gillett there, her husband went out upon our going in, and said, he would go and fetch Barnes and Mary Hodges, but I have never seen him since; I found in that room, the articles contained in this bundle, (producing it;) Barnes was brought over to the White-hart, in custody, and upon him was found a pair of breeches, which Mrs. Kern claimed; Mary Hodges was brought in custody also, and upon her person was found this gown and check apron, which were claimed by Mrs. Kern: On Thursday morning, the 12th, I went to Mr. Goddard's, at Sunbury, I told him we were come to enquire what goods he had belonging to Mrs. Kern; he seemed violently agitated, and desired me to go down stairs to his wife, who would inform me, and she informed me, that they were buried in the garden; she directed me to an apple-tree, in their garden, before the house, it was a very frosty morning, and I could easily discover that it had been fresh dug; I dug there and found two pair of stockings, some check, some brown Holland, and some coarse linen, which have been sworn to by Mrs. Kern; I then went to Mr. Luker's, a pawnbroker, at Kingston, and to Mr. Clarke's, who is also a pawnbroker, at Kingston, and from there to Michael Hayman's, in Blackman street, in the Borough, where I found as many goods belonging to Mrs. Kern, as would fill two sacks.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he a pawnbroker? - A. He sells a variety of articles, he is a general dealer.</p>
               <p>JOHN THORPE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine.

               <p>Court. Q.Where is Dalton's lodging-house? - A.Very near the church-yard, in the horsefair; Barnes lived in Back-lane; he had on a pair of breeches, and a pair of stockings, which Mrs. Kern claimed; Mary Hodges had on a gown, a check apron, and I think a petticoat, which Mrs. Kern claimed; they did not attempt to deny but what they were the property of Mrs. Kern; Barnes hardly uttered a word; Mr. Russell has had them ever since; I have the dark-lantern, (produces it;) and here is the fill of the window,(producing it;) we have also a tool here that was found at Barnes's, which matches with the marks in the fill.</p>

            ; I know this to be mine, and the black stuff petticoat that she had on was mine, a pair of cotton stockings, and this apron.</p>
               <p>Q.Now look at the shammy leather skins? - A.There is my own hand-writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Now look at the articles found under the apple-tree, at Goddard's? - A.This linen cloth is mine, and the flannel; this brown Holland is mine, it is now cut into pin-cloths.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you examined all these articles? - A. Yes, they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount do you suppose you were robbed? - A. I am sure they could not be replaced for one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Russell. Here are two sacks of the articles that I found at Hayman's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kern. I have looked them over, they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Barner's defence. These breeches, that the lady has sworn to, are mine; I bought them in town,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180031"></xptr>she put the mark upon them after they were taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Kern.) Did you put the mark on before or after? - A. There was a mark upon them before.</p>
               <p>Goddard's defence. I am innocent of the charge; my wife was frightened after she heard that my sister was taken up, and she hid them, I did not hide them.(The prisoner Hodges put in a written defence as follows:)</p>
               <p>The defence of Mary Hodges, most humbly addressed to this honourable Court, who am now in your presence, on a charge of buying a gown, a petticoat, apron, and skins: It is represented that I bought them, knowing them to the stolen, which charge I do most solemnly declare is wrong, as when John Gillett spoke to me of buying the things, I had not the least idea of their being stolen; the apparel I bought for my own use, at a price I thought a sufficient value for them; the skins I had no use for, but as I am a tailoress by trade, I told him I thought I could find a purchaser for them, as they would do for linings of breeches; I took them to Mr. Bushell, a master tailor, who bought them of me. My Lord and honoured Gentlemen, permit me to beg of you to consider my unhappy case, with that great judgment, as well as mercy, which is ever known to reign in your breasts, that it is not probable I should have taken these things to any person to tell, with the name of the owner upon the paper round them; being fully assured there was nothing to fear, I innocently went to the first person I thought they would suit, thereby thinking to serve the buyer and the seller, without ever thinking such an affair would end in such fatal consequences as this proves to me; robbed of my liberty, and being now far advanced in my pregnancy, makes my trouble heavier, as I have no friends in London to assist me, or to do any thing for me in my unhappy affair; all my consolation is, that I am to be tried by gentlemen who discard not the poor unfortunate culprits, whose misconduct or misfortunes brings before them, but with mercy and probity searches into facts; that I may be one who may be thought worthy of your attention, is the most ardent prayer of my Lords and Gentlemen, your humble petitioner.</p>

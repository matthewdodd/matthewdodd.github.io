In consequence of some information on the night of 15th Sept., I went to an unfinished building in Hoxton Old Town, and there found the prisoner—I asked him what he was doing there—he told me he had got in there for the purpose of lying down—I told him I thought there was a serious charge against him, and I should take him to the station—I examined him there, and found his person exactly answered the description I had heard of him—I then told him I charged him with being an escaped convict from the York bulk—he said nothing.</p>

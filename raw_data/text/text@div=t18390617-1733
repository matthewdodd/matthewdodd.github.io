                  </hi>. I am agent to the attorney for this prosecution. I accompanied Mr. Archbut, the solicitor, to Brighton, on the 3rd of April, to make inquiry for Sir John Laws, and Mr. Salmon, his clerk—I inquired at the libraries, the newspaper offices, the post-office, and every where I could imagine, but could find neither of such persons—I came to London, and went to the four Inns of Court, but could find no such person as Sir John Laws—I know nothing of such an office as "commissioner of laws."</p>

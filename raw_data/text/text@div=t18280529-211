               <p>MR. LAW conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SHERIMAN. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half; in consequence of information given by me to the Mint, I was placed under the direction of Limbrick, the officer. On the 8th of May I saw the prisoner and again on the 15th, and told him I should see him in a day or two; I saw him again on the 27th, but before that I met Limbrick, Kirby, Reynolds, Lloyd and Isaacs; I was searched by Limbrick, for the purpose of seeing whether I had anything about me, but I had not - Limbrick then gave me four marked shillings, and half-a-crown and sixpence which were not marked. I went with them to the prisoner's house, in <placeName id="t18280529-211-crimeloc1169">Cobb's-yard, Petticoat-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18280529-211-crimeloc1169" type="placeName" value="Cobb's-yard, Petticoat-lane"></interp>

I stepped to the door, gave a signal to Reynolds and Isaacs, who came in - the prisoner's sister and his foolish brother were in the house; they made great resistance; when the officers let go of the sister, she made a rush, picked up something which I thought was the bag, and ran to the privy; I had not observed where the prisoner had put the bag - Reynolds rushed after her, and caught her arm as it was down the privy; the twenty counterfeit shillings were found on me; the sister came to me and asked if I had any shofle about me, if I had to put it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who employed you? A. I spoke to Mr. Powell, and he sent for Limbrick; I was never in custody - my wife is in custody at Chelmsford, charged with passing bad money; I sell sweetmeats - I was a gentleman's servant about six years ago; I never did a job of this kind before; Limbrick gave me the marked money at the Crown tavern, on Clerkenwell-green, about twelve o'clock on that day; I went straight to Cobb's yard - I have received nothing for this, nor been promised anything - I expect to be paid for my trouble.</p>

            . I am an inspector of coin. These twenty shillings are all counterfeit; they are in separate papers, being so slightly covered with silver - eighteen are from one die, and two from another; there are some from both dies in the bag - they are all bad half crowns and half sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Are they fit for circulation? A. They are not what is called"rubbed down;" they now represent money just come from the Mint; the persons who pass them generally rub them down - thousands have been passed in this state.</p>

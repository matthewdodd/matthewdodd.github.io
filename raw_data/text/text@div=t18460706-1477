From my quarters I can see any person passing within the walls of the barracks—it is only the width of the road, about thirty feet wide—I could see over the fence—the wall is not yet erected—on Sunday night, the 31st of May, I saw the prisoner Bramley within the barrack, about a quarter before ten o'clock—I knew him well—I saw him pass along within the fence, and go to the Commandant's house—he went to the cellar of the Command<lb></lb>ant's house, which is below the building—he came up again, and left the barrack-yard for a short time—he then returned, and I particu<lb></lb>larly noticed him—he went to the corner of the wall with a bundle which looked to be light, and while I was giving information to a policeman the bundle was thrown over the wall, but it lodged on the wall for a second or two, and was pulled down by a party on the other side, whom I could not see—I directed the policeman to go up the lane, which would lead to the other side of the wall—I went into the barrack-yard myself, and saw Bramley coming towards the guard-room—I said, "You are the man I want"—he made no reply—I lodged him in the guard-room—the policeman Coglan afterwards pointed out a spot to me on the other side of the wall, that corre<lb></lb>sponded with the spot where I saw the bundle thrown—there was only the thickness of the wall between—it was just on the other side of the wall—the prisoners are all marines, and had been absent from barracks—Bramley had been discharged from the hospital about two o'clock on the Friday, and had been absent from barracks from the Friday afternoon, and the other two pri<lb></lb>soners had been absent from the Friday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at Woolwich. I found a bundle in the area of the officers' quarters, at the new buildings in the new barracks—I told the foreman, and he told me to put it back in the same place, and he would fetch the hospital sergeant—he fetched him, and I returned and picked up the bundle from where I found it at first, and gave it to the sergeant—this is it—it contains nine flannel shirts—I found this bundle about ten yards from where the wrapper was found, near the house adjoining—the bundle was tied up tightly, and a parcel of shavings over it—I was at work, and trod on the shavings—I felt something hard, and found the bundle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Docra.

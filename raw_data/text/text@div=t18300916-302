            . I am a Police-officer. Last Friday evening, at half-past six o'clock, I was on duty at Mill-wall, and saw the prosecutor; in consequence of his statement I apprehended the prisoners in the neighbourhood - I went to Puttick with his friends, and asked him how he had come by a boat; he said Chittell gave him the money to purchase it - I took Chittell at his mother's, asked what he knew of the robbery, and how he got the money he had given to Puttick for the boat; he said he knew nothing of the robbery, and had not given Puttick any money - I took him to Puttick, and asked if that was the boy who gave him the money to purchase the boat; he said, Yes, it was - I then asked Chittell how he got the money, but did not hold out threat or promise to him; he burst into tears, and said he got it from Mr. Wood's house - I asked him who was concerned; he said Bulmer and Ward - Chittell said he got over the back wall, broke the kitchen window, put his hand through, unboited the door, got in and broke the chest open with a mallet and chisel, and took the money; I asked what the money was - he said eight sovereigns, two half-sovereign, and 20s.; he said he had given Bulmer and Puttick 4l. to purchase the boat, and Bulmer, Ward and Puttick 1l. each beside, and spent the rest - Puttick denied having more than the 4l.; Bulmer and Ward also said they had no more than the 4l. for the boat - that Chittell had told them he found the money, and they knew nothing of the robbery; and he said that nobody but himself knew of the robbery till after he committed it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you neither threatened nor promised Chittell any thing; did you not tell him he would be hung? A. No, I did not; he told me himself how the robbery was done.</p>

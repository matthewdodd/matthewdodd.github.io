On the 19th of March the prisoner came with a double knock at the door, and said he wanted to see Mr. Douglas on particular business - I went up-stairs, came down again, and, in consequence of information from another servant, I missed a pair of sugar-tongs from a teatray in the pantry, on the right-hand side of the street-door, about a yard from where the prisoner stood - I rang the bell, and inquired of the footman if he had taken them; he said No - I then took hold of the prisoner, and found the tongs between the lining and the cloth of his coat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he ever been there before? A. Yes; I had seen him three or four months before when he came for Mr. Douglas to sign a petition; he said he hoped Mr. Douglas would forgive him, as he was a real Scotchman and Mr. Douglas was the same.</p>

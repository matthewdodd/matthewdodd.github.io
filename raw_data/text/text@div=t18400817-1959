                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Marchmont-place, Little Coram-street I was at the Brill public-House, Somers-town, on Saturday night, the 1st of August, about a quarter before twelve o'clock—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there, and we had two or three words—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> against me—I asked what he did that for—he told me he would smack my face—I did not <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> against him in return—I walked outside, and stood there till he came out, and he leant up against the railing—I went over to him and asked what he insulted me for in the house—I merely put my hand on his collar, and he took and ran a knife into my side—here is the wound—I attempted then to strike him, but fell back against the railing, and told Grady I was stabbed—he went over to catch hold of him to give him into custody, and he made a <hi rend="italic">dart</hi> with the knife at Grady, and if he had not stood back he would have put the knife into his belly—I was taken to the station-house, and sent from there in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the hospital—I was only there one night—I had my waistcoat, jacket, and shirt on—the knife went through them all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Lucas-place, Tonbridge-street, New-road—I get my living usually by charing and other work. I was in the Brill public-house on Saturday night, the 1st of August—I and the prisoner went in together to have some beer with Caroline Gorman and Joseph Mitchell, about half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve o'clock—we all four stood together—I saw M'Carthy there when we went in—as</p>

               <p>we were standing, drinking, Grady came up, and asked the prisoner for some beer, which was refused—upon which Grady <hi rend="italic">smacked</hi> him in the face—the blow was repeated a second time, and after that Mitchell took it up—the barman turned Mitchell out—the moment he was turned out the gas-lights were put out, and the observation was made, "Don't put the lights out, some of us will be killed"—at that moment M'Carthy came and caught hold of the prisoner, and dragged him out of the place—we, being females, did not think it proper to go out in the mob, and continued there till the mob was dispersed—as soon as they were dispersed a little, we went out, and the first cry was that Gates was stabbed in the thumb, and the blood was pouring—I went to the station-house—there were several per<lb></lb>sons in company with Grady and M'Carthy, but I did not know them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner. I was at the Brill public-house on the 1st of August, in company with the prisoner and Spurrier—we called for a pot of beer between us—a person named Connor and Grady were sparring together—Grady hit the prisoner in the face—they put the gas out—the barman came and took me out—I stood outside the door three or four minutes before the rest came out—they all rushed out together—Grady had hold of one collar of the prisoner, and M'Carthy the other, and they shook him—when they came outside M'Carthy struck the prisoner, and they rushed into one another—I cannot say which used the knife—I saw no more of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the coal line. I was in the public-house, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor there—the prosecutor said, "Are you going to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> a pint of beer?"—the prisoner said, "No, I amn't—he instantly <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand, and gave him a smack on his mouth, and kept pushing him, to insult him—they put the lights out, and bundled them all out to<lb></lb>gether—when they got out they got fighting together—the prisoner said, "By G—you have cut my thumb off," and the prosecutor said, "You b—, you have stuck me"—I said to the policeman, "Take them both, and you are sure to have the right one."</p>

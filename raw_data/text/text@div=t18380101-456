I keep between 200 and 300 sheep, merely for my own amusement—I have about 200 acres of land—the prisoner was my bailiff—I intended to take him as such, but had him a month on trial—he acted as bailiff—he had no authority to sell any hay on my account—nor did he ever inform me that he had sold any—in consequence of his being taken up on the last case, a person from the Rose public-house came and asked if I knew about any hay.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On the Saturday previous to my sending this hay to Har<lb></lb>per's, I consulted master about binding out part of a stack of hay, and he thought I had better do it—to bind the whole of the hay out—he told me Mr. Hatton would take all—that he was a man who bought all his bad hay, but he said, "Do you know his price?"—I said, "No"—he said, "He won't give you but 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a load." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Not a word of the sort passed. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I live at the Rose, at New-cross. I bought eighteen trusses of hay of the prisoner—they came in on the 5th of De<lb></lb>cember, but he asked me in November if I wanted any, being in the habit of having it of the former bailiff—I said, "What is it a load"—he said, "4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "I generally have the middling, I cannot afford so much"—that is about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a quarter of a load—he said, I should have a quarter of a load for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or half a load for 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he brought half a load, and the same night came down to my house with a bill, which I produce—it ii in pencil—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and was to pay the rest by Christmas—but when the prisoner got into trouble I thought it right to go to Mr. Holcombe—I only paid the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my wife paid him, and I promised to pay him the rest between that and Christmas—he said I need not pay any then unless I chose—I said, "I have nothing but a £5. note"—this was on the 5th of December—he signed my book as re<lb></lb>ceiving it—I was never present when Mr. Holcombe and the prisoner were speaking on the subject of hay—I had dealt with the other man (Hall) and thought I might deal with him—I paid Hall for what I had of him.</p>

On the 13th of June, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Tothill-street, Westminster - I had got up to take a walk; I was perfectly sober - I cannot say whether she spoke to me first, or I to her; but I asked her to go and have a glass of gin and milk, and she did; I paid for it, and then had a sovereign, a shilling, and a sixpence- we only stood at the bar: we came out, and I asked her to go and take a walk; she went home and got a shawl; we walked round York-row, and on to <placeName id="t18300708-30-crimeloc172">Arabella-row</placeName>

               <p>JOHN KENNY. I am an officer. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him - I stopped her and she threw the thimble down; I found 2d., and four buttons in her hand - she denied having any thing more; by her manner of speaking I thought she had something in her mouth - I told her to open it, but she would not; I opened her mouth, and found this sovereign, shilling and sixpence in it.(Thimble and button produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met my prosecutor - we went to a wine-vaults; we walked on the Broadway, and he asked me to go on the water with him; I said I could not go as I was - he went home with me, and waited at the street door while I got a shawl; we then went on as far as Pimlico - he said was not that a very pretty garden, and asked me to go down a passage, and to go into a shed with him; I did so - he gave me all he had, and afterwards asked me for the sovereign back again; I said nothing was freer than a gift, and would not give it him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM EMMERSON. I did not go into any shed with her - my coat was unbuttoned all the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he had been out all night, and had not been to his wife since the Saturday.</p>
               <p>JOHN KENNY. His wife said he had not been home since the Saturday morning.</p>

On the 3d of October, I went out about half-past eight o'clock, leaving my wife at home, and the watch on the mantleshelf. The prisoner was often at my house. About half-past four o'clock, in consequence of what my wife said, I went home, and looked for the prisoner, but did not find him for ten days; then found him at Woolwich, and asked him what he had done with what he took away from my house - I did not mention what; he said he would tell me when I was alone. We went into another room, and he said voluntarily that he had pawned the watch for 10 s., in Ratcliff-highway, and sold the chain in Tooley-street, and one seal in Oxford-street, and another seal and a key at another place. I went to different shops with him, and found the watch and chain - the other things were sold.</p>

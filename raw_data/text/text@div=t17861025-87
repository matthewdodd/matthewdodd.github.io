               <p>On the 22d of October, at two in the morning; it was Sunday; I was coming up Wych-street; I was accosted by the prisoner to go and drink a glass of wine; I went home with her about ten minutes after two; when I went to her apartments, I gave her two shillings in silver, and went to bed; I then had two guineas and a half in gold, and four shillings in silver, in a green silk purse; I pulled out my purse in the room before I went to bed to give her the two shillings; the money was in the purse; we went to bed; I put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250170"></xptr> my brown cloth coat and waistcoat on the table; I then pulled off my shoes and buckles, and put the buckles and neckcloth on the table, and then went to bed; I had not been in bed long but I found every thing was not so agreeable as I could wish.</p>
               <p>Where did you put your breeches? - I laid in my breeches and stockings; a little time after I had been in bed, I did not like my companion; the consequence of which was, she said, she was not well, she must get up, and have something to drink; she got up in a quarter of an hour, and left the candle in the chimney piece; I saw her looking at my buckles and shoes; I asked her, what she was doing with them? she said, I never come nigh a man so curious as you are; says I, put them down; she put them down, and at the same time blowed out the candle; she went out immediately and locked the door; I was doubtful of the place I was in; and I remained there till Cox the prisoner came; I missed my purse after she went, and before Cox came in, which was about half after five; I lost the purse about three; how Cox came in I do not know; he said, you bloody b - g - r, what do you do here? I asked him, what that was to him; I had paid for being there, and would stay till I saw the woman that brought me there; he said he had no woman at all belonging to him, and that I should get up immediately; I told him, I would not; in consequence of which he said, I shall return very shortly, and if you are not gone before that time, I will do for you; he did return in a very in a very short time, and says again, what you bloody b - g - r, you are not gone; he then says, get up; says I, do not go to treat me ill; I am a better man than yourself; upon which he took off the bed clothes, and then with a knife he cut me twice. (Shews his hands to the Jury.) One a deep cut; in consequence of which, I jumped up immediately, and said repeatedly to him, do not use me ill, I am a better man than yourself; then I missed a blue cloth coat, which I had on, and my neckcloth, and my pocket handkerchief; when he came the second time it was day light.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the value of this coat? - It cost me three guineas.</p>
               <p>What do you think it is worth? - I do not know; it has been worn by me only three weeks; I leave the value entirely out of the case.</p>
               <p>Do you think it is worth forty shillings? - I should be very happy to get such a coat for forty shillings; I then quitted the apartment, and stood on the landing place, and said, I am now out of your apartment, but I will not quit the place till such time I have my property; I value my cambrick handkerchief at one shilling, and my pocket handkerchief at one shilling; and he flung my head against the door, and the door flew open, and there lay two as notorious villains as himself; they cried out immediately, ham him, and murder him; upon which he came to lay hold of me to throw me over the bannisters of the stairs; I avoided that; I came to go down stairs, and he and the other two came and smashed me down stairs; I fell stupid; they then kicked me, trod upon me, and threw me out of the door; I went into a public house; the man's name is

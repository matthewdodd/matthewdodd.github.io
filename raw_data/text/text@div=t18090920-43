In consequence of suspicion, on Saturday night, the 9th of September, I went to the Marquis of Granby in the Minories, I found in a closet there a quantity of sponge, whetstones, glass shades to reflect light, a piece of gingham, some painting brushes, and some pieces of silk, I knew them to be mine, they are articles in which I dealt, and the prisoner had access to the place where I deposited them, the prisoner was apprehended and brought in, he denied knowing any thing of the closet where these things were found, he was searched in my presence, a key was found on him which opened the lock of that cupboard.</p>

            . I am a constable, I searched the prisoner at the Marquis of Granby, I asked him for the key of the closet, he seemed to make some hesitation, I told him it was of no use, I must have it, he put his hand in his pocket and gave me the key, I then put the key into the lock of one of the closets of the Marquis of Granby, the landlord pointed it out to be the prisoner's locker, I had broke open the door before, I found that key fitted the lock, I found in that cupboard all the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. When the property was produced to the prisoner what did he say - A. He said he knew nothing about it, he had no closet there at all.</p>

               <p>Q. By what means did the prisoner obtain the closet of you - A. By using the house and having his meals there, he had the key of it, it was intirely under his controul, nobody but himself had access to it. I had no opportunity of knowing what he brought there, I saw the constable break open the cupboard, and examine the contents of it, he took out sponge and several articles.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner every day at your house - A. Yes, at his meals.</p>
               <p>MR. GLAND. You are the gentleman that we saw last night, how many closets have you in this house - A. Two that they had by themselves, the key belonged to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you taken up for this - A. I was taken before the Lord Mayor, I was in custody for it.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am intirely ignorant and innocent of it.</p>

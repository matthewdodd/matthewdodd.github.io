I pursued directly - I heard he had got on the top of one of the Maidstone coaches, which puts up at the Spur inn, in the Borough; I came there, and the book-keeper gave me information; I then went to a place in Clerkenwell, where I thought it likely he would go, because there are two clock factories there, of which he had been speaking to me, and said the persons there had collected some money for him. Mr. Moore, at one of those factories, wished me to go to a house of call, which I did - the prisoner came there, not knowing I was there; I asked him how he came to treat me in that manner; he denied it, and said he had not wronged me in any respect; I sent for a police officer, but before he arrived the prisoner threw the goods on the table before me. These are the articles - I can swear to the watch, and some other articles - the whole of them were thrown on the table, except this old silver one, which had been sold in the Borough; he said they were his own property, but when he came to me he pleaded distress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How did I get this watch - was I not going to church, and a man met me on the way and shewed me a silver watch that was out of repair, and he wanted to exchange it for another, and did not you go up stairs and fetch this watch and give it to me? A. Yes, but that was not this watch; he knew I wanted 50s. for this; I had asked that for it in his presence; he told me he knew of a customer for it, and I said "All that you can get above two guineas shall be yours:" he took it and came back, and said the man had not got the money - he had got tipsy, and had broken the glass and hands, and it was put on the board in my shop. I had paid him on the Sa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220043"></xptr>turday evening all the wages we had agreed for - I paid him in money - I never gave him a watch, or any goods whatever, instead of money.</p>

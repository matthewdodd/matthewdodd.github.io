I accused the girl with taking it, she deny'd it: I told her I would put her in the cage, if she would not tell what she had done with it; she told me, she had put it down the vault; and mentioned four pieces of gold that she had taken in the morning.

The woman said, What a sad thing you have brought me to? And the girl said, Mother White, what have you brought me to? Upon their examination, the girl confessed the same. The woman always declared her innocence. I know no ill of the woman, but that she is apt to tipple a little.</p>

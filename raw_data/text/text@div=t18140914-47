I missed the articles in the indictment; on Thursday I found them. I did not miss them until I found them. I was present when these articles were found at the prisoner's lodgings; he lived with me between four and five months. I sent for a constable, and had him taken into custody in my house. The constable and I went to his lodgings at the Queen's Head, Water-lane; in a bed room up stairs I found six cravats, a pocket handkerchief, and a pair of shoes; my name is inside of the shoes; they had been worn very little. He lodged out of my house; he lodged at this public-house when first he came to me. I also found two shirts and two cravats at his washerwoman's; the two shirts are worth forty shillings. The washerwoman's name is Sims. My two waistcoats I found in the hay-loft, hid under the hay. He acknowledged taking the waistcoats, and said where he had put them. One of the waistcoats has my name on it in full length.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MARLOW. I am a constable. By the direction of Mr. Humphreys, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, the Queen's Head, Water-lane, and to Mrs. Sims, the washerwoman; the husband is here. I brought two shirts from the washerwoman's. Mr. Humphreys found the two waistcoats, and gave them to me. I produce them and the two shirts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. James M'Kean, who keeps the Belgrave Head, in Spur-street. On the evening of the 4th of Aug. I was standing at the bar, and saw the prisoner come down stairs from the ale-room—he went quickly out at the street door with a bundle in a table-cloth under his arm—I had never seen him before—I went up to the second floor front room, and missed the property stated—(the ale-room is on the first floor)—I found all the linen turned out of the washing basket, and lying about—the velvet scarf had been lying on the bed five minutes before, and that was gone—it was Clara Harriet Brown's, my master's niece—the table-cloth was Mrs. Mary Ann M'Gagan's, the shirts James Duell's, and the petticoat was mine—it was all in the house of Mr. James M'Kean—the whole of it was worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had been in the room ten minutes before, and it was all perfectly safe—I afterwards went to Vine-street station, and saw the prisoner—I swear positively to him, though I never saw him before, as we have the gas in our passage, which gives such a light.</p>

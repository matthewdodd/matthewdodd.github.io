               <p>Court. Were they snatched out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any body else near you? - The two witnesses that are here were close behind me; the man then ran across the road, and I cried out, I have lost my buckles.</p>
               <p>Was the person pursued? - No, not then, I was so frightened I knew not what I did; I went home first, I live just by there, and one of the witnesses lives just by me; I described the person and clothes of the prisoner, and I went with my husband and the constable in pursuit of him, but he was not taken till Sunday the 16th, between three and four; I went with the constable to the watch-house, to see if I should know him, and I went with the witness to the watch-house to see the person; and I believe he was laid down, and they made him get up; and I think, to the best of my knowledge, that he certainly is the lad that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear to him? - I cannot say I saw his face, but by his statue<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230179"></xptr> and all appearances he certainly is the person.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was he before he was out of your sight? - It is a very broad crossing where he crossed, and he did not run very fast; I did not see his face; my property was not found.</p>

               <p>Did you know Mrs. Hatton before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How could you see this? - There were two link-boys standing on each side of the basket, and there was the light of a candle that was about a yard off in the passage, I saw the prisoner pat her on the shoulder, and force them out of her hand; I followed the boy immediately, he walked across the way when he snatched them out of her hand, there was another boy on the other side of the way; he was not taken till Sunday, between three and four; he got away, he said he would break her arm if she did not loose him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the boy dressed whom she had by the arm. - He had a blue jacket, and a round hat.</p>
               <p>Was it Smith that tapped her on the shoulder, and took the bundle? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the other boy dressed? - I did not see the other boy, he was the farther side of the road; I could not tell what clothes he had on.</p>

               <p>Did you see Smith's face at the time he tapped this woman on the shoulder? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now did you see Smith's face at the time that Mrs. Hatton laid hold of him? - Yes, it was the same night.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hatton followed him immediately? - She went to her husband first, and came back again.</p>
               <p>How long after was it that you saw Mrs. Hatton in St. Giles's? - About half an hour, she took hold of him as he came out of the door where the two thieves went into.</p>
               <p>In what street was this door? - It is a new street just as you get into St. Giles's; she said, I want my buckles.</p>
               <p>That person that you saw her have hold of his arm, coming out of the door, was that Smith the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have seen his face now and you saw it then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As you followed the prisoner Smith, you can tell us into which street he took? - I cannot tell the name of the street, it is about a hundred yards to the passage.</p>

               <p>Then you never saw the boy till Sunday? - No.</p>
               <p>What do you say to this part of the case, that this boy says, that you saw him at a door, and took hold of him by the arm? - I went in pursuit of him with my husband, I went down into a street by the Flying-Horse, and the boy laid hold of my arm as I held it across the door, and he swore he would break it.</p>
               <p>How was that boy dressed? - I absolutely cannot tell, for there was a very little light in the passage, it was between the passage and the door.</p>
               <p>Now you told me just now that that was not the prisoner at the bar? - I said, I cannot swear that that was the prisoner, that said, he would break my arm, because it was not very light.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell us upon your first examination that you never saw any thing of the boy till Sunday? - I did not know it was material, or else I would have mentioned it before.</p>
               <p>That boy that you saw in this street, do do you believe it was the same boy? - I cannot tell, for there was hardly any light, it was between the dark passage and the door.</p>

               <p>Did you ever entertain a notion, that it was the same boy? - I rather imagined that it was, because I heard a paper rattle in the passage, which I imagined had the buckles in it.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. It was dark in this passage? - One of the link boys came along with the woman, and she said she would give him three halfpence if he would shew her a light, and he shewed her a light.</p>
               <p>The link boy did not come, till after they had made the escape? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the link boy with her? - Yes, Sir, he followed her away from where the sprats were, the boy went down the passage, and she took the link out of his hand, and held it at the door; I went into this street with Mrs. Hatton and the link boy, and Jones was there, the link was always alight, and he kept poking it to make it give a good light, she run up to the door with the link in her hand, and stood across it, and there were two boys hid up the stairs, I saw them by the light of the stairs, and they said, let us go down, and see what is the matter, for I will not stay here; and they came down, and Mrs. Hatton held her arm across the door, and she said they should not come out, and she insisted on their stopping there, and they said if she did not let them pass they would break her arm.</p>
               <p>Did either of them lay hold of her arm? - They took hold of her arm in this manner, and pushed it.</p>
               <p>Which was that? - The one in the blue jacket.</p>
               <p>Was Smith either of these boys? - I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Had they both blue jackets? - No, one had a light coloured coat, and one of them run up against me, as I stood right opposite the door, and pushed me down, one walked away, and the other run, and then they both walked together, till they both got out of sight.</p>

               <p>I only went with Mrs. Hatton to shew her the prisoner, when she saw the boy, she said I am not quite sure, whether that is the boy, says I, stand up and let the woman see you, says she, I am almost sure it is the boy.</p>

On the 12th of January, a little after twelve o'clock at night, I was in the Strand with a friend, and met the prisoner and another woman - we went up a court, and in about five minutes she left me very abruptly, which made me suspect her. I felt, and missed my watch. We detained the other girl, and took her to the watch-house. I described the prisoner to the watchman, and in about half an hour she was brought in with the watch. My shirt-pin was also taken.</p>

               <p>ROBERT GREAVES. I was with Mr. Fletcher. The prisoner and another girl accosted the prosecutor - she walked up Round-court with him - I stood in the Strand with the other girl. In about five minutes I went up the court, and met him coming down - he said he missed his watch. The prisoner was taken in about half an hour.</p>

When I got to the New-cut I was tripped up, and my watch taken from my fob, against ray will—as soon as I found that, I tried to collar a person who took it from me—it was only one person—he ran away—I called the policeman, told him I was robbed, and called, "Stop thief"—I saw my watch and the prisoner at the station within a short time.</p>

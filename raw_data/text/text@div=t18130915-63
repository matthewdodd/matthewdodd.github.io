On Saturday the 7th of August the prisoner came into our shop and asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs. Bradley attended to him; he shewed him a bundle. Bradley, after he had shewed them the prisoner, brought to me to count them; he said he missed a piece. I counted them; there were nine pieces. Bradley said he counted them before he shewed them the prisoner; there were then ten pieces. Bradley left that bundle with me. He went to get another parcel to shew the prisoner, and after some time he missed a piece from that parcel; he then told me that the prisoner had got another piece from that parcel. There was no other customer at the counter where the prisoner was. The prisoner hesitated a long time, and said there was none to suit him. I then went up to the prisoner, and said, as you do not want to buy, I must take from you what you have stolen. I lifted up his waistcoat, and saw ten black silk handkerchiefs under one arm. I took them from him, and four coloured silk handkerchiefs dropped from under his other arm. They cost me more than fifty-four shillings.</p>

            . I shewed the prisoner the black silk handkerchiefs; first I counted them; there were ten pieces in that bundle; he did not choose any of them. I perceived they were one piece short; I took them to Mr. Hayward to count; he made nine; there should have been ten. I shewed him some coloured ones. I laid six pieces before him; they contained different quantities; he said they were too dear. I missed one piece from them. I saw Mr. Hayward take one parcel from the prisoner, and I saw the other parcel drop from him. The prisoner bought nothing; he spoke English very well then.</p>

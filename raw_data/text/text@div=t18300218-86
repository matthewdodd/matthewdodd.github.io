               <p>JOHN TILLEY. I am a Police-officer. I was on duty, and saw the prisoner walking very fast; I followed him; he ran, and I ran after him - I took him with the cloak - he was about fifty yards from the prosecutor's when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Holborn, and just as I passed the George and Blue Boar a gentleman alighted with this cloak and a trunk - he asked me to carry the cloak for him: he turned down Turnstile, and said he would leave the trunk and follow me - I was going on, and the officer came and took me; when I was taken to the shop they were not certain whether they had lost one or not; it was eleven o'clock, and the shop was closed.</p>

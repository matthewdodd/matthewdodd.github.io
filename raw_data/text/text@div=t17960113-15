On Saturday, the 26th of December, I had some reason to suspect the prisoner, and kept a watchful eye upon him; in the afternoon I observed him in a particular part of the warehouse, where he had no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130031"></xptr>right to be. About five in the evening, I saw him go into a dark corner, and stay longer than he had a right to stay; he had not business there at all. About half after five or a quarter before six, as I was in the counting-house, I heard the door open, I thought the prisoner had gone out; I went out at a different door of the warehouse, and went round some houses, and up an alley that leads to that door, expecting to meet the prisoner with something, but I met with nobody. I came to the warehouse door, and saw a hole where some bricks were taken out. I then looked through the railings of some pallisadoes that goes into a church-yard, and saw a bag lying in the burying-ground close to the wall of our railing; I got over the railing, and felt the bag with my hand on the outside, and it convinced me there was sugar from the feel; it struck me who put it there; I went and looked in the hogshead I suspected it to come out of, and there was about one hundred weight gone, and the mark of a canvas bag in the sugar, which I never before observed in a hogshead, and the marks of a sist which had been put under the bag to take it up, the sugar was all dug out in one place; I had looked at the hogshead several times in the afternoon, and it appeared to be in the same state that it was the day before.</p>

            Before this time you had not observed any taken out? - A. No; not out of that hogshead; about seven o'clock I told Mr. Thwaits what had happened; and set a person to watch who came to take it away; about ten o'clock at night we paid the men their wages, and they went away, and the prisoner among them the rest; I went to a neighbour's house Mr. Hales's, at the bottom of the alley, and, in about twenty minutes, I heard a noise at the top of the alley; I ran out, and three or four of our men had the prisoner and the bag in custody; he had conveyed his knot, privately, out of the warehouse, to carry it away; I saw his knot in the warehouse at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. As you stood at Mr. Hales's house, could you see the knot in the church-yard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take such notice of the bag, when you saw it in the church-yard, as to know it to be the same bag when you saw it afterwards? - A. I saw it before, in the morning, in the warehouse, and I could swear to the bag; it was a new bag; it had never been used in our business; if it had been an old bag, I should not have observed it so much; a new bag had no business there; we sent for a watchman; he was asked, what was in the bag; he said sugar: I said, John, is there any thing else in the bag; he said, no; I asked him, where he was going to carry it; he said, he would not tell me; I took a piece of the sugar out in my hand, it was so like the sugar in the hogshead that, I believe, I could swear to it from circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the bag? - A. Yes; it was our bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was contained in the bag? - A. It was weighed, and there was three-quarters and twenty-three pounds; three pounds were taken off for the bag; and there was one hundred and four pounds of sugar; it is in the constable's possession.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You kept a watchfull eye over this man, but saw him do nothing? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a bag by a hogshead, and thought it a strange thing? - A. It had no business there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bag? - A. I took it up twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon it? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Having taken it up twice, and without knowing whether it has any mark, you swear to this bag which has a mark? - A. I could swear to the bag; I cannot swear to it in its present state, it has been so tumbled about; when it was produced, I knew it; it was a new bag; I could swear to it from the complexion of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the complexion of it the complexion of every new bag? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not such bags in common use? - A. I never saw such a bag out of our shop; I am told they are used to bring corn from abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to swear to this bag, than that it was a new bag, and the bag you saw by the hogshead was a new bag? -

               <p>Q. Is Tabernacle-alley the passage you mean? - A. I don't know the name of the passage.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Jackson.) Can you swear to the sugar? - A. It is impossible for a person to swear to it; I firmly believe it is Messrs. Newman and Thwaites; it is a particular sort of sugar.</p>

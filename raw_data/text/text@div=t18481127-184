                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Holt, who keeps the Colonel Wardell, in Tooley-street. On 8th Nov., about twelve o'clock, as we were clearing the house Conolly came and got change of a sovereign from me—about twenty minutes before that, I found a drunken sailor by my door quite insensible—two constables had him—I took him into my house and gave him such lodgings as I could—it turned out to be Little—a policeman searched him—I saw nothing found but a few papers and a piece of whipcord—he went asleep on the form—he went away in the morning before I was down—he was so drunk I could make nothing of him.</p>

On 8th Nov., between ten and eleven o'clock at night, a sailor was brought to my place by John and Daniel Collins—his head was down—I could not see his features—he appeared very drunk, and I refused to take him in—next day I went with Daniel Collins to buy a pair of shoes—he paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them, and bought a jacket for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 11th of November I was in Mr. Webb's service. I was sent by him to get some butter from Brewers' Quay, with a horse and cart—it was delivered to me—there were twelve casks in the body of the cart, and three on the copse, in quarter casks—in all fifteen firkins—as I was driving away, a man came running up to me at Billings<lb></lb>pte, and said something, in consequence of which I returned to Brewers' Quay—when I came back, I found the horse, cart, and butter gone—the person who spoke to me had on a pair of corduroy trowsers and a fustian jacket, very much torn—he was a very dirty-looking man, and was pitted with the small-pox—I had seen him at work on Brewers' Quay, which made me think it was right—the horse and cart were afterwards found at Day's livery-stables, in King David-lane, Shadwell.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 11th of November I was living with Mr. Stebbings, at No. 65, Cable-street. On the afternoon of that day the prisoner Collins came there along with a man, who is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi>—he said, "I understand you have got a horse and cart to let?"—Stebbings said, "The cart is out; my partner has got it out"—Collins said, "Do you know where I can get one?"—Stebbings said, "You can got one at Hall's, the green-shop, three doors down"—Collins and <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi> then went away—they returned in two or three minutes, and said they could not set one these, it was out—Stebbings</p>

               <p>said. "My partner's van is in the stable, if that will do, I will lead it to you," and he went out with them—in about a quarter of an hour Stebbings returned alone—that was about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon I went to the door when Collins and <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi> went away, and saw the prisoner Bowles and another young man, whose clothes were all torn off him, his elbows were all out, and he was freckled with the small-pox, he had a fustian jacket and corduroy trowsers, and was very dirty, he had a low-crowned white hat with a broad brim, and was bigger them either of the prisoners—they went the same way as Stebbings, Collins, and <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi>—I saw them walk close up to one another, but did not see them speak—I saw them join directly after Stebbings, Collins, and <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> went away—Stebbings walked on first, and the other four were all together—they were in company—I went to the door, and saw them turn round Shorter-street, which leads into Well-close-square, which is when Stebbings's partner kept his van—I saw the four men together for about five minutes—they were all four together in a line—about half an hour after, as near as I can guess, when Stebbings was at tea, and I was in the shop I saw Potter's van and Stebbings's horse—Potter is Stebbings's partner—the van was full of tubs—<hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi> was by the horse, and Collins was by the cart—I did not see any one else—I was going out at the time, and saw the van go up Rosemary-lane, and stop at Coxson's—I saw <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi> take one cask out first, and take it into Coxson's—Collins at that time was standing by the horse's head—I then saw <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> come out and take another cask out, and take it in—I then went on to where I was going—<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> said to Coxson, in Collins's hearing, "Are not you going to have the other two?"—Coxson said, "No, I will not have them, as you have brought the van up to the door, I will not have more than two, or else I would have had the four"—Collins was about a yard from Coxson at the time the conversation took place, and must have heard what was said—about two hours or more after I was at Stebbings's house, and Bowles and the ragged man came to the door—Bowles said, "Mistress, is the van come back yet?"—I did not make any answer then, as I was serving-they went and stood a little distance from the door—Bowles came again, and said, "Mistress, is the van come back?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I am not going to be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> out of it in no such a way," and the ragged ran said, "I am not going to be done out of it"—they stood quarrelling with each other—the ragged one said, "I am not going to be done out of it after driving it away," and Bowles answered, he was not going to be dm out of his regulars—when I said the van was not come back, Bowles said, "I want the young man who borrowed the van, <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi>."</p>

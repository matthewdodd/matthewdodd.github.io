We had been in the country, and came home by Red Lion-street; Stapleton got over the iron rails, lifted up the sash, went in, and handed to me a basket of gauze and lace, and came over the rails again. Then David Price went over, and Stapleton followed him: they both went in at the window, and looked about a great while. They found a clock, and Stapleton handed it out to me over the rails. I took and carried it home: they all came with me. Then I gave Stapleton a halfpenny to buy a candle: we then went up stairs and looked at the clock. We sent Stapleton for Dailey; this was in a lodging in Dailey's house; Caton and Stapleton rent the room: Dailey came up and looked at it a great while: he said he had a clock of his own, and he did not chuse to buy it; but he would think of it by the morning. I told him it would not do to keep it in our lodging, for the chimes would strike, and we should be found out; he told me I might take it to his dwelling-house. I took it under my coat, and carried it to his house, which was but the next door; I carried it up stairs, and left it in a fore-room. We were taken up that night, about twelve o'clock, as disorderly persons: I and Stapleton got clear of that, and about twelve the next day, Dailey went and discovered the clock to the gentleman, as he found Caton could not get off. (The clock produced in Court, and deposed to by the servant maids, as their master's property.) I was taken up again between twelve and one, at the Running-horse, at the corner of Bambury-street, St. Giles's.</p>

               <p>Caton's Defence.</p>
               <p>I got up one morning to go to see my father. I called at an ale-house, the Running-horse, and had a pint of beer. I had drank more beer than ordinary. I got into that house to lie, and they came and took me. I am as innocent of the charge as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Stapleton's Defence.</p>
               <p>I lodged at the Running-horse, and used to play at shuffle board. M'Mahon said, As I had no money, if I would go with him, he would shew me where to get some. I went with him to this house that night.</p>
               <p>Court. You are not called upon to accuse yourself.</p>
               <p>Stapleton. I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>Price's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was standing at the corner of Red Lion passage, and this M'Mahon and two others came by: he had a clock under his arm. He asked me to go along with them. We went to the Running-horse, and drank a pot of beer till it was twelve o'clock. I was afraid my father would lock me out, so M'Mahon took me to a house where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Dailey's Defence.</p>
               <p>M'Mahon never lay in my house, he called me up, and asked me whether I would buy a bargain. I said, No; I'll have nothing at all to do with it. I went down stairs, then up into my own room, and went to bed; he followed me up and left the clock in my kitchen. I know no more of its being there than the child unborn, till I got up: then I went to the constable, and told him there was such a thing left in my house. I have got a very good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Clay. What time did you first see the clock?</p>
               <p>Mr. Clay. It was not brought till about twelve o'clock. Galaway Dailey came and told me of it between eleven and twelve. The boys were taken up long before.</p>

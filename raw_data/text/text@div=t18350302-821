                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in St. Martin's-lane. I concealed myself in my shop on the 2nd of March—the prisoner was in my shop—I heard him ask for a yard of ribbon—my youth, Richard Thomas, took out the drawer—he decided on one yard of black and white galloon—the youth then went to the top of the shop—he returned, and called me—I went from behind the door, and stopped the prisoner with this roll of ribbon—he said, "I bought it of the youth for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said, "That is the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the counter"—the youth said, "No, he gave that for the galloon."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When I was in the shop, I took the ribbon out, and gave it you. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Yes, you did, and you had laid the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the counter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was sent to the office, and was discharged—I then went for the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that the officer took from me—he gave me that, and took me again. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He was discharged on the Tuesday, and we went be<lb></lb>fore the Grand Jury on the Wednesday—I had seen him at my shop before.</p>

               <p>—he said, "Yes"—I put the drawer before him, and served him with a yard of it—I went to the top of the shop for my scissors, and when I came back, I missed this piece of ribbon out of the drawer, which was on the counter—he was to have paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the galloon—he put down a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and went out pretty quickly—he did not take his change—my master called him—he turned back and said, "I gave the boy 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the roll of ribbon"—he pulled it out of his pocket when my master said he had stolen it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I said, "There is the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—you was looking at the ribbons, and would not look at me at all—I was going to work the same night, at Mr. Jameson's, a hair-dresser, to carry a board out.</p>

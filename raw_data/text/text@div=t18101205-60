On the 4th of November, about a quarter before five in the afternoon, I went out of my house, I fastened my window by a gimblet and double locked my door, there was a pane of glass broken in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a pane of glass broken, do you think a person putting their hand in might pull out that gimblet - A. Yes, I think I could have done it very well myself. As I was going out of the house I saw Mr. Green, a neighbour, he was talking to the prisoner, Cranston; I smiled and told Mr. Green I was going to take a pleasant walk, the afternoon being fine, meaning the contrary; I told him I was going to Bayswater, he said not back to night, I said yes, I had done it frequently after this time, I then walked on to Bayswater, I met my husband there about half past six o'clock, we both returned home about a quarter before ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your husband - A. A shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know Cranston before, did you - A. Yes, he lives very near to us. When we came to the top of the Green there is the City Arms where we have our beer, I gave my husband the key, he went home and I followed with my son and the pot of porter in my hand; when I came to my own door my husband met me and said, we are robbed; I went in and found the kitchen window open, that window I had fastened with the gimblet; I missed three candlesticks off the mantle-shelf, a shirt from the chair back; we then went up stairs I missed a bolster, two pillows with their cases, a pair of sheets, a gown, a one pound Bank note, fifteen shillings in silver, and two table-cloths.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these things again - A. I have seen some of the things again but I cannot say whether they are my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me caution you, you must speak the truth - A. On the second week there were some things brought up to the office.</p>

About six weeks ago I saw a person look over my pales in my yard at one o'clock in the morning, I really believe it was Cranston, I spoke to him, I said, what are you looking after here, my friend? he said, he was taking a view of the rooms to see whether they were bigger than the rooms in his house; I asked him who he was, he said, a neighbour over the way, the hair-dresser. Cranston used to shave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now after this conversation with him, that he was your neighbour, the hair-dresser, had you any doubt about his being your neighbour - A. No, not the least doubt in the world.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended Cranston on the 5th of November, the sister of Cranston applied to Mrs. Dadd, the sister and Mrs. Dadd came to my house together and offered five pound, a gentleman of the name of Holder offered ten pound to Mrs. Dadd, they asked me what I could do in it, I told them I could not do any thing untill I apprehended the other prisoners. There is another besides these, I apprehended Clare on the 21st of November, it was through a letter being sent to our magistrate; I went on board the Dorset East Indiaman laying off Gravesend; before I apprehended Clare Cranson offered to me if I would admit him to be an evidence he would tell where the property was.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you this conversation with Cranston - A. On the 29th he told me proviso I would admit him to be an evidence he would tell me where the things were; he had pledged the things on the 5th at Mr. Crouch's, Paul-street, Finsbury-square, they were all pledged in his own name and they had burned the duplicates; I went to the pawnbrokers and found it to be true. Clare said to me, coming up from Gravesend, he wished he had never seen the family, it was well known Cranston was a thief and had been sent away before for stealing spoons; he was innocent of the charge. Cranston told me he was the first person that entered the house, Clare followed him, and Clare's brother, a butcher, stood outside; he has been out of the way ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN. I was standing near to Mrs. Dadd's door, Mrs. Dadd came out and told me that she was going to Bayswater; Cranston was standing near me, he asked me how far it was to Bayswater, I said about five or six miles, he said it must be late before they get home I said it must be nine or ten o'clock before they came home if they made haste.</p>

            . On the 4th of November, about half past seven, or between that and eight, I went out to see if the beer was coming. As I went up to Elbow Place near the prosecutor's house, it joins Howard's Green, I saw a man stand in Elbow Place in a blue jacket. I turned my head to look at him in the face; he then turned his head round to hide his face. As I was returning on Howard's Green, I saw the prisoner Cranston coming along with a large bag. I have been to his shop to be shaved, they make bags. I am confident it was the prisoner Cranston, and the man that I saw in Elbow Place was not Clare, it was a stouter man.</p>

Magnay, and on the 18th of April I saw one of their wagons at their warehouse about two o'clock—it remained there about half an hour before it left—I then saw it drive off—Corduroy accompanied it as wagoner—I saw him driving it, he was by the side of the horses—I did not see Ell at the warehouse—I followed the wagon to the Stationery-office in James-street, Buckingham-gate—I did not see anything delivered, as the wagon went up a gateway—I saw it return, and it was driven to the Coach and Horses public-house in York-street—Corduroy went in there—whilst he was in there£Ell drove up in a cab—he got out and went into the public-house—I did not see him come out again, but I saw Corduroy come out in about a quarter of an hour—he then took the wagon to the Duke of Ormond's Head public-house in Princes-street—Corduroy went in there, and stopped about a quarter of an hour—he then came out in company with Ell—the wagon then went on towards Storey's-gate—Ell and Corduroy accompanied it, walking—when they got near to Storey's-gate, I saw the tilt of the wagon move, and Ell got in—it was an ordinary wagon-tilt—a person inside would not be perceived by persons outside while the tilt was over it—Ell's hat came off as he was getting in—Corduroy stopped the wagon, and Ell got his hat again—the wagon then went on to a beer-shop at Lambeth, and stopped at the door, and Ell got out—he and Corduroy went into the beer-shop—I saw them come out—the wagon then went on, and Ell and Corduroy accompanied it—it stopped at the corner of the Waterloo-road—I then saw Corduroy unfasten the tail-board of the wagon—(before he did that, he and Ell stood talking together for about two minutes)—he took out of it two bundles in brown paper wrappers, and placed them at the door of a shop which is a receiving-house for the London Parcels Delivery Company—Ell was by him to see what he did—Ell then carried the parcels into the shop, and Corduroy drove on with the wagon—Ell remained in the shop four or five minutes—he then left, but I cannot tell which way he went—I then went into the shop and saw the parcels which had been taken from the wagon—they have since been examined and found to contain each three reams of paper—they were addressed to "Mr. Dodge, No. 25, Ashley-terrace, City-road"—I cut off one of the directions—(this is it)—I made a communication to Messrs. Magnay on the subject—I then went with the inspector to the receiving-house—I made a com<lb></lb>munication to the persons there, and brought away the parcels—between eight and nine o'clock the same evening I went, by desire of my inspector, dressed as a porter, and took the two parcels to Dodge's house—I knocked at the door—Dodge came—I said I had two parcels for Mr. Dodge—he said "My name is Dodge; it is all right"—he then took the parcels off my shoulder and put them down in the passage—I asked him if he</p>

               <p>would have the kindness to give me a receipt for them—he said, "Did Ell tell you to ask for a receipt"—I had not at that time mentioned Ell's name—I said, "No, he did not, but I should be better pleased if you would give me one"—he then said, "Did Ell pay you?"—I said, "No, he has not, sir"—he said, "Then I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you can tell Ell that I have paid you, and that will be as good as an acknowledgment for the receipt of the paper"—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and offered me some gin—I then left, and joined Mr. Magnay and Mr. Todhunter, who were waiting some yards from the house—I returned with them, and took Dodge into custody—I told him I was an officer, and took the paper which I had already delivered—I afterwards took Ell in custody—I found a portion of a card in his pocket, which I produce, also another half of a card which I got from Gibbs at the receiving-house—when I was following the wagon I was in plain clothes—I had seen the wagon loaded at Messrs. Magnay's with the bulk of the paper—it was in open reams, that is, the sides of the paper were open—the paper that went to Dodge's was covered altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of Sir William Magnay, and am in partnership with him in the house in College-hill—we sup<lb></lb>ply her Majesty's Stationery-office with paper—we never permit any persons in our employ to have any perquisites, or to dispose of any outside paper, or outside covering, or wrappers—in consequence of what I ob<lb></lb>served relative to our stock, I employed the police to watdh our servants—on the 11th of April Haydon brought me this direction, which is Ell's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mr. Dodge, No. 25, Ashley-terraoe, City-road"—I was afterwards shown another address on another paper, which was in the same handwriting—there were two parcels of paper brought to our place by Haydon—this is one of them, and on the wrapper of it is u Mr. Dodge, No. 25, Ashley-terrace, City-road"—there were about six iearns of paper in the two parcels—they are worth about six guineas'—that is what we should sell them for if we sold them—it is called blue-wove double foolscap—to the best of my belief it has not been sold—it is paper we do not generally sell in the trade, it is made expressly for Government—in consequence of this paper being shown to me, I went with the officer to Dodge's house, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—the officer was dressed as a porter—he took the paper there—when I got there I found Dodge there, and the paper which had been delivered by the officer—on my going in I asked if Mr. Dodge was at home—he said, "What is your pleasure, Sir?"—I said, "Is your name Dodge?"—he said, "Yes, Sir"—I said, "I give you into custody for receiving stolen property; this paper is mine; where did you get it from?"—he said, "I bought it of John Ell"—I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ream"I said, "You know you must have been doing wrong in buying that paper for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "If I have done wrong I am a ruined man; what shall I do! I will confess all"—I said, "Whatever you say will go in evidence against you"—he said, "My wife advised me to have no transaction with Nicholson, for it would be the ruin of me if I did," or words to that effect—we then took the paper into his front room, and retired to his work-shop, which is the back room—he is a working book binder—it is a private house—I there examined his stock—we found on the counter three more reams of the same sort of paper, blue-wove double foolscap—I said, "Here is some more of my paper"—he said, "I received that from John Ell yesterday, and likewise five reams more that I have sent to Mr. Yarranton, the ruler"—I searched further and found several reams of yellow-wove double foolscap, ruled—I said, "This is also mine; how came you to have it ruled?"—it is not customary to rule printing paper in this way—on looking further I found a considerable quantity of books made from the same yellow-wove foolscap paper that was ruled, on the counter—it is not usual for printing paper to be ruled in that way for books, as it is a paper that has no size in it, and the ink sinks—it is expressly prepared for printing—I looked further and found a considerable quantity of wrappers, some under one counter and some under another, under other paper, and, on looking at</p>

               <p>the wrappers, I found the direction "Mr. Dodge, 25, Ashley-terrace, City-road, by the Parcels Delivery Company," in John Ell's handwriting—after I found these, Dodge's remark was, "What shall I do? I bought the paper of Ell"—when he said he had no idea he was doing wrong, I said, "You must know you were doing wrong; you could not have bought this paper, 26lbs., (which was the weight of it) for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is not 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound: it ought to have been from 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said, "I bought a ream of paper of Mr. Evans, in Budge-row, for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "What was the weight of that?"—he said, "14lbs."—I said, "Surely you cannot compare this with what you bought at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; you have been a long time in the trade, and ought to have known better; show me your invoices."—but on searching I cottld not find any, neither could he show me any—he said, "I have got none"—he then said, "I shall be ruined, I have respectable connexions who were going to put me into business; my sister promised me assistance as well as a friend; I have first-rate characters from the Bank of England; what shall I do? I will confess all"—I said, "Whatever you confess will go against you"—he said, "Shall I be locked up to-night"—I said, "Yes, you will be locked up, but I will speak to the officer to get you a comfortable cell"—he said, "Will you prosecute me?"—I said, "I will"—he was then taken to the station—he made use of these sort of expressions frequently—Ell was under-warehouseman in our establishment—he was acquainted with the regulations of our house as to the Stationery-office and the mode of supply for it, as to inspection-notes, and so on—an inspection-note and receipt-note are the same thing, except that one is kept and the other is returned to us—the receipt-note is the acknowledgment from the office that the quantity of paper purporting to have been delivered has been received—at the Stationery-office, on their receipt of the paper, they give the receipt-note back and retain the inspection-note, and give us an ac<lb></lb>cepted notice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it Ell's business or not to see the wagon loaded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The clerk gave Ell instruction to load the wagon with a certain quantity of paper—it was Ell's business, with the assistance of the porters and wagoner, to put that in the wagon, and nothing but what he was desired to put in, no more—it was within the scope of Ell's duty occasionally to go to the Stationery-office, either with or without the wagon—it would excite no suspicion for him to go to the Stationery-office, but I am not aware of any business that he had which would take him to a public-house in York-street, or elsewhere, and most decidedly not to the Parcels Delivery Company-Dodge was not a customer of ours—I did not know him at all—when I had given him in charge the officer addressed me as Mr. Magnay—up to that time I am not aware that Dodge knew who I was—the officer named me first.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not tell you he had purchased the paper of which those books were made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He only mentioned having bought some paper of John Ell—he directed my attention to some books—I was looking over his place, and I think I had seen the books before he mentioned them—I am not aware whether I had said anything about them before he mentioned them to me—I will not swear that I had.</p>

               <p>to the attorney, Mr. Hobler—that was the first time I told him of it—I have never been before the Magistrate—I have been a jobbing-porter for twelve months—I have been in regular employ, but not latterly—I was in the City police about four years ago—I was obliged to resign, because I got a drop too much—I have been in no regular employ since—this was on a Friday, and I think it was on the 18th of April—Messrs. Magnays have not been talking to me about the 18th—I will not swear that the officer or Mr. Ilobler did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you do when you got a drop too much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to sleep on a step up a court in the Old Jewry—that was the only offence forwhich I was dismissed—there was no other charge brought against me—I have not applied for any regular employ since—I have been employed as a porter, about Southwark-bridge—Mr. George Magnay was the person who first came to me about this matter—I heard that he was inquiring for me, and I went to him at his house, but I had seen him in Thames-street before I went to his house—I believe I spoke to him first—I knew it was him, because I had seen him before in the street, going in and out of his house at the corner of College-hill—I knew him as I know anybody else—I had been told it was Mr. Magnay a long time ago, and I went up to him in the street—I do not know whether I had any work that day—I did not get a drop of anything to drink at his expense—I did not get anything of Mr. Hobler—they gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the subpœna last Wednesday—I went to Mr. Hobler's office by order of Mr. Magnay—I was reading the newspaper on the Friday morning that I went with the note, and I saw the date on the top it, so I know k was the 18th—I go with a great many notes, and often read the newspaper—I do not know that I noticed that day in particular, but I know it was on a Friday, and the next morning I heard that some persons had been taken at Mr. Magnay's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that the note you took had any<lb></lb>thing to do with this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but when I heard that a robbery had been effected, the thought struck me directly, "This is the very man I have seen"—I did not know that the note I took had anything to do with the robbery till I had conversation with Mr. Magnay, and then I went to Mr. Hobler's by his desire—I heard Mr. Magnay had been inquiring after me two or three days.</p>

               <p>(Mr. De La Rue, a stationer and card-maker; Mr. Jones, a clerk in the Bank of England; Mr. Coe, of the stationery department in the Bank of England; and Mr. Freeman, of Somerset-street, Portman-square, gave Dodge a good character; John Ayres, a cow-keeper, at Hoxton; Francis Riches, a green-grocer, Whitmore-road, Hoxton; Henry Binfield, a draper, in Old Fish-street; and Edward Cohen, a tailor, in Great St. Thomas the Apostle, gave Ell a good character.)</p>

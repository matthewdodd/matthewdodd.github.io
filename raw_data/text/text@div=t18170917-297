               <p>JAMES CASHWAY. On the 16th of September, I and my wife were going home about ten o'clock at night, to Swan-street, Bethnall-green, we were at the corner of <placeName id="t18170917-297-crimeloc1520">Bacon-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18170917-297-crimeloc1520" type="placeName" value="Bacon-street"></interp>

I left him at the public-house while I went to the watch-house, and when I returned I found he had made his escape. I told Turner to look after him, and on the 20th he took him. I had seen the prisoner before the robbery, and knew his person; I am sure he is the man. I have not received my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I was quite sober. The prisoner was taken again four days after. I never prosecuted any person before.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE CASHWAY. I am the wife of the last witness; I was with him at the corner of Bacon-street, when the prisoner and two others rushed against us; two of them ran down Swan-street; my husband said he was robbed, crossed over after the prisoner, and took him; he resisted, and tried to get away. I held him tight, he tore my clothes to pieces, and said "let me go." We said we would not. We got him to the Half Moon public-house; a man came in, called him by a different name, and said"it was not George; I will be bail for him for 100l. or 150l." While my husband was at the watch-house two gentlemen came in, and said if I would give charge they would take him to the watch-house; on taking him out, the man, and some others, rushed against them, and rescued him. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I did not lose sight of him until he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was a light in the public-house window. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Some men came along and pushed me against him, when they took me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Nassau Clark. On the 20th of December the female prisoner came to my house to char—I had examined the plate on the 12th of December, and found eight spoons ail two ladles, and the rest of the plate all right—they were kept in a place<lb></lb>box (which was locked) under the bed up stairs—I had not examined it after the 12th—the prisoner went to that room on the 20th, when she came I did not miss these spoons and ladles till the officer brought them—there are them—whoever took them must have taken them from the box the lock was not broken, it was quite right—the key of it was in another her in my possession, and that was kept locked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of James Edwards, a coach proprietor, of Rochester, in Kent. He has stables in different parts of Kent—I have seen a bay mare in possession of a policeman at Kennnington, in the parish of Lambeth—it was Mr. Edwards's property, and worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen the same mare at Dartford last Saturday week, the 22nd of Ja<lb></lb>nuary, in my master's stables—it had been moved from Dartford to North-fleet.</p>

I vent to Mr. King's livery<lb></lb>stable, in Queen's-row, Kennington, on Thursday, the 27th of January—I saw the prisoner there with Mr. King, standing in a two-stall stable, by the side of this bay mare, which is the same Simpson claims as Mr. Edwards's property—I asked the prisoner if the mare belonged to him—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he brought her from—he said from Portsmouth, and that he had brought her that morning from Croydon—I told him I supposed it to be stolen, and I should take him into custody on my own responsibility—he said he would go any where with me—I said I supposed he would—we left the stable, and went about 200 yards—he then said, "Stop"—I said, "Mind, whatever you say must be given in evi<lb></lb>dence against you, if you say any thing—I don't want to hear any thing"—be said, "No, I will tell you the truth, I stole the mare from North<lb></lb>fleet;" that he got into the stable by a-back way, and laid down about two hours; that he then got up, felt about the different horses, and picked this one out—I asked if he was not afraid of getting kicked—he said, "No," and that he found a pickaxe, and broke open the door the horse usually go in at, and took the mare away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of a livery-stable in Queen's-row, Lam<lb></lb>beth. I saw the prisoner in my stable-yard on the 26th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, with the mare—he asked if I would purchase the mare—I asked what he wanted for her—she was brought out of one stable into another—he asked 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her—I said I should not buy her—I went away, leaving him there—I saw no more of him till twelve o'clock at night—I gave information to Clarke next morning.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 26th of January, I was at the stable at Northfleet—I found the stable-door broken into three pieces, and the mare gone, which I had locked up over night—the pickaxe was moved from over the corn-bin, where I had left it over night—there is a pig-pound adjoining the stable, and the outside boarding of that pound was pulled away—the mare was brought again to Northfleet on Saturday night—I know the prisoner—he was in Mr. Ed<lb></lb>wards's service, and when he left I succeeded to his situation.</p>

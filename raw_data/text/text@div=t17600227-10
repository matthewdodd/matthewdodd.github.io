            . I don't know the name of the place; the prisoner and I took fowls from two places, about four or five miles from London, but I do not know whose houses they were. I saw none but hens that we took, but I do not know how many; we took some from a house that stands by itself in a large field.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there half a dozen?</p>
               <p>Man. Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Singer. Does Mrs. Bigg's house stand so situated?</p>
               <p>Singer. It does, and so does the other where the fowls were lost.</p>

            . I was called from my work to go of a job, to earn a shilling; I went and there were the two soldiers, that is, the prisoner and the last evidence. They had got a wine hamper of about an hundred weight. They ordered me to carry it to Turnmill-Street; there was a shilling left at the bar for my trouble. I pitched at the Flying-Horse, in Tyburn-Road. I saw the wing of a fowl hang out, so I looked in and saw it was full of fowls. I asked the evidence how far they had brought that hamper, he said three or four miles: I asked him where he came from, he said such a place in Yorkshire. I said, what is become of the other soldier that had a game cock in his hand; he said he was gone to Carnaby Market, and would be there as soon as me. I went and carried the hamper to Turnmill-Street, to the house of one Crow, and left it there; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Singer. Did you charge the prisoner before the justice with taking these fowls?</p>
               <p>Singer. I did, upon Man's evidence, and the prisoner owned it, and said he took them out of the hen house.</p>

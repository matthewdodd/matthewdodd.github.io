He acknowledged before I brought him to town that he designed to take my money, being drove to necessity, and wanting subsistence. My hat, wig, weights and scales which I had on my head, together with his hat and wig, were found at the place where he knocked me down.</p>

I never offered to take any thing from him.</p>

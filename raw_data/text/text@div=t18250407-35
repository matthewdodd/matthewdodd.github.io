On Friday, the 11th of February, the prisoner applied to me for work, which I gave him - he slept in my house till the Monday night following, when he went to bed with the apprentice, about eight o'clock. I was called up by the watchman about four in the morning; I got up, and found everybody in bed but the prisoner, who was gone; I found the door open, and a box belonging to my daughter-in-law was open, and the things taken out, and missed a shirt from a closet below, and my soot-cloth from the barn, opposite to the door at the bottom of the garden. None of the things have been found.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN COOPER. I am the prosecutor's daughter-in-law. A box with my clothes was on the landing place opposite to the prisoner's room. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which I had seen safe at nine o'clock, after the prisoner was gone to bed; they are worth 3 l. 15 s.</p>

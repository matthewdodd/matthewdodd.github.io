                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a shoe-shop in Brook-street, Ratcliffe Highway. The prisoner was in my shop about four o'clock in the evening of the 31st of October, offering something for sale—while she was there, I turned to settle a little bill with Mr. Raymond—we could not agree about the price that I had offered her for the articles she brought to sell—immediately on her going out I missed a pair of shoes, which I had just tried on a lady—I sent a little girl after her—she refused to come back with her—she made a stop—I sent a boy, she refused—I then got my cloak and bonnet, locked the door and ran after her—when she saw me she came back, dropped these shoes from her gown—these are them.</p>

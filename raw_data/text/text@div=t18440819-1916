                  </hi>. I have been an officer fifty-one years—I was a cadet in June, 1790. On the 20th of June I lodged at No. 19, Bury-street, St. James's, my family being in Hampshire—I had been at Offley's, in Henrietta-street, and was returning home about half-past ten o'clock at night—I was passing down Hemming's-row, on the north side, and the prisoner came up to me—until then I had not seen him at all—I never had any communication with him either that evening or at any other period in my life—he was dressed in uniform—he endeavoured to whisper to me, and stooped—I rather drew back, and did not hear distinctly what he said—I think he uttered some words—he then asked me what hour it was—I replied I did not know exactly, but it was past ten o'clock—he two or three times attempted to whisper again, but I always drew back, and continued on my way home—I went through Green-street, Leicester-square, Panton-street, into Jermyn-street—I found he was following me and did not choose he should know where I lived—I turned round and said, "Which way are you going, for I am going in the opposite direction"—I turned back from going towards my lodgings, and came into the Haymarket, and began to inquire for a policeman—I turned into Piccadilly, and seeing a cigar shop, I went and asked where I could find a policeman—he was then looking in at the window—they told me where to find a policeman, and as I left the shop door a young man who I had never seen before took me by the arm, and said, "Sir, I will protect you"—I proceeded down the Haymarket towards my lodging—I observed to the young man, "This is the way to my lodg<lb></lb>ing; I don't wish the man to know where I live"—he turned round and said to the prisoner, "What do you mean by annoying this <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>?"—he said, "I know what I mean "—I returned to the Haymarket, and there were two or three empty <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> near the curb-stone—the young man said, "Get into one of the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and you will get away from him"—I said, "Not for a thousand pounds, if he had met with a young man he might frighten him, he will not frighten me, I will go through it and have him punished"—when we came to Regent-circus I saw a policeman, and said, "This young man has been annoying me"—the prisoner ran up and said, "I charge this person with making an indecent assault on my person"—he said that it was in Orange-street, at an accommodation place for making water—he used those words either in Regent-street or at the police office—I had not been in an accommodation place that evening with the prisoner or any person—he said, he was making water in one place and I in the other, that I bent round and put my hand on his private parts—so help me God there is not a syllable of truth in that—I was then taken into custody—Ioffered bail, and he was sent away with a letter to his commanding officer—I was brought next day before</p>

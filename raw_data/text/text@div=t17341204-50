            , Constable. Going by a suspected House, I listened at the Window, and over-heard this Boy, Will. Bear, tell his Mother that he had got a Shirt, and a Shift. I went in and apprehended him. He presently offer'd to discover his Accomplices. As I was going with him to Justice Lade, we came to a House where he said the Prisoner lived with a Woman that past for his Wife. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040022"></xptr> went in and found the Prisoner and the other Shirt, a Shift, and a Blue Apron; the Prisoner said he found those Goods.</p>
               <p>Will. Bear. On Monday Night I met the Prisoner in Paul's Church-yard, he asked me to go with him, and so we went to this House where we saw some Linnen hanging to dry. There was a half Hatch bolted with 2 Bolts. He unbolted them both, but he was forced to hoist himself up and lean over the Hatch to reach the lower Bolt. Then he went in and brought out 2 Shirts, a Shift, a Sheet, 3 Linnen Handkerchiefs, and a Blue Apron. Then we went over London-Bridge, and thro' Pepper-Alley, and came to a Bench by a great Brew-house, where he gave me one Shirt and one Handkerchief for my Share, and said he'd carry the Rest home to his Wife and have 'em dried - She sells Oysters in Dead-man's Place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at my Lodging at Mrs. Woodstocks the Bull in Kent-street, from 8 o' Clock that Night, till 8 the next Morning, and if she was here, she would say the same.</p>

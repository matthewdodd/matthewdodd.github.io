            . I took the prisoner, and found on her the duplicate of the furniture - she said she had left the spoon and a ring with the last witness; he gave up the spoon, but denied all knowledge of the ring - she said she had pawned the bed-furniture, but her mother gave it her, and she wished to be sent out of the country.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said my mother had lent me the bedfurniture to redeem the spoon. Witness. No, I deny that; she said on the Monday morning that her mother had a gown in pawn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I owed Baker a few shillings; I went and asked him for some gin - he said he did not dare to let me have any more; I went home, the spoon was in the cup - I took it and left it with him; I had been to him twice to know what I owed him - he said he could not tell without John was at home; I asked him then what it was, as I had been pawning the bed-furniture for 2s.; my father came in with the officer and said there was his prisoner; I had asked Baker if he would let me have the spoon, he said he would not till he got his money; I did not like to tell my father of the spoon as I thought it would get him into trouble - the gold ring is a keeper that John took in; I should have returned the spoon in the course of an hour.</p>

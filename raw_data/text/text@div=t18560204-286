On Saturday, 26th Jan., in consequence of information, I went to No. 20, Revell's-row, Southwark, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, in company with other officers; some were in uniform, and some in plain clothes—the door was fastened, the officer, Nevill, broke it open—there is only one room on the ground floor, and one up stairs—we went up stairs—the room door was fastened, Nevill forced it open—I entered the room with some other constables—I found John White sitting near a table, near a clear fire, Mary White, and Ellen Baker were likewise close to the fire—the other prisoners were sitting on a bed at the table, Halswell was sitting behind them—they all surrounded the table except Halswell, who sat at the back—at that time I saw the prisoners jump up, and John White had in his left hand a plaster of Paris mould, which he threw on the floor and stamped on it—Mary White took from the table a handful of half crowns and shillings, and threw them on the fire—there was a pipkin on the fire containing metal—Nevill seized John White, and a desperate struggle ensued; all the prisoners, except Halswell, attempting to destroy what was on the table—Thomas Evans seized Mary White, and</p>

            . I am a silk-manufacterer, and live at No. 10, Goldsmith-street. On the 12th of May I saw the prisoner and Mr. Morgan coming from Wood-street towards Gutter-lane; I saw the prisoner stop and turn himself towards the passage No. 13, and throw the handkerchief behind him - I ran, and called them back to show them where it was; he was secured - I laid hold hold of him, and a scuffle ensued.</p>

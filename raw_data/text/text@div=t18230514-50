On Saturday, the 15th of March, my watch and seals were hanging by the side of the fire-place. The prisoner is my nephew - I thought he was in Staffordshire, but about two o'clock on that afternoon he came to my house, and stopped about ten minutes - I was in the room all the time, and saw the watch lianging up while I was talking to him; he had not left a minute before I missed it. I went after him, but could not find him for half an hour. I found the watch on the floor, behind the door of a pawnbroker's passage - I had met him in the street, and he ran to this pawnbroker's door, and got behind - the watch laid just under his feet.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received him in charge at the watch-house. I asked what he had done with the property - he said he had shewn them to a boy; that he gave the seal to a costermonger, who was to give him 7 s. for it on the following morning. I went after the costermonger, and got back one of the seals.</p>

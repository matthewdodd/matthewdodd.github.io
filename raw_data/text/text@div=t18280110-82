            . I am a clerk at the West India Docks. On the morning of the 13th of December I was standing at my door, which is the next house to this, at a quarter to seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner come out with a copper - a woman was with him - I ran after him, and said, "Halloo, you thief!" he threw the copper at me, and ran off - I struck him with a boot which I had in my hand, and pursued - I overtook him, and knocked him down - the woman came up - he got up - I still pursued, and took him again: I saw the copper compared with the place - it fitted exactly.</p>

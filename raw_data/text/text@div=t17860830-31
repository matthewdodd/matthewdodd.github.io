               <p>Court. Open the enamels? - I have no knife. (Opens the enamels.) If you take my magnifier and take it at three inches: - here is a piece I have found in the prisoner's possession; I have another piece in my pocket that will match it; that will appear to any gentleman of judgement that that was one piece that flew from the other; this is the small piece which I have in my possession; when the enamel is poured upon a sheet of copper, and not properly cooled it will fly; I reckon myself a bit of a mechanic; and I know what can, or what cannot be done.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is the value of that enamel, of all that you found there? - I value them at ten pounds; some I sell for a guinea, some for ten shillings, some for seven shillings, and some for five shillings per ounce.</p>
               <p>How are these pieces used? - They are ground in an agate mortar, and then they melt it and put it on the gold; by twenty years practice I brought it to bear, to make ruby, and every colour; sometimes I have two guineas an ounce; here are a number of different colours; I dare say here are two hundred ounces in the parcel that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300069"></xptr> I found in his lodgings; I have a cabinet with fourscore drawers in it, and a bureau, and when I came to take his pocket book I found a drawing of this key. (The drawing produced by the officer.) And he took a copy of all my secrets or receipts which were kept in my cabinet, so that he must have been there for a long time, I am very happy to get it again, or else I should have been ruined.</p>
               <p>You was pretty careful of the key? - Yes, I never let my wife have it though she is a gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>(The drawing handed up.)</p>
               <p>Court. This is a drawing that any workman might make a key; have you a partner? - Yes, he is concerned in the enamel.</p>
               <p>Are these valuable, or might they be thrown away? - Some I do not put much value upon, that - that is of some value to be sure, which I sell at ten shillings an ounce; it gets red in the fire, like a ruby, and never loses its colour any more; now this is a remarkable thing, it appears to you to be blue, but when it is enamelled it is a fine purple red; it is made from gold, and struck into it in such a manner that when it comes to be put on gold it is a fine purple red; it is worth ten shillings an ounce; that I sell it for to workmen; the prisoner has numbered almost every paper here to correspond with the receipts in the book.</p>
               <p>How long has this man lived with you? - About half a year; he ground the materials, charged the furnace, and poured it out when I knew it to be ready.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Dovey do not be angry with me because I am only going to say one word to you, and that is, another time when you come into a Court of Justice, do not presume that every man in it means to insult you; I should be very sorry to insult a man of your ingenuity.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I leave it to my counsel.</p>

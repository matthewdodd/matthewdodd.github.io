            . On Friday evening, the 9th of July, about seven o'clock, I was coming from <placeName id="t18190707-155-crimeloc832">Great Russell-street into Tottenham Court-road</placeName>

I felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket - I turned round, and saw the prisoner throw it on the ground; I picked it up. They appeared not to know whether it was best to run or to fight. I seized the prisoner - the others seized him also. A scuffle ensued, and he fell down; they got him away. He ran down Bedford-street, and the other two ran towards Hampstead. I crossed over, and was going towards Clipstone-street, and when I got to the corner of John-street, I accidentally saw the prisoner, knew him again, and he knew me, for immediately he saw me he endeavoured to escape; I secured him. He partly confessed it, for he said I had no business to knock him down in the road, and that he had hurt his elbow. I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of a Custom-house agent, and live at 57, Queen's-row, Walworth. On Monday night, 1st April, about nine o'clock, or a little before, I was in the Albany-road—I had come from the Old Kent-road—I had occasion to turn down the first turning on the right for a necessary purpose, and while I was there the prisoner came up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185004080150"></xptr>
               <p>to me and asked what I was going to stand—I said I was not going to stand anything—she laid hold of my right arm—I told her to leave go—she then laid hold of me round the neck with both bands—I made an effort to get away from her, but was not able to do so—two men came up at the same time, and one of them said, "Halloo, old girl, you are drunk; why don't you leave the gentleman alone?"—I thought they were going to disengage her arms from my neck, but I felt one of the men put a handkerchief or cloth round my mouth—it had a very disagreeable smell of something, I could not say what—I then suspected their intention was to rob me, and I struggled and struck some one, but I do not know who it was—I had on an oil-skin cap, and the point of it covered my eyes over so that I could not see—it was pushed down at the time, by some one's hand I suppose—the handkerchief, or cloth, covered my mouth and nostrils—after I had struggled and struck somebody I received a blow at the lower part of my stomach, and after that I do not remember anything—I became insensible—I had three sovereigns and a half in my waistcoat pocket—when I recovered myself I was lying down on the right-hand path, and my money was gone—no one was near me then—no one could have taken my money before I met the prisoner—I am quite sure I had it safe when the prisoner came up to me—I noticed her dress—she bad on a dark dress, a dark shawl, and a black bonnet—I noticed her features and her voice too—I have heard her speak since she has been in custody, and I knew her voice again as well as the face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Can you take your oath that it was I that did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I mentioned before the Magistrate about receiving the blow in the stomach—a man was taken up, but I could not identify him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went down this turning, do you know what time it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not exactly, I think it was about ten minutes to nine—it was eight o'clock when I left my own house, and I walked from there to the Elephant, then down the Kent-road, and into the Albany-road; that would not take more than an hour, and I did not hear any clock strike—when I got home it was about half-past nine—it took me rather longer to get home than it would have done if I had been well—I usually walk that distance in a quarter of an hour, but it took me half an hour on this occasion.</p>

On the night of 1st April, I was on duty with Moss, in the Old Kent-road, about a quarter-past eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner there—I have known her by sight for several years—she was in the company of two men, going in the direction for the Albany-road—she was dressed in a black bonnet and a dark shawl—her drew I cannot speak positively to—I produce a black velvet bonnet which was given up by the person who removed her things from where she lodged—I showed it to the prisoner at the police-court, and she said, "That is my bonnet"—when the prosecutor came to the station to see her, she was placed with four other women, and he selected her out—he could not identify the man—I could not positively swear to the man, but I have an idea of who he is.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 330). I was with Quinnear, on the night of 1st April, about a quarter-past eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner and two men with her—they went along the Kent-road, towards the end of the Albany-road</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185004080151"></xptr>
               <p>—she had on a black bonnet—I took her into custody the next night—I told her that I took her for robbing a gentleman of three sovereigns and a half in the Albany-road, with two men, on the Monday night, between eight and nine o'clock—she said she was not near the place—I said "How can you say that, when I and serjeant Quinnear saw you go through the gate between tight and nine?"—(I have known her a long time as a common prostitute, I am sure it was her)—she said it was not her, she knew nothing at all about it, she went away along with a man to a public-house drinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You did not take me into custody. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Indeed I did—I can swear that you had this bonnet on on Monday night; and when I took you, you had a new one on, a straw one—you had on a black bonnet on Monday—I cannot swear it was this one—I found 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on you.</p>

I again went, with Mr. Sharp's assistant, to No. 19, Twister's-alley, and he saw Wilson, and identified her; he met her on the stairs, and said, "This is the person that pledged the watch and ring"—the said, "I know nothing about it; I pledged the ring at Brooks's, but I know nothing about the watch and ring"—I then took her into custody, and afterwards, in consequence of information, directed M'Kendrick to be taken that same day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 213). In consequence of information I received, I took the prisoner Penfound into custody on the night of 3rd Dec., in Commercial-road, Spitalfields, about half past 9 o'clock—he was in the street—I told him he was charged with being concerned with others in a burglary, at the house of Mr. Wood, in Holborn, a pawnbroker's shop—he said, "I know I am, I will tell you all about it"—I said, "You have no occasion to make any confession to me; if you do, I shall give it in evidence against you before a Magistrate"—he said, "I may as well tell you as any one else;" I said, "You must go to the station with me"—on the way to the station, he said, "On the night of the robbery, I was standing in Holborn about 4 o'clock in the evening; I saw three or four men standing about, close to the pawnbroker's shop there, and about that time there was a large fire broke out in the neighbourhood; one of the men came to me, and asked</p>

               <p>me what I was standing about there for; I told him I did not think proper to tell him, I did not see what business it was of his, and he said, 'You had better go away'—I said, 'I shall not go away;' I believe he said, "If you do not go away, we will make you go;'" and then he said, that about that time the fire broke out, and said, "I went away to where the fire was a short time, and then came back again, thinking that there was something going on wrong at this pawnbroker's shop; at the same time when I got back I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man standing about there, but he did not speak to me, he appeared to be in company with the others; one of them came to me again, and said, 'it is no use your standing about here, we do not want you, go away;' I refused to go away, and he said, 'Well, we are about to do a job here to night, keep all quiet for us outside, and we will make it all right with you after '—a few minutes after that, I saw one of them go into the side door of the pawnbroker's shop, and shortly afterwards saw the same person through the window of one of the upstairs rooms; I still remained by the outside of the house till after the shop was shut up; and after remaining some time after that, I saw the door open and one of the others was let in, and after waiting a long time they came out together, and gave me fourteen or fifteen gold rings, a gold watch, three silver watches, half a sovereign, and a pocket book; I went away, and made all the haste I could to Worship-street; I went to Mr. Saunders' beer shop, and saw Mr. Saunders, who at that time appeared to be drunk; I asked Mrs. Saunders if she would take care of some property that I had found on Newington-causeway, and that I wanted to sleep there that night if she could let me have a bed; she said, 'You can sleep here to-night, but I will have nothing to do with this property;' I afterwards saw Mr. Saunders again, and asked him to take it; I gave him the whole I had received, with the exception of the money, and he went into his bedroom with it; I saw no more of the property after that."</p>

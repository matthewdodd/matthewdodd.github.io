I got sitting down by the fire and saw the woman fumbling about his pocket, she pulled out a clasp knife and a halfpenny first, I see her do it, and she said, he had got nothing at all; and then she got fumbling again, I thought she had been fumbling in another manner at first; then she fumbled again and pulled out the purse out of the same pocket, as for the contents of the money I will not be answering for; it was a worsted purse; I awaked the man immediately and told him of it; I asked him if he had not lost a knife and a halfpenny? he said, yes, he had lost a knife and some halfpence, and thirteen shillings, then after that he wanted her to give him the money and make it up and let her go about her business, then she would not make it up, the woman would not deliver the money to him; so we told Mrs. Peacock of it at the one Tun; says I, this here woman has taken the money from this here man, and she denies it; she kept it for some considerable time; then she took it out of the purse and put it in her pocket, and then threw the purse down; then Mrs. Peacock begged and prayed of her to give the man the money, then she pulled out the half crown piece, and four shillings and some halfpence, and the knife; then mistress ordered me to fetch a constable; when the constable came to search her, he found three shillings in her hand more, then after he had got the three shillings, she wanted to go, the constable said she should not, because she did not make the remainder of the money up, the man said if she would make the remainder of the money up he would spend two shillings for the good of the company, she would not do that; so they took her away.</p>

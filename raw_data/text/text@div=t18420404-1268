On the 6th of March we moved from Baker-street, Stepney—I locked up the house carefully that night—it contained the articles stated—when I came next morning the door was broken open, and the things gone—on Tuesday, the 15th, I saw Helen Harper with my daughter's frock and handkerchief on, which I had missed from my box in that house—I got a policeman and gave her into custody—she said she had bought them in Petticoat-lane—at the station I observed that she had my daughter's petticoat on, and said so—she said it was not, that she had bought that in Petticoat-lane with the others—I afterwards went to No. 26, Albion-street, searched the house, and found this towel, the glass, and lace there.</p>

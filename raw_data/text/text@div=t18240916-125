               <p>ZACCHEUS COATES. I live in William-street, Manchester-square. On the 29th of July I was in <placeName id="t18240916-125-crimeloc677">Bentinck-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. The watch-house keeper said,</p>
               <p>"All stand round," and we did, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Can you say which it was, and you said you could not speak to his face; you said you did not wish to give charge of any person. - Witness. Yes, I did so, but I knew his jacket, and can swear to him by that.</p>

            . On the night of the 29th of July, I heard a cry, of stop thief! in Bentick-street, and saw the prisoner running on the opposite side, I tried to stop him, he rushed past me; I followed him, and at last overtook him in Fair-street. The prosecutor said he had lost his watch; I searched the prisoner, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>J - BROMLEY. I saw the prisoner running down Bentick-street; I was standing at the corner of Hind-street; he saw me, and ran down Fair-street. He was given into my hands at No. 18, Fair-street, by Edwards, close to the rails of the area.</p>

A gentleman told me to go back and look into the area; I went, and found a young man at the door with a light. I found the watch-case in one part of the area, and the inside in another.</p>

            . I had taken the prisoner before the others came up. I was passing Hind-street, and saw him running; he attempted to go down Mary-le-bone-lane; he then ran by me; I caught at him, but missed my aim: he went down Fair-street, put his hand over the rails, and then deliberately laid himself down, and put his hands through the rails. I followed to see what was done, and said to the watchman,</p>
               <p>"If you come with me I think we can find the watch." I went home with my wife, and then went to the watch-house, and it was too late; next morning: I went as soon as business would permit to the Magistrates, but it was too late.</p>

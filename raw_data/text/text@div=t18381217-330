                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, and live on Holborn-hill. On Sunday night, the 2nd of December, a little after nine o'clock, I was walking by the corner of Field-lane—I felt something at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner walking away with my handkerchief—he dropped it; and three girls who were standing there, directly passed it, one behind the other—the prisoner ran off down Field-lane—I pursued him, but was stopped by two thieves—I came back, went home, disguised myself, went out, and saw the prisoner drinking with some thieves—he then went and <hi rend="italic">sounded</hi> several persons' pockets—he then tried a gentle<lb></lb>man's pocket, and I laid hold of him—I am quite sure he is the boy—when I took him, he bit my hand—there was an attempt at rescue—I got two good knocks on the head, and I have been threatened since—I had seen the prisoner before.</p>

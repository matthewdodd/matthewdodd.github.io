I felt, and missed my handkerchief, knife, and comb, from my coat pockets - they were immediately produced, and I was certain of them all - they are not here. I examined them, and have no doubt of them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner and two others, and watched them some time - I saw the others hustling round Mr. Randall. I went up, and asked if he had been robbed; he said Yes - I did not see them take any thing from him - the prisoner was in their company - Cowley went up, and I apprehended all three. Cowley took the hat off the prisoner's head and found a handkerchief, which the prosecutor claimed. I took the prisoner to the Compter, and in his waistcoat pocket I found the knife and comb - he said nothing about the burn and darn in the handkerchief till after he had seen it.</p>

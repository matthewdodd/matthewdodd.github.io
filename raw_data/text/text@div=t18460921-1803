On the evening of the 11th of Sept., I saw the prisoner Davis in my house—I recollect him perfectly well—there were two more with him—I cannot recognise Barnett—I first saw them at the foot of the stairs—they were going up stairs—I went up two or three stairs to see if my bed-room door was shut—I considered it was, and did not go up further—they stood on the stairs and asked me for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin and cold water—I cannot say who spoke to me—they also ordered a glass of ale—I saw the man who is not in custody—I only recognised him by his dress, not by his features—in about a quarter of an hour after, in consequence of something my daughter said to me, I went up about three stairs, and saw a person in a light dress pass from my bed-room door—it was M'Lean, who has escaped—he went from my bed-room door into the front room in great haste—I came down stairs and made the gin-and-water—Davis was then standing at the kitchen door, down stairs, waiting for the gin-and-water, at the time I stepped up stairs—I thought I heard</p>

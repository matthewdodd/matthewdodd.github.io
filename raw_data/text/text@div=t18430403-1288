                  </hi>. I am a dentist, and live in High-street, St. Giles. On the 21st of Feb., about one o'clock, the prisoner and two companions came into the shop—one of his companions requested to have a tooth extracted—I examined his mouth, and found no tooth that wanted ex<lb></lb>tracting, but he fixed on one in the lower jaw—I saw it was quite sound, but he said he would have it out—I walked with him back into the surgery to take it out—the prisoner and the other man went with him into the surgery—I set the patient in a chair to perform the operation, and immediately opposite</p>

               <p>was another chair, on the back of which was my coat—the prisoner passed to the chair where the coat was, and as I was performing the operation my back was towards him—as I applied the instrument to the man's tooth he slipped out of the chair—I set him up, and attempted again, and he served me the same trick again—I set him up a third time, and the tooth came out—while this was doing, the prisoner stood by the chair where the coat was, and his companion who was tried last sessions took the coat away, but I know the prisoner must have taken the coat, and passed it to the other man—in a few minutes after the companion of the prisoner left, and then the poor man who had lost the tooth rinsed his mouth, and paid me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and left—I followed him to the door, and saw him cross—I then went back to the surgery and missed the coat—I had seen the coat when I showed the man into the surgery—I am sure the prisoner was one of the men.</p>

            . On the 23d of April the Prisoner came into my shop to buy two yards and an half of printed cotton; we did not agree, and I did not sell her any; there were several remnants upon the counter, which I had been shewing to a customer before. After she was gone out of the shop, Mr. Wiseham, a Linen Draper in the Poultry came and asked me if I had lost any thing out of the shop. I told him, I could not tell presently. He said, I believe you have had a shoplifter in your shop. After he was gone, I missed something. Mr. Wiseham came some time afterwards and brought me this remnant of printed cotton, which I had in the shop about a quarter of an hour before. I went directly to the Compter with Mr. Wiseham, and the Prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him how he knows he had it a quarter of an hour before?</p>

            . On Monday the 23d of April, about four or five in the afternoon, as I was standing at my door, a person came to me, and said, there's one of the most notorious Shop-lifters in the Counter as ever was. Said I, I have lost a piece of calico this day, perhaps I may know the person. I went and looked at her, and she did not appear to be the person who was in my shop that day; I went back to my shop, and the person who told me she was a shop-lifter, said, she is gone into the Wheat-sheaf in Cheapside. I said, if she is so good a hand, may be she may make something; I went to that shop, and as I got there, she came out; I went into the shop, and asked Mr. Wealy whether he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100026"></xptr> had lost any thing, for I was told, the woman was a notorious shop-lifter, and had lately returned from transportation. He said, he did not miss any thing; then I went to the Counter again afterwards, and the master of the Counter told me, if I would look into the cupboard, I might perhaps find my goods. The cupboard was opened, and I took this remnant of cotton out of the cupboard. I knew by the mark that it was Mr. Wealy's; so I went to him and asked him if he knew any thing of this, and he said, it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you the key of the cupboard?</p>

            . Did you lock the cupboard door presently?</p>
               <p>Horabin. I did not lock it immediately; it was open some time, and the servant had the key, to take the liquors out; I was out of the room several times - I keep the tap on the master side of the Counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not your servants come to that cupboard when they please?</p>
               <p>Horabin. Yes, my servant may. - I have but one servant.</p>

               <p>Wealy. There was another woman in the shop after the Prisoner, but she went the other way; the Prisoner went one way, and she went the other; and if the other woman had gone the same way, she was not gone long enough to get to the Counter when Mr Wiseham brought me the cotton.</p>
               <p>Q How came you not to look over the goods as soon as the Prisoner went out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Wealy. Because I had not time till the other woman was gone - She bought four yards of painted cotton. <rs id="t17440510-26-verdict138" type="verdictDescription">

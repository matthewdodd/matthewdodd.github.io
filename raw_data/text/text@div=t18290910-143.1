            . I was in Crown-street, about half-past eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another; I followed them - they separated, and joined company again; I then took the prisoner, and asked what he had got; he said what was that to me; I took this work-box from under his arm - he said he had it to take home for his sister; I took him to the watch-house; he then said he bought it of a young man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you tell him you would give him a lift for being saucy? A. No; he was rather bounceable; he said, I am a respectable man, and will let you know it;" I had seen him about four months ago.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A young man came up, and asked the way to the Seven-dials; the officer then came up, and asked what I had got - I said what was it to him; he said he was an officer - I said, "It is a workbox I bought of a young man for my sister;" he then took me: I was in London five month's ago, but have been in the country since.</p>

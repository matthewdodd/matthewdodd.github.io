            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 27th of January I apprehended the prisoner at a house in a court in Whitechapel; when I went up stairs she crept under the bedstead - I pulled her out, and told her the charge; she made no reply: I asked her where the property was - she said I should have no blood-money out of her; I found this handkerchief under the bed, and found a pair of shoes on her; Mrs. King claimed this gown and petticoat, which she had on at the office.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I bought these shoes myself out of a shop - I bought the things; I could have stripped them off at the first examination, but I wore them, as I had bought them - I kept away, because I had a few words with my brother; I went out, got intoxicated, and staid away - I was ashamed to take the shawl back; I got under the bed when they came for me, as my, as my brother was with them, and he is a very severe man.</p>

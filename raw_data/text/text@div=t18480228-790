                  </hi> I lived at Smith's-terrace, chelsea. On Saturday evening, about half-past eight o'clock, I was sent for from the Phœnix tavern, went into the garden, and saw the prisoner in Mr. Cole's parlour, next door, packing up clothes—I got on the wall and looked in, then went for a policeman, then got on the wall again, and saw the prisoner go down into the kitchen, and come up the area, and scale the walls—I followed him—the policeman caught me, but let me go, and I caught the prisoner in Markham-street—I did not lose sight of him—I and the policeman took him to the station, and found four silk handkerchief in his hat.</p>

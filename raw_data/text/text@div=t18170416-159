On the 6th of April, about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the Cock, public-house, in Dyot-street; it was on Sunday. I had been drinking, and was not very sober. I staid there till eight or nine o'clock-the prisoners, Taylor and Cosgrove persuaded me to go home with them. They took me to their lodging, at No. 2, <placeName id="t18170416-159-crimeloc836">New-street, St. Giles's</placeName>

I put my clothes on the bed, and put my watch in my stocking, which was on my leg. I was very drunk, and slept till about two o'clock-no person was in the room, except Connolly and Taylor. I awoke, and found myself alone-my clothes were gone, and my watch was taken out of my stocking. I went to the door, and called the watchman. Rowland came, and took me to the watch-house. I described the women and my property to him, and Taylor was secured. I saw my jacket and waistcoat at the watch-house. Taylor was brought up to me, and I knew her directly.</p>

            . I am a watchman. At two o'clock in the morning, I heard some voices in the direction of Dyot-street. I went to No. 2, New-street, and found the prosecutor there with a rug over his shoulders. He said he had been robbed. I went into the room, and found the property gone. He went to the watch-house, and described Taylor to me particularly, and his property. When I got to the watch-house, I found his jacket and waistcoat there - He was quite sober then. Taylor had been taken up - He swore to her.</p>

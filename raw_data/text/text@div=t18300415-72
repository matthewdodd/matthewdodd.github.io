On the 30th of March, about five o'clock in the morning, my shop shutters were wrenched on one side, a pane of glass broken, and six pairs of boots and four odd shoes were taken out; I have brought those they left in the window to match them - I was in bed and asleep at the time.</p>

            . I was going to my work that morning, and had occasion to go behind a fence; I heard a pane of glass break - I looked through the fence and saw the prisoner draw these articles out at the window; as soon as the clock struck five he went off - I went after him and met the watchman; he went after him, and said he could not find him - I said, "He cannot be far off, if you go on quick you will see him;" he went and I met him coming back with the prisoner - these articles were found on him.</p>

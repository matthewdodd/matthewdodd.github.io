               <p>WILLIAM FOREMAN. On the 22d of July, I was going up <placeName id="t18280911-370-crimeloc1918">Broad-street, St. Giles'</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What part of Broad-street was this? A. A few yards from George-street; I was not accusing the girls of taking it; I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been up late settling some business - I was returning home, and saw the prosecutor pulling three girls about, and accusing them of taking his handkerchief - I passed on, and soon heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned round, he came up, and accused me of taking it; if I had, it must have been found on me or in the street.</p>

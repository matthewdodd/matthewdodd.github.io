             sworn. On the 10th of July between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was going along <placeName id="t18060917-8-crimeloc42">Piccadilly</placeName>

I had in my pocket, a half guinea, a seven shilling piece, and five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the seven shilling piece any where. - A. No, I took her over to the watchman, and he took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might she be with you. - A. Not a minute, in fact I could hardly believe that it could be possible that she could take the money in that time; I took the money out of her hand, I kept it in my hand, and gave it to the officer at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me half a guinea and five shillings, he took me up a passage, and after he had connection with me he wanted me to give it him back.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She accosted me in the street, and almost tore the coat from my shoulder, that is the truth.</p>
               <p>- GREGORY sworn. I was at the watchhouse, I was the officer, the prisoner is the person that was brought into the watch house, and this is the money the gentleman delivered to me (producing it); I searched her but could not find the seven shilling piece, she acknowledged taking the money from him.</p>

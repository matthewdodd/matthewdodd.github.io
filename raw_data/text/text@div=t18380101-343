               <p>Monnery and Edward Josiah Monnery, hosiers, glovers, and out-fitters,0 No. 165, Fenchurch-street. On the 29th of December, about five minutes to six o'clock, I was in the shop walking from behind the counter, to another counter on the left-hand, and hearing somebody come into the shop, I turned my head and saw the prisoner making towards a pile of handkerchiefs—I did not know him before, but I am certain of him—there are seven gas-burners in the shop—he went towards the handker<lb></lb>chiefs and took them off the pile—he left about two pieces on the counter—he took about forty-eight handkerchiefs, being eleven or twelve pieces of different lengths—he made towards the door and ran out directly—I ran after him calling out, "Stop thief"—he was not brought back for half an hour, but he was stopped eight or ten doors from the shop, within two minutes of his leaving the shop—I saw him stopped and taken into our shop—I saw two pieces of handkerchiefs drop from him—he had then all in his arms till the constable took hold of him, and he still had some under his arm.</p>

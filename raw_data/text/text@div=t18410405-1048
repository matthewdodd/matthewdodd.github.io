                  </hi>. I live in Cockspur-street, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and am assistant to my father, John Lambe, who is a dressing-case maker. On the evening of the 4th of March we lost two silver bottles from the window—there was a pane of glass cracked near where they stood—I missed them about five minutes to eight o'clock—I had seen them safe half an hour before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable A</hi> 126.) On the 4th of March, in consequence of information, I watched Mr. Lambe's shop, from a little after seven till eight o'clock, when I saw the prisoners come, and patrol in front of the house—they examined the window, and at last Sandland went up, with a bag in his hand, pushed in the glass with his hand, and took these two bottles—as he returned from the window, I immediately secured him—he resisted very much, and Spark immediately went down Spring-gardens—I had seen them together for a quarter of an hour—they were talking together—Sandland threw the bottles down while I struggled with him—Bye picked one up, and gave it to me.</p>

Storr went with me to the watch-house, where I saw the meat and Lloyd in custody. I asked Storr, on his return from market, if he had sent out any meat or missed any? he said No. I told him a man had been taken to the watch-house with the meat, and as he was my foreman, he could have no objection to accompany me to the watch-house to see if it was mine. He went with me, and at first said it was not mine. I said it depended very materially on his conduct how he should be dealt with, and desired him to tell me how the meat came there. In consequence of what he said I left him in custody. There was a piece of bone in the meat projecting out in a particular manner - it was torn - I compared it with a piece of beef in my shop which it was cut from, which perfectly satisfied me it was mine. I have preserved the bone, and produce it. The mutton was of the same quality with that in my shop, and it is not well dressed, having been done by my apprentice.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Friday morning, the 11th of March, about a quarter past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner, Lloyd, coming out of Black Horse-yard, Tottenham Court-road, which leads to Messrs. Slade's back premises; he had a sack on his shoulder; I stopped him, and asked what was in it? he said,</p>
               <p>"What is that to you?" I asked him where he was going with it? he said to St. Giles's, and I might go with him. I I said,</p>
               <p>"You must go with me to the watch-house" - he said he should not; I insisted on it, sprang my rattle, and secured him. He threw the sack down and would not carry it - it contained beef, mutton, suet, and a tongue.</p>

            . I am in Messrs. Slades' service. I saw the mutton at the watch-house; I had cut it up the morning before, and am certain it had not been sold - it was safe in the house when I went to bed. Storr slept in the house; he got up earlier than me. We generally open shop about six o'clock in the morning; I got up a little after six. The meat was not sold that morning - I saw it at the watch-house about eight o'clock in the morning - it must have been stolen. Storr might have been in the shop alone for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I came down. I have never seen the two prisoners together. I was present when the beef was compared; it had been torn in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Storr was gone to market before you came down - A. Yes. When I came down the door was shut - nobody could get in, except at the door. I found two of the hooks had had meat taken from them, but cannot say what meat had hung upon them.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. Lloyd was brought to the watch-house by the watchman; the meat was brought in a sack. He said he bought it, I asked where? he said that was nothing to me. I enquired at different shops. Garner came to the watch-house and claimed it as his master's. I then returned with him to the shop till Storr came in, and then Mr. Slade went with him and me to the watch-house. I shewed Storr the meat, and asked him if it was his master's? he said No; he said he could not tell whether the mutton was his master's or not, but the rest was not. I kept the prisoners separate, and told Storr that Lloyd said he gave it to him; he then turned to his master, said it was his first offence, and begged for mercy. No promise had been made to him.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Friday the 19th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, he went out, and left me at home; I went out about half an hour after, and locked the door; I went to a chandler's shop; I staid there till after nine; while I was there, between eight and nine, he came for the keys; after nine o'clock I went to him for the keys to the public house, went home and found the door open, and the padlock lying with the staple drawn on the outside; I ran back and asked him how he could be so wicked to draw the staple of the padlock and leave the door open; he said he was not in the house, and that the young woman with him saw he was not; he bid me go home and see what I had lost; I went home and missed three gowns out of a chest in the back room on the ground floor. I went to four pawnbrokers that night; the next morning I went again, and at Mr. Fleming's in Drury-lane, I heard of one of my gowns, the white one; he told me there had been a woman there with a gown, and called the boy to describe her; the boy said she had a brown gown on, snaggled teeth, and a scar over her eye; by the description I knew it was the prisoner; I went and took her up directly, and the boy swore to her person; when she was taken she denied the fact, till we were going by Mr. Henshaw's in Crown-court; then she owned she took them, and said she had pawned them there; I found all the gowns there; I told all the marks before I opened them; she said she did it for want of money; she said she was not willing to put my husband to the expence to withdraw her recognizance: she had been in a quarrel with a person, and my husband had been bound in a recognizance for her.</p>
               <p>A servant to Henshaw produced three gowns that were pledged by the prisoner on the 15th of April, between nine and ten at night. (They were deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>

               <p>This day five weeks she came to me at nine o'clock at night, and brought these three gowns and a penny, and desired me to pawn them for what I could, for she said she wanted to buy a bargain and did not want Thomas to know of it; she said she wanted to make what she could, and then to leave this Thomas. She has been several times in the Bail Dock with me, pressing me to take this thing on myself, left Thomas should turn her out of doors.</p>

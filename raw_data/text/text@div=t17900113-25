               <p>I am an officer; on the 1st of January I was going through Wellclose-square, and saw the prosecutrix have hold of the prisoner; she said he had stole her cloak, and took it from her forcibly in an alley in Cornhill; I took him before the magistrate; there he said the prosecutrix gave him the cloak.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The prisoner asked me to go with him to get some muslins and handkerchiefs, in a court in Cornhill; when we got there, he pulled the cloak off my shoulders, and ran away: it was Ball-court; he never spoke to me: I called out, but saw nobody; two more men came up to me the instant he was gone, and tore my bed-gown down, and pulled my bonnet over my face, that I could not see them; I gave an alarm, but nobody came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you unpin the cloak, and give it me to tie up the muslins in.</p>

               <p>When I went with her to fetch the things, she said her husband was dead, and she had buried her two children; and when we have got the things, you may as well come and live with me, I am a widow; she gave me her cloak and handkerchief to tie up the muslins, because her apron was old, and would not hold them.</p>

I was returning back towards the parlour, and met the prisoner coming out. He gave me a paper, and said, this is the direction; if you send any servant, he would take care he should have the box. I suspected he had something under his coat, by his going out with one hand behind him under it. I went into the parlour, and found the candle lying on the table, and the silver candlestick was gone. I ran after him, and catched him in Church-court, near St. Martin's church, about 200 yards from my master's house: I laid hold of him, and received several blows from him.

               <p>Mr. Roberts. I had seen it hanging up in the parlour that day before I went out, about four o'clock in the afternoon. When I came home, between seven and eight o'clock, my maid gave me a direction to go to the swan and two necks, in Lad-lane, for a box. I went there the next morning, but no box was there for me. (That direction I left at Sir John Fielding's ) When I came home, I asked my maid what sort of a man it was that left that direction? She said, he was a very tall, thin man. Such was the prisoner. In looking round the room, I missed my sword; I went and got it advertised, and the Saturday following, Mr. Fielding sent for me to come to him on the Monday, at eleven o'clock. He said a man was taken up for stealing a silver candlestick, and he thought he might be the man that had stole my sword. I went and found the prisoner there, and my sword (produced in court.) This sword is my property; I have wore it five or six years.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Roberts. On a Wednesday in last month, the prisoner knocked at our door. He asked if Mr. Roberts was at home? I told him no. He asked what time I expected him in? I said that was uncertain. He said he was book-keeper at the swan and two necks in Lad-lane, and there was a box left there for my master, and had been there above a week, and he called to let us know, fearing there might be something of consequence in it. He asked me leave to write a direction. I asked him to walk into the front parlour; and gave him a pen and ink.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The sword hung in that parlour.</p>
               <p>J. Jones. While he was writing the direction, another man knocked at the door; I went to answer at the door, and left the prisoner in the parlour. The man at the door asked if a captain did not lodge here? I told the man we had no lodger at all. He said, a friend of his had fell down in the street, and broke his leg, and he would be very much obliged to me, if I could direct him to a captain, naming a name, to assist in getting his friend into the hospital. While I was talking to him, the prisoner came out of the parlour, and delivered a direction to me, and desired me not to forget to deliver it to my master, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>J. Jones. This was about a quarter after six in the evening. I thought it very odd, he should come so out of the parlour. I went in after he was gone, but did not miss any thing then. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170004"></xptr> next morning I missed the sword and belt, and told my mistress of it. When my master returned  he soon missed it. I am sure the prisoner is the man that came in and wrote the direction; he had the same great-coat on he has now: he had it open. I know his face and his voice; and am certain he is the man.</p>

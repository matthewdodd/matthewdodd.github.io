            . Q. You are a police officer - A. Yes. On the 30th of September, I was informed the prisoner was in Shadwell office; I went to her, and searched her and found nothing; I apprehended Mrs. Ward, and then I went to the prisoner, and told her I had apprehended Mrs. Ward, and I had got the remainder of the money. She acknowledged then that she had taken the money from the man; there is thirteen guineas in gold, and some articles that were bought with the other money; I mentioned a beaver hat, the prisoner had bought of Mr. Salter, the hatter, two pair of shoes, stockings, and several other articles; I told her she had given Mrs. Ward two pair of stockings, and I took off two gold rings from the prisoner's finger, that I was informed by Mrs. Ward, she had bought of Mr. Mitchell, the pawnbroker. The prisoner then said she had taken the remainder of the twenty two guineas to Mrs. Ward to take care of for her, thirteen guineas she said; there is thirteen guineas that I received from Mrs. Appleby, and here are articles she bought; and this two pair of stockings I had from Mrs. Ward; I went to Mrs. Appleby for the thirteen guineas with Mrs. Ward.</p>
               <p>MARY WARD. On the 30th of September, about half an hour after seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner going up Kings Arms gardens, she had got a little boy by her side; she asked me to go with her to buy some shoes, as I understood them; I went with her to a shop in Old Gravel Lane; she bought a pair of half boots, a pair of shoes, and a pair of pattens; she changed a guinea, I believe they came to sixteen shillings; she then went and bought a hat for fifteen shillings; she gave a guinea and took the change; she bought sixpennyworth of rolls for breakfast, some tea and sugar, and two pair of stockings; the bought two rings. She said a man had promised her marriage; she changed a guinea, for the two rings; after we had bought these things I bought her two water tubs, which she had taken home to my house; the shoes, hat, and stockings I took care of; the rings she put on her; I took them to my house first, then I sent my girl with them to Mrs. Appleby's; she gave me thirteen guineas, to take care of, as she had no pockets. Mr. Brown asked me what I had got; I told him directly. I put the thirteen guineas in a box because they should not be lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards you went with the officer to Mrs. Appleby's and got the clothes you had sent her, and the box with the thirteen guineas - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brown. Did you get any more money afterwards - A. Yes; the next morning I searched about the yard; I received information from the landlord where this man slept, that there were two guineas in the yard; I picked up two guineas.</p>

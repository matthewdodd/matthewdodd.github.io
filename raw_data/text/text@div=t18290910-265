            . I am a general-dealer in saddles and harness. On Friday week a message was left for me to go and look at a saddle at No. 9, Hart-street - I met Webster, and said "I am going to look at a saddle, there was one lost out of the park, perhaps it is it;" I went there and asked the man in the shop if there was not a man who had a saddle to sell, he said go to the first-floor- I went up, and the woman said "My husband is gone out and has got the saddle;" I went back to my house and heard that it had been there - I went to the Duke of Wellington public-house, and saw Serjer, and another man who had the saddle; Serjer said, "It does not belong to me, it balongs to a man named Smith - I want 36s. for it;" I told Webster.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of September I went and saw Serjer with the saddle - he said he bought it of a man named Smith, but he did not know where to find him; I took him - he was examined the next day; some of his friends looked out for Smith, and said he was at a public-house - I went and said, "Is your name Smith?" he said "Yes - I gave the saddle to Serjer, and I received it from Simpkins;" I took him to the office - Simpkins said he was the person who applied for it under false pretences.</p>

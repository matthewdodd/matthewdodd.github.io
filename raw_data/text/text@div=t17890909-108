               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You thought this person had been a gentleman; and put confidence in him; and went for a coach? - I did think so.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner at the bar, upon the spot at the time? - I did not see him then; when he had the box, he was going towards Aldgate; he told me the first man gave him orders to carry it to the three Nuns at Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Should not you have taken that or any other box for the same gentleman, if he had paid you? - I believe I should.</p>
               <p>You say the gentleman and the other porter were acquainted; did you ever see them together in conversation? - I never did; I pitched the box in Camomile-street, close to the corner of Bishopsgate-street.</p>

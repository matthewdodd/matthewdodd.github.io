            . The prisoner was in my employ, and left me in the month of July - he had been round on the day he left me to my customers to receive money - he did not account for any money he had received of Mrs. Williams - he came home that evening and put the basket in, and went to a public-house - I went after him and said, "John, will you come and stir the sponge" - he said "Not before eight o'clock." I met him on the following evening between nine and ten, in the Borough. There was 5 s. 4 1/2 d. found on him, which I believe the officer gave him again.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner on the evening of the 11th of July, at the Obelisk. I found two or three bakers' bills on him, but I do not recollect that I found any money on him - if I did I gave it him again.</p>

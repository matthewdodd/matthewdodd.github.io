               <p>I am son of the last witness. On the 15th of August, about five in the evening, I came up stairs from church, and saw this man in my mother's room; and when he saw me he came out, and went down stairs: the door was not locked: I ran after him, and I asked him what business he had in that room? he said, what room? he was in no room there: I followed him into a publick-house, and I told the landlord, and he sent for a constable, and he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>I went to see for some linen that Mrs. Butler had to wash for me, and I forgot the number of the house, and I asked a baker, and he told me No. 3; I went and met a woman, and asked her, and she said, she did not know; I found a door open, and I went in; and the boy came up, and he asked me what I was doing; and I said, I wanted Mrs. Butler, and he followed me, and several others, and cried, stop thief! I went into a public-house, and they sent for this constable, and he took me; I found these keys, and some other things in a bundle; I shewed them to an acquaintance of mine, and I said, I should sell them. The boy swore he found the two aprons on the stairs. This constable wanted to be bound over, and the justice would not let him.</p>
               <p>Court to Dyer. Where did you find the keys? - I felt down the outside of his pocket, and they were not there, and I put my hand into the inside of his breeches, and I found these false keys. What he said respecting my being bound over is false, my lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, I once found a bunch of keys, and I gave them a person, and eight of them would open her drawers.</p>
               <p>Court to Dyer. Did you hear the boy say any thing about the aprons? - He said they were on the floor.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Sandford Booth, of Bishopsgate-street, without. On the 9th of June I was near St. Brides, in Fleet-street—I had a pocket-handkerchief—this is it to the best of my knowledge—it was produced to me in five minutes after I missed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am patrol of St. Bride's. On the evening of the 9th of June, I saw the two prisoners, and two others in company with them—I had seen them at six o'clock, all together—I knew them well—I saw them all together again at half-past nine o'clock, following Mr. Turner—that occasioned me to watch them—I saw Miles attempt the pocket—one Willoughby came up and get before them—he took the handkerchief out, handed it to Miles, when he gave it to William, who put it in his hat—I went across the road, and took hold of Willoughby and Williams—Willoughby got from me and ran down Bride-lane—the prosecutor took Miles and I took Williams to the watchhouse—I took the handkerchief from him.</p>

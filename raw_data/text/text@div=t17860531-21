               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry how he came by it? - He came very publicly into the street, at four in the afternoon; he had it over his arm; he offered it to several shops; it hung at the door all the week after, I had no notion of its being stolen; the officer came to me, and I fetched it down immediately; it is small sized, it will not fit the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What would such a coat as that cost at first? - I suppose about three guineas.</p>

               <p>Smith. Then, you have worn it night and day; gentlemen's coachmen generally have their left-off clothes; we buy better than this; I saw the coat; says I, it is rather too small for you; says he, it fitted me when it was first made for me; and he being a young man, I thought he might have grown.</p>

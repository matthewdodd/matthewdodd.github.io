            . I am a watchman of St. Martin's parish, in the Strand, On the 22d of July, betwixt 11 and 12 at night I stopped the prisoner with a parcel loose in her apron near Bullin court ; she said she was going to a place, and went into Exeter street to her own mother's door. Mrs. Turner came up to me, and told me the prisoner had got some things of hers. I carried her to the constable.</p>
               <p>Samuel Green. I am constable. The prisoner, with the things loose in her apron, was brought to the watch-house by the last evidence. She seemed much confused, and said very little.</p>

               <p>I was hired a weekly servant in this house for 2 s. When I had been there about three days, my dinner did not agree with me, and my mistress gave me a glass of brandy, and the other young lady gave me two or three glasses of wine, and I was so much in liquor that I can't tell whether I took the things or they put them in my apron.</p>
               <p>Mr. Birmingham and his wife, and Mr. Caswell and his wife, appeared, and gave her a good character, exclusive of this affair.</p>

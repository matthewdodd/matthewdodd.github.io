               <p>Colonel Charles Napier, of no. 57, Green-street, Grosvenor-square, commanded the regiment; as also the Right Honourable Colonel Gustavus Rochford, of No. 11, Cavendish-square; or by referring to the Secretary of War. I sold out of the army on the 12th of March, 1818; after which, I went to New South Wales to settle; but owing to unfore<lb></lb>seen misfortunes and losses which I sustained, I was obliged to return to England again. I can assure you, Sir Edward, I never had the re<lb></lb>motest idea that ever I should be nominated amongst begging-letter wri<lb></lb>ters; nor did I for a moment except the reply in answer to my unfortu<lb></lb>nate affliction, from so meritorius an individual as yourself.—<hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY STEELE</hi>, late 100th regiment.—To General the Honourable Sir Ed<lb></lb>ward Paget.—No. 138, Oxford-street, London; 28th of September, 1835.—P.

               <p>(No. 5.)—Sir Edward Paget has to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Steele's letter of yesterday's date, in which he has favoured him with his address, and given him references of so circumstantial a kind, that he came no longer doubt the authenticity of the statement made in his letters of the 17th and 23rd instant. Under these circumstances, he incloses a five pound note, and sincerely regrets the distress to which Mr. Steele and his family are subjected.—R. M. College, 29th September, 1835. "</p>

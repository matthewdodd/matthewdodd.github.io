               <p>I am a gardener and headborough: about two o'clock in the morning, on the 30th of November, I thought somebody was attempting to break into some of the houses opposite; I took a cutlass and went down by the side of the pales, I heard a foot step; I advanced and seized the prisoner; I asked him what he had got; he called me by my name, and bid me hold my tongue; I said it was an odd time of night to be carrying hay; he said, if I would hold my tongue he would take it back; I told him it was too late, he should not have taken it; I told him as he was a single man, it was not excusable.</p>
               <p>What is he? - A watchman at night; he said he had five more trusses, which he had from Mr. Humphreys, and it was hay he had bound for him; I took him to the cage; he keeps a horse of his own.</p>

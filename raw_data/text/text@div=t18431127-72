                  </hi>. I am footman to Mr. Richard Bloxam, who lives at No. 40, Cadogan-place. It is his dwelling-house. On Saturday, the 11th of Nov., I took the plate in a basket up stairs into the dining-room be<lb></lb>tween live and six o'clock, I put what had not been used into a basket, and took it down into the pantry between seven and eight o'clock, and about eight there was a knock at the front door in Cadogan-place—I answered the knock, and found a person there who asked for a Captain Atkins, who has been dead some time—the man went away on my answering the question—in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes there was another knock—I was in the kitchen at the time—there was a light in the pantry—it was rather a loud knock, and could be heard through the house—I went into the area, and an<lb></lb>swered the person, and found a man there who said he had a message for me—I went part of the way up the area steps—he then said I was not the person—I believe it was the prisoner Manning—he hnd a dark coat on, and a cap—he said it was a dark young man he wanted to see—I told him to go to No. 42, I thought there was a dark young man there—Eliza Simpson was in the kitchen at the time the knock came—I did not see her while I was talking to</p>

               <p>Manning—the kitchen looks out into the area—the pantry is at the back of the house, and the kitchen in front—you get into an open yard at the back of the house, through a back door, and then there is a washhouse at the end of the yard—there is a wall dividing the yard from Cadogan-mews—there is a door in the wall, which is kept locked and bolted inside—I had locked and bolted the door the day before, and taken the key into the drawing-room—I sleep in the pantry—I did not miss the plate till next morning—there were twenty forks, twenty spoons, and two sauce ladles all silver, worth upwards of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went into the back yard leading to the mews, and found the door in the wall was pulled to—the bolts had been drawn, and the door unlocked—I ob<lb></lb>served foot marks near the door, in the inside—they appeared to have been made over-night—they were about two feet from the door, such as might be made by a man dropping from the wall, which is about eight and a half feet high outside, and about ten feet inside, the ground being lower—on the next night, Sunday, Manning was brought to the house in custody—I thought he was the person who had come on Saturday night.</p>

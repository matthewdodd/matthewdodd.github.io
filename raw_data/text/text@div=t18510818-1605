                  </hi>. I am in the service of Philip George Dodd, a jeweller, 79, Cornhill; he does not occupy the house, only the shop, and two rooms at the back. On 9th July I had charge of the shop—the prisoner came in about three o'clock in the afternoon—she asked to look at a ring which was in a tray of rings in the window—it was a serpent ring, with an opal in it—I took the tray from the window and showed her the rings—while</p>

               <p>she was looking it over, I said, "I have some other serpent rings which I will show you"—I turned to the window, and took two other rings out, an emerald and a ruby—she liked them in preference to the others, because they were less expensive—she selected the ruby one, which was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she then asked to look at some brooches, which I showed her, and she selected one, at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she then wanted some gilt bracelets, which I showed her—she selected one pair—she required a silver thimble, one of which she selected from a number—I made her a bill of the articles, which amounted to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she requested some one might be sent with the articles, which would be paid for when they reached home—nothing had passed between us about a diamond ring, but in the tray I showed her there was a diamond ring, and when she was gone that ring was missing—our porter went with her with the things—he had been in the shop the whole time she was there—no other person came in—I missed the diamond ring not two minutes after she was gone—it had been in the front row of the tray that I showed her—the porter returned in about twenty minutes—he made a statement to me, and, in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said, I went, at five o'clock, to Milk-street—I could not find the prisoner, nor hear anything of her—I went again the next morning, and again in the afternoon, but they knew nothing about her—it was at a warehouse in Milk-street, a part of which is occupied by Mr. Clay—the price of the ring was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have seen it since—this is it—it has our private mark on it.</p>

I was in the shop with Mr. Leach about three o'clock that afternoon—I remember the prisoner coming in—I took notice of her—she asked Mr. Leach to show her a gentleman's ring which was in the window—he did so, and she did not like it, because it was too high—he placed the tray before her—she looked at one, and then he showed her some from the window—she took one which was less price—she then asked for bracelets, and then for a thimble—she requested to look at ear-rings—we said we had none—she then desired the bill and the things to be sent to Milk-street—I went there with her—she told me to wait outside a door—she went to a door, where the name of Clay and Kemp was up—she said, "Wait here a moment; I will see if ray uncle Clay is at home," or words to that effect—she came back in a moment or two, and said, "My uncle Clay is not</p>

                  </hi>. I was an assistant to Mr. Young, a pawnbroker, in Leicester-square.

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker and jeweller, and live in Nel<lb></lb>son-street, Greenwich. I have known the prisoner fourteen months, and have repaired jewellery for him—he represented himself as a traveller to a grocer. On the 14th of July he came and asked me if I would let him have a watch to show a person to sell, provided he left security for it—he offered to leave this bill, which he said was a good one, and he would re<lb></lb>turn the watch or motley in the evening—he said the bill was taken for grocery which he had sold to the acceptor of the bill—I agreed to let him have the watch till the evening—he did not call in the evening—I saw nothing of him till after the bill became due, and was dishonoured—I gave the bill to Mr. Tanner, my next-door neighbour, to send to his banker's—it was returned to me noted, which I had to pay for—I wrote to Mr. Hutchinson, who appears to be the acceptor of the bill, after it be<lb></lb>came due, which was on the 6th of September—about a week after that the prisoner was brought to my shop—he said it was a good bill, that he would come and pay me the money for the watch, and take the bill from me as soon as he could—the watch was pledged with Mr. Nash, in Lon<lb></lb>don-street, Greenwich—I found it there, and paid Nash 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, which it was pledged for—I gave it up to the officer, by the Magistrate's order—I asked the prisoner to give me the duplicate—he said there was no occasion for that, as I had got the watch from the pawnbroker—I met him again about a week after, in Straits-mouth, Greenwich—he then promised to come and pay me as soon as he could, but said he was unable at pre<lb></lb>sent—I know this to be the bill I gave to Mr. Tanner, by my handwriting at the back.</p>

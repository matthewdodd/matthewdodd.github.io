I thought I had found a good find, the next day I went and told them. I thought no harm at all, two or three days after I was over-against the watch-house at St. Catharine's, the watchman came and took me by the collar, and said I was his prisoner, and ask'd me if I knew of such and such things?

He wanted 12 s. on it, the man let him have half a guinea. He put down Smith in the book, I did not hear the christian name.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 180). On Saturday night, 18th Nov., I saw Brown in Southampton-street, carrying something—I followed him, and saw him put it over some railings into an area at the end of Jones's house—there are several boards placed right across the area—there is no window, but a door in the basement into the area—it can be seen by day-light—it is generally kept shut—I lifted up what Brown had placed on the boards, and found it was lead—Brown had then gone into Churchway, which is the front way to Jones's house—I concealed myself for a few minutes, and Brown came out of the front door into Churchway, took the lead, and pnt it through the railings <hi rend="italic">cm to</hi> another board a little lower down the area—I took hold of him, and asked what he had got, he said, "Nothing particular, only a parcel I brought for Mr. Jones; wait a minute, Mr. Jones will be here for it"—at that instant Jones opened the little door and came into the area—the lead was about as high as his breast—he took hold of one end of it—I caught the other end and said, "Stop. I will take that"—Brown said, "That is your property, is it not, Mr. Jones?"—Jones looked up and saw me; he knew me—he had seen me before, and he said, "No," I think, I will not be positive—I took Brown and the lead to the station—I came back to Jones's shop and said to him, "Well, what about this lead?"—he said, "Well, I had not it"—I said, "I shall take you into custody for receiving the lead, knowing it was stolen"—he said, "It was never in my shop"—I said, "No, but on your premises, and in your possession"—he said, "You never saw me pay for the lead"—I said, "No, I did not"—I found a half-crown and a shilling on Brown—I asked him where he got that from—he said he had earned if at a penny or twopence a time—I said I thought it was money he had received for the lead—he said, "No," and he had never taken anything to Jones's shop before—at the Police-court Jones told me he had a good mind to <hi rend="italic">cut</hi>—he said, "I would have come back again on Monday morning; I thought you would come for me; you need not say I received the lead; I should not mind giving you a pound or two;" and then his wife said, in his presence, "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

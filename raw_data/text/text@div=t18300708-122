            . I am a Police-constable. On the 8th of June I was going home, and saw the three prisoners together, looking into an oil-shop window in Norton-falgate; Angier went into the shop, he then came out, and they all went away; I went into the oil-shop, and then followed them - they went on towards Shoreditch church, and looked into a watch-maker's shop; Angier went in there and came out - then they went to another shop; I followed them down Church-street, Bethnal-green - they all three tried the door of an undertaker's-shop; they went on to a clothes-shop, and went into the passage, one after the other; I still followed them, and at last I saw Angier go into Gregory's shop, the other two stood outside - Angier came out again; I went in and asked Mrs. Gregory if she missed any thing - she then looked, and said she had; I went and took them - they were altogether, resting their hands on their hands on some butts - Rogers walked away when he saw me, and I followed him; he ran, I made a spring and jumped on his back - I took off his hat, and found this handkerchief in it; my partners took the others - they searched them at a public-house, they had no money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long have you been in the Police? A. From the beginning of it; I had taken a great many thieves before; the Chairman of the Quarter Sessions has not refused to take any case on my representation; I was not ordered out of Court the other day - I was not accused of buying cotton handkerchiefs, and charging boys with stealing them; I was not in my Police dress when these prisoners were taken - I was then off duty - I saw them go into shops and ask the price of things; I found nothing on Angier.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you in April last lose any nails? - I believe I did. On the 25th of April I was called on by the watchman, he asked me if I had sent a man out with any nails; he said he had stopped a man on Snow-hill with some, and that he said he had them from me; I went with the patrol to the watch-house and saw the nails; they are my property, they were taken from the prisoner by the patrol; I asked the officer of the night if he had searched him, and he said no, I desired him to search him, and twenty-seven nails were found in his pocket: the prisoner had worked with me eighteen months or thereabouts; but I discharged him before Christmas; I asked him if anybody was concerned with him; and he said no.</p>

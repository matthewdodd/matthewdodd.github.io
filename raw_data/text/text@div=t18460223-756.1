                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Daggett's-court, Eldon-street, Fins<lb></lb>bury. I have seen Selliss before at a public-house—I met him on Friday morning, the 20th of Feb. between twelve and one o'clock—he said, "Will you stand a pint of beer?"—I said I would, but it was after twelve o'clock, and all the houses were shut up—he said he would find a house if I would pay for a pint of beer—I said of course I would—he went to a house on the left-hand side of Bishopsgate-street—I then had two sovereigns, eighteen shillings, and some coppers in my pocket—I paid for two pints of beer there—Weston was there, and Selliss seemed to know him—as soon as we came out Selliss said to me, "Where are you going?"—I said, "To a coffee-shop"—he said, "Come with me"—we went to Whitechapel—he said, "Here is a house open, we can have a pint of beer here"—I paid for a pint there—Weston and Selliss followed me out—I went to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-stand in the middle of the street for a necessary purpose—I was there knocked down, and imme<lb></lb>diately there were three or four persons upon the top of me, and I felt them ripping my coat—I heard my coat ripping—I saw no chance, and cried, "Murder! murder! police!"—as soon as I cried "Murder!" Weston <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> right away from me across the street, and stood against the wall, as if he had not a hand in it—I saw him run across the street, and he was one who had been holding me down—I am positive of that—he was the only one I recognised—the policeman came up—I told him what had happened—I went right straight to Weston—I said, "Here is one of them," and gave him in charge—I did not see Murphy after I was in the house, nor Selliss—he came out of the house after me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Weston.</hi> I went into a public-house, and met with Selliss and the prose<lb></lb>cutor; we went to another public-house, and had some more beer and gin; then we went to Whitechapel and had two pints of beer there; he came out with two females, and when I came out I found he was knocked down; I pulled a young woman off him; he hallooed, "Murder!" and I took her off. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, he did not—my money was all gone, and my pocket, and the back of my coat with it—the money was in my coat-pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gun-square, Houndsditch. I was in White<lb></lb>chapel, and heard a cry of "Murder!"—I saw the prosecutor knocked down by Murphy—I am positive of that—when he was down I saw him put his knee</p>

               <p>upon his breast—he muffled him about, and he took from his person some black or dark thing, like a pocket—he got up and ran up a little avenue—I followed him, and opposite Whitechapel church he turned back—I said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, knocking that man down, and doing what you have done"—he said, "It was not me"—I never lost sight of him—he said he would go home—he ran across Whitechapel—I followed him and cried, "Stop thief!"—the policeman Kelly came up—Murphy ran up a little avenue, and we lost sight of him—there was a turning in the avenue—I am positive he was the man.</p>

I said, "I shall go home in a few minutes;" I was going home; Selliss and Weston came in; then the prosecutor; the prosecutor paid for two pints of beer, and then for bread and cheese, and beer for two prostitutes, and he left these men; he then came out; Selliss was the next that followed him, and Weston stopped to the last; I came out, and walked over to No. 9, Flower and Dean-street, where the officer took me.</p>

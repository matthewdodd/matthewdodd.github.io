            . Early one morning I got up to work; I bid the boy get up; he came down in a few minutes after me; he went to fetch some pots in, and never came back again. I went up stairs, and saw my breeches were moved; he was a fellow-servant of mine: I live with Mr. Freestone, at the Bunch-of-Grapes, in the Spaw Fields. I had one pound sixteen shillings and a groat in my breeches, but that was gone; I saw it at going to bed; he was taken the Friday following, and carried before Justice Cowley; there he owned he had taken my money, to buy cloaths: when he was brought to my master's, he said he had taken twenty-two shillings, and that was all: he was committed to New-Prison. I did not get a farthing of my money again; he said he had laid it all out.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the matter; he beat me one night, and I ran away in the morning; he told me he would beat me again.</p>

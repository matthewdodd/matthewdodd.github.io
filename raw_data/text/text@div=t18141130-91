               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man that you took - A. My partner took him; I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>JEFFERY COOK. I am the other watchman; I was standing at the corner of Sidmouth-street, I went with Blond to the new houses; I saw the prisoner up in the building, in the two pair of stairs: I took hold of him, and took him to the watchhouse, and delivered him to the watchhouse-keeper; there was another man with him, he made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get into the house - A. There was no fastening to the vault, they got in that way.</p>

I went back with one of them; we searched the house from the top to the bottom; in the attic story we found this lead, it looked as if it had been taken from the room; the lead was wet; there had been rain that night. This is the lead.</p>
               <p>- JONES. I am a watchman. I went into Sidmouth-street with Branscomb; I assisted in searching the house; we found the lead in the attic story.</p>
               <p>JOHN BAXTER. I was constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to me on the 6th of last month, between two and three o'clocke in the morning, and this key and this hammer; I have had them ever since.</p>

            . I am a patrole. In the morning, I and some of the watchmen went and fitted on the lead to the roof of the house where it was taken from; it matched exactly to the gutters; it is all gutter lead, and fitted the roof; she roof was snipped intirely of all the gutter-lead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was without any money; I went into this house to lay down, I went up into the two pair, and laid down, and went to sleep; I did not hear any body; I thought it much better to lay on the boards up stairs, than on the cold stones below stairs.</p>

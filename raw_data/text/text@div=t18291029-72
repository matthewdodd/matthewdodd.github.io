            . I am a printer. On the 17th of September I was coming through Smithfield, and heard a man was taken up for stealing a pair of trousers, and a young man who was with me, named Ford, asked me to go to Mrs. Dynam's - in consequence of what he said, I went to her house in Field-lane, and asked her for a pair of trousers which Ford had left there - she asked me to come down to her other shop in Field-lane; I went, and she placed me in the back yard, fastened me in, and in two minutes they brought them to me, and as I came out of the door, she herself told me I was not to say where they came from, for they were a poor pair, not worth 2s.; I brought them to Scasebrook's mother, who was in West-street, and I was taken in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are in a respectable way of life? A. No; I am an unfortunate lad- I own I have been twice in Bridewell; the last time was twelve months ago - I was not out two days before I was taken to the House of Correction, and since that I have been twice at Guildhall; I am now in custody - I was in Newgate six months ago; I am seventeen years old.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

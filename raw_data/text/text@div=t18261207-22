On Friday, the 24th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, I took thirty-two silver spectacle-frames, in a bag, to Goldsmith's hall; I fetched them about half-past four o'clock, and then went to 'Change: I was in <placeName id="t18261207-22-crimeloc129">Fleet-street</placeName>

I went up the court, and only lost sight of him for a short time - he was stopped almost directly, by Mr. Taplin - we have never found the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whose property were they? A. Edmund Taylor's. I was christened by the name of Henry William, but go by the name of William only; the prisoner came behind me - I could not see him well then - he ran away directly the bag was taken, and I went up the court after him - he was stopped almost directly; I did not see his face till he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that night, that the prisoner took the bag, and the other held you? A. I believe I did, but he is the one who held my shoulders; the one who took the bag had a fustian jacket on; I went into a newspaper-shop directly he was taken. I believe I said there that he was the man who took the bag. I turned round, and saw him take his hands off my shoulder.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to say he took the bag if he held your shoulder? A. I am sure he held my shoulder while the one in the fustian jacket took the bag.</p>

            . I am a plumber, and live in Greystoke-place, Fetter-lane. I was coming down Johnson's-court, towards Fleet-street, and heard the boy cry out - I saw the prisoner running from the boy, towards me - he was pushing himself out from the mob, and met me on the steps of Johnson's-court; the boy cried out, as if he was hurt; I laid hold of the prisoner - the boy immediately accused him of being the thief; he said he was not the person, but the man who had committed the act had run up the court; I saw nobody running up the court - if there had been, I must have seen them; I went into the newspaper-shop with the boy, but did not hear what account he gave there. An officer was sent for, who took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner said he was not the person? A. Yes. The boy did not say whether he had seen his face; he said one held him, and the other took the bag. I heard him say the prisoner was the thief - that was all.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Wych-street. I was going towards Temple-bar, and met the prisoner and another person coming towards me, arm-in-arm, just about Johnson's-court; I was about four yards from the court - they were coming towards Fleet-market, meeting the boy - when they got opposite to me they turned back again, and I saw the prisoner go behind the boy, leaning over his shoulder - the boy had a kind of parcel; he hallooed out directly, and I saw the prisoner and another one leaning over him - the other made off, up Johnson's-court; the prisoner was up to the top of the steps, and Taplin stopped him; I am sure he is one of them: I did not see the parcel taken, but the other ran up the court with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then it is true that the one who took the parcel ran up the court? A. Yes; the prisoner said, "There goes the man who has got the property, up the court," but I know he was in company with that man; Taplin was coming down the court - it was a dark court; the man had very likely passed him - I went into the newspaper-shop, and said the prisoner was the man who was leaning over the boy's shoulder. The constable was in the shop. I am sure I accused him of being the man; I was loaded with goods; I did not go to Guildhall the next morning; both the persons leaned over the boy's shoulder, and were both behind him; I had never seen the prisoner before; there was a mob after the boy hallooed out. Taylor was not in the newspaper-shop; the master of the shop asked if anybody knew about the business; I did not go forward, as the prisoner was being searched, and he was writing a parcel of names down. I told the master of the shop afterwards that I had seen it; it was in Flemming's Express-office; the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070019"></xptr>in the shop when I said I had seen them arm-in-arm, and had seen it done.</p>

            . I am the street-keeper. I received the prisoner into custody - he said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the boy say, in the shop, who took the bag? A. No. There was a boy said something about the prisoner not taking it; I did not hear any-body say the prisoner was not the man, but that might be said. I did not observe Dunbar in the shop, but I was not sent for till afterwards, and I dare say there were twenty people there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I have sent to get this boy up - his mother has sworn she will kill him, and has sent him out of the way, that he should not come here.</p>

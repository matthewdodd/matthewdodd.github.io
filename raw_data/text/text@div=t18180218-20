On the 14th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I heard the street - door open, ran up, and saw the prisoner coming out at the parlour door - I had seen the street - door fast about five minutes before; I did not hear the door open.

            . I was passing, and was told a thief was in the house, and that they could not procure a constable. I took him into custody, and was informed that he had an accomplice outside; the prisoner pointed out the accomplice - I took him, and then the prisoner. Mr. Day charged him with entering the house, and moving part of the plate. The articles stated in the indictment laid at one corner of the table; the salt had been emptied out of the cellar on the floor-the things were in great disorder. I found nothing on the prisoner.</p>

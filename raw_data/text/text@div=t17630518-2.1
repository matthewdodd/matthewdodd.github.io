               <p>I had been on the other side the water to see a kinsman, going home through Newgate there were two boys and a man; I had been drinking a little more than did me good. I was throwing my hands about, the gentleman turned round, and said, his pocket was pick'd. The handkerchief was thrown upon the cape of my coat; the gentleman said, you rascal, you have got my handkerchief. I had not power to speak at that time. The two boys ran, one on one side, and the other on the other, of the gentlemen. I said, the handkerchief is none of mine, if it is yours you are welcome to it.</p>

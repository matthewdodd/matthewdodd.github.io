                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. These cushions and horse-cloths were safe in the stable on Monday evening, the 14th of March—I missed them on Tuesday morning, the 15th—as I was coming home, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, two persons passed me—one had a cloth or cloths, and the other a bag—I believe the prisoner to be the one that had the cloths—I thought it looked like my master's pro<lb></lb>perty, but I had no suspicion at the time, or I should have stopped them.</p>

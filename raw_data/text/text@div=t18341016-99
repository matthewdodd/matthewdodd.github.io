            . I am a carman. On the 27th of September my caravan was in Thames-street, at the corner of the Custom-house gateway - the prisoner had no right to have it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you followed the business of a carman? A. Five or six years - I have known the prisoner about two months - I know Mrs. Cleaver; she is the widow of a person who was one of the fellowship of carmen - I carry on my business in her name - my caravan<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160056"></xptr>has her name on it - I had employed the prisoner occasionally as a driver of the cart, and so has my servant; but my servant is not in Court - I did not hear from him that the prisoner had my cart for the purpose of doing this job - he has been authorized to employ the prisoner to drive the van - on the 27th of September the prisoner came to me, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, after my man had booked the work he had done in the day - the prisoner said he had taken my van for the purpose of taking a chest of indigo - he said he had received 3s. for it, which he gave me, and I gave him 1s.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did he tell you where it was taken? A. He said from Cutler-street to Whitechapel; but he did not say who had employed him - I should not have known my van had gone for indigo unless he had told me - I heard from my own man that the van had been used while he was away for five minutes; but he did not know by whom.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you not surprised that your van was gone? A. Yes; but when we got to the corner we heard who had taken it - I do not stay with the van.</p>

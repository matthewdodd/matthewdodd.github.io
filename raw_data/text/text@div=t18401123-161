                  </hi>. I live in Herefordshire. In July last I was staying in London, and had a front parlour at No. 3, St. Alban's-place, St. James's, which I used as a sleeping-room—Mr. Lane, the owner of the house, did not sleep in the house, but his servant lived there and attended to the rooms—on Saturday, the 11th of July, I came home about twelve o'clock at night, and then went out to a club-house in the neighbourhood—I took a latch-key with me, that the parties in the house should not be kept up—I closed my room-door, but did not lock it—I closed the outer door after me, and am quite sure it fastened—I returned about a quarter after two o'clock, and found the police in possession of my room, and nearly all the property gone, to the value of nearly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Friend the 4th of February, the day that the king of Prussia was about to embark from Woolwich I was sent by the commissioners down to Woolwich in plain clothes—I was at the Bell public-house, at the Water-gate, at Woolwich, about four o'clock in the afternoon—I went up stairs in search of a person, and took hold of the handle of the first door I came to on the right hand side of the stair-case as I went up—it was closed—I observed two persons standing on the landing to the left of that door—I knew them both by sight—neither of them was the prisoner—one of them said something to me—I partly opened the door, and saw a bed to the right—I was in the act of pulling the door to again, when one of the persons made the observation to me, saying he had made a mistake—I then went into the public room directly opposite the bed-room—I merely looked round—I had to close the door after me to do so, to see who was there, as the door opened into the middle of the room—I then came out again—on again coming to the landing there were no persons standing at the bed-room door—the two men I had before seen, appeared to me to be coming into the refreshment-room—in consequence of suspicions I entertained I went and gave infor<lb></lb>mation to the landlord, who went up stairs—one of the men I had seen came down stairs and went out—I then heard the cry of "Thieves," and something else—I could not catch the other word—upon that I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to a constable outside to go into the house while I went after the person who went out—I followed the man I had seen come out, and took him into custody, also two others, but I afterwards found I was mistaken in one, and he was let go at the station-house—he was a respectable man living in Woolwich-upon the person of the man that I saw go down stairs was found a gold watch-chain, key, and some money, but having no reference to this case-after being taken before a Magistrate he was dis<lb></lb>charged, and the other two as well—one was permitted to go on his own recognizance.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Bell public-house at the Water-gate, Woolwich. On Friday afternoon, the 4th of February, about four o'clock, I received information from Goff, in consequence of which I went up stairs to my bed-room door, which is on the right-hand side, and about three steps from the top—it was open—I met the prisoner at the door, coming out of the room—I had locked the door two hours before—the plate was kept there, but the spoons in the knife-case were moved by my wife—when I last saw them safe, they were in the knife-case in the bed-room—there was a chest on a chest of drawers having eight drawers in it—the prisoner was at the door which was half open—I took hold of his collar with each hand, and called "Murder! thieves!"—my wife and servant ran up stairs and took hold of the prisoner—a man's arm then came out of the room—I did not see the man, because the door was on the jar—he came and hit me in the mouth, and tried to knock me down stairs—that was when my wife was coming upstairs before she got up—he hit me on the chin—it did not hurt me (after I had locked the bed-room door I gave the key to my wife) my wife and the servant-maid scuffled with the prisoner—one took hold of one collar, and the other of the other—I went into the bed-room and found all the things pulled off the bedstead on to the floor, bed and all, and all the drawers open but two—I missed my watches, which I had seen in the drawers that day or the day before—we had twenty-two spoons—we found five of them again—a man picked them up on the stairs and brought them to me—I missed two pairs of sugar-tongs, fifteen tea-spoons, a pair of salt<lb></lb>spoons, an old guinea, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and several pieces of old coin, but I do not know what—I produced the five table-spoons before the jus<lb></lb>tice—the moment I got to the room-door and found the door open, I found the prisoner coming out—the drawers were all unlocked but two, and I could not lock them again with the key—they had been picked—these five spoons now produced are five of the spoons which were in my bed-room that afternoon.</p>

I was in the neighbourhood of the Bell public-house when the cry of "Murder" and "Thieves" took place—I ran to the house, and saw the prisoner on the stairs, and Sullivan having hold of him—they were struggling together, about three stairs from the bottom—I saw some spoons on the stairs like these, and I picked up a watch-key on the stairs at the same spot—the prisoner and Sullivan were nearly close to the stairs where I saw the spoons lie—nobody else was as close, except Mrs. Burch and Hayley—I found the things all thrown about in the bed-room.</p>

I was at this house on Friday, the 4th of February, and saw the prisoner coming down stairs, and Mrs. Burch and Hay<lb></lb>ley had hold of him—I heard something fall about half way down the stairs—the prisoner, Hayley, and Mrs. Burch, were about half way down the stairs at the time, at the same spot—there was no person near enough to have dropped the spoons where I saw them, but the prisoner, Mrs. Burch, and Hayley—there was no one on the stairs but myself, the prosecutrix, the prisoner, Hayley, Foay, Portman, and Sullivan—there were three or four other persons on the stairs besides Mrs. Burch and the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wax and tallow-chandler, and live at No. 62, Marylebone-lane. About nine o'clock in the morning of the 30th of October, the prisoner Hermitage came to my shop, with a basket—I am sure he is the person—It contained cakes of wax, cast in plates and dishes—he asked if I bought wax-pieces—I said, "Yes"—I put them into my scale, and asked where he got them—he said he collected bog-wash and kitchen-stuff, and that he bought them of the servants—I said I know better, and asked him who they belonged to—he said they belonged to him—I said I knew better, and asked him again; and he said they belonged to his father—I asked him where his father was—he said he was in High-street, with the horse and cart—I said, "Well, leave the wax; send your father, and I will pay him for it"—he took the basket away, leaving the wax in the scale—I followed him down the lane, and when I got into High-street, I found Cole wheeling a barrow—Hermitage had over<lb></lb>taken him, and was talking to him—I went up, and said. "You brought some wax to my shop just now"—he said to cole, "Where have you got this wax form?"—he said it was his own—I said that would not do—I looked about for a policeman, but could see none—I then said the best way would be for them to walk on the pavement, and I would wheel the barrow to the station-house, with the wax in it—they did so; and I wheeled the barrow till they came to William-street, Tottenham-court-road, and there they ran away—here is the wax which was brought to my shop—I weighed</p>

                  </hi>. I went with Noble to No. 18, William-street, and found the basins, and dishes, and things—I afterwards went to Mr. Child's, Earl's-court, Kensington, between two or three miles from Chiswick—he is a wax-bleacher—I found the bar of the window of his store-room forced—I</p>

               <p>went to No. 14, North-row—I know that Cole had occupied apartments there for some time—Cole's house and Child's are within one hundred yards of cach other—I observed on a wooden fence separating Cole's pre<lb></lb>mises from some unoccupied premises, some wax dropped, and the second fence was broken down.</p>

Cole worked for me about two years ago—I went with offi<lb></lb>cers to Chiswick, and found the wax in pots and pans at the premlses in William-street—here are two lots of wax, one from the barrow, and the other from the basket—I have compared the wax in the pans with the rest, and they correspond; and that found in the house is of the same quality as I have on my premises—my window was broken open—I had seen it a few days before all right.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cole.

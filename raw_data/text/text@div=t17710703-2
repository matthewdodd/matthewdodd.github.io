Mr. Bailey sent for me on the ninth of May; I found the prisoner stopped there; she said she was come to get a duplicate for the gown: I charged her with a constable; she slipped away from the constable at the justices, and they could not find her for two hours.</p>

The next morning Mrs. Davis came to me to enquire for a gown she had lost; I said I had taken one in; I shewed it her. The prisoner came to pay the interest due on the gown on the tenth of June, and to get a duplicate; I stopped her, and sent for Mrs. Davis; she came and owned the gown, and we took the prisoner into custody: she said she could bring twenty people to prove it her gown; that she bought it in Wales.</p>

I have witnesses to prove I caught the gaol distemper at the last sessions, and lost the use of my limbs. A young woman told me there was a gown in pawn, and wanted me to get a duplicate for it in my own name; I went, and they stopped me. I never pawned them, nor have not been in the prosecutor's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the 2nd of June I fell in with the prisoner, on the road at Islington—there was another woman with her—it was between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I had been drinking, but was not drunk—I treated these women with some gin—I went into one public-house with them in Barnsbury-street—very close to the public-house, they pulled me about, got me down on the ground, and got this shirt out of my pocket, and a few shillings in money—I had put it into my left side trowsers pocket—I took it out, and put it into my coat pocket, behind—I lost about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was taken out of my pocket when I was on the ground—they did not keep me down many minutes—I had a bundle in my coat pocket, containing a shirt—they took that away—one woman went away—the prisoner remained with me—I went after the other, because I asked the prisoner where the shirt was, and she said the other had got it—I went to her—she said the prisoner had it—I came back, and found her, and Otto accused her of stealing the shirt, and told the constable—the shirt was found on her—she denied having it to the officer.</p>

A little before twelve o'clock I went to the Rainbow for half a pint of beer, and the prosecutor was treating two women with some gin-and-water—then they had some gin, and then he went out over by the chapel—the two women followed him, and the prisoner took something from his pocket, but I do not know what it was—I got the po<lb></lb>liceman, liceman, and then it was found on her.</p>

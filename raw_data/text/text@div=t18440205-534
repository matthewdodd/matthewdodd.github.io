About seven o'clock on the evening of the 17th of Jan., I was on duty in plain clothes, in Oxford-street, with Sergeant Parker, and near the Circus saw both the prisoners, who I had seen a few evenings before—they were standing near a cart which had a basket of clothes in it, which they appeared to be watching—the cart went away—the prisoners went down Oxford-street—I followed, and kept them in sight—they overtook a man drawing a truck with several boxes and trunks in it—Hughes went into the road, and looked into the truck—the man turned down Orchard-street, and the prisoners followed—Payne went up to the man drawing the truck, and walked by his side some distance—when they got into the dark part of Portman-square, which is the east side near the en<lb></lb>closure, Hughes went behind the truck and endeavoured to get out one of</p>

               <p>the boxes, but did not succeed—they followed the man into the New-road and then returned into Oxford-street, loitered about some time, and then followed another cart down Oxford-street and Edgware-road—that was not the prosecutor's cart—they still kept in company—the prosecutor's cart was standing opposite a green-grocer's in the Edgware-road—they passed it, turned back, and came and stood near the cart a minute or so—they then walked a little distance—Hughes went back to the cart, took the horse-cloth, and walked away towards Payne, who was waiting twenty or thirty yards distant—he was in sight—I stopped Hughes with the cloth on his arm, and asked what he was going to do with it—he said he took it for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, to throw at his friend—Payne walked away, and was apprehended by Parker—Parker had not kept in my company the whole time—I lost him for about an hour—Payne appeared to be looking out at the time Hughes took the cloth.</p>

I was out with Whicher, and saw the two prisoners—we watched them for three hours, and about ten o'clock I saw Hughes in the custody of Whicher—Payne was about thirty yards off—I went after him—he asked what I took him for—I said, for stealing a coat or something from a cart, and he must come with me, we had got his friend—he said, "I have no friend; I know nothing about it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to George Revell, who occupies a house in the parish of St. Mary, Newington, in Surrey. On the 25th of August, a few minutes before twelve o'clock in the day, I saw both the prisoners standing at the window for two or three minutes together—Hamilton put his thumb down to the glass, cracked it, pushed the piece in, and took out two pieces of lawn—Knight was standing within two or three feet of him at the time—when I first saw them they were together—when Hamilton took the lawn they walked away different ways—I imme<lb></lb>diately ran out at the private door, and caught Hamilton—I bought him into the house—he was searched by a policeman, who found the two pieces of lawn on him which I had seen taken out of the window—the policeman took Knight—I am sure of their persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Blackman-street about twelve o'clock, and saw Hamilton, Knight, and another one cross from Suffolk-street to the end of Trinity-street—I instantly stood still, and had scarcely done so, when all on a sudden, a disturbance took place—they were going towards the prosecutor's shop window then—they stood at the window a minute or two—I crossed over, and saw Hamilton in the custody of the two witnesses—I said, "Hold him fast, I will go after the other"—I went after Knight, who was walking away, and took him—he merely said, "What do you want with me?"</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into this gentleman's shop last Saturday evening; my husband is on board of a man of war, and his brother allows me a small sum, so far as his pocket will allow; I had pledged all my clothes; I went to that shop to buy a gown, and the piece that I pitched upon was only six yards and a quarter; I told him there was not enough; he told me there was; I told him I did not wish to have less than seven yards; he rather urged me on the business; I immediately said, there was not sufficient; I bought a yard and a half for the child, and paid 2 s. 7 d 1/2. I was coming out of the shop, and he said, come back, and have that print; I told him, whenever I bought a piece of print I liked to have half a yard over to mend it; he then said I had robbed him; I told him I had not; he sent his man to get a constable; I told him he had no right to detain me; I had left my children in the street; the beadle came and took me to St. Martin's watch-house; I had a one-pound bill in my pocket; I declare to you all that I never took that piece of cotton; I did not see it; he might as well say it was forty yards as what he has.</p>

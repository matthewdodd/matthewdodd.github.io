                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-inspector. At a quarter before four o'clock, in the morning of the 19th of September, I saw a boat rowing away from some eel vessels, which were lying off Billingsgate—I gave chase and captured the two prisoners in the boat, at the opposite side of the water—in the bottom of the boat were 200lbs. of live eels, and by the side of the boat was this part of a basket, which is used to fasten the eels in with—Fleming was rowing, and May was standing up shoving—there was a dredge in the boat, but it had no rope to it—they said a man gave them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to row the eels to Gravesend,. and not to give them to any one till he came—they were then about thirty miles from Gravesend.</p>

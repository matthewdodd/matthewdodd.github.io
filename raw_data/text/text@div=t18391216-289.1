                  </hi>. I am a stay-maker, and live in St. Martin's-court. On Friday night, the 6th of December, about seven o'clock, I was sitting in my parlour, and noticed some stays moving which were tied to a nail just within the shop-door—I went to the door, and missed a pair—I saw the prisoner a few yards from the shop, and went after him—he had the stays in front of him, which he threw down, and ran some distance—I pursued, caught him, and brought him back—he said, if I would let him go he would never do it any more—the stays were brought to me by a man who picked them up—these are them (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my custody with these stays—in going to the station-house he said the prosecutor did not find the stays on him, he had thrown them down—I asked what he could have done with the stays—he said he could have sold them if he had got off.</p>

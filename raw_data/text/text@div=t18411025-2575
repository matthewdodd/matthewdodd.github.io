On the morning of the 29th of September, about twenty minutes to three o'clock, I heard a scuffle in Church-street, St. Giles's, and saw the prisoner running—I asked what he was running for—he said, "Oh, nothing particular, I am going home"—I asked what he had under his arm—he said it was his own property—it proved to be a pair of boots and a piece of calico in a bag—I took him to the watch-house—I found a lucifer box and other articles on him.</p>

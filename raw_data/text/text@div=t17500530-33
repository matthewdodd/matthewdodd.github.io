My shop, which joins to my dwelling-house, was broke open on the 7th of May at night, and from thence were taken out 23 rabbits, which were in the shop when I shut it up at a little after ten o'clock; the door I found open, some nails were wrench'd out, and the bolt undone by violence. The next day I had some intelligence of a woman in the neighbourhood, who had some rabbits to sell; which intelligence was brought me by Mr. Lee, who also told me that I might meet with her at the Seven Stars in Rosemary-lane.

Then I watched the boy, and followed him to Well-close-square, and, giving him a tap on the back, ask'd him what he had got there; he turn'd about, and said, what's that to you. I still follow'd him till he came to the Old Seven-Stars in Rosemary-lane, when I told him, if he would come in, I would give him some drink. Accordingly he came in, and put his bag down. I then ask'd him what he had there; he said they were rabbits. I ask'd him where he had them, and he told me from home. I desired to see them, and, upon looking, found them to be a buck, a doe, and six young ones. So I gave the landlord and a soldier charge of the boy, till I fetch'd the prosecutor, who lived near me, and who, I heard, had lost some.</p>

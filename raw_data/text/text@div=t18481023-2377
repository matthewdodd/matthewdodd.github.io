I am in partnership with my brother, John Wood—we are carpet, blanket, and woollen-warehousemen, in Watling-street—Frederick Young was our carman for a year and a half—it was his duty to take out parcels for delivery—he was always about in the warehouse, with the other porters, waiting for orders—in consequence of information, I went, on 18th Oct., to his house—I there found a piece of drugget, a rug, sheets, and a carpet—this drugget was tacked on each side, as they are in our warehouse—I had seen the pattern in our warehouse—I know the rug; I believe it was made expressly for us.</p>

A.On the 16th of June; I did not know of her pawning these things -there were two table-cloths which I found at the pawnbroker's, on which I had received 4s. 6d., but I have not charged her with stealing them; the two table-cloths which are down are two common kitchen ones - I certainly did offer to repay her the 4s. 6d. if I got my property; I have another lodger in the house, an elderly gentleman, who has been with me twelve months - I never knew of her pawning these articles; I missed them, and spoke to her about them: no such word ever escaped my lips as that I did not care what things were pawned for the temporary use of my lodgers, so long as they were returned when they left the lodgings - I will swear I had not sold these sheets for 18s., nor any of these articles: I had not agreed to receive payment from her by instalments, except for those cloths on which I received the 4s. 6d.</p>

               <p>MRS. SIMPSON. These are my husband's; this gauze alone is of very little value, but it belonged to a dress, and was taken out and cut into a tippet - I heard her tell Walton so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What is the value of this bit of gauze? A. Not much; the dress would be worth 2l. - I do not know whether the officer was there when Bright said she cut it up to make a tippet; I think he was gone up stairs - she told me she took it out of the drawing-room; I was not asked before the Magistrate what the prisoner said; Bright confessed that she had taken a shawl and other things - I know this pink dress; I have the dress-maker here who made the two dresses into one; it is different from any other in London; the gauze has no mark upon it -Bright has been in our service for about two months; I had a good character with her.</p>

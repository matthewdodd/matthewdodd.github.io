                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the City. I was walking along Whitechapel-road on Sunday night, the 28th of Sept, and felt a sudden thrust at my side—I turned, and my hand came in contact with the prisoner, and my pocket-book fell on the ground at his feet—no one could have dropped it but him—no one was near—I said, "You have picked my pocket"—I picked up the book, and endeavoured to seize him—he made his escape, running down Whitechapel-road—he turned up a yard, and when he had got some distance he fell—a policeman came, and we secured him—he made great resistance and escaped, but was taken ultimately, and conveyed to the station—I am sure no one could have taken my pocket-book but him—it could not have fallen from my pocket—it was a deep inside pocket—as we were going to the station he made a desperate kick at me, and hurt my leg very much.</p>

I was on duty on my beat on the evening of the 28th of Sept.—I heard a cry of "Police!" and "Stop thief!"—I hurried to the place, and saw the prisoner turn down George-yard, running, followed by the prosecutor—the prisoner fell, or threw him<lb></lb>self down, and I took him—he resisted very much, and would not walk—I dragged him to the end of George-yard, and got a person to help him up—he made great resistance.</p>

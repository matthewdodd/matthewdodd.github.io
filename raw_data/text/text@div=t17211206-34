The Prosecutor depos'd, that going to the Red Cow in Turnbul street to ask for a Lodging, he saw the prisoner there a drinking. That the prisoner told him he could let him have a Lodging in his House - That he went home with the prisoner, who shew'd him a Room, where he lay that Night, but next Morning miss'd his Rings and Buckles; and asking the prisoner if he knew any thing of'em, he call'd him Son of a Bitch, and turn'd him out of Doors. He charged a Constable with the prisoner, who found the Buckles in the Lining of his Breeches; and then he told the Prosecutor he knew but of one Ring, and his Wife should give him that. The prisoner in his Defence said, that not going to Bed that Night, he came early to his Wife's Room, where he found the Prosecutor in Bed with his Wife; and asking him what he did there, the Prosecutor said, I have satisfied your Wife for what I have done; that afterwards his Wife shew'd him the Buckles, and told him the Prosecutor gave `em to her. <rs id="t17211206-34-verdict174" type="verdictDescription">

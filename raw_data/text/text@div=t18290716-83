            . My father works at a chemist's. I was on the Fulham stage, and saw the prisoner get up and hand behind the coach at Hyde-park-corner; he came on for some distance, then got down, and went to another young man - I spoke to my sister, then got down, and secured the prisoner; he threw the purse over the rails at Lord Coventry's - we took him to the watch-house, and then I came back, and saw the purse where I had seen him throw it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me move my hands at all? A. No, I did not; a person came to you, and you got down, crossed towards Lord Coventry's rails, and threw it over the rails - I do not know what pocket you took it from.</p>

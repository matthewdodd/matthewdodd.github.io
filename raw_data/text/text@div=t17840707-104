               <p>Are you very sure you unbolted the back door, that it was not open? - Yes, and I saw the yard door swing, then I looked round, it was rather dark, I did not observe the window at first, but when I looked round again I saw part of the window was gone off the ground floor.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by the window being gone? - It is a small sash, it was taken out and gone.</p>
               <p>Are there any window shutters? - No.</p>

I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, (The things deposed to.) I saw them all the night before, I fastened the window myself at nine with a large nail, it has no screw, and I locked the yard door with a padlock, I was the last that went to bed just before twelve.</p>

               <p>How far is that from the court where the prosecutor's house is? - I suppose it is a quarter of a mile; we were standing together and this prisoner came by me, I was standing with my back towards him, he crossed up St. Martin's and went into Newport-street.</p>
               <p>Which way did he come? - Down Long Acre, I did not observe him till he was crossed into Newport-street, as soon as I saw him, I saw a bundle in his hand and another under his arm, I went and seized him, and my comrade came to my assistance, I asked him how he came by the bundle, and he spoke in broken English, and said his mistress gave it him to carry into the country to iron; I thought it was a bad story, we took the bundle from him and took him to the watch-house; and when he came there I found two linen handkerchiefs in his pocket, the constable put the things by; at ten o'clock, they were taken to the magistrates, there they were opened, and they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Are you sure to the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

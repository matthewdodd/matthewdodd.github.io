            , who works in the gas-works, went with me on the evening of Monday week, the 12th of September, about twelve o'clock, I had missed my clock from my room that day - my son was with me, and directed me to the house - the door was open, and Watts was at home - I said "Ma'am, do you know this boy?" she denied knowing him - I asked her son, who was in the room, if he knew him - he said he did - I said to Watts you must know my boy, as he has been here selling a clock this afternoon - she said she did not know him. Welsh said, "Mistress, here's the boy's father who owns the clock: we don't want to hurt you nor the boy; all we want is the clock; and here is the three shillings for you which you gave for it." She said to my son, "You bad boy, you are not trusty, to come into my house after you have robbed your father; you told me you had picked up the clock over the water, on a gentleman's steps; did you not say so?" - he said he did. Welsh then said, "Mistress, give us the clock, we don't want to hurt you." She then asked if I would take payment for it till the next morning, and she would return it, as it was not then in the house, and asked if thirty shillings would do till she sent the clock home. The boy had said before, in her presence, that she had given him three shillings for it. I said I would not leave the house till I got the clock, or she sent for an officer to take me up. She then whispered to her own boy, and he said would not two pounds do till I got the clock back again. I said I would take no money; I wanted nothing but the clock. She then told the girl to bring a pen and ink for me to write the number of my house, and she would send the clock home next day. She then laid down sixpence for a pot of beer to treat us. My wife then came, and brought the watchman to take my boy and her. She said to my wife, "Go home, woman; and your clock is at home before you." I told her to go home, as we had made it up, and I expected to have the clock every moment. As we were going out she came and took hold of my arm, and said she was a lone woman, and begged me not to hurt her, and she would send it home the next morning. She whispered to Welsh to make it up with me - she then went away, and I thought she was going to fetch the clock. I remained there till after eleven o'clock, when my wife and another woman came to call me, but the prisoner did not return. Her boy asked leave to go out to look for her, and he did not return. The next morning my wife went to see if she could get the clock - the prisoner said she knew nothing about it - she did not buy it. She was taken into custody. I have never seen the clock since.</p>

I saw him at the door, but my mother did not turn him out - I will swear that - it was the boy's uncle who sent for the porter - it was my mother's 6 d. which she put upon the table to pay for some cheese for supper; my mother did not say to them, that if 2 l. would do, she would give it them. Sullivan said he would make it up for 5 l. My mother did not offer a sovereign and 10 s., she had not a sovereign about her. I heard of the man kissing my mother, and wanting to sleep with her, and I was quite shocked at it. I do not know what my mother usually buys. I was at home at the time.

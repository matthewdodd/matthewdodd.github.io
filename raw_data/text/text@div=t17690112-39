I put my hand in and missed my handkerchief. He said, if I would go back, he would shew me the person that picked my pocket. He took me down to near the church, in the Poultry; not seeing the person, we were returning towards the Mansion-House. He then shewed me the prisoner, and said, That was the lad; I went and took hold of the prisoner. He took my handkerchief out, and attempted to throw it on the ground. I seized it.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Pain, in Bow-Lane, Cheapside. I was going to the Royal Exchange. I saw the boy at the bar follow the prosecutor. Just at the corner of Lombard-Street, the prisoner took a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket. I went across the way, and asked the gentleman if he had not lost his handkerchief; he put his hand into his pocket, and said, he had; then I said, Go along with me and I will shew you the person that took it. We went back, and up the Poultry, and found the prisoner as we were coming back. I said, That was he. The prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket, in order to throw it down, and the gentleman secured it and the prisoner too. There was another boy in company with him. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)</p>

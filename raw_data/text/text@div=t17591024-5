I was acquainted by Mr Brown my partner in a building, that a house belonging to me and Mr Richardson, as assignees of one Lee a bankrupt, was stripped of some lead, and he had a suspicion of Barber, and his labourer one Ellis. Mr Brown had examined Ellis, we took up Ellis first, he confessed, that he and Barber had taken it away. Then we took up Barber, and before the Justice they were there together. Ellis confessed he and Barber took it and carried the lead at five turns to the house of Speight. Ellis went three times and Barber twice. Barber contradicted that, and said, no Tom, I went but once, and that was with a little bit that I carried in my apron. Mr Speight was fetched there. He owned he had bought lead of them, but he contradicted Ellis as to the point of time of the night. I can assert the quantity is upwards of three hundred weight by the quantity that is missing. Speight did not own what quantity he had brought, but that he had bought lead of them two or three times. We got a search-warrant and searched Speight's house, (he is a Shoemaker and keeps an old iron shop) we found no lead there, we have not found any since.</p>
               <p>Q. from Barber. Did you ever suspect me in any thing of this sort?</p>
               <p>Hulbert. I never knew him 'till he came to work at this building. At first I thought him a diligent man, but latterly I did not think him so, by his behaviour to his master.</p>

            . Barber and I were at work at Knightsbridge at a building. I carried some lead from there to Westminster for the owner. Barber asked me, why I did not save a little for myself, and told me where I might sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of lead being taken away from Mr Hulbert's house.</p>
               <p>Ellis. Yes, that was in Tyburn-Road: Barber said, the man that owned the house was broke and run away. This is about six weeks ago. We went there: he watched below while I went above. I went and took away the middle gutter and some other lead. When I threw it down he cut it in small parcels with a brick-axe. After we carried it to Speight's house, we got there I believe between ten and eleven at night, he lives in either Bird or James-street, by Grosvenor's-square: we made five turns of it, I carried three, and Barber two; Speight was at home, (we had sold him some small quantities before) he paid Barber that night two half crowns in part of pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lead weighed ?</p>
               <p>Ellis. I cannot tell the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What per hundred was you to have for it?</p>
               <p>Ellis. They gave us a penny a pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Ellis. No: the first parcel came to about four shillings and six-pence, the whole of the three last turns came to five shillings and some odd half-pence. I was taken up about three weeks after, and was before the Justice with the two prisoners. There I declared the truth, though I was not examined so regular as I am here. The prisoner Barber said there, that he carried a piece of lead in his apron, and Speight said, he had bought lead of us, but not that came to so much money as I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Barber. He owned before Justice Welch that I was at work at the time he took away the lead ?</p>
               <p>Ellis. That was at another time; that was with regard to taking two troughs off another house.</p>
               <p>Speight. When I was before the Justice, Ellis did not know me.</p>
               <p>Ellis. I knew him as soon as he came in at the street-door.</p>
               <p>Q. from Speight. Did you sell it to me or my wife?</p>
               <p>Ellis. He was present, and he gave Barber two half-crowns in part of pay that night, and he paid me four shillings the first turn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money?</p>
               <p>Ellis. Barber kept the two half-crown pieces, and I the other.</p>

            . I have known Speight about twenty years: he has lived in my house six years, in James-street Grosvenor-square; he is a Shoemaker, and his wife keeps a broker's shop, sells old iron, and the like. I have ask'd him the price of things, he has always call'd his wife. I don't think he attends that business. I know he has been gone 6 or 7 months, but I took no notice of his going or coming. His wife paid me at that time. I believe he returned about a week before he was taken up: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240006"></xptr> know it was a very short time; it could not be weeks but days.</p>

            . I had an action out against Speight on Nov. 6. 1758. I employ'd an officer; he absconded. I renewed the writ several times, but could not take him. I went to his house in August last, in James-Street, Grosvenor-Square, and ask'd his wife if he was at home? she said he was not. I desired her to tell him to come home, and I would make up matters with him, and I would have no officers to molest him. He came down about a fortnight after to me in St. Martin's Lane. We made up matters.</p>

               <p>Priscilla Stanley. I have known him above 20 years. He came to me about Christmas last, and told me, he was afraid of being arrested; I let him be at my house about a fortnight, before he went to the other lodging. I believe he is a very honest man. I have laid at his house since, and he has not been at home.</p>

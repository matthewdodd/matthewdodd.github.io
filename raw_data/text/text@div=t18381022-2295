                  </hi>. My husband's name is John Thompson—we live at Ramsay, in the Isle of Man. On the 21st of September I came by the Railway-train from Birmingham to London—I arrived at Euston-square about nine o'clock in the evening—I was looking for my luggage, and the</p>

               <p>male prisoner came up to me—he attracted my attention to the first car<lb></lb>riage, and told me that my luggage was there—I told him I thought it was not—he was quite a stranger to me—I had seen him in Birmingham—I had a pocket-book in my right-hand pocket—it contained a £5 note and three sovereigns—I felt it safe while the prisoner was speaking to me—my pocket-hole is in the centre behind—he stood on my left-hand side quite close—I lifted my hand to adjust my shawl, and felt a pressure on my right hip—I then put my hand down, and missed my pocket-book—the prisoner was still standing close by me—I turned round and seized him, and told him he had robbed me of my pocket-book—he said he had not—there were several ladies and gentlemen standing, but not near enough to touch me—I am quite positive of that—none of them had been so near as the prisoner—I called for the policeman—the female prisoner then came up, and said she could take me to the gentleman who had robbed me of my pocket-book, as she saw him do it—I had not at that time said anything about losing a pocket-book except to the male prisoner only—I told the policeman that I had been robbed of my pocket-book, and she must have heard it—I said that the man I had in charge I was confident was the who had robbed me of my pocket-book—Fisher passed very close by the male prisoner, and I felt confident she had received the book—she then mixed with the crowd—a policeman came and took the man, and ordered another officer to look after the female—I pointed out the female prisoner to the officer—the pocket-book was afterwards shown to me by the officer—it was the one I had lost.</p>

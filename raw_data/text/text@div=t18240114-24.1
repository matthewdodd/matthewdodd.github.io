On the 30th of December, about five o'clock, I was called down, and missed part of a chest of tea from my warehouse, which I had seen safe two minutes before. I pursued towards Fenchurch-street, and overtook two persons lifting it on the prisoner's head, in Lime-street, and as I pursued, he threw it back at me, but it did not hit me - I fell over it - continued to pursue, and kept him in sight till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COOK. Q. How do you know it was your's. - A. It had the Company's mark on it, and was numbered 1617. They have but one of each number in a sale - they have four sales every year; but there is a mark of the sale as well. I overtook him about forty yards from the house. A little boy directed me after him.</p>

            . I am a tailor. I was at the top of Philpot-lane, talking to a person, and saw three young men cross the road with a chest of tea, about fourteen yards from Mr. Shillcock's, who came out after them immediately. They were running, and had a cord under it, one holding each end of it, to support the chest. I was behind the prisoner all the way, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped. I was close to the chest when it fell. He ran away, and I after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw three persons. - A. Yes; one in front, and one on each side - the two put it on the prisoner's shoulder, and ran away - there was nobody to follow them.</p>

            . I keep a public-house at St. Mary Axe. I was going down Lime-street towards Fenchurch-street, and saw the prisoner running with the tea chest, he threw it down. I told Mr. Shillcock to follow him, while I took care of the chest. A person came up, and said he was an Excise officer - that it was smuggled, and he should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140015"></xptr>seize it. I said he could not, and as soon as the prisoner was brought back, he went off.</p>

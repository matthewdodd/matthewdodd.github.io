               <p>Do you remember what day it was? - I think it was on Wednesday, the 2d of November, it was when Trott was there, Till was there when I came in, and when Mrs. Handland came in.</p>
               <p>Was Till near her? - He was fast asleep when I first went in, to appearance; then he got up some time after, I cannot be accountable for the time, then he went to the corner of the tap-room and sat down, and in she came, and said she had been robbed, she was very near Till at that time; I did not hear her make any charge against him.</p>
               <p>Should you have heard her make any charge against him if she had? - I certainly must, but I heard her make no charge against him, I came in about six; Till was in when I came there, and I did not miss him out of the house while I staid, which was till a quarter past ten or more; Till was there all the time to the best of my knowledge, I certainly must have missed the man if he had been absent at any time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. Did he go out for a few minutes? - To the best of my knowledge I swear that he did not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively he did not? - I cannot be accountable for it particularly.</p>
               <p>Then he might to the best of your knowledge? - If he had been in my company I should have missed him, I did not see him go out, certainly I must have seen him if he had gone out.</p>
               <p>Court. You swear to the best of your knowledge, which is very different to the swearing to the fact; now Sir, I wish to know of you, whether you can swear positively that he did not go out; answer me, yes or no? - To the best of my knowledge he did not; I will swear that he did not go out no further than where I sat on the seat; I never went out, and believe he did not, if he had gone out I must have observed him, I left him in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He was awake when Mrs. Handland called out a robbery? - He was sitting in the corner, he might be asleep, he was a yard or two from Mrs. Handland, I remember her very well saying she had been robbed, but I do not remember the words, she looked round the tap-room when she said so, I believe, but I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Court. If she said she had been robbed by a friend, and not by an enemy, must you have heard it? - I think I should, but I do not recollect it particularly, I was in a box with a different company.</p>

               <p>Then during all the time you were looking at Meredith, Till might have gone out of the tap-room? - I think if he had gone out, I must have seen it, he was under the jack; he was by me all the time.</p>
               <p>Might not he go out, and you not have seen him? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Now you have sworn, and you are to speak to the utmost of your knowledge, do you think he could have gone out without your observing him? - No, Sir, upon my soul I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if that is the case, you can swear positively he did not go out? - I am sure he could not well go out, because he was facing of me.</p>
               <p>You may swear you never saw him go out, and will you swear he did not go out? - I cannot go to say that.</p>
               <p>You did not observe that he did not go out, but you will not positively swear that he did not? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. What colour was it? - I cannot tell directly, it was a very pretty pattern.</p>
               <p>Was it a figured pattern? - There was no particular pattern that I took notice of, it was a new bit of cotton.</p>
               <p>Let me look at the indictment against Till, is there any cotton gown in that? - There are three linen gowns in it, but no cotton gown.</p>

She said she had lost several things, and she told me if I would go with her, she would give me two guineas, and if the man was convicted, there would be forty pounds, twenty pounds for her, and twenty pounds for me; I told her I would not be guilty of any thing of the kind, and she d - nd my eyes, and said, I robbed her, then the followed me down into Holborn, and she said, you did not rob me I know, and she said, come your way with me, and she wanted me to get drunk, she called for a pot of hot and paid fourteen pence of it; and she called to a man, and said, I want a warrant for a man that robbed me, I caught him robbing me; so when I heard her say that, I thought I would see the end of this, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220198"></xptr> would go over with her, she went across the way from the

            , and she went into the office, and said, I want a warrant, says the man for what; says she, a man has robbed me, and she made such a blundering story, that they would not grant her a warrant, so says the man, if you will give me half a crown, I will go with you.</p>
               <p>Did she say who had robbed her at that time? - No, I cannot say she did, she only said a man asked for half a crown, and he would go with her, she would not give it him, but she told him, she was a woman of great spirit, and if he did her business, she would pay him well, he said he wanted nothing but half a crown, I have known Mr. Till twelve months, I have known her sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see this man carry a bundle, as she wanted you to swear? - I did not, I told her it was false, and I would be hanged before I would do it, she told me she had lost a yellow gown at that time, and that if I would be good to her, I should never want bread.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. My Lord, I submit this evidence is not relative to the present charge, it is not specified in the indictment, was this to be the case, any sort of evidence might be produced, as it may subject the the prisoner to another indictment, that of subornation of perjury, I never remember any such evidence admitted, the case is, whether she swore falsly before the Court, when she swore she saw this man with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Court. The question here is, not whether this woman has sworn false, but whether she has sworn corruptly, and this is certainly evidence to be received to shew the intention of the party, and it is a circumstance to be left to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. Pray madam, who are you? - I am a Jewess.</p>
               <p>That I know, where do you live? - No. 6, Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>What do you deal in? - Old clothes.</p>
               <p>How many times have you been an evidence in this Court? - Never but once, about some shoes I bought of a neighbour.</p>
               <p>You was suspected of buying them knowing them to have been stolen? - No, Sir, I came up as an evidence.</p>
               <p>When was it you say you told Till of this? - The very day I knew of it.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was that? - It was the Friday after the Wednesday that she told me she had been robbed.</p>
               <p>How came you not been here, upon Till's trial? - He never sent for me or else I should have come.</p>
               <p>Who was present at that time? - There were a good many people at once.</p>
               <p>Who was present?</p>
               <p>Russell. I was present for one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask that witness Cohan, how long it is since her husband was hanged? - I am a married woman, my husband is alive now, he has not lived with me these seven years.</p>
               <p>Was ever any man hanged that passed as your husband? - I never lived with no man but my husband, I know better than that.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What was the name of that man that was hanged? - She had two children by him at the birth.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of that? - I know of no man in the world that was hanged, belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Do you know any man that was hanged for stealing a hat? - No, my Lord, I do not, I never knew a man that was charged with stealing of hats in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear of any such charge of any man of your acquaintance? - No.</p>
               <p>- BLACKETER sworn.</p>
               <p>I took a man from Litchfield-street office; he was tried and convicted; I have seen this woman come to Newgate to see him, but I do not know there was any connection.</p>
               <p>Cohan. My Lord, I knew a man that was taken up for robbing a baker's shop in Rupert-street, and this was the man I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220199"></xptr> to see, but I never knew a man about a hat.</p>
               <p>Was that man convicted? - Yes, he was convicted, and died for it.</p>
               <p>Now, I asked you if you knew any man that was tried and convicted here, and you said, no? - That was about a hat; you would not have me say anything that is not right; this was for a suit of clothes; he was no more my husband than any other man that is here; I knew that man's mother, she nursed me; I have been parted from my husband these seven years, I defy the world to say anything against me.</p>

               <p>Was you examined at the last trial of Till? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there ever any application made to you to give evidence against Till? - Not before she brought a summons to me.</p>

               <p>Who brought that? - Mrs. Handland.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and Mrs. Handland about that summons? - It was on the night that Till was to go to Justice Blackborow in the morning, and she told me to come and breakfast with her the next morning, which I did, and she sent me out for some liquor, and I drank part of it, and I went with her to Saffron-hill, to carry some rags to sell, and then we had another quartern of gin; and then we went to the Sun at Clerkenwell, and there we had another quartern of gin; and then Mr. Chambers came in to us, and then we had another quartern of gin; and then Mr. Chambers asked me, if I knew what I was come upon? I told him, no; says he, do you know you are come to take an oath? I said, no; he said, you are, and you must stand to it; the prisoner was by, and she went to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Had she and you, before you went to Chambers's, had any conversation about what you were to do? - All that was, she told me, I think, as far as I know, I cannot tell what I did, nor what I said then, she never told me what I was to do, before I got down the steps to go in; she then told me, now, says she, you must say that you saw this

               <p>This time, were you sober, or in liquor? - I was in liquor.</p>

               <p>Where were you the day the robbery was committed? - I was at home at work.</p>
               <p>Did you see anything of what she desired you to say you saw? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, upon your oath, that what you said at the Justices was not true? - I did not know, but as I was told the next day.</p>
               <p>Did not you say here, upon the trial of Till, that what you said before the Justice was not true? - It was not true, that I know of; I was this day the robbery was committed at my own work in the shop, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Did you beg pardon of the Court for what you had done? - I did.</p>
               <p>Should you, of your own account, have gone before the Justice, if this woman had not desired you? - No, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Should you have gone without a summons to the Justice? - No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Handland by when you asked pardon of the Court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she attempt to contradict you then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220200"></xptr> before the Court? - I do not recollect now.</p>
               <p>Did she, at the time you asked pardon of the Court for what you said before the Justice, attempt to contradict you? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. Did this lady take you before the Grand Jury to find the bill against Till? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe you have been tried for something? - I have been tried, but not for any thing out of the way; I was tried for my wages.</p>
               <p>Was not you tried for a fraud? - They made a fraud of it.</p>
               <p>I believe you was acquitted through defect of evidence? - I do not know how it was, but I know very well I did not mean to make it a defraud, I meant for the gentleman to have the money, if I had thought on it.</p>
               <p>So, now you come here to swear that what you have sworn before the Justice, was false? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was very drunk, you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came the Justice to take your evidence? - I do not know; I do not know now what I said, any further than I was told the next morning.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the Justice's clerk was here on the last trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he say you was drunk or sober, when you was before the Justice? - He swore I was sober.</p>

My shop is in Lisle-street, Leicester-square; the prisoner was in my service. I had a pair of diamond ear-ring drops which were delivered to Miss Roe, at Mr. Pearman's, Gower-street; the price was 87 l., but they were rather too large for her. I agreed to make her a smaller pair, and she was to wear these, until I could make the others. The prisoner knew all this; he told me afterwards that he had seen her, and she liked them very well and would keep them till about Christmas, by that time, I was to make a smaller pair; he afterwards told me she would keep them, but towards Christmas, I received a letter from Mrs. Ross, the friend of Miss Roe, to wait on her; I told the prisoner the conversation I had with her. Miss Ross said,</p>
               <p>"Have you done the ear-rings," I said, I understood Miss Roe, liked the large ones, so much that she will keep them, she said,</p>
               <p>"I understand you have had them back sometime; I said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! No, that cannot be, and as a proof of it, I will bring you my clerk;" I took him to Mrs. Ross, he told her, that Miss Roe, had told him that she meant to keep the large ear-rings, having a friend who would buy them. I afterwards received a letter from Miss Roe, which I shewed the prisoner, he looked it over, and immediately said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to say, I have them, circumstances have obliged me to make away with them for 25 l.;" he shewed me a card with Mr. Dobrees name on it, saying that he should have some money in a few days, and would get them; he left, and I saw him in Hart-street, Covent-garden, on the 24th of December; he then said, he was very sorry, but he should have 300 l. or 400 l in a few days, and they should be forthcoming. I received a letter from him, on the 28th of December, and had him apprehended on the Sunday following, and after that received another letter from him. I never empowered him to receive the diamonds from Miss Roe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe in July you met me, and requested me to make up your books - A. Yes; he appeared distressed and I took him into my service; my circumstances became involved, in consequence of being robbed of 1600 l., and I desired him to make up my books. I agreed to give him 1 l. a week, till I could get him a better situation, I interested myself for him, and had got him one, at one hundred and thirty guineas a year, just as I discovered this robbery; I said to him repeatedly that it was odd, I did not hear about the ear-rings, and he always said,</p>
               <p>"She will keep them, or if she does not, she knowes a lady who will buy them."</p>
               <p>The following letters alluded to in the evidence were read, one dated,</p>
               <p>"Cheltenham, the 10th of December," from Miss Roe, expressing her surprise at hearing from Mrs. Ross, respecting her being possessed of the drops, and stating that she had returned them to the prosecutor's man, also the two following from the prisoner to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>"My good Sir, From the same principal which operates on the mind of any man, who may have transgressed on the rules of propriety, has rendered me heart broken. I hope in a few days to see a friend, who will be productive of a mutual adjustment of our differences. In the mean time, I hope you will excuse my attending upon you.</p>

               <p>J. MACKIE.</p>
               <p>"Sir, From the manner in which you are proceeding against me, it will be requisite in my defence to have recourse to such observations as will produce very unpleasent consequences, which you will not have me to blame for, I can only say it might have been otherwise, without any prejudice to either."</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have I not frequently pawned diamonds with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was placed in a very critical situation by the prosecutors trusting the business to my care - he found my services useful to him in his embarrasments. He has frequently desired me to do the best I could to carry on the business in his absence, and I have pawned goods to pay the workmen on Saturdays, and when the ear-rings were pawned part of the money was appropriated to his use. There was an account between us, and if the ear-rings were brought into the account there would be little difference between us. There was no intention ultimately to injure him.</p>

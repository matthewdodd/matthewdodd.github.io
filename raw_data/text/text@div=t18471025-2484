Hicks"—he said nothing when he wrote it—he gave it to me, and said I might either pay it away, or he would give me the money next day—he did not come next day—I sent my wife with a message—she returned with the check—in consequence of that I went to the prisoner's lodging—I was his baker—I did not find him till the Thurs<lb></lb>day following—I then told him there were no effects to the check, and I must give him into custody—he said I did he was a ruined man, but he could not be worse off than what he was, it would be a charity to do it—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi> I am an army agent at 35, King-street, Westminster—I lived at 29, Parliament-street, at Messrs. Vacher and Sons, many years, and left three years ago—I had chambers there—I never saw the prisoner but twice before—I knew his father very well—he died three weeks ago—I kept his accounts for many years—his name was Raymond Hicks—he was as officer in the army, and I received his pay as an agent—I never knew of the prisoner's having an uncle—I had an account of the father in Sept.—I had no instructions to pay anything to the account of C. Hicks or J. H. Hicks—I do not know whose writing this check is, it is not the prisoner's father's—in the spring of this year the prisoner called on me to inquire after his father's health—I think that was the first time I saw him—I do not think I have ever paid any money to him on his father's account—this check was offered to me, and I returned it.</p>

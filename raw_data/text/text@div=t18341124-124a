                  </hi>. I am a police-constable. On the 17th of November, at twenty minutes past six o'clock in the morning, I was on duty, and saw the two prisoners come down Union-court, Orchard-street, Westminster—I saw Selsby had Elliot's clothes on—in about five minutes, Elliott came down with a great-coat on his arm, and a different hat on from any I had seen him wear before—he went into No. 12, and attempted to go up stairs, but instead of that he was going into the yard—I told him then was some<lb></lb>thing wrong, and he threw the coat into No. 11—I took him, and got this coat—he said he picked it up in Scotland-yard—I took him to the station-house, and there heard that the Swan tap had been broken open—I went back to the house in Union-court, and Selsby came back to the house—I took him—he said he knew it was wrong, and I should soon bear where it came from—there was a girl in bed, and he handed a pair of sugar-tongs to her—I asked what it was, and she gave me these tongs—I found in the</p>

                  </hi>. I was going up Bridge-court, and heard a noise at the prosecutor's house—I looked, and saw Elliott come up the area—he got over the rails, and asked me what it was o'clock—I told him a little after six, and said it was rather strange his getting over there—he said he was pot-boy there—he then ran away—he came back afterwards, and bought 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of sweetmeats of me—he told me to go on the bridge, and he would buy some more—I told him I must not—he then gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to say nothing about it—I then saw Selsby come by—I am sure they are the persons—I had known Selsby before.</p>

I keep the house; it is part of the Swan Hotel, Blackfriars—I do not sleep on the premises—I left the house all secure at night, and the next morning I heard of this—Selsby had been living with me as pot-boy—I went in the morning, and found the door leading to Bridge Court was open—I found the till open—I went down stairs, and found two squares of glass taken out of a window, which enabled them to get in—I went to the station, but, during this time, the officer had detected the prisoners with this property on them, the whole of which I can identify—I had shut my house up on Sunday night, and saw it all secure—I had given Selsby 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Saturday night when he left me—there is a bank token among the copper, which I had taken on Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brick maker, and live at Islington. I supply Mr. M'Intosh, the contractor for the Greenwich railway—he wants forty millions of bricks—on the 11th of February, I employed the prisoner to cart five hundred bricks to the rail-road, on the other side of London bridge—I afterwards saw those bricks at Mr. Elston's, in the Old Bailey—they were the same sort of bricks as I delivered to him—they are worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per hundred—he had no authority to do any thing with them, but carry them to the rail-road—Elston's premises are directly out of his way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am kilnman to Mr. Burge. On the 11th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary, I helped to load five hundred bricks into the prisoner's cart, and saw him drive off with them—he was to take them to the Greenwich railway, and nowhere else—his proper way would not be down the Old Bailey—it is out of his way altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in the Old Bailey. The prisoner came to me several times to sell bricks—on Wednesday, the 11th of February, he sold me five hundred bricks—he brought them in his own cart and horse to me, at the Old Bailey—he called at my counting-house about four o'clock that afternoon—I have had cartage work done by him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020096"></xptr>
               <p>several times—he said he had been doing some work for a man and could not get paid—that the money was between 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the man had agreed to supply him with bricks instead of money, and he wished me to take a few of him—I gave him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the five hundred—Mr. Burge afterwards saw the same bricks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You knew him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and had a good opinion of him—I gave him at the rate of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a hundred—bricks vary from 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a thousand—I considered 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a hundred a fair value for money—I have bought bricks much lower and much higher—the pri<lb></lb>soner keeps his own horses and carts, and has worked for us two or three years—the bricks were not mixed with others.</p>

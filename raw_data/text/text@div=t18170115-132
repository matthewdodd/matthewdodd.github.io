The prisoner was in my employ, the pistols were in the shop where the prisoner slept, for him to guard the house; I had been ill for some months, and the first time that I came into the shop I missed them, and asked him for them - He said, he could not find them, and wondered where they were gone to, he said, he had not seen them for some months, I asked him if he suspected any man of taking them, and he said, he suspected a man, named Payne. I saw the pistols at Hatton Garden, on the 9th of December; I had an officer on the 9th of December at my house, and he found the duplicate of the pistols on the prisoner, and he said, they were the pistols that he had stolen from me.</p>

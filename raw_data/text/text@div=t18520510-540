               <p>my master and mistress had been before the Magistrate—I was first spoken to about going to Newgate last week, the day on which I went—my master told me to go and see if I could recognise the man that passed the bad 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I went and saw about twelve men walking round the yard—Roberts was not with me, nor any policeman, only the turnkey—I pointed out the prisoner.</p>

I have looked at these two notes, one No. 94650, dated 2nd Sept., 1850, and the other 23432, dated 4th July, 1851; they are both forgeries in every respect, paper, plate, and signature; one is pretty well done—they are not from the same plate, and I do not think the paper is the same.</p>

On Saturday evening, 10th April last, I was at a public house called the Falcon, I believe, in Old Fish-street, from about ten minutes or a quarter past 6 till five or ten minutes past 10 o'clock—I was drinking some ale at the bar with a gentleman named Hughes, and the prisoner—it was proposed that we should have a game, at cribbage, and we went into the parlour and played—I and a Mr. Williams, the prisoner and Mr. Hughes played—I can swear that the prisoner never left the room, from the time I went there till after 10.</p>

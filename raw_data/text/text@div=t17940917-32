I have been under a sit of illness since, I met two men and they asked me to come and drink; and I went and we had several glasses of gin together, which made me almost intoxicated, I was not in the shop, the woman went in and fetched out a shovel, which she said she found on the road, and I went back again and carried it into the gentleman's house; if the gentleman will deny that I was not there with the shovel producing of it, then I am guilty.</p>

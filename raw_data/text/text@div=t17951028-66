               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar had been your clerk for some time? - Yes, for three or four years. The bill came by post; I opened the letter myself, on the 14th of September; I have the bill.(The bill and letter produced.) I opened it and gave it to one of the clerks; it is due the 17th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the money for that bill? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner? -He absconded with the bill and other property, on the 16th.</p>


               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Tell us what situation Chipchase was with you? - Was he clerk with you? - He was. He used to receive money and bills, and once or twice a week I used to settle the balance with him.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if, for instance, he might receive money on Monday or Tuesday, on Wednesday you could receive the balance and settle with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was, in fact, cashier? - He was employed to receive money and make payments for freight, and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this bill came to his possession in the regular course of his business?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280109"></xptr>- I believe the bill was given to the other clerk, John Forthergill, to carry for acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. But whenever it came into his possession it came in that character, in which he served you? - Yes, just so.</p>


               <p>Q. Of course, if this had not happened that bill would have been carried to account in his accounts? - This bill was never entered in the accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. I put this question to you; had he not, in the course of his employment, authority from you to receive money and to charge himself with money? - He had not, before they became due.</p>
               <p>Q. For instance, that very bill in your hand, if he had not gone away with it, he would have received the money, and if he had wanted any particular sum to disburse, he would have paid it away, and have carried that also into the account? - He may sometimes; but the usual course is for to send it to the bankers, and they are to receive it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your usual course was to send it to the bankers for them to receive it? - Yes, it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, Chipechase, bring any bill to you on the 16th of September? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it been since paid? - Yes, paid on the 17th.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to you what did he say? - He put the bills into my hand as usual, on the 16th, I asked him what was to be done with the bills, they were not indorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual that the parties who send the bills to your house should endorse them? - Always when they are discounted. I asked him whether they should be entered in Mr. Burkitt's account as short bills, or what was to be done with them? He said, he wanted small notes and money for them. I hesitated a little, because it was the custom of every person to indorse every bill they sent in; I offered to give him some light money, which laid on our hands, in order to be changed whenever they chose; he objected to the offer of the light money, and said, it must be good money, it was for Mr. Burkitt's particular use.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Messrs. Fothergill any considerable balance in your hands? - Yes, I believe a very considerable one, they always have. I gave him the money, a hundred pounds in small notes, and the rest in cash.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have received the money on that note for Messrs. Le Febure and Co. as their due? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I observe you state that when he put the bills into your hands, he did it as usual, by which I should suppose that he was in the constant habit of doing. this? - He used to come three or four times a week paying money, and sometimes taking it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Has he been in the habit of discounting bills? - He has come to the house and left bills.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that he wished to come back, in order to do justice, but that the American sailors had offered to rescue him if he had chose? - I dare say there were near three hundred seamen about; I believe he spoke to them when he came out; he spoke to the Captain, and I know the Captain whispered to him three or four times before I brought him away, I am sure it would have been impossible for me to have brought him away if he had said half a word; the Captain and the landlord of the house were so much against me, that I thought myself in great danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in consequence of his good conduct that the rescue was prevented? - Certainly.</p>

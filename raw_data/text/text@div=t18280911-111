            .

            . I am a smith. I was at the public-house, about half-past six o'clock on this evening, alone; the prosecutor, prisoner, and another person entered in about ten minutes; they called for a pot of half-and-half - the prosecutor pulled some silver from his right-hand waistcoat pocket and paid for it: he fell asleep soon after - the person, who came in with him, sat on his right side, and the prisoner on the other - the other man went away soon after; his name, I understand, is Jackson - the prisoner then shifted round towards the sailor, who seemed to be asleep, but in a very little time the prisoner's hand was very near his pocket; the sailor got up and said "It won't do. I am awake to that," and went to sleep again - Paveling came to me and said "Look out;" I kept my eye on the prisoner and saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket and take some silver out, but what it was I cannot say - Paveling came and said "I want to speak to you;" I went out with him into the passage: he asked if I had seen it - I said he had better acquaint his master; he said he had, but he did not chose to interfere - his name is Lennox; he keeps the Bell, Bell-yard, Gracechurch-street - during this time the prisoner came out, asked for a candle, and said he was going to the privy - I saw him go to the cellar and return, and Jackson returned; they both went in on the same side of the box, but did not go near the prosecutor again; they asked for another pot of half-and-half and asked me to drink; I said if I did I would pay part; I paid for a pint - they then said they would have another pint, and that the sailor should pay for it when he awoke; I said I would have nothing to do with that, and called for a pint for myself - they drank theirs and said they would have another, and the sailor should pay for it; the waiter said if he was to pay for it he must awake him; he roused him up and told him there was a pot of half-and-half to pay for; he put his hand into his right-hand pocket and pulled out a note, he turned it over to his left hand pocket, put his hand into his pocket again, and said something about half-and-half - he rapped his arm on the table and said he did not like such tricks: Paveling said "If you have silver why not pay for it out of that;" he said "I have no silver, it is gone," and then threw down a sovereign - I had seen the prisoner take the silver out of his pocket: I believe I left the house first.</p>

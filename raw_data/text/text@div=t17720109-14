I saw it afterwards at Justice Girdler's; the two pieces of nap cloth were exactly the same measure; I am certain it was the same cloth. There were two pieces cut up the middle; I put the seal of the house upon one of them. The serge was deficient, only six yards and a half one piece, and six and three quarters of the other, was remaining. It was as near that quantity as I can recollect. It was entered on the 25th, and delivered to the carrier on the 26th.</p>

When I came down again, he asked me if it was safe; I said, the man said it was. Then he bid me go up and fetch him the outside handkerchief, and bid me tell the man he wanted him. I brought down the handkerchief, and Puller came down and spoke to him. Some words arose between the prisoner and another man in the house, and they went out.

The prisoner and another man came into my house with two pieces of cloth, on (I think) the 27th of November, about twelve at noon; they had some in a sack, and a piece under their arms. After they had been about an hour, they asked if we could lodge him. I said he might lodge in the garret, and put the things in my bed-chamber. I thought he had brought them out of the country to sell. He went away, and I heard no more of him till Saturday, when the other man came to me, and told me, a spiteful person had put him in prison on suspicion of stealing the cloth, and asked me to let him have it. I would not. He said he was going down to be examined again, and asked me if I would go. I went, and told the justice of the other things. I saw it measured at the justice's; I think one of the two pieces was light cloth; one 17 yards and upwards, the other 16 yards, and one I believe about 12 yards of serge.

               <p>I was going down to Birmingham, and between Whetstone and Barnet I saw this lying on the road. I picked it up; another man was very close by me; I brought it up on the Causeway; found it too heavy for to pretend to carry it back to London; I took a piece out, and put the other on the side of the road. I thought, as the hay-carts came to town in the morning, that they might bring it. I did not know the colour, it being dark. I came to town to the Three Pigeons; I left a piece with a man there, a countryman of mine; I never offered to sell it. I went and gave a man a shilling to put it in his hay-cart, and carry it to Mr. Prebble's. I never advertised the thing; I did not know how to go about it; I intended to advertise it going next day to the Pigeons, thinking I had all the cloth together. They charged a constable with me. I know I was a little in liquor when I went there. I saw no waggon when I picked it up.</p>

            . It could not possibly get out; it lay in the bed of the waggon, and the flats on it. I think they must have got into the waggon to get it out.</p>

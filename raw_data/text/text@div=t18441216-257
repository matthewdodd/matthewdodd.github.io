                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Clayworth; he is a poulterer; we live in Bishopsgate-street-Without. The prisoner worked for me as a charwoman on the 16th of Nov.—she left about seven o'clock in the evening—at ten I missed a table-cloth—I sent for the prisoner the next morning, and charged her with taking it—this is it—I went to Mr. Fry's, in Whitechapel-road, where it had been pledged, and saw it again—it is worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it has been stained with a cup of coffee.</p>

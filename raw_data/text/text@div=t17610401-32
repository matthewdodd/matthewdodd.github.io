            . My husband is named William. I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention them.</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. Three linnen gowns, a stuff-gown, two linnen shifts, a cardinal, and a hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with them again?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. I found them on the two prisoners backs when we took them; some on one, and some on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them, or either of them, before?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. Harriot Hand lived servant with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What had she upon her?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. She had a white linnen gown, an apron, stockings, and shift.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Drinkwater?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. She had a purple and white gown, a sattin cardinal, shift, and pair of shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. What is she?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. She lodged in the house where I lodge, up one pair of stairs. I missed the things in the morning, and Hand had absconded, and the other also.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you miss them?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. On Tuesday, March 31, and found the prisoners on the Wednesday, about 10 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say for themselves?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. They both owned they were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say as to the taking them away?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. They both owned they took them; and said, they would bring them every stitch back again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Elliot. I was by when the prisoners were taken, and heard them both acknowledge the things belong'd to the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>The prisoners neither of them said any thing in their defence.</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. Since Hand has been with me I have found her true and honest.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she with you?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. Not a fortnight, but I had a good character with her. She is very young and foolish.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Drinkwater lodged in your house?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. She had lodged in the house about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her character?</p>
               <p>S. Saunders. I know nothing ill of her before this.</p>

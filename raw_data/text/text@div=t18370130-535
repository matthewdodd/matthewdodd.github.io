                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Little King-street, Holborn. I saw this piece of cloth safe at a quarter before four o'clock on Wednes<lb></lb>day, the 11th of January, hanging inside the shop door—I missed it in two or three minutes—I went out immediately, as a man told me I was robbed—I am sure it was the prisoner, but I lost sight of him when I came to Great Queen-street, and he got away—in an hour and a half I went to a pawnbroker's, and found him there with the cloth—he had been to several pawnbrokers—I saw he was frightened—I asked him what he had brought in, and took his hand—he could not speak—I asked the pawnbroker what he had brought—he said, "A piece of cloth"—I sent for a policeman and he begged to be forgiven—this is my cloth.</p>

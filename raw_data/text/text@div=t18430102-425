                  </hi>. I live at No. 42, Plummer-street, in the house of my brother, Charles Thomas Cameron, in the parish of St Leonard, Shore<lb></lb>ditch. On Monday evening, the 12th of Dec., about half-past five o'clock or a quarter to six, I was in the kitchen with my sister Eliza, and there was a little hoy six years old also in the house—the kitchen-door was open—I heard a noise in the passage, took a candle, and went and found the prisoner in the passage, just by the side of the stairs which lead up stairs—I asked what he wanted—he appeared very much confused, and asked for a man named Davis—he said two men had come in, and he had come in after them—he did not say how they had come in—Mr. Morley, the witness, called from the parlour window that I was to keep him—he called out loud enough for the prisoner to hear—he said, "Keep the door shut, there is a thief in the house "—I do not know whether the prisoner opened the door, or whether I did, but he got out into the street—Mr. Morley caught him, and tustled with him some time, but he got away from him, and ran up Plummer-street, into the City-road—no one hallooed after him—I returned to the house, and shut the door—Morley did not go in with me at that time—I went up the stairs And saw the apron on the stairs—I went quite up the stairs, but the apron was about seven or eight stairs up—it was a woman's apron, belonging to Mrs. Warwick—I have often seen her wear it, but I cannot say when—I had been up the stairs about ten minutes before, and it was not on the stairs then—I took it up, and took it into Mrs. Warwick's room—she lodges in the house, but was out at the time—I saw her about an hour after, when she came home, and showed it to her—I went into her room with her—she lodges in the parlour, from the window of which Mr. Morley called to me—I found the apron where I had put it in her room—when I put the apron into her room the window was wide open—I had pot been into the parlour all that day before—Mrs. Warwick went out about three o'clock in the afternoon—I did not see the prisoner again for a week and three days, when he was at the station in custody—I had never seen him before he was in the house to my knowledge—I am quite positive he ki the man I saw in the passage—no person named Davis lived in the house—I know no such person—I had not seen anybody in the house but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Plummer-street, City-road. On the evening of the 12th of Dec. a person gave me information, and I went to Cameron's house, and called in at the window—I asked who was there—I saw a man in the front parlour—he made me no answer the first time—the win<lb></lb>dow was open—I had not seen anybody get in at the window, but on looking in I saw the man who I spoke to—he at last asked me for a person named Davis—I told him no such person lived in the house—about that time the parlour door, leading out of the parlour into the passage, was opened—he opened it himself, and went into the passage—Mr. Cameron's sister came with a light while he stood in the passage—they had some conversation in the pas<lb></lb>sage</p>

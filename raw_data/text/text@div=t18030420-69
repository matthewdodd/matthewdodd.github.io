               <p>Q.When was it you missed any thing? - A. On the night of the 24th of February, I left the stall about half-past nine at night; I locked it up, and went home; I missed two pair of old shoes, and an odd one; some pieces of leather, a memorandum-book, and a sponge; I had left them safe locked up with a padlock.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HEBERDEN sworn. - I am a watchman; on the night of the 24th of February, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the stall; I did not see him go in; I followed him to the corner of Gerrard-street, and then I saw him throw something away into the open street; I followed him, and laid hold of him; I sprung my rattle for assitance, and took him into custody; I saw him drop this iron into an area.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that before he had dropped the things, or after? - A.Afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what it was at the time? - A. I did not; I knocked at the door, and the people of the house told us to come in the morning; I went between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you call that piece of iron? - A. It is what they call a center-bit.</p>
               <p>JOHN NARBORN sworn. - I went to the assistance of Heberden; I saw the prisoner drop the property, and I saw him throw something into the area; I picked up some old shoes, some leather, and a memorandum-book (produces them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me throw any thing into the area? - A. Yes, I head it drop.</p>
               <p>(To Collins.) Q.Are those your shoes and leather? - A. Yes, they were my own; I always take my customer's work home with me of a night; the memorandum-book is a book I keep against my landlord, when I pay my rent.</p>
               <p>Q.How did your stall appear to be broke open? - A. The watchman came to me, and told me my stall was broke open; about half past seven o'clock I went and found the pastlock was taken off, and carried away.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it forced off? - A. No, I think it was taken off by a picklock-key, for there is nothing wrenched.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. On the 7th of February, I came from a village in Northumberland, where I had been to see my mother,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200084"></xptr>who is ninety-two years old; I continued there eighteen months, and practised my profession, which is that of a hair-dresser; it did not answer my expectations; I arrived in London on the 7th of February, at near twelve o'clock at night; I called at an Alamode-beef shop, to refresh myself, where I staid about fifteen minutes; I went with intent to procure a bed, in Green-street, Leicester-fields, where I had lodged before; as I got to the corner of Gerrard-street, a man walked very fast by me, and dropped something; I called to him, but he made me no answer; the watchman came up, and laid hold of me; I told him which way the man was gone; he said he had got me, and that was sufficient for him, observing with a great oath, that he should lose his place if he had not somebody, for he was already upon his good behaviour.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Heberden.) Are you sure you saw him come out of the stall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you say you was upon your good behaviour, and must take up somebody? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.You never lost sight of him after you got out of the stall? - A.Not at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. It was not a moon-light night, was it? - A.No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q.How far were you from him? - A.About fourteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you fee any body else near him? - A.There were several people passing.</p>
               <p>Q.You saw him come out of the stall, you saw him throw the things away, and you never lost sight of him? - A.Never.</p>

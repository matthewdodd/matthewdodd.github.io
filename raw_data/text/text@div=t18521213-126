                  </hi>. This is my dwelling house, and is in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate—I am a tobacconist—on 26th Nov. I went to bed at a quarter past 11 o'clock—I was the last person up—the windows and doors were then all shut and bolted—there are three windows, which open on to the leads on the first floor, and one more especially, which is the kitchen window—any person getting on the leads could get in there—I was awoke about half past 2 o'clock next morning, went downstairs, and found all the drawera under the counter drawn out, and the kitchen window open, which had been shut the night before; I had left 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and some halfpence in a small bag in the till in the shop, and about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of halfpence in a bowl—the inner sash, the enclosure of the shop window, was drawn aside, and the contents apparently all gone—I suppose there were about thirty bundles of cigars, worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., gone from the window; but I found them afterwards, tied up in a bag, against the private door—I saw my servant fetch this hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from off the leads.</p>

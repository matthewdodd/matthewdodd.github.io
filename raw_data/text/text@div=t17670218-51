            . I am turned of fourteen years of age, I saw the two prisoners standing by Mr. Dent; I saw Miller put his hand into his pocket and take but a handkerchief, and give it to Green. I live with Mr. Stevens a watchmaker, in Whitechapel; after that I saw Green drop the handkerchief, and gave a wrench out of Mr. Dent's hand, and run away down Houndsditch; after that I heard Green say he should be cleared, for he did not take it, Miller took it; after that Green was brought back, and carried to Mr. Lane's the poulterer's shop; there they both confessed: Green said Miller took the handkerchief but of the gentleman's pocket, and Miller owned he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise of forgiveness, on condition of their confessing?</p>
               <p>Robins. Mr. Lane or Mr. Dent said before my Lord-Mayor, that if they would make any discovery of their gang, they would pardon Green, but not for this offence; I heard nothing said to them before they took the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Miller's defence.</p>
               <p>I was walking along; I happened to touch this gentleman; he catched hold of me, and said I had taken his handkerchief; I never touched it.</p>

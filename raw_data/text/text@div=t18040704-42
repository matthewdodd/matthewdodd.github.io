               <p>- LEWIS sworn. - I went to see the failing-match; my coat was buttoned; I felt a hand against my pocket; I turned round, and saw some suspicious persons near me; I saw the last witness near, and the prisoner was wanting to push in between me and the stone work; I watched him; he found he could not get before me, and he went behind him, put his hand in his pocket gently, and drew out the handkerchief and put it under his coat; some Police-officers were on the bridge, and I gave him in charge.</p>

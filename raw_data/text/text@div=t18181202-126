            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on another charge, and asked her for the duplicates. She said she had some in her bureau, and she had no others. I found a great quantity there. I searched her person, saw her hand in her pocket-hole, and between her stays and her body I found a glove containing forty-eight duplicates, four of which related to these table-cloths. She said they belonged to a kept woman, in Mortimer-street, who gave them to her to pledge. I detained them for her to bring the woman, to say they were her property, between the Saturday and Monday she absconded. On the 15th of November I took her at Battersea. She said they were the prosecutor's.</p>

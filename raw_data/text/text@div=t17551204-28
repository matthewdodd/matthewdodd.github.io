On the 14th of November the prisoner was stop'd with some copper at the house of Mr. Child; he sent for me to know if I knew the prisoner. I said I did, he work'd with me; I was told there was some copper stop'd at his house, and the prisoner. I went and saw two saucepans unfinish'd, and some other pieces of copper. I have sworn the saucepans are mine. (produced in court, and a poled to) There is a piece of copper also, which he was at work upon the day before he was stop'd.</p>
               <p>Q. How much copper is there of the two saucepans and that bit of a coal scoop?</p>
               <p>Shelton. It makes in all about a pound and three-quarter. We took the prisoner before my lord-mayor the next day, but I did not swear to the thing; so he was remanded back to prison. On the Wednesday following I went again before my lord-mayor, and swore to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner own at any time he took the copper?</p>
               <p>Shelton. No, my lord, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks are on the copper?</p>
               <p>Shelton. None. I know it by my own work, having a particular way in working.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would you not swear then, and yet go and swear six days afterwards?</p>
               <p>Shelton. I was very tender; and when I had made close inspection, I went and swore to it.</p>

            . I live in Barbican, am a founder. On the 14th of November last I was sent for home; and there was the prisoner at the bar stop'd with this copper. I told him I was of opinion the things he brought me were not honest come by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer you this to sale ?</p>
               <p>Child. Yes he did. The I ask'd him where he work'd (for I had once or twice sent my servants to watch him, to know where he work'd, but they could bring no account.) The saucepans were brought about six weeks before he was stop'd; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040018"></xptr> came only with a bit of copper then. My wife bought the two saucepans of him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Child. I bought these two saucepans of the prisoner at the bar; I gave him 11 d. per pound for them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Shelton. Are these your saucepans ?</p>
               <p>Shelton. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Child. He was stop'd on the 14th of Nov. with a small bit of a coal scoop, which be brought to sell amongst other metal. There is a pound and 3 ounces of it. He was stop'd upon this. I sent for my husband home, and we charged a constable with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Child. Where did he say he work'd?</p>
               <p>Child. He told me he served his time with a brasier at Newbury, in Berkshire; but I found he served his time in London. When I found he worked with the prosecutor, I sent for him. So it came out.</p>

               <p>"Examinant says, that one night last week he was at the stables belonging to the said regiment, in King-street, Portman-square, about twelve o'clock at night; he was in the room for keeping the regimental stores; he got into the room by the keys being left in the lock; that upon the floor he found divers regimental hats, and stripped the lace off fifteen of them with a knife; and, having so done, took the lace, and hid it under the manager where his horse stands, intending to sell it to some old Jew; he did not break open any drawers to get at the keys, but found the same in the door."</p>

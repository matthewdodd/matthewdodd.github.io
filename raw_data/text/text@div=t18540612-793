                  </hi>. I am single, and reside with my father, George Inseal, who keeps the Red Cow public house, at Peckham. On Tuesday, 9th May, the prisoners came, a little before half past 1 o'clock, they called for two glasses of gin and bitters which I served them with—there are two entrances to our house; it is situated at a corner—one door is in High-street, Peckham, and the other in Red Cow-lane—either of those doors lead to the bar—the bar is an angle—at the corner of the bar there is an entire separation—there is a partition, so that anybody coming in at one door would not be able to get to the persons who came in at the other door—one door would come to the front of the bar, the other to the side of the bar—the partition would prevent one coming in at one door getting to a person coming in at the other—the partition is rather high, no one could look over it, but they might lean over the counter and shake hands—when the prisoners came in, no one else came in, but there was a person in about two or three minutes before, a middling sized man, with fair complexion and light whiskers—he held his head down—I could not see what age he was—he asked for a pint of porter and the newspaper—I gave him the porter and newspaper—when I had served the prisoners, Tookey walked up and took the newspaper from the other party—that was while I was drawing the bitten—I did not hear Tookey ask for the paper, I did not notice him taking it, but he had it when I turned round—Tookey then asked me if I would oblige him with a sovereign for two half sovereigns; I went in the bar parlour, took a sovereign from a purse that was inside the cash box, and gave it him—the bar parlour is just at the back of the bar, facing the door—the cash box stood on a chair just inside the bar parlour—the prisoners were in such a position that they could see all over the bar parlour—the fair man could see the bar parlour through the window—they could all three see the cash box—Tookey then said to White, "Will you have anything else"—White said he would have a glass of cider, for he had tasted our cider before—we keep our cider in a stone lobby at the end of the passage—Tookey said he would have a glass of bitter ale, which we keep in the same lobby as the cider—I took the keys and two glasses, and went out of the bar to call my father—I went towards the lobby, which is a continuation of the place where Tookey and White were standing—I went out of the bar down the lobby—my father was in the kitchen, which is on the right when you get to the end of the lobby; White followed me, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185406120090"></xptr>
               <p>Tookey remained at the bar; White stood right in the centre of the pas<lb></lb>sage—he stood at the doorway leading from the bar to the lobby (we have always kept the cider and bitter ale in that lobby; when any customers have come for them we have always gone there)—I called my father to draw the cider—he asked me to hold one of the glasses, which I did; and I then called the servant, Mary, to come and hold the other glass, for I must go to the bar—when my father drew the first glass of cider, he took it, and I went back to the bar—as I was coming back, Tookey rushed past me—the first person I saw was White, he stood in the doorway, I pushed past him—he was not doing anything, he was standing there, the door was hardly wide enough—he stood right in the middle, I pushed him to get by to the bar—as I came along the lobby I was met by Tookey, he rushed from the bar towards me; he went to the lobby and drank his ale—he did not stop me, I went back to the bar—I stood in the bar about a minute, when my father came in with the money which they had paid him for the ale and cider—the prisoners had not come from the lobby—they then rushed out of the house—that raised my suspicion—they had not got out, when my father called out, "Another halfpenny?" and one of them threw down a halfpenny on the bar, and it fell on the ground; they then went rapidly out of the house—I then went in the bar parlour, and saw the lid of the cash box lying down on the chair which the cash box had stood on—the cash box was then gone—I do not know the amount that was in it—I bad seen two or three notes in it, the rest was in gold and silver—I called out to my father, "The cash box is gone"—he had scarcely got out of the bar from bringing me the money—he was going back to the kitchen—he went out of the door and called out to stop the two prisoners—they were the only persons who were in the house—when I got back to the bar the fair man was gone—I had left him on the other side of the partition at the bar—the prisoners were pursued and brought back—I examined the top of the counter, there was one scratch of their boots as they had jumped over.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever seen this fair man before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my recollection—I call him a fair man—he had a very fair complexion, and light whiskers, rather bushy—he was dressed in black, and had a large over coat on his arm; he had a black hatband—he was there more than five minutes before the prisoners came in—he was reading a newspaper—he came in at the side entrance; the jug and bottle entrance—the prisoners came in at the front entrance—you cannot see over the parti<lb></lb>tion—in the bar parlour, where the cash box was, there is a glass window—the window was filled with glasses—there was a plain net curtain at the window; the curtain is such as you can see through—only I dine in the bar parlour—one end of the window comes about the same distance as the parti<lb></lb>tion—there is not a door leading into the bar parlour, there is merely an open space; no glass in that—that opening is opposite to where the pri<lb></lb>soners were standing—it is a very small bar parlour—there are three chairs in it, and a small table—the cash box was standing on a chair, just inside the bar parlour; the chair was facing the doorway, on the right as you went in; about half way up the bar parlour—the three chairs do not stand on that side—I am sure I went to the cash box to get the sovereign; it was in a purse in the cash box—there is no place in the bar where we keep loose gold; we keep money in the till; but when we have a sum in it, it is taken out and put into the desk—the cash box usually stood in the desk, but that morning it was taken out to alter the desk—the desk was taken out, but the cash box was there—we do not keep loose gold and silver in the bar</p>

               <p>parlour—we go every time to the cash box—the key of it was in the desk; it was not locked—the weight of silver and gold in the cash box had forced the lid off—it had been off some length of time; I cannot say how long—the desk was not there that day—it was a common size cash box—I have not the lid here—when I went to call my father I stayed there about a minute—I was about a minute absent from the bar—my father has not been finding fault with me about this matter—he said it was wrong of me to leave the bar—I went before the Magistrate on the same afternoon, and again the next time—my father went with me—my father did not see the fair man—there was no one in the bar but myself—my father had been in the bar half an hour before—there were not any working men about that day—our regular customers had been in—not a great many—I do not know whether there were any that I had not seen before; I did not take parti<lb></lb>cular notice—I took notice of the fair man, because he was a remarkable man—he had a large coat on his arm, and he had been in previously—he came in about half past 11 o'clock, and had two glasses of porter, and I saw no more of him till about five minutes before the prisoners came in—the first time the fair man came in, he held his head down—he did not ask for the paper then—it was because he held his head down that I noticed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Red Cow, at Peckham, in the parish of Camberwell. On 9th May I remember my daughter coming to the lobby at the end of the passage—I was in the kitchen—my daughter called me to draw a glass of ale and a glass of cider—I had seen the prisoners in the house before, three or four or five times—they just came in for a mere simple thing, a pint of porter between the two, or a glass of gin—I might, have seen them three or four days before 9th May—White followed my daughter—he stood in the doorway—he blocked the door up—he stood some time, and would not decide whether he would have ale or cider—I asked which he would have, and he did not give me a direct answer—he seemed to hesitate; at last he decided that he would have cider—my daughter held the empty glass—I drew the cider, and gave it to White—my daughter went to the door, and I looked and saw Tookey leaning over the bar towards where the cashbox was—my daughter went along the passage towards the bar—White drank what I gave him—I drew the glass of ale, and I heard a noise—I looked, and saw Tookey coming very fast for his glass of ale—he got it, and drank it very quickly—I asked for the money, and White gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that was a little way in the passage—as soon as they gave me the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. they were in the act of going out—I said, "Another halfpenny?"—as soon as I had said that they <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the halfpenny down, and went out as fast as they could—my daughter immediately called out that the cash box was gone—I cannot say how much there was in it that morning, whether it</p>

We have not got it"—they said they were innocent; that if there had been a robbery they had not got it, they had got nothing.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 12th of May, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and presented a paper - I asked him what it was, if it was a petition; he would not answer, but requested me to look at it - I returned it to him: he still requested I would open it, which I did, and seeing it was a petition craving charity, I returned it to him, and he left the shop - he had not left more than a second before I missed a gold watch off the counter, which I had packed up to send to a customer; I sent a workman and the porter in search of him: they did not find him, but I met him the following morning, about twelve o'clock, on Westminster-bridge, and had him apprehended by a Policeman - I am certain he is the man.</p>

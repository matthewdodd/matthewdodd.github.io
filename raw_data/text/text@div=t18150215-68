On the 23rd of January, the prisoner came to my house, and wanted to know if I would give credit for what goods were sold in my shop; he said he received his money monthly of Mr. Holdsworth, at the Mansion House; I let him have what he wanted; from that time to the 6th of February, he had goods and money to the amount of two pounds nine shillings and eight pence; he then said, he should have twenty pounds on the Monday, and he would come and settle, had I got change; I said yes; I counted out seventeen one-pound notes; he looked at the notes, and took them up; he said take care of my pocket-book, he put it on the counter, and said he was going to Holmes's.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. This was Monday, the 6th of February; the seventeen one-pound notes he took away with him in his hand, I was counting out the silver and the halfpence when he went away with the notes, he said he would be back in a minute. I found he did not come back; I looked in the pocket-book; I found some blank paper in the pocket-book, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he shewed you a twenty-pound note at all - A. He had a piece of paper in his hand, it looked like a piece of writing paper. Finding he did not come back, I went to Mrs. Holmes's after him, and then to his wife; his wife said she expected him in; I could not find him. I went and gave information at the Mansion House; I saw no more of him until he was brought to the Mansion House on the Monday.</p>

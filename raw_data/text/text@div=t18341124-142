That is not true—she did not say I was a stranger, and she could not trust me—I did not get up and put on my clothes till I saw Hutchinson run down with my jacket and waistcoat—my trowers were under my head, but my money was in my waistcoat pocket—I told her I had no money, but I had—I told her I had only sixpence and twopence, not wishing her to know how much money I had—she said, "Never mind the money, pay me another time"—she asked me to give her a quartern of gin—I said, "Well, give me a night's lodging, and I will give you a quartern of gin."</p>

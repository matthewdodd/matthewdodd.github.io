            . I was coming from my work that night down Holbourn-hill; I met the prosecutor, the prisoner was by his side; I saw his hand in the prosecutor's pocket; I passed by them, and upon hearing him call out, good man give me my handkerchief, I turned round, and they were collaring each other; there was another man with the prisoner; they dropped a blue and white spotted one; I took it up and gave it to the Black, (that is the prosecutor) he would not own it; I saw the prisoner's companion going over the way, I did not go after him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>Coming up Holbourn hill the prosecutor turned round, and said his pocket was picked; this other gentleman said he saw my hand in his pocket, that is very false; they took me into the watch-house, I desired them to search me; the prosecutor said, if I would give him half a crown he would not appear against me; he said he gave a gentleman 3 s. 6 d. a day to come and appear against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever offer as the prisoner has said?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I never did; they came to me at Esquire Walker's, where my wife is now, to make it up, and I said I would not make it up, till I know what footing I was upon; I have attended here these four days, and his friends almost tore me to pieces in the Sessions-house yard; I was forced to confine myself in the alehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you on board a ship?</p>
               <p>Walding. I am cook on board a merchant ship; I lost several things by pickpockets; I lost a pair of shoes last year on Tower-hill, and I always said, the first I catch I'll hold fast.</p>

            . I am the wife of William James. On the 4th of August the prisoner came to my aunt's house, in John-street, with a box - I saw her unlock the box; I did not hear any man persuade her to do it - she took a silk shawl out; she left the box with me till the next Monday, and then took it away; she afterwards left some duplicates with me - I gave them to the officer.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young man I had known for six years; he asked if he should carry it for me; I said I would thank him - he went to Union-street, Back Church-lane, and he asked me to go and have half a pint of beer, which I did; he stood outside with the box; he opened it, and pawned some of the things - I did not know what to do; I took the box to James' house, and left it there, to see if I could make up the money to get the things - I met the young man again; he asked if he should see me any more; I said he might do as he pleased, he had been my ruin - I then went and got the box, and he took it quite away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. On the 16th of April, about twelve o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner at Rose-villa, Well-street, Camberwell—he opened the front-gate, walked up the gravel-walk, went round into the back-yard, and shut the gate after him—I could not see him after that—he went round the end of the house—I waited about ten minutes, and then rung at the bell of the front-gate—Mrs. Philips opened the front-door—I told her what I had seen—I was taking a pint of beer to the house—she took the beer, and I went into the kitchen with her—I went out, and called Mr. Burrows to help me search the house—we searched the out-house, and bottom part of the house, and found nobody-Mrs. Philips and Mr. Burrows went up stairs together to look, and gave an alarm—Mr. Burrows and I and one Smith, went up stairs, and saw the prisoner in a bed-room, standing between the bed and the window—it was a quarter of an hour after I had seen him at the back-door—Mr. Philips was on the landing—we took the prisoner, and gave him into custody to Sergeant Dinn.</p>

Naish gave me information—I went up stairs, looked under the bed, and saw a man there—I called Mr. Naish up to take him, and when I did so, he got up from under the bed—he was taken—I missed some hair-pins, a brooch, and a small bracelet, from the pincushion of the toilet-table—I saw the sergeant take a bundle from under the bed which the prisoner had been under—it contained some clothes of Mr. Philipi's, which were kept in the drawers of the same bed-room—I had seen them there in the morning—I have seen the trinkets since in possession of Dinn—these now produced are them.</p>

On the 18th of December I went to Well-and-Bucket-court, Old-street—I went to a room on the ground floor—the street door was partly open—the room door was shut—I lifted the latch, went in, and saw the female prisoner sitting on the bed<lb></lb>stead, blowing the fire—the man was in bed with two children—I seized the female prisoner—she gave a loud shriek, and wanted to know what I wanted there—I gave her to Reynolds, another officer, who followed me in—I then commenced searching a cupboard, and took from it two bags, one containing Roman cement, and the other plaster-of-Paris—I gave them to Reynolds—I found a tobacco-pipe with some white metal in it—I saw Duke find some <hi rend="italic">gets</hi>—I then went to another cupboard, and at that mo<lb></lb>ment the female prisoner swung across the bed—Reynolds took hold of her, and pulled her back, and stopped her from coming any further—she had come to where I was standing—she said, "I cannot help what my husband will do—Oh my poor babies, what will become of your father and mother!"—I then took from the wall a bag, which was hanging up, full of old rags—I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it on the bed, and told Reynolds to search it—in that bag was another smaller one, and in that this mould—in a butter flat, under the bed, I found twenty-seven counterfeit shillings, and twelve counterfeit six<lb></lb>pences, which I have here—I saw Ash take from the same flat two good shillings, and a good half-crown.</p>

I said, "Yes"—I went to the yard to wash myself, and when I came in, I put on my coat and handkerchief, and said I was going out—they said, "Put these bags away"—I said they could put them away—they put them in the cupboard—I left them there—I went down White Cross-street, and saw no more of them.</p>

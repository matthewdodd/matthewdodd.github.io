               <p>Had you locked the door when you went out? - I did not lock my door, I lost the key, but I latched it, which is as good as a lock, I opened it with a bit of stick; the woman that lives with me was at the door before me, and she picked up a stocking and a cap; I had that cap and stocking in the bundle among all the rest, and I missed a whole bundle of wet linen, as mentioned in the indictment; (recites them) the things are all here, they were in my custody for washing, some of them, and the rest are my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. What time did you come home that evening? - I came home in the course of ten minutes after I went out.</p>
               <p>Was not it light enough to see without a candle at that time? - No, sir, it was not, I had a light half an hour.</p>

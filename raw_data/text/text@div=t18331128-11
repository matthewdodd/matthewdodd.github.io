            . I received the £100 note from Ransom's - I saw the box again on the 17th of October; my husband and I went to the cellar and took the box down and took it into the sitting-room, and then opened it and missed the £100 note, and the £5 note - the prisoner had lived nearly six months with me, and left on the 15th of Ocotber - my husband went out to look for her on the 17th. and while he was gone the prisoner came to our house for a band-box, about six o'clock, in the evening; or soon after, she came into the shop; I saw her, and charged her with robbing us of a £100, and a £5 note - she laughed at me, and said, "Indeed, I have not taken it" - I sent out for a policeman and had her taken to Bow-street station-house - the cellar was not locked, as she had access to it to draw water -(looking at a small book) this is my writing; here is an entry of the £100 note, being No. 711, dated the 12th of December, 1832 - I am sure that is a correct description of the note I received from Ransom's, and which was safe in the box on the 7th - I saw that note on the 18th at the Bank; I have not seen the £5 note.</p>

Johnson, 12, Charles-street, Westminster" - I have not the least doubt of this being the note she gave me - Smith, Payne and Co. are our bankers - I don't know what became of the note; I paid it to our cashier.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner on the 17th of October - I took her to the station-house; I searched her, and found on her a bunch of keys, three pawnbroker's duplicates, one silver tea-spoon, a knife, and a snuff-box - I asked her if she knew anything of the note; she denied all knowledge of it - she told me she lived at No. 84, Wells-street, Oxford-street; I went and found she did not live there - I afterwards went to No. 54, Well-street,(I am sure she told me No. 84) - I went up-stairs to the attic and found this box - it was not locked; it contained some loose ribbons, and flannel, and linen - I tried the keys I found on her to the box, and one fits the lock; it was a very common lock - I shewed her the box on the Friday at Bow-street, and asked if it was her box; she said it was - the property in it was not claimed; she said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>MARTHA PEARCE. While the prisoner was in our service she had not that box.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARK. I cannot identify these articles as having been sold to her; I sold her some linen, and there is some here - I had not seen her before that I am aware of - I am sure she is the woman who paid me the note - I saw her again on the 18th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take the money - I never saw the box Mr. Pearce described - I never saw any money in the house.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the afternoon of the 23rd of October, I saw the prisoner about ten minutes after two o'clock - he was then in custody of Burkboy - I neither threatened nor made him any promise - I asked him if he had been in Mr. Brown's skittle-ground; he said, he had; I then said, "You have stolen some linen," he said, he met a man outside Mr. Brown's premises, who asked him to go and have a game at skittles; that he went in with the man who stole some linen from the kitchen - I said "you were both running away together," he said, "Yes, we were;" I searched him and found 15d. on him, in money; I have the linen here; I received it from Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>PETER BROWN. I deliverd the linen to the policeman, they are the things I mentioned before; a tablecloth, and towel, and other things, a pinafore, and 3 pillowcases, they were all in the bundle which I saw the prisoner drop; they are my property; the aprons I wear myself; and here is my child's pinafore; the table-cloth is what we had in use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Kennington-lane, and met the young man, who asked me to play a game at skittles; he said, he was going to the kitchen-door, to ask for the skittle-ball; and while he was gone. I went to the water-closet; he came and knocked at the door, and said, "Richard, if you don't come along you will be taken into custody;" I came out with my trousers undone; he went on to the road, and then he said, "Here they come;" he chucked the things down, and ran on, and got a good deal before me - the witness Brown came up and said, Stop him! I turned up a lane: I stopped, and he caught me.</p>

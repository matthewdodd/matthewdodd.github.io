            . On the 24th of May last I had been to see a relation in Russel court; in returning back, I stopp'd in Covent Garden, with a man whom I deal with for fruit; I went down Henrietta street, it being a fine moon-light night, I went in order to call upon a relation in King street, near the Seven Dials, nam'd Williams; I went up Bedford-street, but finding it full late, did not call. I cross'd Long Acre, and thro' a court into <placeName id="t17600709-31-crimeloc162">Hart street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17600709-31-crimeloc162" type="placeName" value="Hart street"></interp>

Soon after he was seiz'd by a soldier; somebody came up and said my face was all bloody; I describ'd the watch, and soon after it was pick'd up by a person now in court, with the glass broke; then the prisoner said, now you have found your watch, have you any thing farther to say to me: said I, as I have got my watch you may go and be d - d; upon which he said, then I charge the watch with you. I was bail'd out on the monday morning, I went to Mr. Fielding's with him. At the justice's, the prisoner first said I was with a woman, and miss'd my watch; and he was going by at the corner of the alley, and I charg'd him with taking it, and that he never was in the court, and that he never had it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether, when we were in the court, he did not put his hand in my breeches, and lay hold of my private parts?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I did not; I never heard him speak a word till after he had struck me with my watch; then he said either blast or d - n my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I did not lay hold of his collar upon his attemping to put his hand into my breeches, and he did not immediately beg I'd not use him ill, and say I'll down on my knees, and hold his hands up, and take his watch out of his pocket, and say, I'll make you a present of this, as I have no money; and I took the watch and struck it at him.</p>
               <p>Smith. No, upon my oath this is not true; he took my watch out of my pocket, and with the force broke the stone out of the seal; I am not at all surpriz'd at this, there was a chairman came and told my fellow servant, since he has been in confinement, that the prisoner said, I offer'd him 7 s. or 7 s. and 6 d. I offer'd him no money, nor nothing like it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176007090038"></xptr>Q. Is the chairman in court?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Smith. I have liv'd with my Lord Falmouth 14 years.</p>
               <p>Norwood Francis Ward. About half an hour after 11 that night I was walking up Bow street; just as I got on the top of Bow street I heard the cry watch; I look'd, and saw a scuffle, and some people going that way, and a soldier stopp'd the prisoner; I went up; the prosecutor said the prisoner had robb'd him; the prisoner seem'd to be running towards me before he was stopp'd; the watchman came, and they charg'd the watch with him. Mr. Smith said, the prisoner had stole his watch; the prisoner desired to be search'd; I still kept walking up Hart street; the people said, if he has it not, perhaps he has thrown it away; a gentlewoman, named Finney, took a candle, and look'd on the ground, and found the watch on the ground where the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner charge the prosecutor with having done any thing?</p>
               <p>Ward. No; he did not charge him with any thing; after the watch was found, the people ask'd him, whether he had any thing more to do with the prisoner; he said, no; as I have got my watch, let him go and be d - d. Then, by desire of some people present, the prisoner said, then I charge you for the scandal; and they both went away to the roundhouse together.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words the prisoner made use of when he charg'd him?</p>
               <p>Ward. Somebody there said; now if I was in your place, I would charge the watch with him; said he, so I will.</p>
               <p>Q. What for?</p>
               <p>Ward. It appear'd to me, for the scandal for saying he had taken the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with them to the roundhouse?</p>
               <p>Ward. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner charge the prosecutor there with any thing, with some attempt upon him?</p>
               <p>Ward. No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you at the watchhouse?</p>
               <p>Ward. I was there several hours.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I could not have made my escape from the prosecutor before the watchman came u p.</p>
               <p>Ward. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether the prosecutor did not charge me with robbing him of half a guinea?</p>
               <p>Ward. No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never charg'd him with taking any thing but my watch; I believe the prisoner once did get out of my hands, but I had hold on the skirt of his coat, when the watchman came and took him in charge.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Finney. I keep a public house in Hart street; on saturday the 24th of May, about half an hour after 11 o'clock at night, I heard watch call'd; I ran out, and saw a soldier had the prisoner by the collar; the watchman came and took hold of him; and the prosecutor charg'd the watch with him, saying, he had stole his watch. I said to the watchman let me have your lanthorn and look about; he gave the lanthorn to the prosecutor, and I went in and took a candle, and looking lower down, just where the prisoner was taken by the soldier, there I found the watch in the kennel. Mr. Smith, before I found it, said, it was a gold watch, with a shagreen case, and the glass was broke by striking him in the face (and it was such a watch) Mr. Smith had a cut in his face; the prisoner ask'd Mr. Smith, if he had any thing more to do with him; Mr. Smith made a little pause; and said, as I have my watch, go about your business and be d - d; there was some people standing by said young man, why don't you charge the watch with him; then he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner charge the prosecutor with any thing?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Finney. No, I did not; he did not charge him with any thing; I was in new prison after that to see the prisoner; he there said he never saw Mr. Smith before, nor never mentioned Mr. Smith's doing any thing to him.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I was calling the half hour in Hart street, I heard the cry watch, watch, stop, stop; I ran, and saw a soldier had the prisoner in custody; I ask'd what was the matter; the prosecutor said, I charge you with this man, he has pick'd my pocket of my gold watch; I took hold of him; I said to the gentleman, do you know where you lost your watch; he said, somewhere hereabouts; in 3 or 4 minutes the watch was found; then the prisoner wanted to go; and ask'd the gentleman if he had any farther charge against him; the gentleman would have forgiven him, when I let him go; then he said, I charge you with this gentleman, for a scandal in detaining of him; then I said, gentlemen, if you please to go to the roundhouse; so they went together.</p>

            . I was constable of the night; I was in the watchhouse when the prosecutor and prisoner where brought in; they charg'd each other; the prosecutor charg'd the prisoner with stealing his watch, and the prisoner charg'd him with stopping of him, and charging him with stealing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you at the watchhouse that night?</p>
               <p>Clark. I was there till about 4 o'clock; they were brought in about 12.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor met me facing Henrietta street, at the lower end of Russel court, and look'd very hard at me; he stood up as I past by, and touch'd my shoulder, he stood like if he was making water; I past him, he followed me, and look'd very hard at me; he came and pull'd me by the sleeve, and said it was a fine night; yes, sir, said I, it is; he said, will you take a walk this way; I could not imagine what he meant; but willing to know what he wanted, I turn'd back, and went up into Hart street; he took hold of my arm, and carried me up to the 7 Dials, through several courts and passages; after which he took me up this court, in Hart street (it is not a thoroughfare) where he made an attempt to lay hold on my private parts, and was going to unbutton my breeches, in order to put his hand in; then I struck him; he begg'd I would not make a noise, nor use him ill, and he would make me a present of any thing he had about him; I said I wanted nothing of him, but call'd him villain and scoundrel for using me so, as he had; I said, I would use him ill, and beat him; upon which he said, I'll down on my knees to you if you will not use me ill; you dog. I said, I'll have nothing of you; he put his watch into my hand, and said it was a gold one, and that he had no money; he would make me a present of that; I struck him with the watch immediately; upon which the watch fell; as soon as I struck him he call'd watch, watch, and a man came up who was a soldier, and laid hold of me; then the watchman, and several of the neighbours got round me; he said, he had lost his watch, the watch was found about 20 yards from where I was standing. I said, have you any thing more to say to me; he said, no; then I said, you scoundrel, I charge you for detaining me from my business; then we went to the watchhouse together.</p>

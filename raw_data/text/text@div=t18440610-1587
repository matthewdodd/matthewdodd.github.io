On the 19th of May I saw the prisoners in a public-house at the corner of Barbican—there was a young woman in my company, who asked them to drink—we had rum and water—they did so, and the male pri<lb></lb>soner called for half-a-pint of gin—we drank the rum and water and gin toge<lb></lb>ther, and came out together—they asked where I was going—I said I was going home—they forced me very much to go and have something more to drink—I went into a public-house near the Post-office, and called for two glasses of brandy and water, which I paid for—we drank it together, and came out into Aldersgate-street—they asked me to go home with them, and took me to a room on the ground floor in a court in Aldersgate-street—they asked me to have supper—I refused—they had some—in the mean time one of the three asked me to take my hat off—I refused—one of the three said, "Take it off"—I asked for my hat a great many times, to go—they refused to give it to me—I got up and said I would go—one of the three put the candle out—the male prisoner immediately came up, collared me, and said, "Deliver up all you have, or it will be the worse for you"—I refused to do so—he imme<lb></lb>diately struck me on the head with a poker or some iron instrument, which felled me to the ground—the two females assisted him in doing so—the female prisoner was one of them—they beat me very much, and kicked me—I struggled to get off the ground—one of the three called out, "Get me a knife and I will cut the b—y b—'s throat"—I got up off the ground, and missed my watch from my fob—I begged them to spare my life whatever they did—I said, "Now you have robbed me of all I have, let me go"—they began to put their hands into my pocket, and took all I had—the two females opened the door and looked out—I made a plunge, got from the male prisoner, and he ran out after me and said, "Collar him, collar him; d——n his eyes, never let him go"—they all three got hold of my collar—I got from them again, and ran away, called a policeman, and made a complaint—I saw the prisoners again in about half an hour pass the end of the street, and pointed them out—I said, "There go two of the party;" and I heard Elizabeth Patterson say, "Run, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, run."</p>

There were five or six of them in company in the common tap room: they drank porter in a silver tankard: I was not very well, and went to bed about 9 or 10. The tankard was not missed till the next morning; then we recollected the two women who had been drinking out of it last: they went for sisters: Pomfret was taken that very night, and carried to the watch-house; and the next morning, before the bench of Justices, she confessed that she was the very person that stole my tankard: she had confessed it before me and two or three others before we went there. On the Friday morning Lambert was taken, and they were both at the Justice's together. Lambert owned she had part of the money the tankard was sold for: they both said, they employed

Pomfret said the tankard was in his possession all that night, and the next morning he brought the money. Lambert said, she knew her sister, whom she called Pomfret, stole the tankard, and they went directly to the Jew, and he sold it. We took up the Jew; he confessed he had the tankard in his hand, but said he gave it them again. I never got my tankard again.</p>

I said, Certainly you must know how that was come by, as there was my father's name on the bottom of it. He said, he could neither read nor write. I took him to my father's house also; then the constable had brought Pomfret out ready to go before the justice. There Pomfret confessed she stole the tankard, and that Lambert went along with her to the jew to sell it, and the Jew gave her a guinea, a 6 s. 9 d. and 3 s. 3 d. halfpenny; and after that he asked for something for his trouble, and she gave him 2 s.

            . I am beadle of Whitechapel. I went with the prosecutor and took the prisoner at the Three Compasses, Brick-lane, in company with about fourteen other women and men; he described her person before - she did not deny it - but several girls said she had been there a long time - I took her to the watch-house, and she gave up 10s. 31/2d.; I went to search her, and a piece of paper fell from her, which she picked up, and swallowed. Bardwell described the other woman, but I have not seen her since.</p>

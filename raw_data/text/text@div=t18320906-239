On the 28th of July, from one to half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was in Little Tothill-street, near Old Pye-street; I had received this money from a gentleman, and I am sorry to say he gave me a good deal to drink; I was the worse for liquor, but I remember I lost my purse and property - I had been into an eating-house at the corner of <placeName id="t18320906-239-crimeloc1347">Little Tothill-street</placeName>

             (Police-constable B 99). I took the prisoners, with the assistance of two other officers - I saw them leave the house with the prosecutor at half-past one o'clock in the morning - Bullock had hold of the prosecutor's arm, and the other two followed; I went back, and the keeper of the eating-house told me the prosecutor had some silver about him, and I had better look after them - I went, but lost sight of them; in about a quarter of an hour I passed the eating-house again, and heard of the robbery; I took the prosecutor to the watch-house, to take his name and address - I then went to Union-court, where I knew the prisoners lived; I met two of my brother officers - we went to their house; the door was locked - we stopped till about three o'clock - I was then coming away; my brother officer called me back, and he had the men in custody; I asked if they recollected being at the eating-house, and leaving it with a drunken man - they denied it; I sent for the prosecutor, and he identified them all - I found 11s. 9d. on Smith, 3d. on North, and 1 1/2d. on Bullock.</p>

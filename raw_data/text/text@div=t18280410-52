            . I am a saddler, and live on Saffron-hill. I know James Greenaway - he has met with an accident since this happened, and is in the hospital. On the 2d of March, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw him at the end of <placeName id="t18280410-52-crimeloc301">Cable-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

I saw the prisoner put his hand into Greenaway's pocket, and draw a handkerchief out - I was close to him: I turned round, and told Vincent, the constable, who was near - he was not out of my sight; I seized him directly, and the handkerchief was found under his jacket - the other got through the mob, and escaped; I should know him again, if I saw him - it happened at the ruins of the Brunswick Theatre.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. What were you doing there? A. I went to see the ruins. I saw the prisoner close behind the prosecutor, and directed my attention to him - he was close to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How then could you see the hand in the pocket? A. I did not see it till he had the handkerchief in his hand - he took it from the pocket; he did not stoop, and could not have picked it: off the ground, for I kept my eye on him: I had seen him attempt several pockets, and had followed him for five minutes or more. The last work I had to do, was for Mr. Colyer. Greenaway swore at Lambeth-street, that his name was James.</p>

            . I am a constable. I and Isaacs went together, to see the ruins; I saw the prisoner try several pockets, and told Isaacs to keep his eye on him: he told me soon after, that he had picked a pocket - I immediately secured him, and took this handkerchief from his pocket, which Greenaway claimed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from my aunt's, and saw this handkerchief on the ground - I took it up, and put it into my pocket.</p>

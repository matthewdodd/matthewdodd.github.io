He went on shore and staid some time, and came again with a pot of beer in his hand and made me drink, and said, he would meet me at Battle-bridge; and as I was coming up I called at another ship that lay at St. George's stairs, where some persons took me, and asked me what I had got; I told them I did not know, I had not touched it, but I thought it was sand; they let me go. Then two more came and stopped me and they let me go. Then these two men stopped me and sent for Mr. Scrivener, and he bid them let me go. But they said they should have 5 l. each for stopping me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Shepherd's Bush. On the morning of the 22nd of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I was coming out of Newgate-market, into Newgate-street, and three persons met me—they had the appearance of gentlemen by their dress—there were two porters coming from the wagons, and carrying a hamper, and the gentlemen surrounded me against Jenning's shop—the prisoner was one of the three—he was on my right, and as I turned to let the porters pass, the prisoner put his hand into my right-hand pocket, and drew out ray two bags, one containing eleven sovereigns, and the other four—he walked very gradually away, and I after him—I never lost sight of him—when he came to the corner of Ivy-Jane he cried out, "Tom, bring the flat, my cart is gone"—he then took to running, and I followed him, and called, "Stop thief"—he jumped over three flats, and a young man stopped him—I collared him at that identical moment—I was over the flats as soon as he was—he then put his right-hand into his coat pocket, and drew out one of my bags, which had eleven sovereigns in it—I seized his hand with it in it—the other bag was picked up with the four sovereigns in it.</p>

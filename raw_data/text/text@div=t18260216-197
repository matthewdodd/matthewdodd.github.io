I weighed it, and it weighed 3qrs. 5lbs.; I paid them 2l. 15s. for it, and said "What are you going to do next?" they said they had to go for some more to Clerkenwell. I filled up that tub in Kingsgate-street, and made it up to 5cwt. 18lbs. - it was then put into the cart by the prisoners, myself and other servants, to go to my melting house in Liquorpond-street;

            , my other servant, and the prisoners, went with it. I had seen a quantity in the warehouse in Liquorpond-street, that morning, in the pan- there was 2cwt. 2lbs. - the 5cwt. 18lbs. was to be added to it, and the weight of the cask deducted from it. Restall afterwards made some communication to me. I went with two men to Liquorpond-street, and weighed the fat very exactly - I found a deficiency of 2cwt, and 1qr. nearly. I did not see the prisoner again that day, though they said they should return with some more from Clerkenwell; they returned about noon the next day, and brought the same tub which they had taken, which then contained 4cwt. 1qr. and 16lbs. of fat; I weighed it, and said "You know I have been very uneasy, and uncomfortable about the losses I have had - what did you do with that tub of fat you took last night?" they said they had emptied it into the melting pan, which would have taken about twenty minutes. I told them I certainly must find out what they had done with the fat that was in the tub; they said they could bring people to prove where they had got the fat they had brought that morning; and Lodge said"No one saw it taken away;" I said they had. They then clenched their fists at the boy, and went away swearing; I gave information at the office, and they were taken in about six hours. I have never received any clue to know where they bought it - the value of the 2cwt. of greese would be 36s.; they get a profit by buying this grease and selling it to me. Lodge has been with me nearly five years, and Baylis three or four.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Do you collect your grease from different people? A. Yes; the last time I weighed the grease in Liquorpond-street, on the 16th, it weighed 4cwt. 1qr.; I had been there on the morning of the 15th, and there was some grease in the pan which I did not weigh - Reed, the officer, saw it weighed on the 16th. Restall and Freshingfield are employed in Liquorpond-street; when Restall is not there, Freshingfield locks the place, and brings me the key.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were they to do with the cask? A. They were to empty it clean out, and then weight it in the presence of George Restall; they were then to take it away empty, and get some more fat in it; if any part of it had been taken away I might have bought it again - it would have undergone no change whatever; I saw the grease on the 15th; it appeared to me to be 2cwt. and upwards.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RESTALL. I am servant to Thomas Knowles. I have been so for three or four years. I was at his shop in Orange-street when the prisoners brought the grease on the 15th - it was taken out of the scale and filled up with the stuff on the board, to 5cwt. 18lbs. - it was then put into the cart, and I drove it to Liquorpond-street - the two prisoners walked; I had seen 2cwt. 2lbs. put into the pan the day before, which came from Mr. Bullock's, and on the morning of the 15th, it appeared to be the same quantity; when I got to the warehouse I turned the cart round, and they got the cask by the side of the copper, and Baylis got the fork to empty it; I took hold of the fork, and Lodge gave me half a crown to go and get a feed of corn. I went, and was gone about five minutes, or not quite so much; I had not to go one hundred yards - on my return I saw the cask in the cart, upon its beam ends; I went into the melting-house and locked into the copper, and thought all was not right - I said nothing to the prisoners; they went into the street, where Albion said to Baylis, "We may as well have something to eat;" Baylis said "I was to have gone home to dinner - my wife has got a meat pudding, but she must not mind its being cold;" they then went up the steps of a public-house - I locked up the doors - they said to me "Come in;" I said I did not want any thing to drink, but I went into the house and spoke to my father - they offered me some beer but I would not have it. I was in the house about eight minutes, and then came out; I left them going along the passage. I went home to master and told him what I had seen - he came to the warehouse and weighed the fat, and took the weights - there was 4cwt. 26lb. in the pan, which was less by 217lbs. than I expected. I had kept the keys from the time I locked the door till my master got there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you weigh the grease on the 14th? A. Yes, and gave my master the account of it. Mr. Bullock was there when it was weighed; Freshingfield went to the warehouse as well as myself; I did not weigh the grease on the 15th. The pan is a large surface, and it would be difficult, without trying, to know what quantity was in it. The stuff put in on the 14th was kitchen stuff - about the same sort as that put in on the 15th- I did not look into the cask when the prisoners were gone into the public house - it laid on its side in the cart, with its mouth towards the tail.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you weighed it on the 14th? A Yes; and I saw it on the 15th - if there had been 2 cwt. gone, I should have missed it; I looked into the pan, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160088"></xptr>>it appeared all right; after I left the melting house, I gave the keys to my master.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor; I was present when the prisoner brought this cask to be weighed, in Kingsgate-street; I saw it loaded, and was in the shop when Restall came and gave information - we all three went and weighed the grease in the melting-pan - there was 2cwt. short of what there should have been; there was only 4cwt. 26lbs.; I had been there on the night of the 14th, when it was weighed - and we put upwards of 2cwt. into the pan, and 4cwt. and upwards was sent on the morning of the 15th; I saw the quantity on the morning of the 15th, before the cask was sent from the house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAYLIS' Defence. There was an opportunity for Restall to look into the cart, and it was his own offer to go and fetch the corn - he went and got some cat's-meat; a great part of the grease was emptied before he went away - when he returned he said nothing to us - we went and had some refreshment - he went home to his master's, as I suppose, after he had been with his father.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RESTALL. They asked me to get some dog's-meat - and I said, "I might as well get some for the cat;" I was not absent more than five minutes - I went for the meat while they were measuring the corn.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was there a tail-board to the cart? A. Yes; it was as high as the sides - I could not look over it without raising myself up.</p>

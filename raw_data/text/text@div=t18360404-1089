                  </hi>. I am a general dealer. On Sunday night last, between twelve and one o'clock, I was near Arbour-street, Arbour-square, in the Commercial-road—the prisoner and two more women met me—the other two left, but the prisoner got hold of my arm and wished me to go home with her—I walked a little distance, for about a minute or minute and a half, and I found she had got her hand in my breeches pocket, where I had bad six sovereigns just before—I felt, and missed three sovereigns—I am con<lb></lb>fident the prisoner must have had them—I felt her hand nea there—I accused her of stealing three sovereigns—she said she had not get them—I heard them rattle in her mouth—I put my finger to her mouth and felt one of them—I had seen her put her hand to her mouth—I offered her, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if she would return them. and said I would let her go; but if she did not deliver them up, I would call the police immediately—I did that—she tried to get away from me—as soon as the police made their appearance she threw her<lb></lb>self on the ground, took the sovereigns out of her mouth, and tried to con<lb></lb>ceal them about her person—when the policeman came up I told them I had been robbed of three sovereigns—one of them had a lantern—he looked and found them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You recollect you put your hand into your pocket, and pulled out your handkerchief, and three sovereigns fell on the ground, and then you knocked me down, and gave me the black eye I have now. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

At half-past twelve o'clock on Sunday night, there was a cry of "Police"—we made up to the place, and the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge for robbing him of three sovereigns—she <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> herself on the grounds—my brother officer took one hand and I took the other—we raised her up, and she dropped these three soveregins—she had crossed her legs—we pulled them open, and then the sovereigns appeared under her—I did not notice whether she had a black eye.</p>

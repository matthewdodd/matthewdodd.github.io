                  </hi>. I live in York-street, Westminster, On the 8th of Aug. I lost two geese—I saw them safe on the 7th of Aug., about the middle of the day, and missed them the next morning—I saw two at the station, which I have no doubt were mine, but geese are so much alike I did not swear to them.</p>

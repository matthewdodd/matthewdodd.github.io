We went to bed a little past eleven; I had these notes and bills in my pocket book, and in my purse was twenty-four sovereigns and a half guinea. I did not lock my room door. I have the numbers and dates of all the notes. When I went to bed my pocket book was in one trowser pocket and my purse in the other; when I awoke, about seven o'clock in the morning, my trowsers were on the floor, close to the chair; I believe I had put them on the chair; I was not disturbed in the night. I had received the 10 l. notes at the Bank a few days before, and at that time took the numbers and dates; they were all dated the 5th of November, 1821, and numbered from 6117 to 6131, both inclusive. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You cannot say where you left your trowsers - A. I generally leave them on the chair; I have no doubt but I did so then. The people of the house told me there was no visitor but us, and so I did not lock the door.</p>

I saw the prisoner there that evening with another person named Durley, alias Smith; they came together, and both slept there in one room on the third floor. They went to bed between nine and ten o'clock, and left about seven next morning. They had blue trowsers and Wellington boots on when they went away, very muddy, and would not wait to have them cleaned. The prosecutor slept on the second floor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you do not know whether he has any rich relations - A. I understand he has. He shewed me the sovereigns, and said he had done it, and could do it again, and almost pointed out the house where he did the robbery. He said there was a board sticking up to tell where he had done the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you do your last work - A. On Saturday; I worked for Mr. Christian. When I knew him, he lodged at my brother's house, which is the way I knew him. I never saw him with much cash before.</p>

            . I live in Catherine-street, Commercial-road. On the 18th of December, 1821, I went to Moulsey-hurst - the prisoner was one of the party, and Moriatt also. I saw Durley alias Smith there; he and the prisoner were dressed in Wellington boots, blue trowsers, and fustian shooting jackets, and new silk hats. The prisoner and Durley paid all the expences of the trip between them. Warren, the Excise-officer, is my brother-in-law; the prisoner bought a new silver hunting watch of him, on the 19th of December, 1821. The prisoner, I, and the party at the fight, had agreed to meet next morning, at the Star, public-house, and they came to us again in the evening, at the Roe-buck, public-house, Commercial-road, and we were to meet them next morning in Albion-street - we went there, but did not see them. A woman at the door said, the officers were in the house, and we had better go. I met the prisoner that day, and asked how long he had been from No. 12, Albion-street; he said not long - I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you not had some curious visitors there this morning," he said, No. I said if he had done anything he had better not go there again - he swore at me, and went away towards Albion-street, and in ten minutes after he came running to me, and begged of me to run with him; we both run to a public-house, at the back of the London Hospital, and had some refreshments; he said it would not be proper for him to be seen in Albion-street again, and begged I would not betray him - I said I would not. I saw him next day at Hackney. The last time I saw him was the 1st or 2d of January, 1822, and from that time not till eight months after.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 20th of December, 1821, I went to No. 12, Albion-street, Commercial-road, and saw a girl there - I asked for Bob and George; she said they were out. I searched the rooms, and found a blue surtout coat. I know Durley, I saw him at the office six months after the robbery, dressed in this shooting jacket, which was taken from him, (producing it) - he has been tried since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where did you lose it? A. I do not know - I lost other property at the same time - I had been drinking, and was off my guard.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130138"></xptr>I was not perfectly sober. I lost it in Whitechapel - I had it safe at seven o'clock. I was in company with Mr. Watson, a respectable man. I live in Mile-end-road - I had taken brandy and water - I fell in company with a woman in Whitechapel after I left Mr. Watson, about ten o'clock, and went to a house with her. I am sure I did not give her my watch - I gave her what I had in my waistcoat pocket, it was about five or six shillings. I will not swear that I gave her any thing - she told me that I did. I did not give her the watch, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Will you swear you did not give her your watch? A. Yes; I neither gave it, lent it, or sold it to any one - I gave information at Lambeth-street next morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. About what time did you leave Mr. Watson? A. About seven o'clock; I do not know whether my watch was safe then; I cannot say that I had it when I went into the woman's company - I missed it that night, and am almost positive that I spoke about it that night - I named it to the woman, as she observed, that if she had known I had lost it, she would not have invited me in.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the 29th of August I assisted in searching a house in Bell-alley, Petticoat-lane, Spitalfields - I believe it is No.12; the prisoner was there; one party secured her- I went up stairs, and did not hear her say any thing; she went up stairs, and saw me searching there - she was secured, with her son and servant, in the first floor; we went up to a bed-room on the second floor; there was a large four-post bedstead, which I removed, and on moving part of the flooring, about a foot and a half in size, I found this watch, with its face upwards - there was another watch and several other things there; Limbrick and the others were searching the first floor. It is a private house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you see her son there? A. I saw a young man about eighteen, and a person she called her servant; she was about twenty-one or twenty-two; I took them into custody; they were discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. I went with the other officers; I got first into the house, and saw the prisoner in a little back parlour; I asked her name - she said Solomons; I asked if she owned the house - she said Yes; I said we had a warrant to search - she made a great noise, and the officers came in; I sent her up stairs: I remained below some time, and fastened the doors. I then went up, and saw Edwards take the watch out of the hole - I asked if it was her bed-room - she said it was, and that she slept there; we took her and the property away.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRETT. I am clerk of the papers at Newgate. Isaac Solomons ceased to be in our custody on the 25th of May; there was no discharge lodged for him; he was taken to the Court of King's Bench, by a Habeas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William White and his part<lb></lb>ner, silk—mercers, in Blackfriar's-road—neither of them reside in the house—the servants live in the house. On the 24th of December, about half—past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for some silk to make a bonnet—I showed her a variety of pieces, and sold her a small quantity off one of them—I had occasion to turn my back for a few minutes, and as I came back I saw her take this piece of silk off the counter, and place it under her cloak—she purchased a few small articles, and paid for them, and was leaving the shop—when about half way out, this piece of silk dropped form under her cloak on the floor—she took it up again, and placed it again under her cloak—she went to a counter in another part of the shop—I there charged her with stealing the silk, and found it under her cloak—the end of the silk was wound round her arm at the time I found it, and the roller was falling on the ground—I went for an officer—it was sixty—one yards of silk, and worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the retail price; the wholesale price would be shout 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. On the 24th of July, as I was going in at the gate these two men were coming out of the gate of Mr. Buckler's premises, Casey had got Lane's jacket under his arm, I asked him what he had got, he said he did not know; I asked him to turn it out of the jacket, he did, it was lead. The two prisoners were both coming out together; there was a knife belonging to Casey with it. I discharged them both from the ground, and locked the door. I examined upon the top of the building, the lead did not fit, the middle piece had been taken away. The lead was fresh cut, and the lead found upon Casey was fresh cut. The lead was cut away from the house belonging to Mr. Buckler.</p>

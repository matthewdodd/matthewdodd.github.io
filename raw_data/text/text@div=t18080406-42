Yes, about half past eight in the evening, it was dark, he asked me to shew him some screens; he desired me to send a gilt one, and a plain one to No. 16, Beaufort's buildings, to a lady for choice; I told him the plain one was six shillings, and the gilt one was seven shillings and sixpence; he desired me to send them immediately; he supposed the lady would choose the plain one; he went out of the shop, he returned before I could have an opportunity to send the boy; he desired me not to delay, but to send them immediately; I sent them by the boy

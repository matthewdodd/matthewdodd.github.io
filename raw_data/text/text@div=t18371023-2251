               <p>in Princes-street, Cavendish-square.

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Kenrick. The pri<lb></lb>soner and I used to work together at the same stable—in June last the witness gave me a cheque to take to Richard Stevens—he was outside—the prisoner took it out of my hand, said he knew Mr. Broome over the way, and would go and get it cashed—I did not see the prisoner and Stevens together in the yard—I have never said I saw Stevens, and handed him the cheque, saying, "You are to get this changed "—this is my hand writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his signature to the deposition</hi>)—which being read, stated that he went to Stevens, who was with the prisoner in the yard, that he said to Stevens, "You are to take this, "holding out the cheque," and get it changed," and the prisoner took it out of his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 158, Oxford-street. I have not got the cheque here—I sent it to Ransom's bank for payment—there is nobody here from Ransoms—all the witnesses the Magistrate called for are in attendance—the prisoner came and asked me to cash a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Kenrick, and I gave him nine sovereigns and a £5 note; and not having enough cash in hand, I gave him a cheque of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my own bankers as a balance.</p>

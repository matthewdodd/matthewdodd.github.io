On the 5th of April the prisoner came to my master's with another person, and dined in the first floor front room - two other persons dined at the same table - they paid for what they had; I left the prisoner and the other person alone for a quarter of an hour, and as I went up again the other man ran by me as fast as he could - the prisoner remained in the room at the same seat as he had dined at; I went into the room, and saw one drawer a little open, and a piece of trimming hanging out of it - I missed these articles from that drawer; I found the gown under the table where the prisoner sat, the rest were quite gone; the drawer could not have been opened without the prisoner seeing it - he sat with his hand down close to where the gown was - I asked what ailed him - he said he had a pain in his side - he had come with the other man, and the prisoner paid for both; I bolted the door, and rang the bell - the prisoner jumped up and opened the door - I went after him, seized him, and held him till master came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did the other two pay for what they had? A. Yes; they had left - I went down for change - I had not noticed the drawer open before they left.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The other men did not run away? A. No- the drawers were not above a yard from the table.</p>

               <p>EDMUND PEPPER. I am a constable. On the 22d of October, I was in Cranbourn-street, about seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoners, Wood and Randall, lurking about, and Shields standing at a window; all three went into Covent-garden together - I followed them into Drury-lane and saw Wood and Randall attempt a shop in Princes-street; they waited about a few minutes, and then went into Holborn to a pawnbroker's shop at the corner of Bloomsbury-steps; Wood went in, and the other two waited at the door; I had not seen the coat - I went into the shop and found him offering it in pledge; I asked him where he got it, he said a boy at the door gave it to him - I called Brothers, who was with me, and gave him in charge; I went out and brought the other two in and took them to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I had not seen the coat all the way.</p>

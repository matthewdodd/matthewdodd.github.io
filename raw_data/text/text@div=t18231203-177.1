            . I am a builder. On Monday, the 20th of October, I examined these premises, and found three gutters stripped of the lead; and seeing some left, I thought they would come again. Sheen was set to watch; and on Tuesday, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I came out and saw some men lurking about - they spoke to each other and went away, and in about twenty minutes I heard Stapleton was taken. I went to the premises, and found the lead thrown from the gutters. 8 or 10 cwt. was stolen that night - about 2 cwt. was found.</p>

            . I am a farrier, and live in Church-street. On the evening of the 21st of October, I saw two men (not the prisoners) lurking about these premises - I watched them from half-past six till twenty minutes to eight o'clock. Sheen came up. I went with him to the shed, and found Stapleton laying under a cart, on the premises. The gate had been padlocked - they could creep under the gate into the yard - the lead was just by him, and inside the shed I found a coat, which I am positive belonged to the prisoner Robins - I have seen him wear it - I knew both the prisoners before.</p>

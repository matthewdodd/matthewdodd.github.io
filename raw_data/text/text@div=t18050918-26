               <p>Q. Did you ever find your handkerchief again? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HARDY sworn. - I am a shoe-maker, I live on Saffron-hill; I saw these two men follow the gentleman from the corner of Shoe-lane into St. John's-court, just by Holborn, in the way to Cow-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before? - A. I have seen them at the Distillers Arms public-house just facing where I live; I saw Perkins put his hand into the gentleman's right hand pocket, and take out his handkerchief; Thompson was along with him at the time; when Perkins had taken the gentleman's handkerchief out of his pocket, he put it in his bosom, and they both ran away down St. John's-court into Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the two men? - A. Yes, I am certain of it, and I informed the gentleman of it; as I was going home I saw Thompson go down Field-lane; he went into a shop, and offered the handkerchief for sale.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden: On the 8th of August, from information, I went to the Distillers Arms, Saffron-hill; the prisoners were pointed out to me; I did not find any thing on them; when I handcuffed them, they said, if ever they got their liberty, they would take away the boy's life.</p>
               <p>Perkins's defence. I belong to the Tower-hamlets; I had just come from my regiment, and finding nobody at home I went up to the Distillers Arms to get a pint of beer; the boy first pointed out another man; I was then in the yard, and the boy pointed out me afterwards, and said, that is him.</p>
               <p>White. He made his escape through the back window into the privy when he saw us.</p>
               <p>Thompson's defence. I am totally innocent of the crime; I am very well informed that Mr. White bribed the boy, and promised to buy him a hat if he would swear the same at the Old-Bailey; he gave him sixpence then.</p>
               <p>White. I gave him sixpence to buy him some bread and cheese; the boy was hungry, and had no money: I never promised him any thing.</p>

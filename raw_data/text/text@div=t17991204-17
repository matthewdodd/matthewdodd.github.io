               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. (Counsel for Smith.)</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Smith bought three yards of white, and three of black lace? - A. Yes; and she paid likewise for a remnant that was purchased between the two; she paid two pounds, two shillings, and sixpence, altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by purchasing it between them? - A. Mrs. Jane said she would have it, and Mrs. Smith paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it she did say? - A. She said she would have it; they were both looking at it.</p>
               <p>Q. They were looking over a great quantity of lace? - A. Yes; when a person asks for lace, we always shew them a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Smith agree with you about the price of it? - A. She paid for it, but Mrs. Jane agreed for the price; I said nine shillings and sixpence, and Jane said she would give it, and the others did not object to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Mrs. Jane for the money? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mrs. Smith had paid you, you turned your attention to the other? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you saw Mrs. Smith do nothing but bargain for the lace, and pay for the lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mrs. Smith at your shop before? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not told half a dozen people that you never saw her in your shop before? - A. I do not know that I have ever been asked the question.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many friends of your master and mistress who have heard you? - A. I never did say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you never said so? - A. Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Jane.)</p>
               <p>Q. Saturday night is a busy night? - A. Yes, we are in general.</p>
               <p>Q. How many fellow shopmen have you? - A. Men and boys, there were nine.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not all here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they have been in the shop? - A. Half an hour, or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How many partners has your master? - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not often happen that lace will fall off the counter? - A. Sometimes it will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was it possible for a card of lace to slip into the straw box? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DELIGHT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. (Produces the lace.) I was seht for by Mr. Green: I took the two prisoners to Marlborough-street; this card of lace was given me by Mr. Watson, and has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Watson. This is the same lace that I picked off the floor; it is Mr. Green's property; it cost us more than fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Jane's defence. I never offered to pay Mrs. Green for any articles that were lost before; she offered to let me go if I would pay for them, and upon my refusal, she sent for a constable.</p>

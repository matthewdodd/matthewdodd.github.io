               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of those persons? - A. The prisoner was the person that did every thing,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030018"></xptr>the other did nothing; I founded it, and told him I could not change it; I pulled out the till, which had silver in it, and I said, yes, sir, I can; and I took the purse out of the till, which he snatched out of my hand; and as he was wrenching it out of my hand, he could not get it out of my hand easy; he dropped a seven-shilling-piece out of it; then they both ran away with the purse, and the money that was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in your purse? - A. I cannot say positively to the money that was in the purse, I put, myself, into it, in the afternoon, a guinea and some silver; and there was gold and silver in the purse before, but how much I cannot say.</p>


               <p>Q. Was there any struggle between you? - A. No, it was a sudden snatch; I was frightened, and put down the silver that I had in my other hand to endeavour to save the purse, but he got it from me, and ran away.</p>

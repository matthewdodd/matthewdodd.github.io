I said, I was coming to London: he said, coming down Holborn, Will you have any beer? he took me in at the French-horn; we had some beer and bread and cheese; then we went to another house, and had some bacon and eggs for supper. I was going to sleep; he said, You shall not sleep here. I said, Where shall I sleep? then he said, I know a place. He took and shoved me into this place, and said, Go and sleep there: he gave me some keys, and said, When you wake, lock the door again: he said, the things all belonged to him.</p>

            . I am a smith and bell hanger, No. 2, Gutter Lane. On the 28th of January, about half past six in the evening, I had occasion to come out of doors, I saw the prisoner at the bar plant himself at the top of <placeName id="t18110220-9-crimeloc44">Gutter Lane</placeName>

As I was standing the off side of the way, a little boy came with a parcel upon his head, the prisoner snatched it from his head, and came running down the lane, the boy cried out, I ran across the street, threw the prisoner down, and tumbled on top of him. At the time that we were down, there came up a young man who appeared to lay hold of him, and while I was picking up my hat he let him go. I immediately pursued after him, and catched him again after he had ran eight or ten yards, I took him and the property to the Poultry Compter, I never lost sight of him, he was never away from me ten yards. I saw the prisoner take the thread from the boy's head.</p>

On the 7th of January some clothes hung just inside my door; the prisoner was walking by my window for full a quarter of an hour, and two others with him - my wife was taken very ill; I ran into the back place, and when I came back I saw the prisoner with his hand on the trousers - I ran after him, and two doors off he gave them to another person; I followed, and he ran up a court which was no thoroughfare - he turned, walked back, and I took him; I have never seen the trousers since.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GOOK. I am a constable. I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He said he suspected me of being one of the party, and the constable said that would not do, he must commit me on a charge of felony - the next day he said I took them, but before he had never said such a word - he said if I would produce them he would not prosecute me.</p>

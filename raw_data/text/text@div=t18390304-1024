                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. At half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 23rd of February, I was at the Marquis of Granby, at Knightsbridge, in the parlour, and saw the prisoner—she was a stranger to me—I went home with her to a street in Westminster I do not know the name of it—I agreed to stop all night with her—I went up stairs to bed about one o'clock—I was sober—I fell asleep—I awoke about three o'clock—when I went there I had seven half-crowns, a half-sovereign, and four or five shillings, and three sixpences, in my coat pocket—I put my coaton a chair at the foot of the bed—a female and a man came into the room about three o'clock—they awoke me, and wanted me to leave the room—the prisoner was then gone—I took hold of my coat, and my money was gone—I cannot say whether those persons who came in might have taken it—I refused leav<lb></lb>ing the room—I put on my clothes—the two persons remained in the room, and another man came in—I staid till the policeman came—they fetched the prisoner—she said at first she had not seen me—I said I knew her, and she had robbed me—I am sure she is the person.</p>

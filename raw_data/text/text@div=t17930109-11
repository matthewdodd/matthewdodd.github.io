               <p>I had lived with Mr. Finney four years and a half; between the hour of seven and eight on Friday, the 4th of January, in the evening the prisoner came backward, and went down into the cellar, and took the iron rods out of the cellar, and he went out of doors, when we went out of doors leaving off work, he whipped up the court, and took him on his shoulder, this was about eight o'clock, he had left them in that court, it is a private court. I asked him what he was going to do with them, he said, he was going to sell them to make up some rent, he said, he could sell them at three or four places, and asked me to go with him, we went to a house in Petticoat-lane, the man's name was Jones; Ireland offered him the rods to sell, and Jones offered him a penny a pound, the price of old iron, Ireland said, that would not do, he said, he would go up further, and see if he could get more, in the mean time Mr. Armstrong came in, and he asked whose rods they were? Ireland made answer and said, they are mine, he said more than that, he thought it very hard he could not go, and sell his own property, as he wanted money so bad; then Mr. Armstrong laid hold of him, and ordered somebody to take the curtain rods; these are the same that are now secured, they were Mr. Finney's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you to have any share of this money? - No, there was no mention of a share.</p>

               <p>Q. It seems to me a strange thing that he should trust you with the secret, except you was to have some advantage by it? - I am sure I was to have none, nor did he mention a word to me about it.</p>

(The examination was not taken in writing.) This was when he was waiting in the office to be examined; they were examined, and the next morning Mr. Finney came to the office, and claimed them, this was Friday night they were taken. Holland was admitted an evidence on the Monday following; he was committed on Friday till Monday, and then bail was given for him on Monday night, he has been at large ever since.

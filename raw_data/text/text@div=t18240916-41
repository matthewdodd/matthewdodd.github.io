            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 27th of July, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoner coining from the back premises, about thirty yards from Mr. Selby's, with a basket, a bundle, and a blue cloth cap in his hand; I asked what he had been doing there: he said he saw the cap over there, and went to pick it up. I said,</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you have picked up something else" - he said he had not, and that he came from Clapton: I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got in this basket;" he said,</p>
               <p>"What is that to you" - I said,</p>
               <p>"I insist upon knowing;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Where is your authority, you shall not see without." I put my hand to the bundle, and we had a fall; I let him get up, and we then had another fall; he then

             a clasp knife, and said with an oath that he would be my butcher; he ran at me with it, to cut or stab me: I saw a man of the name of

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner come straight up to you - A. Yes, he was about thirty yards from me; he could see me, and we both walked up to each other; he did not run away: he walked up to me, and we stopped. I had not got my patroles' coat on.</p>

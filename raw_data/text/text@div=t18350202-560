                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jeremiah Lyons, and live in Cow-lane, Shadwell. On the 26th of January, I went to drink at the Duke of York, in High-street, Shadwell, at eleven o'clock at night—I had met with Ann Robinson, a dress-maker, and went in there, and called for a quartern of gin and a pint of beer—I took out my money, paid for it, and then had a five-shilling piece and a sixpence left—as I was rather in liquor, Robinson</p>

               <p>took them out of my hand, put them into my tin muff-box, and put them in my bosom, and I gave her a glass of gin—I did not want any myself—I had had some—the prisoner was there, and asked me to give him a glass of gin, which I did—I then went out—he came after me—put his hand round my neck, and took my box and money out of my bosom with his other hand—I said, "Give me my box"—he said, "When I have taken a pinch of snuff"—the officer took him, and has the money.</p>

I never spoke to him in my life until I was in the Duke of York—I had seen him in the street, like another man—I had not drank with him at the White Hart, and at the Ship and Dolphin—I was not sober—I had had some ac<lb></lb>quaintances at home that day—I did not give him the money in the box—he took it by force—I tried to prevent him.</p>

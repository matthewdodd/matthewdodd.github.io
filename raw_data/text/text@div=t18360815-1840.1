                  </hi>. I live at Colney, near St. Albans. On the 7th of July, I was on my road, between Mimms and Barnett, about five o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner and another woman—the prisoner caught hold of me and began to ask me questions—I said I did not want them—she asked me to go with her—I refused—she than began to get my frock up, and get her hands into my pockets, I suppose—I felt her hands about that part of my person—she left me for two or three minutes—I felt for my watch and missed it—I went after them—the prisoner joined the other girl—I got up to them, and said to the prisoner, "You have got my watch"—she denied it two or three times—I said I knew she had it—she said she had picked up one, if that was mine, I was very welcome to it, and gave it to me out of her bosom—it was mine—I also missed two shil<lb></lb>lings and a purse—a policeman came up and took her—I gave him my watch—the other girl did not come close enough to me to take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on the spot, and saw the prosecutor and two girls—only one went close to him, from what I observed—I watched, and saw the prisoner stop him—I saw her hand under his smock frock, and in three or four minutes she ran away from him—I saw him feeling in his pockets, then turn back and follow her—he caught her, and when I got up I asked him what was the matter—he said he had been robbed by the prisoner—I followed and caught her—I asked her if she</p>

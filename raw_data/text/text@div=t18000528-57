               <p>Q. Is that the way you buy sheep often? - A. Not in common; and the next day I sent my son for the five sheep to old Mr. Field's house; my son brought them, they were pole ewe sheep; I killed one that night, and turned the other four into my field; on the 12th, Robinson, the drover, and his son, came and claimed them; on the Wednesday, young Robinson came down again for the skin, I gave it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever pay for the sheep? - A. No; the drover told me I might kill the other four, and sell them, that was at Hatton-garden; I asked what I was to do with them.</p>

             (the younger) sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. My father and I are drovers to Mr. Tingey: On the 10th of March last, Mr. Tingey lost nine little pole ewe sheep, marked over the loins; my father and I went to Enfield-highway on the Wednesday afterwards, to the prisoner's father's house, and from there I went to Mr. Grover's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in your way to Mr. Grover's house, did you see the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At Mr. Grover's did you find any thing? - A. Yes; the skin of a sheep that was killed, and four alive in the field; I believed them to be the sheep; when I came back to my father's, in my way back I saw the prisoner, he was on horseback, I was in the path, and he was in the road; I asked him whether he knew of any wrong sheep that road; he smiled, and said, no, he did not know of any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you had lost any? - A. Yes; I told him we had lost nine, I did not tell him where they were lost from; then he went on, and I came on; then I went back to old Mr. Field's house, which is a public-house, and found the sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the skin? - A. Yes; Grover gave me a skin some days after.</p>
               <p>Grover. The skin that I gave to him was the skin of the sheep that I killed; Mr. Spilling the constable has the skin.</p>
               <p>- SPILLING sworn. - I am a constable, (produces the skin); it was delivered to me at Hatton-garden-office by young Robinson; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Robinson. I cannot swear that this is the same skin.</p>
               <p>Tingey. I believe this to be the skin of one of the sheep that I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never had any more sheep but what I had honestly paid for; I did not know any thing about the sheep before Tuesday morning; I mentioned to Mr. Grover that I had got some sheep at home, and asked him if he wanted any; I told him he might have a score, or half a score, or fifteen, or any number he pleased; finding these sheep came wrong into my drove, and not knowing where they came from, I sent them to Mr. Grover's to be killed, because they were sinking in flesh; the other four I let Mr. Harman have; I told him they came wrong into my drove, I did not know the price, and when I learned the price I would let them know, for they should pay no more than I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280058"></xptr>did; Robinson came down on the Wednesday, and I paid him for the nine sheep; he took fifteen guineas from me for them, one pound fifteen shillings a-piece; he told me they were his property; I told young Grover to tell his father I did not know the price of them, when I found out the owner I would let him know.</p>

             (the elder.) sworn. Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When these sheep were found out at Grover's did you receive any money for them? - A. Yes, I did; I received three five pound notes, half-a-guinea, and two half-crowns, and I gave him sixpence back, which made fifteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the market price of the sheep when they were lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that been put to the account of Mr. Tingey? - A. I left it at Mr. Tingey's book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before the man was taken up? - A. Yes, some days.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you that money? - A. William Field.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you authorized to do that by Mr. Tingey? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Tingey know that that stands to his account? - A. Yes; but I took the money on my own account; I was at the loss of the sheep.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called fifteen other witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

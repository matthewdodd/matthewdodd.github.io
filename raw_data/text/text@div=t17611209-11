             came in to ask me to fetch down a velvet cap that lay for about 6 d. that she said was her husband's. I left her in the shop by herself, and went and fetched it, and discharged her. I do not remember any body was in the shop by besides her. My usual way is, when I take in goods, to deposit them under the counter, and the next day take them all off, and put them all up in by warehouses till called for. When I came to book the things, the apron and some other things were missing. (The prisoner is one of the last women that I should have mistrusted). Then I thought to lay a scheme to find out the person that had taken the things. I gave it out about the Friday following, that I should be at home by myself, and I knew the prisoner knew that I had given it out. I placed a man at my window in the kitchen, which has a full view of the shop, and I had darkened the kitchen; the prisoner came in about five o'clock, and said, Ship, I want an apron that has been here some time. Then I said, you know that I am at home alone, and I can not go to leave my shop, and nobody here; I can't find it. Then she said, go and fetch that cap, that I brought again the other day. I went up into the warehouse, and took the cap, and came to the stair-head. I heard the gentleman that I had planted in the kitchen say to her, you would have robbed Mr. Ship's house if it had not been for me, I'll take my oath of it. Thinks I this man has been too rash, she has only attempted it. When I came down she threw me the money that was due to me, and said, look for the apron to-morrow, for that will be wanted. As soon as she was gone away, said the man, that woman is a thief, and I would have you take care of her; inquire into her character. I sent to Mrs. Geery that lives near me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Ship. I live in Long-alley, Moorfields. I sent to her to know if she had such an apron as I missed at her house. I had informed the person whose property it was, that it was taken away, and she had brought an d left with me a piece of the same cloth to compare with it if I should hear of it. I sent that piece. Mrs. Geery let me know she had such an apron, which she took in of

               <p>I was at Mr. Ship's shop, and Mrs. Saloway was there. Mr. Ship went and fetched my cap, it was not my husband's. I went home about my business; after that I went to this woman's house for a peny worth of cheese for my supper; something catched me and tore my pattin. I looked down and saw something; I took it up, and it was an apron in a paper. I said to my husband, I have found something here. I shewed it him, and the next day I went and carried it to Mrs. Geery, and said I wanted money on it. She asked me whose it was. I said it was a young woman's apron, and she lent me 4 s. on it. I had been at Mr. Ship's house since, and it is a wonder he did not say to me he had lost an apron.</p>
               <p>Q. to Geery. Did the prisoner tell you whose it was?</p>
               <p>Geery. She said it was a young woman's, and cost her half a guinea, and she saw half a guinea paid for it. I lent her 4 s. upon it, or at least I rubbed it off her score, as she owed me money.</p>

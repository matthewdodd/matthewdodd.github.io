                  </hi>. I manage the business of my father, George Dixon, who keeps the Worcester Arms public-house, in George-street, Portman<lb></lb>square; I know the prisoner—he is a tailor; his mother keeps a lodging-house on the opposite side of the street. On the 24th of Jan. I saw the prisoner at the bar of my father's house—he had a pint of half-and-half, and paid for it with three penny pieces—before he paid for it he produced this cheek, and asked for change for it—I gave him change, seven move<lb></lb>reigns and a half—I presented it next day at Sir Claude Scott's—it was not paid—they wrote on it, "No account."</p>

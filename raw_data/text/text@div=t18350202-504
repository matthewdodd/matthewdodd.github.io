                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Whiteaves, a silversmith, in Fleet-street. On the 26th of March, 1834, the prisoner came to master's house, and brought this silver sugar-basin and tea-caddy, with a silver inkstand, a fold<lb></lb>ing eye-glass, and some silver coin—the whole weighed 60 ounces 2 penny<lb></lb>weights, which I bought of him—we put it in our window—I afterwards saw the sugar-basin and caddy in possession of the last witness—it is a remarkable sugar-basin—I never saw one like it before—I am certain it is the sugar-basin the prisoner sold us—he said he lived near Newbury, in Berks—I never knew him live in London—I knew him before—when he came in, he said, "How do you do? Here are a few articles I have to sell, which the persons in the country are necessitated to sell in consequence of the badness of the times"—in consequence of his saying that, and having bought, some articles before of him, I did not suspect him—he did not mention who the country people were—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce for it as old silver—he came again, on the 6th of January, to sell another quantity of plate, and we detained him on account of having had information from Makepeace—we told him we should give him into cus<lb></lb>tody in consequence of our buying plate of him stolen from Colonel Bla<lb></lb>grave—his answer was, "I am not the thief"—I said we detained him to clear our own character, as there was some imputation cast on the charac<lb></lb>ter of the house—I said, "I hope you will be able to clear your cha<lb></lb>racter"—he hesitated a good deal, and I said, "But you say nothing"—he replied, "I have enough to do to think"—we took Colonel Blagrave's arms off the plate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask the prisoner how the people who were necessitated to sell the sugar-basin happened to have arms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it did not strike me as odd—there was the crest on one side, and the arms on the other—it is usual to take the arms out—I thought he might be an honest man, and he might be sent up to sell them—he did not say they were poor people—he said people were very much distressed, and were obliged to sell it—I cannot tell what quantity of plate he brought the second time—it is in the officer's hands—I weighed the pencil-case—it was 3 ounces—there was a silver tea-pot and stand, a sauce-ladle, and table and tea-spoons—I did not weigh them—there was not time.</p>

               <p>JOHN CARLISLE. I am an officer. On last Wednesday week I happened to be at the watchhouse in Coweross, the prisoner was brought in on suspicion of stealing a barrel. The next night I saw the prisoner, by Peter's Lane. I tapped at the watch-house, asked the officer how the man got on that was in for the barrel. He said he got off. I said, He goes, with a piece of wood on his shoulder. They came out of the watch-house, and went after. He asked him where he got that; he said he it. The officer took him to the watchhouse, and or three minutes Mr. Pearcy came into the watchhouse and claimed the piece of wood. He said it was for a shoemaker's cutting board.</p>
               <p>- HUDSON. I was officer of the night. I went out and apprehended the prisoner with this board on his shoulder; he told me he bought it of a man in the street. I said that is the same story you told me last night. He said yes, he bought this board and the barrel in the same way. This is the cutting board. Mr. Pearcy came to the watchhouse, and owned it.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The cutting board is mine; this is my mark on it.</p>

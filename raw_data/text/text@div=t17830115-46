               <p>Court. How lately had you seen it before the 10th? - I had not seen it lately.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know but it might have been lost a good while ago? - From the confession of Le Cane having purchased it; I saw them in March or April, 1781: Le Cane afterwards surrendered himself, and acknowledged that he bought them of Milton and Beamey; he was to give at the rate of 4 guineas an hundred.</p>
               <p>How much were they worth a hundred from hop factors? - The valuation was 3 l. 15 s. it seems he had been deceived in it; they persuaded him that they were smuggled, but that they were worth a great deal more.</p>

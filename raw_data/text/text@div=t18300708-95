I was sent for - the prisoner denied the charge; I searched him, and felt some money in his breeches - he popped his hand to it, and said, "Oh, that is only the lining of my trousers;" and after that, as I could not find the money, I made him take his breeches off; we got a candle, and in the room he worked I found a loose brick in the wall, which I took out, and found a purse with the ear-rings, brooch, and other things in it - I afterwards found 6s. tied up in the tail of his shirt; I asked him where the other money was - he pointed to a place, where I found 4s.; I found an instrument in the room he worked in, which matched with the marks on the drawers.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

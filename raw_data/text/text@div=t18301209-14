            . I am a Policeman. On the 15th of November I was in Queen-square - Holman gave me information, and from her description, on the 16th, at night, I apprehended the prisoner, walking with a girl of the town in Tothill-street, at a quarter-past ten o'clock, about a quarter of a mile from Millbank-street; I stopped her, and asked her name, which she refused to give - I said I should lock her up till I went to Millbank-street; she then said, "What will they do with me?" I then asked where she lived - she said at No. 23, Great Almonry; I took her there, and found in the room she took me to, in a bundle under the bed, all the property except a cotton dress - I had said if she would produce the property it would be better for her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

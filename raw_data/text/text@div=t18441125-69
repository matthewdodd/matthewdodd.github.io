I was on duty in High-street, Aldgate, about six o'clock in the evening, on the 1st of Nov., and saw the three prisoners—M'Carthy had the cask of butter on his shoulder—Mallows was walking on his right side, and Carthy on his left—when she saw me pass them, she fell back in the rear of the two men, and I turned back to pursue them—Carthy immediately said, "Oh, he is done"—M'Carthy then dropped the cask of butter, and ran down Petticoat-lane—I pursued him, and Mallows ran off—I took M'Carthy, and Carthy attempted to rescue him—she was very violent, and nearly bit my left cheek off—she threw her arms round my neck, and said, "You shan't have him now"—M'Carthy resisted very much, and others attempted to rescue him.</p>

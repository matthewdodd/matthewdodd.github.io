I left him up stairs for pretty near an hour, I know not the day, it is not a fortnight ago. After he was gone I missed a silver spoon, and could not suspect any body but him. I got a warrant of justice Fielding to search his lodgings. Then the prisoner own'd he had taken it, and open'd a drawer; he took it out, and gave it to the constable, and fell on his knees and ask'd pardon (produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Q. Has it any mark on it?</p>
               <p>Bird. No, it has not.</p>

               <p>Bird. Mine had no mark upon it, and the prisoner own'd it was my spoon.</p>

            , at the banking house. I was in Newgate-street, between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the 1st of February, and saw the prisoner noticing people's pockets as they passed - I watched him. I noticed Mr. Sieck; the prisoner got up to him, put his hand in his pocket, and 
               <persName id="t18230219-25-person282">drew</persName>
             the handkerchief out - I was not two yards from him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190015"></xptr>at the time. A woman was walking with him - I said to him,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed that gentleman." I made a catch at the handkerchief, and caught him by the cuff of his coat; he put himself in an attitude to strike me - I then let go of his hand which had the handkerchief in it, and in the mean time the woman came up, and caught me by the collar, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go along, what have you to do with that man" - she let go of me, took the handkerchief from the prisoner, and went off with it. Mr. Sieck came up, and said he had lost his handkerchief - the prisoner was secured before he was out of my sight. I knew his person before, and am certain of him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 1st of February, I was on the opposite side of the way, and I saw people collected, and found the witness accusing the prisoner of having stolen the handkerchief - I took him. I found nothing but a few halfpence and an old clothes brush on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your Lordship and Gentlemen, I stand charged with stealing a handkerchief, which I deny - though it is of little use, for you are bound to give a verdict according to the evidence, and it is my misfortune to be in custody at a time when I am too poor to employ counsel. I understand two persons can prove my innocence, but have nobody to send for them. I was convicted here at a former period, and soon liberated having His Majesty's Most Gracious pardon. All I can say is that in this, as in the former case, I have been pursued by bad men, who seek my destruction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Moses Abraham Collis. We live in (Cross-street, Saffron-hill—on Saturday afternoon, the 31st of Jan., I was passing down Long-lane, about a quarter past two o'clock—a woman came and asked her way to Islington, and several other questions—she kept on talking, and the prisoner Lawson pushed against me—I moved to allow him to pass—he then stood on the curb, and looked across the way, as if towards a shop—I then passed on—there were two men walking before me, who prevented my walking as fast as I would—before I got to the bottom of the lane a young man told me something, which induced me to look after my purse, and I missed it from my pocket—I had had it safe not a quarter of an hour before—it contained two brooches, a neck-chain, one earring, a sovereign, and a steel purse inside the velvet one—after I had moved for Lawson to pass, he stood looking over the way, then he and Rixon came behind me, and all on a sudden they rushed past me, and then the young man told me they had got my purse.</p>

I said to Mr. Brown, "You had better go and apprehend this man," giving a description of the man—I was then sent again to Clerkenwell—I was again examined at Worship-street—I asked Brown if he had apprehended the person—he said "No" and I was committed—I had a friend came to see me here—I said, "Have you heard about the apprehension of this man Elderfield"—he said, "No"—I told him to go to the office and inform the magistrate of the person, giving him a descrip<lb></lb>tion of the man—Graves the officer from Worship-street, came down to me—I was called to Mr. Cope's office—he brought a little note with him with the name of the person on it—he said, "Is this the person you want?"—I said, "Yes, it is"—he said' "Perhaps I can find the man; I do not know whether I can or not"—he went away, and I never heard any thing more of him, till my wife came down and told me that the man had been apprehended and examined at Worship-street, and they let him go again—as to my knowing the things came through a dishonest channel—I knew it no more than an infant unborn—I understand the man has since absconded—he was apprehended and I could do not more than I did, as an individual locked up in jail.</p>

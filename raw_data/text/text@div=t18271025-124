I lost the property stated in the indictment on the night of the 16th of September - I went to bed at ten o'clock, when the house was secure; but some persons entered during the night; we were frightened, and gave an alarm - they entered the front bed chamber window, by meads of a ladder. I got up about two o'clock, because I heard a noise - the thieves were in the house at the time, but went away when the alarm was given. Among the articles taken were those now produced, which I saw at Bow-street on Monday, the 24th of September; it was on a Sunday night they broke in; I do not know any thing of the prisoner; there was a spoon, a gold watch, a brooch, and other things taken, which I have not seen since; they were in my bed-chamber. This is old family plate, and has my initials on it now.</p>

            . I executed a warrant on the 18th of September, when I found this property in some of the drawers in the back room; part is marked, and part not. The articles were not exposed for sale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was this found at the same search as before? A. Yes; the prisoner opened the drawers, which was a place where I should expect to have found plate for family use; I dare say there was ten or fifteen times as much plate as this in value; excepting the articles in the indictments it has all been returned. We asked him how he came by it; he said, "I either purchased it, or got it in exchange;" it was exposed in the drawers; there was no concealment whatever.</p>

I laid out a deal of money at the Duke of York's sale; I gave eighty-eight guineas for one article, and thirty for a gold-headed dagger.

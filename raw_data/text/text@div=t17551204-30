She went with me to a pawn-broker, named Prenton: there I found the mug. From thence we went to Mr. White's, a silver-smith in Wapping-Street, where, they owned, they had the other things.</p>

               <p>Eliz. Adkerson. The prisoner and Lyng brought a punch-ladle and spoon to me, on the 14th of Nov. The prisoner had no hand in making the bargain. Mrs. Lyng said, They were honestly come by, and belonged to a creditable housekeeper. Mrs. White, my mistress, desired her to let me go with her to that house-keeper. She said, We need not doubt what she said; so I did not go. After that Mrs. Ramsey came, and the prisoner with her, and we delivered them up. (Produced in court.)</p>

            . On the 14th of Nov. at 6 at night, the prisoner brought into my house a silver spoon and punch ladle; and said, A gentlewoman had given them to her to sell, and desired me to go along with her to sell them. Then she desired I would go along with her to pledge the mug. I said, Will it not bring me into trouble? She said, That will be fetched out on the morrow. Then I went with her to Mr. White's. I sold the spoon and ladle for 22 s. These are the very same produced here. I went with the prosecutrix and the prisoner to demand them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner with you when you pawned the mug to Prenton ?</p>
               <p>Lyng. No, she was not; but I did it by her order.</p>

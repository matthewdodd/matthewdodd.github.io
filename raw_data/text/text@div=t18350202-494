I was passing over the bridge, and saw the prosecutor being stopped by an obstruction—I saw him turn hastily round—I turned round, and saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief from his hand on the ground—the gentleman took it up, and collared him—he knocked his hand away, and ran off—I ran, and secured him, and brought him back.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the guard to the Leeds waggon. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 27th of May last did you go with the waggon on its passage from Leeds to London. - A. From the Bull and Mouth, London, to Hertford, is my stage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you besides. - 
               <persName id="t18060702-34-person341">A. William Low</persName>
             the waggoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your waggon loaded with. - A. There was some packs of wool on the outside; as we were going on a little further than the Cock at Houndsfield, just before we came to the Two Brewers, I saw the prisoner at the bar wiping his boots as he walked along; when I went up to the Two Brewers he asked me if I would have something to drink, I told him no, we were going to stop at the White Hart to water our horses; when we got to the White Hart at Ponder's End he was there, he gave me a glass of ale and the waggoner another, I told the waggoner that man was going to Hodsdon, he had told me so, the waggoner said do not let him ride; we went into the public house, then he gave us part of another pint of ale, the waggoner then was a tankard because he was two pints, he asked him whether he might have a mouthful of meat with us for his supper, he had some; then it was my turn to ride a little way.</p>
               <p>Court. You had been on foot before. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he came out of the public house had he told you what he was going to Hodsdon for. - A. Yes, he enquired of Mrs. Littlechild to lend him a bag, she lent him one, he gave her sixpence for it, he said he wanted the bag to put a couple of game cocks in that he was going to fetch at Hodsdon; then I got up and rid, the waggoner told me not to go to sleep, I came from the hind part of the waggon into the hay bag at the front of tht waggon, the waggoner said he would mind the near side if I would look out on the off side; in rather better than a quarter of a mile from the Red Hart he was on the off side filling his bag with wool, I saw him do it, he was pulling out the wool from the side of the pack as the waggon went on, I told my partner to go round and he would catch him at it; he went round and catched hold of him and called me, and I went to him and catched hold of the other side of him, we took him back to Mrs. Littlechild's, the White Hart; I stopped by him there till they sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went back to the waggon did you see the place from whence he took the wool. - A. I searched it directly I caught him, I put my arm ever so far, there had been a great deal of wool gone by the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed at this time. - A. He was dressed in black, and a pair of boots on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed before you came out whether your packs were safe, whether there was any hole in them before. - A. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you got from London before the prisoner overtook you. - A. I saw him this side of the Cock first, I suppose about seven mile, it was not dark nor light then, with the dust and every thing I could not rightly see him. I only knew he was a man dressed in black.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had not he the appearance of being in liquor when you first saw him. - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you drunk yourself. - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LOW sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were the waggoner of the Leeds waggon on the 28th of May. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were called to by the last witness when he was in the hay bag, to go round the waggon to the prisoner, and you would catch him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was that. - A. About twelve minutes past twelve, we started about twelve o'clock from Ponder's End, this was about a quarter of a mile further, when I went round the waggon and came up to him, he had a bag under his arm, I took hold of his shoulder, I asked him whether he knew what he had been doing of, he said he had not been doing any thing as he knew of, I said I will tell you what you have been doing of, you have been robbing the waggon; he begged and prayed for me to let him go, I took him to the White Hart, Ponder's End, and the bag too, I delivered him into the bar and the bag too to Mrs. Littlechild, and Holton my guard was with him, I went back to my team immediately, I left the bag in Holton's care, I went back to the pack, and I saw it was cut and a great quantity of wool was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear to you to be drunk. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner applying to Mrs. Littlechild for the bag. - A. Yes, I heard him ask for the bag to put the fighting cocks in.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see her give the bag. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in it or was it quite empty. - A. Quite empty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this. - A. It was moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the waggon was this hay bag. A. At the fore part.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in a place that he must have known that he must be seen by the guard if he had attempted to have robbed the waggon. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Could he see the guard in the hay bag. - A. Perhaps he did not know that he was there.</p>
               <p>- LITTLECHILD sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You keep the White Hart at Ponder's End. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the county of Middlesex. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the Leeds waggon coming to your house with Holton the guard and the last witness Low. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before. - A.No, he asked me if I had a bag of any description, he was going to Hodsdon for a couple of fighting cocks, I told him that I did not know that I had one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020026"></xptr>of that description, he pressed me very much, he said he had brought one from home and he had left it at Newington, I told him there was a bag with a hole in it, I supposed it would hold the fighting cocks, he might give me sixpence for it, and if he returned it I would give him the sixpence again.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not let him have any wool in it. - A. There was not any thing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that waggon left your house. A. It might be past twelve, they returned back in about a quarter of an hour, when Low brought him back, he said this is what the rascal wanted the bag for, I said I am very sorry I lent him the bag; Mr. Low sent Crossingham the constable; the bag and the prisoner were left in my bar, and the same bag was delivered to Crossingham; the bag had two handfuls of wool in it, and two handfuls were taken out of his pocket during the time he sat in the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these persons come in. - A. Yes; when they first came up to the door the prisoner came in by himself, and asked for a pint of ale to take out to the waggoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the appearance of being in liquor. - A. No, they had two pints, and one pot of ale together.</p>

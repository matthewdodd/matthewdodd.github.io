               <p>WILLIAM PAYNE sworn. - I keep a house, <placeName id="t18020428-16-crimeloc84">No. 2, Kingsgate-street, Holborn, in the parish of St. George's, Bloomsbury</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the man? - A. I am positive he is the man; I never let him go from the time I laid hold of him till I delivered him to the watch-house-keeper in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q.It was light? - A. No, it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. We all know it is not dark at that time of the year, at seven o'clock? - A.It was not light.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so light you could distinguish his face? - A. I had a candle in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. But you could see his face as you went to the watch-house? - A. I could see his face as he went along, because I was quite close to him; if it is ever so dark I can see a man's face that is close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds if this man is convicted of a burglary? - A. I have heard of such things.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How did the person get in? - A.By opening the street-door, with a latch; it was upon the latch, and bursting open the shop-door; it is left upon the latch for the benefit of the lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore your lodgers might go in and out as they pleased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the house that night? - A. I had not been out the whole day.</p>
               <p>Q.Anybody might open the latch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How lately before had you been at the street-door? - A. A few minutes before; I fastened the kitchen-window, and came down again, and had only taken a book and sat down when it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the other door broke open? - A. It was bolted, as well as locked, inside.</p>
               <p>Q. How had it been opened? - A. It was burst open, the staple was burst off; it was the bursting of that open that alarmed me.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE ROMLEY sworn. - I am an officer,(produces the property); I searched the prisoner, and found nothing upon him but a common knife; being without a hat I asked him what had become of his hat; he said he had lost it in the scuffle; the prosecutor went back and found the hat.</p>
               <p>Payne. Q.These are my boots, they were hanging up in the window; when I caught him he had them in his hand; on my return from the watch-house, I found his hat in the passage, some matches, and a bottle of phosphorus.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I understand that Mr. Romley has been putting this man in the way of getting forty pounds upon my conviction; I have not been out of trouble long; I went to inquire for a man of the name of Murray, and being in liquor I went to a wrong house, and when I went in, that man knocked me down; and, as I had an undoubted right, I knocked him down again.</p>

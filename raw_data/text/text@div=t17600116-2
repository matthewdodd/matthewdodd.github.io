               <p>Sarah Tulk. On the 8th of last month, about seven o'clock in the evening, my maid was gone out, and in about a minute or two after I heard a sort of a bustle in my shop; I went quick upstairs, and at the top of the stairs I met the prisoner at the bar, who held a half-crown to me, and desired I would change it for him. I seeing behind him two other men in the shop, was surprised, and said, I cannot change it, pray go out. He said, pray change it, and held it still towards me, saying, I want to pay these men. The other men said, it is a mean thing if you cannot give change for that. They went out, but the prisoner stood pulling at the ribband, which I saw he had hold of out at the door; they all had pulled at it. I took hold of the prisoner's collar and also of the rib-band, took it out of his hand, called for assistance, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the ribband before he took hold of it?</p>
               <p>S. Tulk. It was on a roll, fastened to a line, which was tied to a post.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the ribband from his hand, or from the post?</p>
               <p>S. Tulk. I took it from his hand, but part of it was down on the ground in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not part of it in the window?</p>
               <p>S. Tulk. No.</p>

            . I was below in the prosecutrix's kitchen when she called out; I ran up and saw her holding the prisoner by the collar: I laid hold of his coat, and pull'd him into the shop. Then we sent for an officer, and took him before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the ribband when you took hold the prisoner?</p>

When we were before justice Fielding he ordered the people to search the prisoner, and in one of his pockets were found some red herrings, and in another about five or six shillings, in shillings and six-pences.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutrix, and heard the cry of stop thief. I ran out, and saw the ribband lying on the ground; there was the prisoner standing just by it at her door, whom she pulled into her shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether all the ribband was on the ground?</p>
               <p>Rederup. I saw it lying by the post out at the door, but whether the end of it was fast within the shop, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any resistance?</p>

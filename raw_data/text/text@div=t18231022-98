On the 12th of October, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, and merely shut the door, but did not lock it - the lock catches. I left a small pug dog tied in the kitchen, but no person in the house. I was passing the house about half-past seven o'clock, and heard the dog barking - I stood opposite the house some time - a man looked me in the face as I crossed over - another came up and asked me what it was o'clock - I took out my watch, and told him a quarter to eight, but it was too fast. In about five minutes two men opened the door and came out - I immediately ran across and secured the last one, who was the prisoner. An officer came up and took him, and asked what business he had in the house - he made no answer. I went into Charter-house-street soon after, to pursue the other man, and there found a quantity of halfpence - a small housewife, a few needles, and an empty box, which were in the house when I left, were found on the prisoner. I had let the servant have the key, and did not go in for some time.</p>

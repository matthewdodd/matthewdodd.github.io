               <p>Prisoner's defence. Saturday week I came to town, as stated, in company with three men and a woman; when we came into London, they told me they were strangers to London; I told them I lived very near there; they had a portmanteau and several bundles; among the bundles there was this parcel that I had; I asked them to go to my lodging to get a cup of tea; upon entering the room there was Mr. Smith there; I asked for my wife; he told me he would take me there; after going down stairs, and going along, I recollected I had a parcel that belonged to them; I threw the parcel to the man that belonged to it; he picked up the parcel, and after the man went a little way he threw the parcel down; he says he pulled his pistol out to the man; he had no pistol; in the mean time I was thrown down on my back; he tied my hands; how was it possible that it could not be out of his sight, when he was shifting from one side to the other and tying my hands; I asked him where I was going to; he said, you must go along with me; he said, come along immediately; a scuffle ensued, it did not last above a minute, there were no blows, nor any harm.</p>

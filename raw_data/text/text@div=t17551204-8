            . On the 10th of October, about eight o'clock I was coming down <placeName id="t17551204-8-crimeloc42">Fleet-Street</placeName>

I saw the boy spit in his hand; then he put it quick into my pocket, and took out my handkerchief; I seized him by the collar while he had it in his hand (he produced a handkerchief.) I have only two of this sort; but whether this or the other at home is it, I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon it at that time so as to be positive it was yours ?</p>
               <p>Gretton. I did. I took him into a publick house, there he owned he took my handkerchief out of my pocket, and that he was set on by the tall fellow.</p>

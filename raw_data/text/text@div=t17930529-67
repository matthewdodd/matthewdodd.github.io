               <p>I keep the house; this young woman was going in the country to live with Mr. Sheridan; she asked her brother leave to put her things into her brother's room, in a box up two pair of stairs; the prisoner was a <rs id="t17930529-67-deflabel377" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Can you from that cursory observation venture to swear that they were Mrs. Tooner's, or the same that Mrs. Tooner swears to? - Yes, I can; I took the apron in my hand. I thought it was one of my own, and asked her how she came by it? she told me she borrowed it; I did not know then that it was Mrs. Tooner's; I did not know till she came to town that she had missed any thing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I don't know what I am here for; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable and beadle. Mrs. Greasley where Mr. Tooner lodges sent for me; they gave me charge of the prisoner at the bar, for robbing them of these articles; I went and searched her, and I found these duplicates that she said were her own. (Produced, and two of them deposed to by Neale the pawnbroker.) I found this key which opens her own lock and the other lock where Mrs. Tooner says her clothes were left, but with great difficulty; I found some things at a neighbouring house, and I was made to understand that she carried them there; it was at No. 4, Haydon-court, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Tooner's lodgings; I was informed they were carried there to wash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever shew the things to the prisoner? - Yes, she went with me, and shewed me where she carried them; I found there a muslin handkerchief and a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Tooner. What do you produce? - A gown and a coloured apron that we found under the bed, under a lodger's bed; I left these things about eight weeks ago at my brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return? - The next Sunday after but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room and find the things missing? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so kind as to look at the two things produced by the pawnbroker, and tell me whether they are your things; I think the one is a cotton gown and the other a linen apron? - They are mine; they were left in the box; I know the gown, I put new sleeves into it before I left it; my name is on the linen apron; there is my name on the cotton stockings; the two muslin handkerchiefs I only just made them before I went to my place</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Greasley. Are any of those things that you saw on the woman's back here? - This check apron I am confident of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing about it, nor do I know what I was taken up for; when I was taken up they put their hand in and took some duplicates out of my pocket, and seven-pence, they had me down to the watch-house one night, and the next morning they took me up to the justice's, and I knew not what they took me there for; I have lived in places where I have always had an upright character; I never touched a rag of any body's, for I had plenty of my own to put on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character.</p>

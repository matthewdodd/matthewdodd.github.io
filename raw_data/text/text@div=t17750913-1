            . I am an old cloaths man, I bought the great coat and a coat and waistcoat of the prisoner and another man, at a public house, the coach and horses, Ratcliff-Highway. I never saw the prisoner before, but have seen him several times since, and I am sure he is the man. I bought them the day before Holmden came and found them, I gave fourteen shillings for the box coat; I bought the coat and waistcoat for sixteen shillings and a pot of beer, I sold them to Mr. Madan a salesman in Rag Fair the same day, the box coat for eighteen shillings and six-pence, and the coat and waistcoat for twenty shillings.</p>

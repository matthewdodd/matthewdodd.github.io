I am sure he is the very man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your chain, seal, and keys again - A. No. I value them at three shillings. He was pursued and immediately taken by the officer.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner ran past me, when I cried out stop thief some people had turned him; he ran towards me, and a boy with a link said, officer, beware of the knife; he had a knife drawn in his hand; when I came close to him he throwed the knife into the water out of his hand, but whether he threw any thing else away, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the knife again - A. No; I went and searched, I could not find the knife. The moment the prosecutor came up he said he would swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing still when the officer came up, though he raised a mob about me; the prosecutor came and said I was the man. All what the two witnesses says is false.</p>

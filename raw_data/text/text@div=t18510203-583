On 16th Jan., about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner, whom I had known for twelve months, in Lower Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell, with Johnson and Clayton, whom I knew by sight—I and Reeve followed them to the Grapes public-house, Albemarle-street—they were in conversation toge<lb></lb>ther—the prisoner had a very shabby hat—the others had nearly new ones, apparently—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not much worn inside, I think it is an old one dressed up—we were in plain clothes—they all three went into the Grapes—I got a third constable, stationed him at the door, and went into the parlour with Reeve—the prisoner and the two men were there—Johnson was sitting in a chair, and the pri<lb></lb>soner and Clayton were talking to him—the waiter was sweeping the room—I said, "Good morning, gentlemen"—they said, "Good morning, master," and Johnson got out of the chair, and they all three moved towards the parlour door—the prisoner had no hat—they passed me, and I followed them—I knew they could not get out—I searched them all three at the door, but found nothing on them—I said to the prisoner, "Where is your hat?"—he made no answer—I said to the constable, "Don't you let either of these persons go while I search the room—I said to the waiter, in the prisoner's presence, "Where is that man's hat?"—he said he did not know—I found it behind a table, close to where Johnson sat, and within three feet of where the prisoner stood, with this blue hand-kerchief in it, containing a great quantity of plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to the door, and missed the man without his hat—the other two were taken in charge, and I searched every room for him but that in which the land-lord was asleep—the other two men were locked up, but discharged the same night by Mr. Thirwett, at Clerkenwell—the prisoner was afterwards taken—I examined the premises, and found that, without passing the constable, he could get over the privy into the next house, the door of which is always open, and so into the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Matthew Howitt, a draper, living in Holborn. I know this forty-one yards of challi to be my mas-ter's by his marks on it—I saw it safe at five o'clock on the 9th of June, and missed it about half-past six.</p>

About half-past six o'clock on the 9th of June 1 saw the prisoner with a female and a man near Turnstile—I thought there was something suspicious, and I got behind a cart, and watched them—I saw the prisoner and the other woman go to Mr. Howitt's shop-door, and the man stood at the window—I came from the cart and saw the prisoner secreting these goods under her shawl—I took hold of her about a yard from the door, and she dropped these—I tried to apprehend the others, but in the confusion they got away.</p>

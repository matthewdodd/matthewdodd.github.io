Helping my fare out of my coach I lost my coat off my box; I was opening the coach door, I left it on my box. Mr. Tipper, at whose door I put down my fare, said, he would go and see if he could find it; he did, and fetched back the lad and coat in the course of six minutes. I did not see him take it.</p>
               <p>- TIPPER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, I live in Houndsditch: I was sitting in my house on Wednesday, the 17th of August, and I heard the coachman say, I have lost the coat; I went to the door, and told him not to make any noise, and I would go and endeavour to see if I could find the party. I ran up Woolpack-alley, into Gravel-lane, and so into Petticoat-lane, and enquiring, a party told me they had seen such a person go into Shiman Lally's, the nick name of

I went to the house, and the door was fast; I knocked at the door, and this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140036"></xptr>Shiman Lally's son, a lad about nine or ten years of age, came to the door and let me in, and I directly rushed into the room, and there saw the prisoner at the bar, sitting down in a corner of the room with the coat; he was sitting on part of it; there was nobody but him and the lad that let me in. I took the prisoner and the coat to the watch-house. As I was coming along he told me I had better take the coat and let him go; that was all he said.</p>
               <p>How long might you be doing this? - About six or eight minutes.</p>
               <p>How far is Shiman Lally's house from where the coat was lost? - Not above thirty or forty yards.</p>

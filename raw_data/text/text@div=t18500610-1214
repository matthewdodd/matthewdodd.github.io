On 19th April, I went into a coffee-house in Waterloo-road, about two o'clock in the moruing—I had a cup of coffee—I sat down by the side of White—I had not known him before—in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he got up and left the house—I missed my purse, and my pocket was cut—I had had in my purse a half-crown, a shilling, and a farthing—I had it safe when I went into the coffee-house, and paid for the coffee out of it—I spoke to the people of the coffee-house, and then went to the police—I have not got my money or purse since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Pardon,'a linen-draper, in Mile-end-road. This occurred on the 5th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening—I had had the misfortune to have some panes of glass broken—I had a number of pieces of printed cotton in the window—I lost about eight pieces, and twelve or fourteen pairs of gloves—they were within reach of the broken window—I discovered the loss of it as soon as it was done—the policeman brought the prisoner into the shop—I have not re<lb></lb>covered half of what was lost—here are four pieces of cotton, which contain thirty-seven yards in the whole, and two pairs of gloves—these are part of what I lost—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 10, Flower-and-Dean-street. I was in Mile-end-road about half-past seven o'clock, on the evening of the 5th of February—I saw the prisoner, and a little boy with him—they went to the prosecutor's shop—the prisoner stooped, and took out the pieces of print, one by one, till he had got seven or eight pieces—he went down Globe-lane, to the pawnbroker's back-door—I watched him till near eight o'clock—I saw him go seven or eight times, and take some every time, and then walk round the corner—I do not know where they put them—they went towards the dust-hole, round the corner—I told the police-man of it—I have no doubt about the person—I stopped till I saw the policeman, and then I told him, and he took the prisoner.</p>

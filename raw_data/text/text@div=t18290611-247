               <p>CAROLINE JOHNSON. I saw the witness with a young man; I did not see him strike her, but I saw her on the ground - the prisoner came to me and asked me to hold her shawl while she put on the witness' shawl; I did not take it, but it fell down before me - she then took up her own shawl and put it on, and then put on the prosecutrix's shawl over her own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She is an unfortunate girl like myself; she said "There is a row;" I went and found this woman on the ground; she took off her shawl and gave it me. Witness. No; I know nothing of her since she lived in service where I did.</p>

               <p>DANIEL PAINTER. I am a watchman. I did not see what passed, but Johnson gave me some information, and I took this shawl from the prisoner in Golden-lane - I saw the prosecutrix the same night; she appeared quite sober.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going down the street, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor in a skirmish - about six people were round by the time I got up; he said the prisoner had snatched at his watch, but only got the chain and key - the prisoner said he would go to the watchhouse and he searched; McDonald was calling Watch! he appeared to have been drinking, but was sober, and walked very well to the watch-house, which is half a mile, without staggering at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman was reeling along - he caught hold of me, and accused me of stealing his chain - I said I was willing to be searched - 
he threw me on the ground and detained me.</p>

He went first, and I after him. The prisoner came up to me and snatched my watch out of my pocket; I seized him by the arm, and called Thief! thief! My partner could not come to my assistance, but I held the prisoner, and he threw down the watch to make use of his other hand, to push me aside; he then made his escape, and lost his hat in the scuffle; he ran through several streets, and we pursued, but lost sight of him; he was, however, taken in a street in which there is no thoroughfare.</p>

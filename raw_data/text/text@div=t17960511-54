A lumper is a labourer employed in discharging the ship of her cargo. Upon information I went to Mr. Staples's office. I saw Mr. Rees, who is clerk to Roe and Robinson, who are skin brokers; they were employed as brokers to land this cargo. I went to the house of Mr. Roe, and saw three casks of beaver, rackoon and fox skins. The first cask appeared to be deficient about fifty skins, another was about eighteen or twenty skins deficient, and there were about thirty missing out of the third cask. I could not swear to the skins; the prisoner was often about the casks as a lumper; he was employed about them from Wednesday till Friday; the cargo was not all discharged till Saturday, then I enquired for him, and he was missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. At Pensacola the skins are packed up and put into the ship by negroes? - A. Yes; we are sometimes present, but we have no business there.</p>
               <p>Q. All the knowledge you have of what is packed up you derive from a bill of lading? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have known deficiencies when they have arrived in this country? - A. A skin or two may have been found deficient, but not more.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know you had lost any skins till you came to Mr. Staples's office? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other lumpers under the prisoner's controul? - A. Yes; there are sometimes eight, sometimes ten, sometimes twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. How many skins were imported last year? - A. Six hundred of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was missing on Saturday, and you supposed he was pressed? - A. I heard so when I enquired for him; I can swear that these three casks were plundered; Mr. Rees and myself were going to Mr. Robinson's warehouse, where these casks were, and a cooper was sent for; the cooper began on one cask; I said there was one cask I was certain was plundered, I saw the head of it had been taken out; we opened it, and found it had been plundered.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say the casks were of different sizes? - A. Yes, and they were all full.</p>
               <p>Q. If such a number as fifty had been taken out, you must have observed it? - A. Certainly; it was very evident.</p>

I saw the woman bulky about the breast, and I searched and found a skin in her bosom; his wife turned about and said, in the presence of her husband, it was a very hard case her husband should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110115"></xptr>suffer for all, or others, or words to that effect; the prisoner whispered us to go with him to the passage; we asked him where he had got these things; he then told us that he had a little before sent a quantity of skins to Mr. Moses, in Lower Shadwell, and that others were packed up in a handkerchief to send to Mr. Moses; and the other officers took him and his wife to the public-house, opposite the Magistrate's, where there was a lock-up-room; we went the same day to Mr. Moses's house, and found Mr. Moses and his wife, and a man, in the shop; we found, in a little closet, in Moses's house, these seven beaver skins.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Robinson and Roe, skin-brokers, our house unloaded the ship Esdaile. In the warehouse we found, in one cask, twenty beaver skins deficient; in another cask, twenty-eight rackoon skins deficient, and in another we opened, we found, I believe, thirty-nine fox skins deficient; I only know of the deficiency by the invoice, which is not here, they appeared to be plundered, one of them had been opened, and the head taken out, they were not so full as they should have been; that which had been opened, contained beaver skins. There are beaver skins among these; there are no beaver skins in the other parcel; they are the same kind of skins that were imported in the Esdaile; they are of the value of 8s. a-piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. From the cask not being so full, you were induced to give your opinion that it was plundered? - A. Merely from the appearance of the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that such sort of skins might have been imported in the preceding year? - A. There were too of the same sort of beaver skins imported last year.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard that they have got into the retail trade? - A. No; except that a hatter may have purchased a few of the regular dealers; On the 23d of April, the cargo of the Esdaile could not possibly have got into private hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Would it have been either prudent or proper to have conveyed skins that length of passage with a deficiency of twenty skins? - A. I don't think they would have packed them so.</p>
               <p>Captain French. Q. When they pack these casks in Pensacola, they always pack them as close as possible, or they would not keep the worm out; so much so, that in case they have not sufficient beaver skins to fill the casks, they fill them up with other skins of less value in order to keep them full.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, I bought and paid honestly for this property.(The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.)</p>

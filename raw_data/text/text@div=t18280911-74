I found articles moved from one place to another, which caused my suspicion; I found three parcels of nails concealed behind an old oven in the back wash-house, against the wall; in consequence of this goods were marked from time to time - I marked the nails myself with a private mark of my own, and from time to time marked things; in August I marked a tea-pot and several things; on the 18th of August I found a tea-pot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110063"></xptr>concealed behind the oven; on the 21st I found a paper of knives and forks there - I took them out and marked them separately; Garnell was concealed to watch that day, and in consequence of what he said, I went in pursuit of the prisoner as he went to dinner, and overtook him in the Haymarket and brought him back; I wished him to take what property he had of Mr. Colwell's out of his pocket: he said he had no property of Mr. Colwell's; I said, "Take out what you have got," and the first thing he took out was the parcel of knives and forks, which were the same I had marked in the oven; he said he had brought them to our place to clean from his lodgings: we have a great number of the same pattern in the wash-house - it is a very old pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There have, of course, been a cunsiderable quantity sold? A. That pattern has been kept many years, but the forks are of a particular sort - they had no mark before I found them behind the oven - I believe the name was burned into the knives, but I cannot say: I put a mark similar to the figure 5 turned upside down, and five forks I marked with a figure 7: the knives appeared to have been dipped in blood, and, of course, were dirty - they appeared new; Mr. Colwell had bought some of that pattern within three months, from Bryan, a town maker; the prisoner said they were his own.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you miss any parcel of knives and forks? A. No; I saw the prisoner come in the morning - he brought no parcel with him; there is a convenience for cleanin them near the oven.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Might he not easily have brought them in his pocket? A. He might; they were not dirty, except from the blood.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might he not have taken them the night before, if he thought proper? A. I should have seen him; he did not know I was hid there.</p>

            . I live in the Haymarket. - The prisoner has been my porter for nearly four years. In consequence of what I heard I went with an officer to search his lodgings, and found a great quantity of property, which I knew to be mine, tea-pots, tea-trays, knives and forks, and several articles - none of them had been marked by me, but had our private marks on them; I never gave him permission to take anything from my stock - the knives found on him are not an old pattern - the forks are; they do not match the knives; I have had forks of that pattern in my stock about twenty years, and had ceased to sell them, being quite out fashion.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Mr. Colwell's on the 21st of August, and took the prisoner; I produce the knives and forks, which I found on the counter - Dodd was present: I heard the prisoner say they were his own; I went to his lodging - I had been watching him some time before, and ascertained them to be his lodgings; I there found a tea-pot, a set of waiters, two patent locks, one of Chubb's patent locks, a pair of snuffers, two finger-plates, a drop-latch, a lot of files and tools, a milkpot, a mustrad-pot, a quantity of other tools, files, planes, and various things; I saw Bond find, concealed under the bed, seven knives and froks, and two curtain-pins; the prisoner was then in the watch-house - I produced the things at the office; he never accounted to me how he got them.</p>
               <p>- BOND. I found the things under the bed.</p>
               <p>MR. COLWELL. The knives and forks found on the prisoner are such as I had on my premises; the knives are made by Bryan, and are marked "London made;" they have been on a board, but whether used or not I cannot tell - here is the tea-pot with the mark erased; I think there seems a smear - this milk-pot I can speak to decidedly, also the tea-tray and waiter to match it; my private-mark is on several of them; I have no mark on Chubb's lock, but the number stamped on it is the number I had from him - here are several articles with my private-mark, and several tools have the marks erased, and that very lately; here are seven knives and forks which are used at my own table at times, and which I could not have sold - I had not missed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Suppose you had seen these forks eight or ten miles off, could you say they had not been sold? A. No, certainly, but they are two patterns, and I happened to have the same pattern of each of them.</p>

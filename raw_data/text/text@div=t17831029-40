               <p>I was driving the Marlow waggon from London, going into Smallbury Green, on the 1st of October, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I got into the waggon to ride, and I put my hand into a hamper, and caught hold of a man's hand, and it slipped from me like a bird; I looked into the hamper, and the hamper was empty. I did not see the man at all. I got down from the waggon, and I said, I am robbed from head to stern. Says a post-boy, who came by just after, What is the matter, farmer? Says I, I have lost sugar and sugar-loaves. Says the post-boy, there is

            . I am a stranger to him: I never saw him by daylight to my knowledge, but when he was at Bow-street, I followed him and stopped the cart; then some people took to the cart, and ran after him. I do not know who it was; it was in the middle of the town, and they brought back a cart with two sugar-loaves, and a quarter of a hundred of sugar. The cart was stopped at the Bell at Hounslow: the man, as I understood, jumped out of the cart, and went away.</p>
               <p>Whose sugar was this? - It was Webster and Montague's.</p>
               <p>How did you know it? - By the direction there is upon it.</p>
               <p>Was it part of the sugar that had been in your hamper? - Yes. Nobody pursued after him that night. I lay at Hounslow: I was afraid to go any further. I gave information at Bow-street next day, and the next week after, as I came through the turnpike at Smallbury Green, the turnpike man said to me, Aldridge, you may have your goods again.</p>
               <p>Whose cart was that that was brought back? - It was left in the custody of a person at Hounslow; the cart was one Bennet's, as I heard: he came and fetched the cart away; it has his mark upon it: it is written upon the wood,</p>

When I came out, I saw the prisoner in the cart: I knew him before: he chucked out a paper parcel, and said, God bless you, take it up, Sir. I was stooping to take it up, and a neighbour of mine says, South, what are you at? they are hallooing stop thief up the town; he has robbed somebody. I threw down the paper parcel again; the man ran out into the road, and cried, Come along, here he is. In the mean time the prisoner jumped out of the cart, and ran away. I am quite sure he was in the cart. In about a minute, the constable and about six or eight more came.</p>

               <p>I keep the Coach and Horses. On the first of October Mr. Frame, and two gentlemen who call themselves smugglers, came and drank some porter; then they came and asked me to lodge a bag of tea; I said I was afraid of the fine, but after I told them they might. I saw no more of them that night. The next morning my man went into the garden, and there he found two sacks.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they left by this man? - I do not know that; they were dropped between four and five in the afternoon: I do not know who left them in the garden.</p>

               <p>I live at Hounslow. I am a shoe-maker. On the first of October, I was just come home, and was going to bed about ten o'clock, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran out, and saw a cart and horse, and one man in it, driving by as fast as possible; I was not able to keep up with him; I followed him till I came up to the Bell, and there four or five young fellows, that were chaise-boys, had taken hold of the horse, and the sugars were upon the ground; two loaves of sugar, and a quarter of a hundred of moist sugar: I took them into my possession: I took them down the town; these chaise-boys insisted on taking the cart and horse where they liked: the sugars are in my possession. (The sugars produced, and two of the parcels deposed to.) This was marked J. M. M. the paper is gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You know them by your way-bill, do not you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How many parcels have you carried to him? - A great many. The parcels in the way-bill and Hughson's book will answer.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you, from your own eyesight, know that you packed these two parcels in your waggon? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Without any way-bill or book at all? - Yes, they were chucked to me, and I chucked them into the hamper. I took no account. I had my account from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You had a great many parcels that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Suppose you had not your way-bill at all? - Then I could not tell any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>There was nothing particular that day to know one parcel from another of the same size? - Here are four of these parcels. I put the parcels to deliver them out, to have them handy. I look at the marks of them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290124"></xptr> oftentimes. I looked at these; I remember the parcels and the marks.</p>

               <p>I am a post-boy. I was going home on the first of October, to Hounslow, in a return chaise, empty. When I came to Smallbury Green, the farther end, it was about ten, and very dark, and there was a man had overturned his cart, and an hostler had brought out a light, and helped him up with his cart. The hostler came to me, and said, Do not you know who it is? I said, Yes, I know who it is, very well; it is Mr. Frame; I have known him some years: I says to him, Mr. Frame, where are you going at this time of night? he said to Hillington. There were two loaves of sugar that I saw lie on the ground, and he put them into the cart, to the best of my remembrance: he then says to the landlord and his hostler, Come, we will go and have something to drink. I kept on in my chair, and overtook a man in his waggon: I hallooed out, says I, Farmer, what is the matter? He said he had been robbed from head to stern. I asked him what he had lost, and he told me he had lost sugars and other things; he did not know what. Says I, there is Frame has just overturned his cart, and I saw two loaves of sugar in the road. I went back with him at his request to Huggins, the landlord's, and just within ten yards, I met the prisoner coming on for Hounslow in his cart, the waggoner went to the house, says he I have been robbed, and this post-boy tells me it is the man that has overturned his cart, I drove on and got before him within an hundred yards of Hounslow, the man jumped off to lay hold of his horse, he whipped his horse and ran off, and I followed him crying stop thief, stop the cart, and the cart was brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. At the publick-house he was drinking with Huggins, after that you kept on? - I did not stop at all, the waggon was three hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>You do not know how long he had been there before? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was going over Smallbury-green, there was a loaded carriage came by, which was turning down to go to Isleworth, I saw these parcels laying, and put them into the cart, going further the cart overturned, I asked the men then to drink, then I went on through Hounslow, and as I went along, a person accosted me to try to stop my horse, I was not willing to be stopped, and I whipped the horse on; I heard a hallooing out, I thought it was safest to go to the house where I was going to deliver these things, I went to Mr. South's, and I said take care of these things.</p>

            . I live in Princes-street, Soho. On the 16th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was standing at my door to tell the Policeman to call me up in the morning, and saw the two prisoners coming from Leicester-square towards my shop; Nunn had a bundle, with a white cloth covered over it; he said to the other, "You go and beef, and I will go and lumber them" - he gave to him what appeared to me to be a waistcoat; Pridham then crossed the road, and Nunn went on to a pawnbroker's - I, knowing they were bad characters, went to lay hold of Pridham, but he ran down a street, and I thought if I followed him I should lose the other - I then went back to the pawnbroker; I just heard the pawnbroker say, "I can't take them in, it is too late," meaning a pair of trousers - I laid hold of Nunn, and said I should detain him, for having stolen these trousers - he said, "Where did I steal them?" I said, "No matter;" I took him out - I cannot be mistaken in Pridham's person, because I was in Clerkenwell prison at the time he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never saw a pair of trousers with Pridham? A. No - I think I was eight days in Clerkenwell prison; I have not been in any other prison - I am a pencil-maker by trade; I was in the Police for thirteen months, and had several prisoners here - I never had any charge against me; I was reported for being too late, and was fined 1s. - I was dismissed for taking a placard from a person with the word "Reform" on it, near the House of Lords; the Commissioners thought I ought not to have interfered with it; that was the only reason why I was dismissed - I was fined twice; I was in prison for having some drugs without the stamp on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How often have you given evidence in this Court? A. Six or seven times.</p>

             (Police-constable C 42).

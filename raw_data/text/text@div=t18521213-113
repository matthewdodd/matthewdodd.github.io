                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Milman-street, Bedford-row. It is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn—on Thursday night, 18th Nov., I went to bed about II o'clock; I saw the windows were fast—the window of the water closet was up, but whether it was fastened I do not know—I locked the outside door—I got up the next morning a little before 8 o'clock; I saw a ladder in the yard, up against the wall—I went out and saw an old coat, and some old shoes and boots—I called the servant—she had seen these things, but did not know the house was robbed—the thieves had got into the house by pulling down the window of the water closet—I missed a pair of boots that I had worn a few days, and one pair that I had never had on from their being footed—my hat and gloves that were on the table, and two other pairs of gloves that were in the coat pockets, and an umbrella—I found an old hat of mine, which they bad left in the yard—this is my umbrella—these are my boots; they have got my own writing inside them—this pair of boots is not mine; they were left on my premises, and a pair of shoes also—I lost two pairs of boots myself, and they had left these in exchange—this is my hat, and this is the pair of gloves that was left in the hat—these other two pairs of gloves were in the coat pockets—the coats have not been found, nor the other pair of boots.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, E</hi> 16). From information I received I went to a coffee shop, in Dean-street, Holborn, on Sunday, the 21st Nov., about half-past 1 o'clock in the morning—I saw Wright there in bed—I told him I apprehended him on suspicion of committing a burglary in Milman-street—in the room there was a small child's chaise, and on it was some clothing—I asked Wright if it was his clothing—he said, "Yes"—it con<lb></lb>sisted of this pair of boots, and other articles of clothing—I saw the other officer find this hat, in the same room, at the same time—I went, on Monday morning, the 22nd, to Lincoln-court, Drury-lane; I saw Devonport—I saw ten duplicates there—one is for an umbrella, and another for a coat, pawned for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these boots that were found in the prosecutor's yard belong to Wright—a week or ten days before that there was a robbery at another place, and Wright was suspected, and then I saw these boots on his feet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have they been in your possession ever since they were thrown in the garden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not see these cuts on them when I saw them on Wright's feet—having seen them on his feet I take on myself to swear these are the boots—there were marks on them then, and there are marks on them now that I swear to—I saw them both on his feet—this boot has been twice fronted, and I noticed this patch coming close to the toe, and I noticed that the sole had come partly off, and been sewn on again—these boots were produced at the station, and they led to the pri<lb></lb>soner's apprehension—there was only one other man in the room I went to, in Dean-street, and he was asleep—there were three beds in the room; one was not occupied.</p>

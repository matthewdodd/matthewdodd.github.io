               <p>GEORGE ARNOLD. I am apprentice to Mr. Hewitson, pawnbroker, Kingsland-road. I produce a black coat, which I took infrom the prisoner, on the 1st of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, for 13s.; I said I thought it was too small for him - he said it was his son-in-law's, and that he had it to make up money for his club; I am quite sure he is the man - I live about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutrix's.</p>
               <p>MRS. SEAMAN. It was between three and four o'clock that I set off to go to Mrs. Robinson's; I am quite sure this is my son's coat - I know it by the make of it; he never wore it - he bought it of a person who made it, and it had a fault in it: a piece was cut off, which is off here.</p>

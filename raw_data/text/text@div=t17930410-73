               <p>I am a coach-maker, a journeyman; my master's name is Parker, we had a shop down the Mews, where we work. On the 14th of March, between the hours of ten and eleven, I was at work at that time, and I thought I heard the voice of two people that I knew, which occasioned me to look out, and I see two men come down the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what these men said? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what became of then? - I did not, they came down the court, I rather thought they were at no good; I still kept looking out of window, and I saw them come up again, one stood by the public house door, and one came up again, and I heard something down the Mews, like a wrench when the other man was standing at the public house back door, I saw the other man go down by himself towards this stable, when he came back again, he had something in his hand; I cannot justly say what; they walked from thence from the public house again, to a court there, they stood, and I heard the ring of an iron implement; I saw them come back again, and they stopped at the Three Tuns back door, and there they told over some halfpence, and then they went down the court, and when they came out there again; I went down to give an alarm at the public house, that I thought there were some suspicious persons gone down the court, and Mrs. White's coachman was there, and he came out, and the prisoner and another burst out from the stable. I am sure the prisoner is one that rushed out, there was nobody else there, the other man turned the corner, but the prisoner at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100090"></xptr>the bar ran straight forward, and I ran after him, and never lost sight of him, but took him, and delivered him to the patrole, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q Did you go back with the last witness to the stable? - I went back after he was there; I went in, and I saw the staple laying at the stable door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear a staple missing at the door? - Yes, there was one missing, and that staple I found close by the door, I saw it picked up.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see the hat and shirt? - I saw the hat and shirt, and some other things lay at the horses heels close to the stable door.</p>
               <p>Garnett. I observed this staple on the ground, there was a staple to the door, when I left the stable.</p>

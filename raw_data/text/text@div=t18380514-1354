               <p>at the City Saw Mills. On the 28th of April, I was passing down the City-road, at a quarter past twelve at night, and met a female, who asked me to go home with her to No. 7, Swan-passage—she is not here—I went up stairs on the first-floor, and agreed to give her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she demanded 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not pay her the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but wanted to turn out of the room at she wanted more than I agreed to pay; but she would not let me, and spoke to a man, who is the prisoner Pearson; and as I went down stairs, he came out of a room on the ground-floor, and struck me a very violent blow on the left eye, made use of a bad expression, and said, "You b-r, wont you pay for the room"—I fell on the stairs—he tore my great coat right open, and held me down on the stairs, and the female prisoner forced her hands into my left-hand waistcoat pocket and took out a half-crown—she had come out of the room on the ground-floor-Pearson did not do anything to me when he held me down—the female prisoner scratched me on the back of my hand, and Pearson tried very much to get my watch from my fob; but I had it in my hand in my trowsers pocket, and held it very tight—I hallooed out very loud for the assistance of the police, and got up-several people in the room said, "Let him go"-Pearson struck me twice on the breast very violently—I called out "Police" very loud, and got away—I went to the station-house, got two officers, and had the prisoners taken into custody—I was not intoxicated—I had had three pints of half-and-half, but I knew what I was about-when I gave them in charge, Pear<lb></lb>son pulled 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his pocket and said, "Here is half a crown that was taken out of your pocket-here is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, at I don't want to be locked up."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 94.) I was on duty in the New North-road. I went with Scott to the house of Pearson—the street-door was open—I found four men in the back room, on the ground floors—I took Pearson into custody—the female prisoner came in afterwards with some beer, and I took her—I saw Pearson offer 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prosecutor while the other men in the room were talking, but there being a confusion, I could not hear what he said when he offered it to him.</p>

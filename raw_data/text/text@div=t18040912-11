               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to induce him to confess? - A. I did not; he confessed that he had stole the dollars; when he confessed before the Lord-Mayor, I applied for mercy for him, but on consideration of my being robbed by servants so frequent, I thought it was a duty I owed myself to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - A. They were in a drawer under my counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To the prosecutor.) Q. You said to me, if I would confess, you would not do any thing to me; upon that account I acknowledged taking the dollars out of the drawer; as a prisoner at the bar it is the truth; I could take my oath of it; do you remember that? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you recollect? - A. No, I cannot; if I could, I certainly should not have gone on with the prosecution.</p>

             sworn. - You are servant to Mr. Gray? - A. Yes, I am a shopman; I was on one side of the counter, and he on the other, where the drawer opens; I saw him shutting the drawer where the dollars were; I thought that he had taken some dollars; I did not see him; I had suspected him several times before; then I informed my master; I called him out of the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he confessed? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master say any thing to him when he confessed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your master you saw the prisoner shutting the drawer? - A. Yes, I asked him what he was about at the time; when I first saw him, he made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what quantity of dollars there were in the drawer? - A. No; they were not in a till, they were in a drawer for that purpose.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to take the prisoner in charge; he observed to me it was very unfortunate that he should be discovered, as he was going away from Mr. Gray, it was the first time he had done it; I am not come here to commit the man; as much as I have said is the truth; I produce the dollars.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Gray.) Whether the dollars you gave to the constable at the Mansion-house, were the same dollars that you took from the prisoner's hand? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he going from you at night? - A. He was, I had discharged him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I must leave it to the mercy of the Jury in your hands.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the prosecutor.) Q. How long had he lived with you? - A. About four months; I had a very excellent character with this man; I was very much hurt when I detected him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

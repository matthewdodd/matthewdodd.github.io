            . I am the wife of the last witness. I was in Kensington Gardens with Mr. Johnson; there was a great crowd close to the palace; I found somebody trying to pull my watch from my side. I said, good God, my watch is gone; before really it was gone; still the hand gave it a sudden jerk, and took it away, but I cannot say who it was. I saw all the prisoners there. I should not have recollected them, only I saw them pass several times. I saw a great many of them there, and I was astonished that mechanical persons should be suffered to be there on such an occasion. On Thursday I saw the prisoners again; they were brought up at Bow-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020045"></xptr>office all three. I knew their countenances again as men whom I had seen and having been near to me, and near to the palace, and at this time I remember the faces of them all, having seen them on that Monday in Kensington Gardens; the prisoners were so near me they could have taken my watch; they brushed me. I cannot speak to any one taking my watch.</p>

            . I am a city officer. On the 12th of April the Lord Mayor went to address the Princess Regent in Kensington Gardens. I saw the three prisoners in the Gardens, facing the princesses windows, near the palace. I saw the three prisoner's altogether, and knowing

             I watched him closely. I saw Wilson and Clark attempt several people's pockets. I saw Mrs. Johnson, and heard her say she had lost her watch. I was not close enough to see which of the prisoners it was that took the watch, and seeing Wilson leave Mrs.

             I followed him. He had not got three yards before he picked Mr. Birkett's pocket. I told Mr. Birkett to keep his eye on him. I immediately went to Bacon's party at the front gate. I got Hooker and Westcoat to come and assist me; they are officers; and as I was coming to the mob I told

             likewise to watch, as the prisoners were making away. I told Mr. Bacon I would thank him to give me some assistance, as there was a party of thieves, I suspected them to have a gold watch upon them, and several other articles. Westcoat and Hooker came with me; we overtook the prisoners just before they got out of Kensington Gardens, all three together. We searched them a little in the Gardens; we felt in their pockets, and found several handkerchiefs on Wilson, and then I told Wilson we had better take them to a place where we could search them strictly. We took them to the Nag's Head public-house, Knightsbridge; we searched Wilson first; we stripped him; in his breeches we found the gold watch.</p>
               <p>- WESTCOAT. I produce the watch; I found it on Wilson, and this handkerchief in his hat. I said to Wilson, there has been a lady robbed of a gold watch, do you know any thing of it; he said, I do not. I then said, I must take the liberty of searching you. I found this watch up in his breeches fob. He said he picked the watch up in the gardens. I told him it was the watch that I wanted. I searched Salmon; I found nothing upon him. I searched Clark; in his pocket I found this gold seal; he said it was his own; he had it a long time. I then asked him what was the cypher upon the seal; he said, H. The cypher is S C upon the seal.</p>

Considering that we were not able to secure the three, we agreed that he should go to Bacon's party to get assistance. I then followed the prisoners across Kensington Gardens until they came to the Mount, never losing sight of them, where they made a halt some little time, and just as they were proceeding to go out of the gardens,

                  </hi>. I am servant to Miss Eliza Thompson, who lives in William-street, Waterloo-road. I do not know the parish—house only keeps one servant—I have seen the prisoner as servant at No. 1, but she is no acquaintance of mine—she came to mistress's house on the 25th of April, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—mistress was out—she knocked at the door, and asked if there was a servant wanted—I said, "Yes," and asked her to come in and wait till mistress came in—(I was going to leave—she sat down, and I fell asleep about nine o'clock)—mistress did not come in till twelve o'clock—I awoke between ten and eleven o'clock and she was then gone—when I fell asleep we were both in the parlourshe was sitting in a chair—I did not miss my bonnet and shawl till next morning—they had hung behind the kitchen door, down stairs—there was nobody in the house besides me and the prisoner—when I went to sleep, the street-door was shut and latched, but not bolted—it was on the when I awoke.</p>

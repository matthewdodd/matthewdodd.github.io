             (police-constable B 131). I was on duty at a quarter past twelve o'clock at night on the 24th of December, in Orchard-street, Westminster - I saw the prisoner, with eight of these barrels on his shoulder, and one in his hand - I asked who they belonged to - he said he did not know, nor did he know where he was going, but a person had given them to him from a cab, and had given him a glass of gin to carry them - I asked where the person was - he said, "I don't know; is not he here?" and seemed to be looking about - I said that story would not do, he must go with me - he said, "Take the barrels, and let me go" - I said that would not do for me - my brother officer came up - I told him to take the prisoner, but he made some resistance - a soldier came by, I asked him to take the barrels, and I assisted to take the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was no concealment of them? A. No: he was about two miles from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>MR. ASTON. I can swear to one of these in particular, and I believe the others are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Dean-street, and a cab stopped at the corner - a man got out of it who had a shooting-jacket on, and an apron - he asked me to carry these barrels down the street, and said he would give me a glass of gin - I did not tell the officer I had had it - I left the man settling with the cabman, and I went down the street where the officer met me - I made no resistance; but I said, "Don't pull me about, I will go with you - I have done no harm."</p>

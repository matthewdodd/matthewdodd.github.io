On the 11th of April, as I went to a back door, I picked up a small coral necklace; I made strict inquiry about it of the prisoner and every person in the house, but could get no information; in about an hour the prisoner came to me, and said, "Mr. Glover, I am sorry anybody should be blamed for my errors, as it respects that coral necklace; I dropped it myself:" he said he had a commission from his mother to get a necklace of that description for his sister and he had taken it to show her, and on Monday he should return it, or pay the money; I said it was a thing he had no right to do, and sent for Mr. Dobson into the warehouse; I then said Styles had said he had dropped the necklace, and that he wished to show it to his mother; I should have said he was about to leave us; we thought it prudent to have him searched, and sent for an officer: when the officer came, he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a variety of articles of his employer's property: he delivered up the key of his trunk, in which were found other articles mentioned in another indictment; a duplicate of the gold neck-chain was found in a pocket-book, on his person - he said it was our property.</p>

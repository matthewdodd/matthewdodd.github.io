            . I am a constable of the metropolitan police (G 5) - I received information, and watched Godfrey from Peacock-street, Newington-butts, into the shop of Mr. Child, in Thames-street - he entered the shop, and went to the farther end, and stood behind a recess at the further and of the shop - Mugford put a small bag full of something into Godfrey's basket - Mugford then came to the door, and looked up and down the street - Key then went to Godfrey, and put something out of another bag into his basket - Key then left the shop, and went up Pudding-lane - he returned in about five minutes; then Mugford and Key both went to Godfrey, at the further end of the shop, and remained with him three or four minutes - Godfrey then left the shop, and went up Botolph-lane, into an orange shop - he then left it, and went over London-bridge, into a coffee-shop, near the Borough-market - he came out in a minute, and then went to the Black Horse, High-street, Borough - I passed by the door, and saw him put a bag into his basket - I called my brother officer, and took him into custody - I found in his basket about a gallon of hemp seed - I asked him where he got it from - he said he bought it in Tooley-street that morning - I asked him if he knew anything about any more hemp seed or sacks - he said no, he had seen no more that morning - I asked him what he gave for the hemp seed - he said 2s. - I said I was positive he had never been in Tooley-street that morning - he made no answer - I asked where he lived - he said at Chatham - I said I had watched him from his home that morning - I took him to the station-house; went to his premises, and found two sacks, marked "Child," and a quantity of seeds; this was the lodging I had seen him come from - we had seen the policeman on the beat call him up that morning - he was never in the room with me - when I told him I knew where he lived, he said his wife lived at Chatham, but he lodged in the parlour at No. 20, Peacock-street - that was the room we found the property in - it was nearly six o'clock in the morning that he started from that lodging - he had some oranges at the top of his basket, and nuts at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Q. Did you not meet me at the door of the public-house, as I came with my basket? A. No; I asked whether he had any more seed.</p>
               <p>Godfrey. I told him I had it from Thames-street, instead of Tooley-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did you know Mugford before? A. I never saw him, to my knowledge; I followed Godfrey to the house, sometimes on one side of the way, and sometimes on the other - when I saw him go into Child's house, I stationed myself on the opposite side of the way, looking over a horse's back - the horse was between me and Child, but not the cart - it was about seven o'clock in the morning - it was a very dark wet morning - I saw Godfrey go into a recess at the further end of the shop - it is a long shop, and I saw Mugford put something into his basket - I am positive it was him - I swear he is the man who put the bag into the basket, because he came to the shop-door and looked into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear to the particular acts of any one man? A. By their heights and dress, and everything; I could see their dresses, because there were two candles and a lamp burning in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Had you ever seen Key before? A. Never - he was nearer the door than the recess - I was on the pavement on the other side of the street.</p>

             re-examined.

               <p>JAMES TILT re-examined. I found no bag in the public-house but this; it was placed on a large gin cask at the bar; I took them from the spot pointed out by a witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Where were you standing at the shop? A. On the opposite side of the way with Baylis - Godfrey did not go into the shop like a customer; he went straight into the recess at once; Mugford first spoke to Godfrey; it was after that that Key put up the seeds.</p>
               <p>MR. CHILD re-examined. Mugford was my head warehouseman, and Key a man under him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there anything irregular in Mugford selling and the other assisting at this time in the morning, if it had been a regular transaction? A. Nothing; he was subject to lose his place if he did not attend to Mugford's directions; he was bound to obey Mugford's orders - the prisoners were both asked before the officers if they had had anybody on the premises, or taken any moeny, or had any customer that morning - they both distinctly said they had not had a soul on the premises, both of them - I deal in split peas - but I can only identify these from the officer seeing them taken off my premises - I am a seedsman - I should say these are very like a sample which I have, but it is impossible to swear to them - we had articles of the same quality and appearance - I have no hesitation in swearing they are my property - they correspond with my articles - I cannot say whether I lost any bag, I have such a quantity - I have hemp seed on my premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Have you any partner? A. No - every seedsman has seeds of this description - Key was a man in my warehouse - we do not consider the porters had authority to sell - the prisoners are in charge of the premises until the man that has more control over the premises comes at eight o'clock - Key might have sold if Mugford had been absent.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Where do you live? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. What became of Gayton? A. He was bound over to keep the peace, and find good bail; and he had nineteen weeks in gaol before he was liberated - since that he has been tried here - I continued in my master's service five years after that, as an apprentice.</p>

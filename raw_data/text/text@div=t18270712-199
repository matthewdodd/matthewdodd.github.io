               <p>ARTHUR MEGGS. I live in Old Gravel-lane. On Tuesday morning, the 5th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in the neighbourhood of Bedford-square, Commercial-road; I had been at a Parochial dinner the day before, and was going home rather intoxicated, but knew what I was about; I met a man in crossing Whitechapel, and asked him to show me the nearest way into the Commercial-road; he took hold of me by the arm, and conducted me to the neighbourhood of <placeName id="t18270712-199-crimeloc1090">Bedford-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I am told that you were exceedingly intoxicated that night? A. I was not very drunk - I had been drinking a bottle or two of sherry, perhaps, but I had no porter; I had not been talking about the watch, and swinging it about.</p>

            . I am a ship-broker. I was in the neighbourhood of Bedford-square; I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards me - the prosecutor was running in the same direction - I took the prisoner; he was taken to the watch-house, and this watch was taken from his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the coat taken off his back? A. Yes - by Mr. Tedwick, a friend of mine - he is not here; it came off in the scuffle, and was carried about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour's walk; I believe my friend carried the coat the whole time; he might have given it to another person for a minute or two, as I lost sight of him - the prosecutor was not very drunk.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mile-end. I saw the prisoner brought into the watch-house without a coat- I searched and found the watch in his left-hand coat pocket; I do not know the gentleman who gave the coat. (Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Whit Monday I had a holiday, and was going home with two young men, who I had met at a public-house - one of them said, "Here he comes!" there was a cry of Stop thief! they ran, and somebody pushed me down - but I know nothing of the watch.</p>

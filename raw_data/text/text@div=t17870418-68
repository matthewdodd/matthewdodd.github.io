            ; after I had gone my round, I came back, and the cart was just driving away from my Lord's stable door; I followed it till I came into John-street; I stopped the cart, and asked Burchell what he had in the cart; he told me some rubbishing hay; I examined the cart, and I found three trusses, besides a quantity of loose hay; I took him to the watch house, and kept him there till he went before the magistrate; it was the same day; I went about eleven to fetch the prisoner; he was my Lord's coachman; when they came before the magistrate, they asked Richard Burchell -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Was the examination before the Justice taken down in writing? - I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution. What passed? - He asked Richard Burchell where he had the hay from; the prisoner was present; Burchell said he bought it of the prisoner at the bar, and the prisoner owned that he did sell it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did he say? - I cannot pretend to say the particular words he made use of.</p>
               <p>What did Burchell say he gave for it? - Three shillings, and the prisoner said he only gave him one shilling for it, and that was a shilling's worth of halfpence; part of the hay is here; it is very good hay.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You do not know whether it is Westmoreland hay or not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Before the Justice, this man said he bought all the hay of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner denied it, and said he had only sold him the sweepings for a shilling, because he expected my Lord's waggon with hay in town? - He might say so.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner give this account of it, that expecting some hay in my Lord's waggon, he had sold the sweepings of the loft, which was the perquisite of the coachman, and received a shilling's worth of halfpence for it? - I cannot recollect that he said so.</p>
               <p>Burchell said first, he had nothing in the cart but rubbish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he said he bought all the hay of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All that you saw put into the cart was a little rubbish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did Burchell say he bought of the prisoner? - He said he had three trusses of hay.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner ever admit that he received three shillings for three trusses? -

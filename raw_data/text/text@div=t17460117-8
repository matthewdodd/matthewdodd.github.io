             had robb'd him, but being so very ill he could not come at his Breeches; and when I rais'd him up on Tuesday, he desir'd I would look into his Breeches, to see what he had lost. He had two half Crowns, a half Moidore, and nine Shillings and Six-pence, which were taken out, and 4 s. left. He desir'd I would look into the Drawers, if she had took nothing there: I said I knew what Gold there was, but not what Silver: Accordingly I told the Money over, and we miss'd 6 s. and 9 d. I went and found her in Black-Boy-Ally, and she had got her Clothes out of pawn: She own'd the Fact and fell down upon her Knees to implore Mercy: She own'd 3 s. she had taken out of my Father's Breeches and the 6 s. she own'd.</p>

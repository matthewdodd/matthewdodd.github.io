                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Notting<lb></lb>hill. In Aug. last a person came to me representing himself as servant to a gentle<lb></lb>man who had just come from Southampton, and taken a large house at Notting<lb></lb>hill—he wanted me to supply him with certain articles, and be took some—he came again and wanted some more—I said, "I don't know your master; I don't choose to trust you with more things, for I have been robbed."On the Saturday following (the 31st of Aug.) I saw the prisoner at No. 16, Ladbrook<lb></lb>terrace—I met him as a gentleman—I took a number of pocket-books, and he selected some for a young lady who was going to boarding<lb></lb>school—I wished for payment, and he said, "Oh, you can leave them till Monday and I will select from them "—I left three till</p>

               <p>Monday for him to select, and he told me to bring the bill for the other I articles he had had in the week, and on the Monday morning he would select what he wished to keep—I went on the Sunday morning and left sixty pencils for him to select from, for a young lady going to boarding<lb></lb>school. On the Monday morning I was making out some of my bills, and some neighbours came in and said something—I went down and found the house was empty—the pencils and pocket-books were gone—I had not sold them.</p>

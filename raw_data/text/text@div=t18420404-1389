                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live in the Broadway, Deptford. On the 30th of March, about a quarter after two o'clock in the morning, I was in New Cross-road, in the parish of St. Paul's, Deptford—I met the three prisoners—they all three passed me, and then Merry returned, and said, "My dear, where are you going?"—I said, "I am going home"—she said, "You had better go along with me"—I said, "Be off about your busmen, I have nothing to say to you"—the prisoner Jones came behind me, and raised the tail of my coat pocket—I said,"There is nothing at all there, be off about your business"—they followed me down the road, about sixty or seventy yards—when they found I would have nothing to do with them, Merry put her hand into my left trowsers' pocket—Jones put her hand into my right-hand pocket—I had a tobacco-box in my left-hand pocket, and in my right 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and at least three penny-pieces, two or three halfpence, and two farthings—I hollooed out "Police," and then the prisoner Lockett came up, and struck me over the ear, and knocked me down—it was a very severe blow, and he made an attempt at my watch—I happened to have my chain round my brace, and with pulling it he could not get my watch out of my pocket—some people were coming along, one of whom, Mr. Bond, I knew—I said, "Mr. Bond, is that you?"—he said, "What is the matter?" I said, "These people have been robbing me"—he said, "Which is it?"—I said, "All of them have tried, and two of them have robbed me"—Lockett made a kick at Bond, and I believe Bond struck him—a police<lb></lb>man came up, and after that I missed my tobacco-box, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the three penny-pieces and the two farthings from my two pockets—I gave them all three into the custody of the policeman—my tobacco-box was produced at the station.</p>

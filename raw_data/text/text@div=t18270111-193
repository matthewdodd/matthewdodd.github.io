            . I am an officer. On Saturday morning, the 30th of December, I went with Vann and Brown to No. 214, Whitecross-street, which is kept by the prisoner Benjamin; it is a clothes-shop, and he deals in goods as well - the shop was shut, as it was his sabbath: I saw a go-cart thirty or forty yards from the house - it was afterwards claimed by Hammond in my presence; I went with Van up a passage into the back room, placing Brown at the door to prevent an escape - we found the prisoners all nearly together; I said to Benjamin, "Where is the property just brought in?" he pointed to three large parcels on the floor; two of them were beds and bedding, and the other contained a variety of articles; three chair-cushions and a tea-caddy were on the floor - all this property was there, except two tea-trays, which were afterwards produced from the parlour. We asked Benjamin who brought it there; he said, "These two men," pointing to Taylor and Hammond; Taylor denied it - we then questioned Hammond, who admitted bringing it there in company with Taylor, who still denied it, and said to Benjamin,"You are a pretty fellow, to say I brought it; you will say any thing, if you say that." Benjamin and his sister, who were present, both persisted that they had brought it there - Van then asked Hammond where he brought the property from; he said that Taylor and another man engaged him near the Elephant and Castle, and that his name was on his go-cart; which we found to be so - Taylor refused to tell his name - we asked Benjamin what they were to have for the property - he said they asked 10l., but they did not want such things. We took them all three into custody, and in three days after we compared these three cushions with three others found in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Hammond was the driver of that go-cart? A. Yes, I found he was so.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Whitecross-street. On the 30th of December, I saw a cart come to Benjamin's premises, about five minutes to nine o'clock- Hammond drove it up to the passage leading to the back door; he and Taylor got out the goods; Taylor came down the passage - this was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before the officers came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was done after they were unloaded? A. Hammond drove the cart to the Cherry-tree public-house, and then returned to Benjamin's house.</p>
               <p>HAMMOND's Defence. I was hired by two men to take the goods to Benjamin's house.</p>
               <p>TAYLOR'S Defence. I did not hire him.</p>

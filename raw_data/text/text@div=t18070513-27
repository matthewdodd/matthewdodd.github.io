            . The prisoner at the bar came to me last Sunday week about seven o'clock, as I was going to bed very ill; there was she and another girl came in with an excuse for me to mend a pair of shoes against the next morning, for her to go to Billingsgate. I told her she should have them done. My watch and ring laid upon the table; they took them both; I will not be sure which took the ring, whether it was the prisoner or the other person, but I am sure the prisoner took the watch; they took them out of my room and fastened my door; I padlock my door when I go out; I sell shoes; they put the hasp on the staple and fastened me in the room; it was about a quarter of an hour before I could get out, I called to my neighbours some time, at last they heard me and took the hasp off and let me out.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house do you lodge in. - A. A bottom room.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew this woman before. - A. Yes, as a neighbour, I never had any thing to say to her; she brought me a pair of pumps to mend once before, she lived next door to me. After I got out of my house I went to her house to seek her, she was not at home. On Tuesday morning I found her in bed about four o'clock, I went with an officer; she said she knew nothing about the watch. I am sure she took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you give me this watch on these terms, for to lay with you. - A. Me want a wife! I am seventy-five, bless my soul, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you come in my place and offer me two gowns of your wife's. - A. I did not, there never was such a word spoke.</p>
               <p>Court. Well, do not be angry. - A. No, sir, I am not angry, but a man of seventy-five years of age, it makes me shudder.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen your watch since. - A. Yes, it is here.</p>
               <p>MRS. CHANDLER. This young girl brought a watch to me on Sunday night the 3d of May, she asked me to put it by for her for a few minutes. When she came to my house she said it was her mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live off Mr. Archer's. - A. I cannot tell, I keep the Star and Garter, Whitechapel road. In ten or fifteen minutes she came for it again; it was a silver watch. When she brought it to me I said it was an old antique thing, and I put it in the drawer.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, The watch was brought to me on the 4th of May, by a woman much resembling the prisoner, in company with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130017"></xptr> another; I believe the prisoner to be the person to the best of my knowledge; she told me her name was

            . On the back of the watch is the letter A; that gave me reason to suppose it was her husband's; she pawned it with me for fifteen shillings.</p>

            . Please you my lord, the prosecutor was with me three times last week; he said to me provided I could get him his watch he would not trouble his head any further about it; with that I went down to the prisoner at the bar, the duplicate was brought to me; I told him it was out of the girl's power to get the watch out; now I said to him, I will give you part in payment now, and on Saturday I will give you the remainder; I gave him a crown piece; he said I am very happy to think it is all settled.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is all a false thing.</p>

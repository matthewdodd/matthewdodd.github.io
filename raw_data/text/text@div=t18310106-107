On the 14th of December I fell in with the prisoner, between twelve and one o'clock at night - I was not particularly sober, but I was not drunk; I had had a pint or two of ale - I had been at a friend's house, and stopped later than I do in general - the prisoners accosted me, and Brock asked me to go home with her, which, after some hesitation, I agreed to - Wenlock went a little way, but I said if she followed I would not go with Brock - I went home with Brock to <placeName id="t18310106-107-crimeloc617">Wentworth-street, Spitalfields</placeName>

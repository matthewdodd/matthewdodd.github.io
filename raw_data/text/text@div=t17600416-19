               <p>Richard Sing. On the 21st of October my summer-house was broke open, and all the things mention'd in the indictment were taken away. We had reason to suspect the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. On what account did you suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sing. He having committed several things of the like nature. After that I was going by a broker's shop in Fleet Market, where I saw some of my goods I asked the broker who he bought them of, and he described the prisoner at the bar. Then I got a search warrant, and in the prisoner's house I found on e china cup, which I believe to be mine, they matching to the saucers which I have by me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find at the broker's?</p>
               <p>Sing. I found the picture and the cheeks to my grate; the picture has my name on it. (The picture and cheeks produced in court, and deposed to.) I never found the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with the prisoner at Mr. Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Sing. I was. He said the same as now, that is, he knew nothing at all of the matter. I asked his wife how she came by the cup.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he by at the time?</p>
               <p>Sing. He was in the same room. She said she bought it of a woman at the door. My wife asked her soon after where she had it. She said to her, she brought it out of the country.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live by Fleet Ditch. I bought these goods I believe of the prisoner at the bar, whom I described to Mr. Sing, and he said he suspected such a fellow. We got a warrant, and took him up. After we had got him, he said, Gentlemen, I hope you will give me a little air, and immediately jump'd out at a back window, and went to make his escape, but the constable and I took and secured him.</p>

            . The prosecutor came and told me he had lost some of his goods, and desired I would go along with him to the broker, who, he said, had described the person he bought them of, and it was one that had done some petty robberies in our neighbourhood. I went with him. We got a search warrant, and found this cup in the prisoner's house. I advised the prisoner to confess where he sold the rest of the things. We had got him upstairs. He gave a jump down, and got from us, then jumped over one pannel of pales, and upon his going over another, we catch'd him by the leg.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams. I am a constable, and took the prisoner as he was at dinner. He said to me, Let me have a little air. I would not let him go. He jumped down and ran, and I ran round to meet him. He got over a fence I believe six feet high, with tenter hooks in it. As he was going over another I catch'd him by the leg, and with assistance we did secure him.</p>

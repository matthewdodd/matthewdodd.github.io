On the 4th of May, Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100041"></xptr> Whitefield came to my apartment, and asked me if I would walk down into her parlour, while she shewed my apartment to the prisoner. (I was about to leave that lodging.) I walked down, and she and the prisoner walked up. I had left my watch hanging upon a little hook under the glass in my room. When they came down, I went up and missed my watch. I ran to the top of the stairs, and called to know if Mrs. Whitefield had removed it; she said she had not. I came down, but the prisoner was out of sight. I went to Sir

            . The prisoner knocked at my door, and asked me what apartment I had to lett; I said a first floor. She said, she wanted a lodging for a master and mistress, a man servant and herself; that the man could lie where the horses were kept; that her master was a captain, and her lady an elderly gentlewoman; that they came from Greenwich the day before, and were at a friend's house; and also that the master would soon go to Scotland, and that she should be left there. I took her up, and shewed her this lady's room. She liked every thing. She said she would fetch her lady. She went down and let herself out. After I was down, this lady called to me to know if I had removed her watch. I was so weak as to go up to see before I looked after the prisoner, so that when I came down again, she was not to be found. On the Saturday morning, she was brought to our house, and the watch was stopped.</p>

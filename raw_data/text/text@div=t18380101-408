About three, or a quarter past three o'clock, on the 1st of January, I was coming down stairs, and saw a person coming up oat of the kitchen—it was the prisoner—I saw she held something behind her—she saw me, and turned back a step or two, and put it out of her hand—it was wet linen—I stopped her, and held her till I called for some one from the other part of the house, and she was detained—I went down and saw it was all these articles—they were wet—I had seen them hanging to dry half an hour before that—it was all in a bundle, rolled up—I called the officer, and gave her in charge.</p>

               <p>Between eight and nine in the evening, March the 15th, I took a walk round, and at the place called the Circus Building, I went into an house uninhabited, and stood in the door way, with my face towards the door, and the two prisoners came and passed me with each a load, I stood till they got past me, I saw another man behind, he set down his load, I took no notice at all of him, but I went into Quebeck-street and told the people of the publick-house, two of the men followed me, I took one of the prisoners, and pursued after the other two but could not find them, I came round the south side; when I took Ayners, he wanted me to keep it quiet, I told him no, it would not do, then I perceived Adams and another man along with him, I met them half way along the fouth side of Portman-square, I took Adams, and the other man got away, they had both loads on their backs.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first saw them, were they coming from that way? - Yes, I took the lead and matched it, and found it had been taken from a house belonging to

               <p>Did you see this lead tried on the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it fit the places? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the place cut out even or irregular? - It was cut out irregular.</p>
               <p>So that nothing could sit it but the piece itself? - Nothing but the piece itself.</p>
               <p>(The lead produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to Robinson. That is not so irregular as you described it? - It is impossible for a man to cut it even without he had a line to cut it by, they cut two pieces out from the gutter, they matched exactly to the place.</p>

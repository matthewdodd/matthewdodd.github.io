                  </hi>. I live in Old Pye-street, Westminster. The prisoner lodged in my house about eight months, and left in August, 1836, when I was going for some vegetables, and asked him to mind the place while I went—he said he would—that was about eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—I returned in a quarter of an hour, and he was gone, and the dog was gone, which I had left chained to the bed, close to my box—the dog was loosened from the chain, and put out of doors—the doors of the house were on the latch, and my box was broken open—an iron bar laid by the tide of it, which it had been done with, and my money was gone—I lost thirty-two sovereigns and six half-sovereigns—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody this year.</p>

I remember the evening the prosecutrix was robbed, but I did not know any thing of it till the day after when she told me of it—I saw the prisoner coming down St. Ann's-lane one evening, eighteen months afterwards, and I said, "Halloo, Charley!"—he said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Bill!</hi> for God's sake do not betray me, for I am in your hands"—I had heard of the robbery before that—I am Mrs. Hayward's son—I said, "I heard you were gone to Liverpool"—he said, "I went to Bristol"—I asked where he lived then—he said, "In St. Giles's"—a man and woman came up the street, and he went into a corner to make water—the woman hallooed out to the man," Come on, George"—he thought she was speaking to him, and he spoke to her—he took hold of my hands, and said, "Good bye!" and ran into Davis's house, saying he was going to see his brother—I went home, and told my mother, and he was taken into custody by Pike.</p>

On Wednesday, the 1st of June, I went to the Royal Charlotte—I had some<lb></lb>thing to drink, and asked the prisoner to partake of a pot of porter—he drank with me—I had about two sovereigns and two shillings in my pocket, when I gave a sovereign to my wife I saw the prisoner wink to another man, and then I told him to leave me—he struck me, and I lost my senses.</p>

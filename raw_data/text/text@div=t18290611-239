About half-past five o'clock in the morning of the 15th of April, I was awoke by a great noise in that house, like the breaking down of the stones of the fire-place - I heard the stove drawn out, and some persons go down stairs very heavy, and put something down in the passage; I looked out of the window, saw Curry open the door and come out, stand on the step, and look in my face; I said, "What do you want there, you thief, you shall not have the stove?" he said nothing, but kept looking at me; I said to my husband, "Father, come and look at him, that thief is looking me in the face:" Curry then left the step, turned, and made a trot round the corner of the Three Sugar Loaves public-house, and went away - I cried Stop thief! my husband went and found nobody in the house; he then pursued - I am sure Curry is the man.</p>

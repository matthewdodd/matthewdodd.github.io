               <p>(The gown produced, burned through and through.)</p>

               <p>A little bit of jealousy, I suppose? - I never had any words with them.</p>
               <p>Who was it that told you that you could not do any thing to them for burning your clothes in the house? - One of the clerks at Hick's Hall.</p>
               <p>At that time had you made any complaint of any thing being thrown upon you in the street? - No.</p>
               <p>This is a gin shop? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did they do with this cup or bason? - Springmore had it in her hand when I came in.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Wawill there? - Yes, he is a tallow-chandler.</p>
               <p>Did not you say your own was buret but did not know by whom? - No, I did not, I went to the Justice, and made my complaint, and the women were discharged.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Wawill went to the Justice after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And Mr. Wawill was very angry with the Justice for discharging them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What complaint did you make at first to the Justice? - About this burning my handkerchief on the Monday night before, and on the Friday night following, that was the complaint I made to the Justice.</p>
               <p>You went there by the advice of Mr. Wawill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you then not to tell the Justice of what they had done in Catherine-wheel-alley, this had happened in Catherine-wheel-alley before you went to the Justice's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not see them do anything with the cup? - No.</p>

                  </hi>. I kept the White Hart public-house in Drury-lane, in he parish of St. Giles in the Fields. On Tuesday afternoon, the 30th of August, I counted up sixty-eight sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and a £10 Bank of England note, and put it in the bottom part of a writing-desk, which fastened with a brass pin—I places also eight sovereigns in the top part of the writing-desk, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the open part, under a flap covered with green baize—there were two brooches, two gold rings, and other arti<lb></lb>cles of broken jewellery in the drawer, at the bottom part of the desk, which fastened with a pin—there was also a number of papers, documents of various descriptions, and the copy of a lease in Worcestershire; also the policy of a five-insurance, by the Globe, of the same premises, a paper be<lb></lb>longing</p>

Division, and he and I searched about London a long time, but could not find any thing—he examined Connelly, about eleven o'clock, in the bar—he asked her a great many questions—she got into a violent ill temper—he said. "You are telling me a whole tissue of falsehoods"—she had remained in bed, I believe, about an hour, or an hour and a half—but her mistress had been talking to her in the bed-room, or the room where the box was lost from—she came down to the bar about the o'clock or half-past—she appeared so ill we thought she could not be guilty—we went over to the cooperage, and she got her bonnet and shawl, and went off down Holborn—my little boy come and tole me so, and we followed her to Saffron-hill. I persuaded her to go to hospital two or three days af<lb></lb>terwards, and she called at my house in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in going, and I gave her some warm beer—(we took up a man in Lascelles-court, about a month after, who was discharged,) and Connelly quitted the hospital in consequence of finding she had quitted the hospital, I went over to Ireland, about the 17th of September, to a place called Lavello, in the county of Mayo, by myself—I got assistance, and took Winifred Finnigan and the two prisoners, and conveyed them to Castlebar—I found two brooches in a box, which Ann Finnigan said was her's with a number of new articles—a handkerchief, gown-piece, brass candlesticks, and men's wearing apparel, corduroy and cloth, and a number of ladies' handkerchiefs-and she had also bought a cow there—I found a number of new articles in Connelly's possession, and fourteen half-crowns in a box in her father's house at Lavello, but nothing that I had lost—I left them in Ireland, and came back to London—I made and application to the Secretary of State for the Home brooches I found were mine—I went with the officer and found the writing-desk about 150 or 200 yards from the Green Man at Finchley-common—it</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old next Christmas, I lived with the prisoner, who is my mother, on Saffron-hill—Connelly is my cousin—I am in custody to give evidence. I recollect Connelly living at Mr. Brown's, at the White hart, in Drury-lane—I went down with my books there—(I sold books in the street)—she asked me how I did—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the desk,</hi>), I know that—I saw it at Mr. Brown's one evening—Mr. Brown was in the bar—Connelly was in the passage with it—she asked me whether I would have it—I said I would not—my mother was at home at that time—while Mr. Brown went down in the cellar to draw some beer, Connelly brought it down stairs; and when Mr. Brown came up, she ran up stairs with it somewhere—I waited at the bar for her—she came down again with a tin can to fetch some water in—she winked her eye at me, and asked me to come out—I went out, and she said, "Why did not you take it"—I said I would not—she said it was a little, work-box she had bought, and she was to have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give me, which the gentleman used to give her in the parlour for fetching gin and run up—I said I would not take it—she told me to tell my mother she wanted to speak to her because she was very ill; and I told my mother so between seven and eight o'clock—my mother went to her about seven or eight o'clock next morning—I saw her going—she told me she was going to Connelly because she was very ill—I do not know what day it was—my mother came back to Saffron-hill, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day, and brought this box with in a blue bag—I did not see her take it out—I went with her near to Barnet, to the fields, up a little road near a public-house—she opened the box, and I saw about half a hundred sovereigns and five or six shillings, and a lot of papers torn up in it—she almost fainted when she saw what was in it, and cursed and swore to see what my cousin had given her, to hang her—I told her to have nothing to do with it—she said she was very sorry—and I told her my cousin had told me to take it, and said there were drunken people and lodgers in the house, and Mr. Brown would not take any notice, and that there was a women there washing, and Mr. Brown would</p>

                  </hi>, I am assistant to my father, a licensed victualler, of the Victory Tavern, Edmond-street, King's-cross. On 20th March about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was coming through Castle-street, the prisoner pounced upon me all of a moment, struck me with one fist under my chin, and with the other hand seized my watch and chain—I fell on the ground on my back from the blow—the watch was in my waistcoat pocket—he drew it out by the chain, which was passed through my buttonhole—I felt it drawn from me—my hat was knocked oft, and my stick knocked out of my band—I got up, left them behind me, and ran after the prisoner; I never lost sight of him—there was no one else in the street—I followed him closely—be turned a corner, but I was close to him—I pursued him to the corner of St. Martin's-lane—a young man there came up in front of him and collared him—he said, "For God's sake let me go—I gave him in custody to a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an iron-plate worker. On Thursday night, 20th March, a little after eleven o'clock, I was at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, with my wife and her sister—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner turn the corner, and the prosecutor behind him—I looked round, and saw him come across the road—I immediately darted out—he said, "For God's sake, don't stop me; let me go"—I caught hold of him, and in the struggle we both fell—I did not let him go—when he got up he said, "What business have you with me?"—I said "We will talk about that when the policeman comes up"—the prosecutor was behind me—I directly hallooed out, "Police!"—a policeman came up from the Seven Dials, and the prosecutor gave him in charge—the prosecutor's clothes were dirty all over the back when he came up.</p>

On Thursday night, 20th March, a little after eleven o'clock, I was in Seven Dials, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I went down to St. Martin's-lane—I saw a mob of persons, and the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge, for robbing him of hit witch—the prisoner said that I ought to take him, meaning Barton, into custody, for he was as bad as him—I took him to the station—the prose<lb></lb>cutor's back was covered with mud, and he was without his hat—I believe he had been drinking, but he was quite aware of what he was doing, and capable of taking care of himself—people are generally confused after being knocked down—what I saw about him might arise from the blow, and not from drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

            . I was in Broad-street, St. Giles's, about half-past 8 o'clock on this evening in company with another patrol. I saw the prisoner and another man following Mash's cart - I saw the other get into the cart at the corner of Plumb-tree-street, and at the corner of Broad-street he let down the basket; they ran off, and I pursued them, and took the prisoner; Lane went after the cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you pass me first, if you had seen me with the mutton? A. The other was before him, and I thought it right to take the first, that he might not get away - the basket was then on the ground.</p>

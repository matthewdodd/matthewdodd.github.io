               <p>M. Marser. I believe it may be about three weeks ago; only my husband lives with me, and he is out of his mind. The prisoner desired me to pay her her wages, saying she would not stay, and after she was gone I found a door on my ground floor broke open, as also a trunk broke open, and missed all the things mention'd in the indictment.</p>

            . I took her into custody. She confess'd she had stole eight guineas, but had spent some of it, and if I would go behind the Alms-houses I should find some of it conceal'd in a knife box. I lock'd her up, and found four guineas in a knife box as she had said, and in a bed 8 s. 6 d. in silver, and seven pence half penny. I found in that room a muslin hood and a silk scarf. We took her to justice Fielding's, and she acknowledg'd the money to be the property of her mistress there, and also before. The silk gown and two shifts the prisoner's grandmother brought to us after the prisoner was in custody.</p>

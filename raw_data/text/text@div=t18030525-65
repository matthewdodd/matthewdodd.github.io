               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; I don't know how he gets his bread: On the 9th of May, coming by Dyot-street, I saw a man standing in the street without a hat or coat; I asked what was amiss; they told me, young Connor had robbed the man; I saw him across the way, and went and took him; the prosecutor was by, relating the case to me; the prosecutor desired his coat again; he said, you b-r, what coat; the neighbours said, we must get somebody to take him to the watch-house; he then said, he would give up the hat and coat; I went with him to his lodgings, and got the coat; he had a drawn knife in his hand; I took it from him.

               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Whose house was it you slept at? - A. I don't know; it was kept by a woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she know the prisoner? - A. She called him by his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else sleep in the same room? - A. Yes, two women in another bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in bed when the prisoner came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Coming up Dyot-street, I was in liquor, a girl that knew me called me into a house; I had this coat of my own over my arm; a man followed me, and said, I had got his coat; I said, if I had his coat, I would give it him; Tierney came up, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Tierney.) Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, some years; he has been employed by Mr. Wellings to drive the military bread waggons.</p>

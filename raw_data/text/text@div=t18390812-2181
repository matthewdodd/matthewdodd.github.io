                  </hi>. I am servant to Thomas Hitchings, a publican. On the 28th of March the prisoner came to our place—I did not know her before—I did not see her again for upwards of three months, when I saw her it George-street station-house—I knew her again by her appearance, her face, and person—she was at the bar there—I have not the least doubt of her being the woman—she was only in my presence from five to ten mi<lb></lb>nutes on the 28th of March—there was nothing particular to make me no<lb></lb>tice her more than a common customer—she came in and inquired the price of brandy, and ordered two bottles of brandy, a bottle of ram, and a bottle of gin, for the Rev. Dr. Penfold, No. 15, Dorset-square, whom I knew by name—she said she was recommended by Mrs. Rutker, of No. 63, Portland-place—I knew that person as the housekeeper of Sir John St. Aubin—she then tendered me a cheque of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said I was to take the amount of the goods out of it—I gave the cheque to my master, who was in a room, and he cashed it for her, but not in my presence—the goods were sent that evening to Dr. Penfold's.</p>

I received a cheque from Bird on the 28th of March, about nine o'clock in the evening—this is it—I no<lb></lb>ticed it at the time—it purports to be drawn on Coutts's bank by the Rav. Dr. Penfold, whom I have known these twenty years—I knew at the time that he lived at No. 15, Dorset-square—I gave the cash to the person who brought it, as I supposed—Bird gave me the cheque—I came out, and the person was standing before the counter—I had not sufficient confidence to swear to the prisoner at Bow-street, and now I do not take on myself to swear to her, she was before me so short a time—I have a very strong sus<lb></lb>picion that she is the woman, but I took no notice of her, and cannot say whether she is or is not—at the time I gave the change, which was a £5 bank-note and ten sovereigns, the person said, "You will take for the amount of the spirits, "which I did, and gave her 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in half an hour I took the spirits to the Rev.

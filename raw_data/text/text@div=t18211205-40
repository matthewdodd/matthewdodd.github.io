            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at the corner of Watling-street, near St. Paul's; Mines, the constable, beckoned to me to follow some persons; about three o'clock, we saw the prisoners at the corner of Cheapside, next to St. Paul's, in company, together with many others. I watched them towards Queen-street, I heard Miss Williams cry out that she was robbed, she was then down on her knees, and her scarf half off her shoulder. I saw Bartlett snatch the reticule from her hand; Wright was a very little distance from him - I noticed them in company all the way. I immediately seized Bartlett, he threw the reticule to Wright, whom Hughes secured and took it from him; I saw it in his hands. We took them to the watch-house - the reticule fell open as it was snatched.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw Hoy at the corner of St. Paul's church-yard - I called him to my assistance, we followed a gang; I first saw the prisoners near St. Paul's church-yard. I saw Miss Williams against a door, she complained of having lost her reticule; the prisoners were both near her, I did not see it taken. Foy seized Bartlett and Hughes took Wright - there was a great crowd, I took Wright to the watch-house, the reticule was torn with the violence of the pull - I found 10 s. 6 d. on Wright and a gold ring on his finger.</p>

               <p>How was it separated from the gutter? - It seems to be cut by a knife, I found a part of a knife in the gutter.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He owned himself guilty; he said, he was going to take it to a public house, to the prisoner Oldfield, who was to sell it for him. I saw the lead there before.</p>

I saw the prosecutor in a fit on the 26th of March, in East Smithfield—I saw the prisoner feeling in his pockets, and there was another girl at a distance, who kept going to her—I did not see any one else near him—the people looked at the prisoner, and then she took the prosecutor higher up the street—three little boys spoke to her, and asked her what she bad got—she said only 41/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his pockets, and she said she was going to <hi rend="italic">nail</hi> him of his <hi rend="italic">toggs</hi>, meaning his clothes—I was following her to see what she did, and she said she would murder me, or get some one else to do it, if I did not go back—I then told the policeman.</p>

               <p>in East Smithfield, where the prisoner had got the prosecutor by some ruins—I saw the prosecutor had got no coat on him—the prisoner had a coat, and two boys had some clothes, and one of the boys had a pair of shoes—the prisoner said to the boys, "This is a fine one"—meaning the coat—they went away together.</p>

I heard of this, and found the prosecutor under an archway, without his coat, shoes, and hand-kerchief—I assisted him home, and I look the prisoner on the Thursday following, from the description of the boys—I had known her before—she said she had never seen the man, and knew nothing about him—the pro<lb></lb>perty has not been found.</p>

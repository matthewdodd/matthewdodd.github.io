I gave the five handkerchiefs to Brown: I took the prisoners into a shop, for they would not walk - in the scuffle Deaddross' hat fell off and I saw these handkerchiefs in it; this was between nine and ten o'clock at night, nearly opposite Brownlow-street; I had seen Pratt put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take the handkerchief, and give it to Deaddross, who was about twenty yards off when he took it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ROBERTS. I was in Holborn and saw the two prisoners and a third person; I saw Pratt go and take the prosecutor's handkerchief - I went and told him: I went with Murray, and found the prisoners in Holborn and took them.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ASPREY. I am a watchman, and took the prisoners into custody; Deaddross said he had done nothing, but in the watch-house he owned one of the handkerchiefs.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>PRATT put in a written Defence, stating that he had been seduced into crime. Several witnesses gave him a good character, and engaged to employ him.</p>

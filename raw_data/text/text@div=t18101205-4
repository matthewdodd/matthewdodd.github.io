               <p>Q. Do you know which of the men did it - A. No, they were so close; I only felt something go, I cannot say who took it; I clapped my hand to my fob, and found it was gone. I had my wife with me, I said to my wife, my watch is gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing before they took it from you - A. No, and the moment I said I had lost my watch one of them threw it at me, I do not know which of them it was.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no struggle between you and the person that took it - A. No. They took it, and I immediately said I had lost it. The watchman was close at hand, he came up, I saw the prisoner, he was quite close to me, I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the watch fall - A. Yes, it fell near the place where the prisoner stood; I picked it up it appeared to me to fall from the prisoner, I could not be certain.</p>

               <p>Q. He did not stop you and ask you for your watch - A. No, it was all done in an instant. This is the watch that was taken out of my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am steward of Lincoln's-inn, and live in the New Hall with my family—no one else lives there. The prisoner was employed to attend as stoker to the furnaces for heating the hall—he did not sleep on the premises—there are rooms appropriated to me in the building—it is my dwelling-house—I live there, and have offices as well—I do not pay rates or taxes—the Society pay them—Mr. Henry William Tancred is one of the Benchers of the Inn, which is in the parish of St. Giles'-in-the-Fields—I am the sole occupier of the house—the occupation is part of my appointment—I cannot say that if I lived elsewhere my salary would be larger—I have coals, candles, and everything found me—Mr. Tancred was treasurer last year—he is the head of the Society—the prisoner had a key to let himself in to his work, and out at night, he being the last person in at night, it was his duty to put the gas out—that key opened two of the doors, the south entrance, which is the kitchen entrance, and the bencher's private door—the kitchen entrance would be the proper way for him to come in—he would have no right to come in the bencher's way—my office is similar to the under steward's of the Inner Temple—I have a passage to the bencher's apartments, and an outer door of my own besides—I am rated as the occupier—there are trustees—the Vice-Chancellor of England is one of them, and is also a member—there are several other benchers—they are trustees of the property—there are differ<lb></lb>ent trustees for the funded property—on the morning of the 31st of Dec., about half-past ten, from an intimation I received, I went into the still-room, which is used by the servants for washing and cleaning—it is underneath the ben<lb></lb>chers' apartments—I saw the prisoner there with a lock in his hand—he showed it me, and said, "See here, Sir, here has somebody been attempting to</p>

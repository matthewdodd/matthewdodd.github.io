            . I am an officer of Bishopsgate Ward. On the 19th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoner in company with another; the prisoner had a basket on his shoulder; they crossed over, and went through Clark's-court - I went round Camomile-street, and stopped the prisoner at the end of the court with it. I asked what it was; he said some wine, which he had brought from the Ship Tavern, and that the landlord's name was Thompson. I said that was not right, and I should detain him - he threw it down and ran away - I pursued and took him in Bishopsgate-street - returned and found the wine.</p>

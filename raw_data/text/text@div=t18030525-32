               <p>Cumming. It corresponds with the book.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that Dymock was a man of bad character, and refused to attend at the Office, on account of his being known there.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dymock.) Did you refuse to attend at the Office? - A. Yes, because I was very busy that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at the Office before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Hancock. I don't know Dymock; I do not believe he is known at the Office.</p>
               <p>Murrils. I have known him twelve years; he likes a drop of beer; I don't know any thing else against him. <rs id="t18030525-32-verdict181" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a chandler, and live in Lambeth-street, White<lb></lb>chapel. On the 15th of May I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock—I was the last person up in the house—I fastened the doors, locked and chained them—there is a cellar flap in front of the house—it opens with an iron bar under the shop window—it leads into the cellar, and was fastened with a padlock—between four and five o'clock next morning I heard a person knocking at the side-door, calling, "Mother"—I knew the voice—it was the prisoner—I got up about seven o'clock, and found the cellar flap open, the iron bar lying outside, and the padlock and staple gone—that would enable a person to get through the cellar, and up a ladder, into the shop—when I got up, the street door was unbolted, unlocked, and unchained—I missed a violin and bow, worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a shawl, worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a bag—I had seen the articles over<lb></lb>night—when my wife came from chapel she put her bonnet and shawl on the table, and the violin hung on a wall in the parlour—it was all safe when I went to bed—I saw the prisoner at my house once or twice after<lb></lb>wards—he was not given into custody when he called—I gave him into</p>

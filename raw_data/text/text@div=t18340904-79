               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And yet that shawl she is charged with stealing? A. I did not charge her with stealing it; but she is charged with having stolen it - after she left me, a woman, named Sarah Parr, came to my house, from the prisoner: to tell my nursemaid that the prisoner had her shawl, and desiring her to go to her for it, and to take her a shilling, which she owed her - I did not abuse the messenger and the prisoner - I said the prisoner was a very artful woman, she had robbed me, and at a future time she might expect to see me - and if she would come herself, she might have her two aprons, which she had left in her bed-room, if she would return half-a-crown to a young man who was servant to one of my lodgers - it was about a week before she was taken that I sent this message - if she had received that message, she had that week to have got rid of the property, but I do not know that she ever received the message - I did not know where the prisoner was living, till Mrs. Parr came and told my nursemaid, who told me - there was no letter came to my house for the prisoner - she brought a letter of character with her - I gave that letter to Mrs. Hampton, the lady the prisoner lived with before she came to me; I mean Mrs. Colonel Hampton, the lady who prosecuted her before - I gave it her, because I knew she was under an indictment for perjury - the prisoner told me where she lived, and I gave her the letter - I do not consider that letter belonged to the prisoner - she gave it me, and begged me to keep it until she took her trial - I heard that the prisoner was to be a witness against Mrs. Hampton - the prisoner wished me to give her a character, and therefore I did not suspect her, as I thought her character would be of more value to her than these trifling things - I took up one article in one of the boxes, which I thought was my husband's front, but it was not; and I took up some ostrich feathers, but they were not mine - I do not know that I claimed any other things, which the prisoner proved were hers - there were some plates and dishes taken down, and I said I had lost a great many, but I did not claim them - Mrs. Glass said they were hers, and I said, "Then take them" - I do not know that I swore to any things at the police-office which are not in this indictment.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are there any things which are left out of this indictment, because the prisoner could give clear proof that they were hers? A. There was a little pomatum pot, and the officer asked me if I could swear to that? - I said "No" - I only knew that my husband had a great many such, and it was taken out - I have no connexion with Mrs. Hampton - I never permitted the prisoner to have any of these things.</p>

            ; but Mr. Vickery having by mistake written my name "Hickers," in a former character, it was reported, after my trial at the Old Bailey, that it was a forgery; and, on my applying for a situation, that character was refused. I referred them to Mr. Hilyer, of Poland-street, Oxford-street, who had visited the family, and seen me there; and I called on him, begging him to state so - he said he remembered me perfectly well, and he remembered Mr. Vickery speaking highly of me, but the body of the letter being Mrs. Vickery's writing, Mr. Hilyer could not swear to it, and I was then thrown upon the open world, without friend or home, and destitute of character - in this distress, I applied to Mr. Hilyer, and stated the case to him exactly as it was - he pitied me much, and wished me to write to Mr. Vickery, informing him of my situation, and begging him to write my character in his own handwriting, which Mr. Hilyer would be able to prove was no forgery - but in three or four days after my trial and acquittal here, I was thrown upon a sick bed, and confined, by very serious illness, for a great length of time - as soon as I was sufficiently recovered to take a situation, I wrote to Mr. Vickery - I did not receive an answer for two or three days, and I wrote again, begging him to state the character I deserved while I was in his employ - in answer to this, he sent a letter, stating that I had lived twelve months in his service, and had conducted myself well - this letter concluded with his name and address, but it was directed to me by the name of "Mrs. Hickers" - I observed he had spelt my name wrong, but as my character had been so much injured by the prosecution, that I could not take a situation as lady's maid, I did not mention the mistake - I then heard of Mrs. Dove's situation - I applied there, and took my character - she read it, and said, if I thought proper to take her situation at six pounds a year, as servant of all work, she would hire me; there were six of her family, four lodgers, and all the washing done at home - but she said it would be made up to as good as thirty guineas a year - I entered her service, and when I had been about three weeks, I was one day standing at the door, when I saw Madam and Mr. Follet go by - I was aware that they knew me, and I was much afraid they would inform Mrs. Dove who I was, by which means I might lose my situation - Mrs. Dove's was the most wretched situation I ever heard of- still I determined to remain, as I knew I was starving, and was striving to regain a character which had been taken from me - a month passed on, and I observed a very great change in Mrs. Dove's behaviour - I was afraid she had heard that I had lived with Mrs. Hampton - in a few days after she called me into her room, and said, "I understand I have got a thief in my house, and you have lived with Mrs. Colonel Hampton?" - I said I had - she then said, "I am informed you are married?" - I said, "I am" - she said, "You have entered my service with a false name" - I said, No, I have not - I then explained the circumstances to her, and referred her to Mr. Hilyer, of Poland-street - she then said,"I have heard a most desperate character of you, and Mrs. Hampton has fearful apprehensions of you on her trial, and it would be better for you to go out of town" - I said, "I am a witness against her, and nothing shall induce me to leave London" - she then said, "Mrs. Hampton will give me any sum of money to get you out of the way, that you should not appear on the trial" - I said, I was afraid she would hear of me, as when Madam and Mr. Follet passed and saw me, I knew they would tell who I was - I stated how much I had suffered, and how much I dreaded a repetition of the past - she said, she felt much for me, and if I would stay, so far from allowing Hampton's party to injure me, she would protect me - I then passed two months in her service, suffering every privation - I had not a sufficiency of food to eat, having nothing but dry bread for eight or nine days together; in fact, we were half-starved, yet I submitted to it to regain my character - there was a gentleman named Palmer lived on the second floor - I had to clean his shoes and boots, and he found his own blacking - there was also another gentleman, who lived on the third floor, whose shoes I had to clean, and Mrs. Dove was to find blacking - she told me to black them with the other gentleman's blacking, and she made out bills for them as if they were cleaned at the hotel, giving me strict orders not to tell Mr. Palmer's servant - I had frequent opportunities of witnessing Mrs. Dove taking sugar and whitey brown paper of his, and if sixpenny-worth of biscuits came, she would take three or four of them - finding this to be the case, I had very little hopes of getting more than the 6l. a year - the time, however, for Mr. Palmer settling his bills came round, and Mrs. Dove said, no doubt he would give me two sovereigns, but he gave me nothing - Mr. Palmer's servant said that nearly a quarter of a pound of tea was taken - I made a reply, "Mrs. Dove has taken it, and she is in the habit of doing it; I should not like the gentleman to suppose that I had taken it, and if you will tell him this, and he will call her, I will say the same" - and Grant, who was then the nursemaid, corroborated my statement - when I have told Mrs. Dove I was dissatisfied with her situation, and that she had deceived me, she would fly into a rage, and say, I ought to be thankful that she kept me, and that if I left her, she would report it over the neighbourhood, and left it be known that I was a person who was tried at the Old Bailey - the gentleman then missed his French polish, and he said to Mrs. Dove, "My French polish goes very fast" - Mr. Dove called me up, and said to him, "Find out the thief, and I will prosecute them without mercy" - I said, "Mr. Dove, you know the shoes on your feet were cleaned with the polish in question" - Mrs. Dove then flew in a passion, and said, I was the person who had been prosecuted - that I was the thief who had stolen the blacking, and the polish, and that Mrs. Hampton and her would send me out of the country, if possible - I said, if she had any charge, she might prefer it - Mr. Dove wished a policeman to be sent for - I said I wished it too - Mrs. Dove then said,"Her character is well known as a reputed thief, and will the gentlemen believe I have robbed them, when she is a wellknown condemned felon at the Old Bailey?" - I then said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040051"></xptr>would leave her service immediately, and she desired me to get my things ready, and leave the house - I said I had no box there, (finding there was only a damp kitchen to put it in, and her husband was in the habit of routing the boxes,) and I must back," and Mrs, Dove said, "Here is a shawl, take this and tie your things in; I dare say you are going to Mrs. Wilson's" - I said, "No, I shall be at Mr. Glasse's, No. 6, West-row; Eliza owes me a shilling, and if she will call on me with it, she shall have the shawl" - I tied up my things, and took them into the parlour, and said if there was any thing of hers she might take it, and not to say as she had of the servant I succeeded; that she had robbed her of a silver fork, and she detained her things - she said she had lost nothing, and every thing there was my own - Mr. Dove said it was not from any merit due to me, but I wished to get a character - when I left, I applied to the green grocer for a situation; they said they could not think for recommending me, as Mrs. Dove had represented I was a thief - I said she should prove it - I then sent Parr to desire Mrs. Dove to give me the character I gave her, and said, I would sent to her to give me a character, and if she did not give me a just one. I would have her up to Marlborough-street- Mrs. Dove came out of the parlour, and spoke to Parr - she said I was a thief and a robber, and if there were a possibility of getting me into Newgate, before the week was out, she would do it - I sent word I was at Mrs. Glasse's, in West-row - Parr brought back her message to me, but I took no notice of it, as I knew I had not taken any thing of hers - on the Thursday following, I was at a young woman's in Maddox-street, when Schofield came, about three o'clock in the afternoon - he rang, and the servant went to the door - I heard a man say, "I am an officer of Marlborough-street" - I went up, and he said to me,"Ann, we have met once more in our lives; I have a search- warrant against you" - said, "Who has taken it out?" - he said, "Mrs. Dove" - I had slept with Ann Bargeley the night before, and my pocket was on the table- I then took my pocket in my hand, though Schofield had sworn that I untied it from my person, but that I deny; neither did I hand it to Mrs. Glasse in any clandestine manner - I had it in my hand, and I said, "Here, take me pocket, and put in into your pocket, as I do not like to be seen carrying it in my hand" - when we got to Marlborough-street office, he said, "You must go into the office with me" - I made no objection, and Schofield persisted in taking Mrs. Glasse in - she was then desired to turn out the contents of her pocket - she gave up my pocket, and said, "Here is the pocket that Ann gave me, but I do not know that you have any thing to do with mine;" she was compelled to turn out her pocket, but nothing was found but her own property - I was then taken to West-row - I looked at Mrs. Dove and said, "What have you to say against me?" - she said, "You shall find out" - there was a bundle tied up in the shawl - Schofield said,"Where are your boxes?" - I said, "These three" - the first was a deal box, without a lock at all, and in that these books were found - she then took a baby's cap, belonging to me, and said, "This is my husband's false front, take it to Marlborough-street" - Schofeld said it was a baby's cap; and she said, "It is exactly like my husband's false front, and I should have sworn to it" - she then took a piece of holland, and some other things, which she swore to, while I stood by silently, and allowed her to take any thing she thought proper - the next was a hair trunk - I pointed out the key, and it was opened - Mrs. Dove took from it these window curtains, and said, "These are my property, she has stolen them from me" - she turned every thing out, but took nothing more - the next was a bonnet-box, from which she took three ostrich feathers, and said,"These are mine, take them to Marlborough-street" - Mrs. Glasse said, "No, they belong to Miss Faulker, I can swear" - Mrs. Dove then turned round, and said, "I think we have got enough; I forgot, my feathers are gone to be cleaned" - they then talked of searching Mrs. Glasse's trunk - I said it was not mine, but I had forgotten that I had bought it of her, and I gave the key to Schofield - Mrs. Dove said, "You will find a pair of shoes in that trunk which belong to a lodger of mine" - it was opened, and the shoes were found- she said, "These are Mr. Palmer's" - I said, "These I took out of pawn, with a duplicate which you know I found" - Schofield said, "Where did you find it?" - I said, "Down the area" - the bundle was then opened, and the things were put all together, Mrs. Dove saying, it was all her property, and she would take it to Marlborough-street - I said I had had the cup and saucer when I lived at Mrs. Hampton's, but Mrs. Dove said they all belonged to her, and they were taken - when I was placed at the bar, at seven o'clock, the office was crowded, and Mrs. Dove began her statement - she said I had entered her situation with a forged name, and a forged character - that I had been a most inveterate thief, and that she had dismissed. me at a moment's notice, and the property produced I had robbed her of - the things were then placed on the bar, and she swore to them - when she took the cold cream-pot up, Mrs. Glasse said it was hers, and the magistrate allowed her to withdraw that - she stated that the candles were hers, and two of them were moulds; but they were all wax, and surely if she had lost them, she must have known what they were - she then swore to the blue bag, and some pieces of soap, and the blinds - she then took up the cups and saucers, which I can prove are mine; and though I cannot, unfortunately, prove that all the things are mine, yet I can prove this brown holland, which she has sworn to, was never in her house - this china cream-jug and the table-cloth belonged to my mother, who is dead - the china cup and saucer I brought from Devonshire; and the child's cup and saucer I bought at the door, for the purpose of making a present to a friend's little girl - the window-curtains she gave me to give to a poor old woman for neckerchiefs, but she is gone to the workhouse, and they were made dusters - the pieces of chintz, and bits of crape, Mrs. Dove gave me in exchange for a green band, to make her little boy's hat large enough - and these bits of carpet she threw out one day, and said, "You say you have an old footstool at Mrs. Glasse's, these may do to cover it." I now leave it to you to say whether it is likely I would risk my liberty and character for these paltry things, which would not fetch me half-a-crown, and which if found on me would certainly convict me; and whether I would have kept them for a week after I had received her message, to have risked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040052"></xptr>transportation, after enduring what I did in her service to gain a character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk-stockmaker, and live Wenlock-cottages, City-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—it is my dwelling-house. On going to bed, on the night of the 2nd of September, I saw my house and clothes safe, the doors were locked, and the windows down—one of the windows which looks into the street had neither shutter or fastening—on coming down next morning, I found the house had been entered—I missed forty-eight stocks from my warehouse, which is part of the dwelling-house, also five pairs of braces, a coat, umbrella, nine silver spoons, and ninety-six farthings, from a cupboard, and two boxes from a lumber-room—the property altogether is worth at least 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found foot-marks on the cill of the warehouse window, which had no fastening—the prisoner is my brother-in-law—he had been in my service, but I had dis<lb></lb>charged him, two days before the robbery—he was aware that that window had no fastening—I am positive it was shut down.</p>

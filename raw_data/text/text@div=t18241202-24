I collared him, and charged him with having stolen the handkerchief - he denied it, but I saw him shuffling at his left hand inside coat pocket, and insisted on knowing what he had there; I pulled his hand out, and the handkerchief was in it. I was taking him to the watch-house when the constable came up.</p>

            . I am a clerk, and live in Ball-court, Giltspur-street. I was proceeding along the Strand, when my attention was directed to the prisoner and another person, making an attempt at Mr. Godfrey's pocket. I was on the opposite side of the way, and was about to proceed across to inform Mr. Godfrey of it, when I saw the prisoner crossing with the handkerchief in his hand. Mr. Godfrey turned round, followed, and collared the prisoner in the middle of the road. I saw the handkerchief found in his hand, which was drawn from behind his coat.</p>

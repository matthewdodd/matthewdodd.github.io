On Sunday night, December the 15th, I was picked up in Drury-lane, at the end of Long-acre; I was a little in liquor, and was so foolish as to go with her; she took me to Angle's; we had some liquor there; there I missed my pocketbook, and asked for it: they said they had not got it; and one went out and then the other, and I went after them into the street. I saw Angle, and asked her for my pocket-book; then I missed my watch out of my fob. I ran after Angle; she got away. The next morning a young man that lodges with me went to Sir

            . On Monday morning a barber that lives in the front room of this house came and said. there was a gentleman robbed the over night in the room; I asked him which way he knew it; he said he had seen the gentleman. I went and searched the prisoner's lodging, which is the back room, and found underneath the drawers a pocket-book open and the papers all loose; the papers had all been examined. Mrs. Angle came in; I asked her where the watch was. What watch! said she. I said I have found the pocket-book, if you don't give it me I shall search you. She hesitated a long time; at last she pulled it out of her pocket. I took her into Bow-street. On examining the pocket-book I found who it belonged to, and sent a man to enquire whether this man lodged at the house that a letter was directed to him at.</p>

He left his watch with us for half a guinea till the next day; he took his pocket-book out to take our directions, and left it behind him.</p>

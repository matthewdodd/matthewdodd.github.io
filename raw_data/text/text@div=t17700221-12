               <p>Kennet Dixon. I live opposite Galley-key in Thames-street, at No 47, and am a merchant's agent and porter at the water-side. On the 20th of January I was in my own warehouse, a person came to me, and said, Mr. Dixon, if you don't take care, you will lose a piece of linen out of a chest; my window looks directly on the chest. It was what we call Pomerania linen, or narrow German. I looked, and saw the prisoner take it, and detected him with it. At that time I did not know whose it was, but now I do. (Produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210008"></xptr> in court, and deposed to.) I had hold of him before he let it fall. It is the property of May and Cothoi, merchants in Fenchurch-street.</p>

               <p>He called Eliz. Brian, who had known him between six and seven years, and had lodged at her house; she said, he was very honest and sober.</p>

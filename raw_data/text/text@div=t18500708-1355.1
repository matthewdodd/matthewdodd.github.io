                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On Saturday night, 16th June, I was coming along the Old Kent-road—the prisoner came up—she took we up a back lane—I gave her a fourpenny bit—I had a half-crown and a half-sovereign in my pocket—I was standing in the court with her—the prisoner had hold of me, and she took the money out of my waistcoat pocket—we had hold of each other—she had me up against the wall—she went over and spoke to a young man who was about five yards off—I missed my money and caught her by the hand, and a half-crown dropped out of her hand on the ground—I picked it up and kept hold of her, and gave her in charge—while I was holding her, the young man came up and told me to let go, but I did not—I was not drunk; I had had part of two pots of beer between five of us—I had no spirits.</p>

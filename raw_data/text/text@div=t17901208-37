               <p>I am servant to Mr. Wright.

               <p>Prisoner. Did not other people sleep in the room that night? - Yes, one William Alcock who collects land-tax for one of the wards in the city; and one Mr. Johnson slept in the same room; Johnson writes for Mr. Tancred, in Lincoln's-inn: the prisoner always behaved extremely well before this.</p>

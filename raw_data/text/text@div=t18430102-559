                  </hi>. I have been servant to Mr. Brown, of Liver-pool. I am not now in service, but live at Lee, in Kent—I have only been at home a month—the prisoner is my brother—on the 17th of Dec., I had four sovereigns in my desk, which I locked—on Saturday the 21st of Dec. I went to my desk, I tried the lock, but do not know whether it was locked or not—I do not know whether the key turned or not when I opened it—there was a mark of the desk having been forced open, and I missed four sovereigns—I had left the prisoner at home on the 20th, between seven and eight o'clock—he has always lived at home at my mother's expense, and has not done any work lately—he never would work—I have frequently given him clothes and other things—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at times, but no silver or gold—I kept my key in my pocket—I had not missed it—I never left it about—he had no means of living—he never did work, only at chance times.</p>

On Tuesday the 20th of Dec., about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner came there, and had something to drink—he changed a sovereign to pay for it, and left two sovereigns in my care—in about five minutes afterwards he took them back again, and went away about eleven o'clock at night—I did not know him before.</p>

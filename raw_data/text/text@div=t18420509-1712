                  </hi>. I live in Denmark-road, in the parish of Camberwell. On the 25th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock at noon, I left my house with my son who lives with me—I left the front door double locked, and the gate, the parlour door, and the door at the end of the passage, locked, but the outer door, which goes into the garden, was open, and ajar—there is a garden and a field in the rear of the house, and a road that runs parallel with our road and the cross-road leading to it—I received information, and returned to my house about five o'clock, I found the gate still locked, the street-door on the single lock, the back-parlour door open, and also the door leading to the kitchen, which I had left locked—on going up stairs, I found the drawer of the looking-glass, which I had locked, forced open—a desk in the parlour was broken open, and the things scattered about—I missed some coins from the desk, and from the looking-glass drawer a pair of bracelets, six rings, four brooches, and other articles, the whole worth between 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lost a table and tea-spoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Denmark-street. The back of my house faces the front of the prosecutrix's—about noon, on the 25th of April, I saw the prisoner walking backwards and for<lb></lb>wards some time before the prosecutrix's house—I saw him try the gate several times, and then he got over the gate, and opened the front door—I did not see any key, because he stood in front of the keyhole, but he ap<lb></lb>peared to be putting something to it—I did not see any thing in his hand—his hands were in front of him, as if he was opening it with a key—I saw him open the door—he then went in and shut it, I then went round to the front of the house—I found Goddard standing in the road—I told him to remain there while I went for a policeman—when I returned I found the prisoner in the hands of a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a druggist, and live at No. 68, Hatton-garden. About half-past one o'clock, on the 25th of April, I was in Denmark-road, Camberwell, and was spoken to at the front of the prose<lb></lb>cutrix's house—from what was said to me I went round to the back of the house, and went to the side of the house to get to the back, along a sort of passage—when I got to the back I saw the prisoner in the garden, and asked him if be belonged to the house—he said he did—I told him some<lb></lb>body was in front, and he had better go and answer the door—he went in, and I went to the front again, supposing from his appearance he belonged to the house—when I got in the front I saw the back of the prisoner, walk<lb></lb>ing about 100 yards off in the high road—I suppose he had got over the gardens, but could not see—he could not have come up the passage—I ran after him, and on my beginning to run he looked round, and ran too—I overtook him with considerable difficulty—I ran some distance—I brought him back opposite the house, and held him till a policeman came—he was taken to the station—I am able to swear to him from what I saw of him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cooper, a millwright. On the 26th of March, between eleven and twelve in the day, I went out of my master's shop. Coming in again, I met the prisoner at the bar coming out. I said, Do you want any body here? He answered, Yes; and named a name which I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner work there?</p>
               <p>Peak. No; he did not. He had this jack-plane in his hand. I said, My friend, did you bring that plane with you? He said, Yes. I took it and looked at it, and said, You have been robbing the shop. After that, I found the hammer and adz upon him; then I secured him, and took him before justice Welch. He said, he never had done such a thing before, and was very sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Russell-street, and am agent to Treutel and Wurtz, of Paris They are foreign booksellers to a large extent—I have a warehouse in No. 3, George-street, Euston-square—I had an immense number of divers works in sheets there—I am wholly responsible for them—in April last, I took the prisoner into my service, at the recommendation of Pfliler, a person in my employment, and he continued three or dour months—in the early part of August, I heard reports that my quires of works were sold as waste paper—on the 19th, I took the prisoner into custody, with an officer, at his house, High-street, Maryle<lb></lb>bone, (before going I went over the warehouse, and missed 1793 quires, worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>)—I told the prisoner I had come to apprehend him on charge of robbing my warehouse—he said, "I am quite innocent; oh dear me, how could I do it, when you always kept the key?"—he said no more then—I then left him in presence of the officer—he was in bed—after a</p>

On Friday, the 19th of August, I accompanied the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, in High-street, and found him in bed, and took him into custody—Mr. Kernot left the room—the prisoner said he could not imagine what could induce him to be so foolish as to be guilty of such an act, I asked now he could dispose of such a large quantity of paper—he said he disposed of it at different times, to three people, Mr. Mahon, in the Borough; Mr. Mahon, in the Waterloo-road; and Mr. Gosbell—I went the house of Mr. Mahon, in Blackman-street, Borough—Mr. Kernot, who was with me, stated what we came for, and he delivered to us 56 1/2 lbs. of paper—from that house he took us to the house in Waterloo-road, and delivered to us 46lbs.—we went to Mr. Drury, and received 146lbs., some more from Mr. Jeffryes, and 41 1/2lbs. from Mr. Wright.</p>

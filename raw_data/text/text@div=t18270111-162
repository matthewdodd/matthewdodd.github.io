            . I am an officer. I was applied to by Mr. Dearlove, of Peter-street, to watch Sharman; and on the 22d of December, a little before eight o'clock in the morning, I saw him come out of the shop with a batch of bread on his head; he went towards Great Windmill-street, and there Jenkins came up to him; he turned round, and said something to her; he stooped, and she took two loaves<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110063"></xptr>off the batch; he went round the corner to Ensworth's shop; she crossed the way, and threw a blue handkerchief over the two loaves. Sharman came out of the shop where he had left the bread, and went home. Jenkins went and stood by a picture shop in Crown-court. Sharman brought out another batch of bread, and went to Mrs. Duncan's, in Crown-court; he left all there except two loaves, which he brought out under his arm; he then passed Jenkins, and gave her a slap on her back with his hand; they went on together to Mr. Walwyn's wine-vaults, in Compton-street; they went in there, and staid some time; I saw Lovegrove and asked his assistance, and when they came out Jenkins had two loaves in her hand, but Sharman had none; they walked a little way together and then parted; Jenkins went on to Coventry-street; I tapped her on the shoulder, and said, "You have got some stolen property;" she said,"I have not." I asked where she got those loaves; she said from her husband, the baker; I said, "Are you sure he is your husband?" She hesitated and said, "No, he is a bit of a sweetheart." I sent her to the watch-house, and marked the loaves; I went to Dearlove's shop, where I found Sharman; he denied all knowledge of the woman, or having seen any loaves but what he took to the shops; I took him to the watch-house, and said to Jenkins, "Which is the man who gave you the loaves?" She said, "That is him." Sharman made no answer. I know Jenkins has borne a good character for years.</p>

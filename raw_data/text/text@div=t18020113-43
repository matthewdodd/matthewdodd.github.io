             sworn. - I am a labourer; I work for Mr. Grimshaw, a builder, in Bernard-street, Upper Russel-square: A great many tools having been lost from the building, I was set to watch, and on the 4th of December, about nine o'clock at night, it rained very hard, the prisoner came by with his left arm strait, instead of swinging it, which made me conceive he had something that was not his own; I asked him what he had got; he said he had nothing but his own property; I knew his tongue, for I had taken him the winter before for the same fact; I looked under his arm, and pulled out a tenon saw and an axe covered up in his apron; he told me, that was to keep the rain from it; I immediately took him to Hatton-garden, and the next morning I found out the two men that owned them. (The tools were produced and identified by May and Lewis.)</p>

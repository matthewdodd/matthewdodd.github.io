            . I am a conductor of the patrol. On the 6th of May, about ten o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner with another man who walked away - the prisoner had three pieces of lead tied in an apron. He said he had been to work at Kilburn, brought it from there, and was going to take it to Mr. Bing, of Tottenham-court-road, to change for new lead - that he was to bring 25 lbs. back, and his master lived at No. 7, Duke-street, Bloomsbury. He said he had about 40 lbs. of lead.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce three pieces of lead which Smith gave to me - three more pieces were found in a field adjoining the barracks. We took the prisoner to a public-house, and met Mr. Bing's foreman there; he said, in his presence, that he did not know him, and that he had no dealings with any one in Duke-street. I went to No. 7, Duke-street, but found no such person there - I compared the lead with the rest, and they tallied exactly.</p>

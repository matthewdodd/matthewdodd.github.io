            . I am groom to Mr. Arsant. I was at work at Mr. Perry's, where Mr. Marshall lives; I heard the shopman say the coat was stolen - this was on the 5th of July, and the next morning I saw the prisoner go to a chest at Mr. Arsant's, No.4, Bush-lane, where he worked, and take out a strange coat; I asked where he got it - he said his mother sent it him from the country; I asked him to deliver it up - he said he would not, and I told Pope, the foreman. I saw Marshall claim it before the Lord Mayor.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Arsant. Piper gave me information on Sunday morning; I went to the prisoner, and asked how he came by the coat which he had got on his back; he said it was from his mother in the country. I made him take it off, and give it to me; Marshall claimed it. He was taken up on Monday; he had not gone away. He was apprentice to Mr. Arsant, and had served four years.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master sent me to the banking-house, to assist the bricklayer; I laid my own coat in the passage, and in the evening, it being dark, I took this instead of it; I went back for my own on Saturday evening, and on Sunday I was going to take this back.</p>
               <p>JAMES MARSHALL re-examined. I heard of no strange coat being found there, and never heard of his coming for any coat.</p>

               <p>Q. What door?</p>
               <p>Taylor. An entry door that comes into the shop, not the street door. I went through the shop into a little room, and heard a noise in the shop. I went into the shop, and saw the Prisoner in the entry with these goods under his arm, and he went out into the street with them. I went out at the door, and cried, Ha Master! and then cried out, Stop Thief. He was taken with the goods under his arm before he was out of sight.</p>

            . I saw the Prisoner peeping in at the corner of the sash of the shop where there were some silk handkerchiefs. I saw him go in at the door without any thing under his arm, and he was not a minute before he came out with these checques under his arm: they were all loose, and I judged he could not be long enough to chaffer for them; and presently the maid came out, and cried, master, stop; so I took him by the collar, and carried him back to the shop. <rs id="t17450530-28-verdict176" type="verdictDescription">

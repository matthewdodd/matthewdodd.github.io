The prisoner Read was servant in the house—on the 9th of March I had occasion to go up stairn, and she said she was thirsty, and must have something to drink—I said she had better not go out, as mistress was out, and I would give her some drink—she said, "No, it is not enough, I am very thirsty, I have got one penny, and will go and get one pennyworth for myself"—her mother (Palmer) was washing there at the time, and she had come there about six o'clock in the evening to assist in folding the clothes, and left about half past ten o'clock—shortly after Read went out under the pretence of get<lb></lb>ting half a pint of beer, did not return—she lived at 21, Barrett s-court Oxford-street—I went there on Saturday morning, about ten o'clock, art they had both left their lodgings.</p>

Next day I went with the officer, and found it at Bridgewater-gardens, at a house. Lack was there. She said she lived there. It is an iron shop - she said it was her shop, and she wanted to know what business we had there. I found some new pewter, which was not mine. She said we had no business to search without a warrant. We found two hundred and fifty lbs. of my metal, covered over with straw, in different places, under the foot of the bed. She said she bought it, and had had it three or four days, and we had no business with it. It was stolen from my premises on the night of the 14th or 15th of June, and this was the 16th. I asked of whom she bought it - she made no reply. I am sure it is mine. We asked her if

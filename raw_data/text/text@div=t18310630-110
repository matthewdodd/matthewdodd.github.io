            . I am a City-officer. On the 21st of June I was coming from Whitechapel: the prisoner and two others ran by me - I saw something like a knife in his hand; they went along Aldgate High-street, and overtook a cart loaded with baggage - they were all three together; I saw the prisoner go behind the cart, and put his hand on the things which were in it - I did not then see any thing taken; they followed the cart on, and by the church met three or four others - they all followed the cart down Houndsditch, and when it got opposite <placeName id="t18310630-110-crimeloc593">Gravel-lane</placeName>

               <p>ROBERT WALKER. This was my cart; I was driving it - I was employed to carry this portmanteau and other goods; I had tied the portmanteau on the cart, and on receiving information I jumped down, and found they had cut the ropes and taken it.</p>

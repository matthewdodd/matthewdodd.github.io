            . Having received information of the loss of this cheque, I went the next day to Puget and Bainbridge, where it was payable, to stop the payment of it - they told me it had been paid on the 29th of March; and Mr. Minshull described the person who received it so accurately in person, dress, and voice, that I had no doubt it was the prisoner, and I took measures to have him apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he been any length of time in your service? A. He came to me in the name of

             (police-constable D 124). I took the prisoner at his house, No. 44, Bryanston-street - I said,"Robinson, I want you" - he said, "My name is not Robinson, it is Grant."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not explain that by saying he meant the name of another man who was going in was Grant? A. No.(The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had received the cheque from a person to get it changed - that he had left his lordship's service on the 22nd of March, and the cheque was not missed till the 2nd of April - as such he could not have stolen it - and that he had formerly restored a valuable diamond brooch which he had found.)</p>

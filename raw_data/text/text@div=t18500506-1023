                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Buckmaster, we live at 4, Norris-rents, Snow's-fields, Bermondsey. Butler was employed by me as a needle and charwoman for the last five months—she had free access to all parts of my house, but did not sleep there—on 16th March, she was at my house as usual, and was employed in cleaning the bedroom—I sent her to my bedroom, at half-past three—she came down in half an hour and went up again—I afterwards sent the child up-stairs, and the said she was gone—I went up, and she was gone—I did not see her again till the 18th of April—my money was in a box under my bed—the box was locked; the key was on my drawers—I opened the lock and everything was turned over in the box—the money was gone; it was in a purse, and the purse rolled up in a little handkerchief—the purse contained 50 sovereigns, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and the silver—I can posi<lb></lb>tively swear to this silver foreign coin, and this sixpence, which has two small holes in it—there is a medal beside—this foreign coin was found on the prisoner, and the sixpence on Butler—I remember on the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note there was the name of "Gibson, Change-alley"—when Butler went from my house, she left her bonnet and shawl behind her—when I saw her again on the 18th of April she was in bed in Gillingham's house, in Bluegate-fields, and said she was in a dying state—I asked her if she had had a doctor—she said, "No, I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 212.) On 18th April I went to a house in Blue-gate Fields—I saw Butler in bed—I asked her name—she said Williams—I asked her where she came from—she said from Westminster—the prisoner was present, and I then asked her how long Butler had been there—she said, "About a month"—I asked her if she knew her—she said, "No;" she came there for a lodging—I asked the prisoner if she had seen any money about her—she said she had laid out a few pounds for her while she was in bed—she said she had had wine, and gin, and oysters, and lamb chops—I then asked the prisoner whether she had changed any note—she said, "No," she had not; she had not seen one—I then left Butler in custody of another officer, as I was not certain she was the woman—I went to Mrs. Buckmaster's, in Snow's-fields, and she came and identified Butler—the prisoner was not in then, and I went to look for her—I saw her coming by King David-lane station, and I called her in—I said, "What about the note? what have you done with the note?"—she said, "I know nothing about it; I had no note"—I said, "The old lady says that you had" (I meant Butler)—the prisoner then said, "I will go up and see her"—she went to her own house, in Blue-gate Fields, to see Butler—I went with her—I then, in her presence, said to Butler, "What about the note?"—Butler said, "I gave it to the landlady?"—Gillingham then said she left it at the Royal Sovereign for safety, if the old woman should die, to put her underground—she did not say that in Butler's presence; we were going out of the door at the time—I searched the bed where Butler was lying, and there I found three sovereigns, four sixpences, and two small pieces of silver, and this purse, which was identified by the prosecutrix—that was all I found in the bed—I did not see the prisoner afterwards on that day—on the 23rd I apprehended her, and told her I wanted her for receiving the note, knowing it to be stolen—she said she did not know it, and she pulled out a pocket-book and gave it me, and in it were these pieces of coin—I asked her how she got them—she stated that they belonged to her son, and she had had them some time—the prosecutrix identified them—I am quite clear that the coins that she said belonged to her son were what are identified by the prose<lb></lb>cutrix—she distinctly identified one, and she says she had such a piece as the other—I then said to the prisoner, "They have missed some foreign coin"—she then said, "It was swept up in the house"—I found on her one sovereign, seven shillings, and one penny.</p>

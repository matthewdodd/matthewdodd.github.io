               <p>These two men said they would give me 1 s. if I would tell what I did; they said, can't you say so, there is no harm in that; they urged me, and at last I owned the other took it out a little way, then I took it quite out; I am a haymaker, and had been at work at Hornsey; I had been over the water to see if all the hay was got in; coming back, near Shoe-lane, I saw a man running as if he would break his neck; they never ran after him, but took hold of me.</p>

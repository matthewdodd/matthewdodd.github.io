                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Morleys in Gutter-lane—I was shopman to Mr. Charles Johnson, in September last—the prisoner was his porter—he had been there about five weeks On the 18th of September, in consequence of finding something I sent for Bennett the officer, and went with him and the prisoner to his lodg<lb></lb>ing, No. 19, Clifton-street, North-road, and in a pan of water, in the kitchen, was found a piece of linen, about two or three yards—this is it there is a mark of "No. 26" on it—it was merely the mark of the length—I did not know the mark—in a bed-room I found a short length of linen, with the mark, "26" on it—it is a custom in the trade to mark both ends of the linen with the same mark—these were similarly marked to the other pieces which were in my master's possession—I left the pri<lb></lb>soner at his lodgings, and communicated with my employer—I went next morning to the prisoner's lodging with sergeant Dick—we found the same two lengths there—the mark was on one, but off the other—it had been taken off—here is the one that has the mark on it—I took the linen away, and two table-covers, which I know to have formed part of our stock—we found another piece of linen at Attenbrough's, the pawnbroker's, marked "F 107"—I knew that to be Mr. Johnson's—it is the remaining part of the piece which was found at the prisoner's house—I am quite certain of that—it makes the twenty-six yards complete—it was one of the pieces bought on the 2nd of March last—we bought eight pieces, from No. 100 to 107, with the letter "F" marked on each—this piece was sent out to a customer on the 21st of June, and returned to Mr. Johnson—here is an<lb></lb>other piece of linen with a mark, which appears to have been rubbed out—I saw it in Finnigan's possession, and am quite positive it is Mr. John<lb></lb>son's—it is the only piece we had in the house marked in this partícular way, with a red mark, and I saw the pencil-marks on it—lawn is marked by means of a small piece of linen, on which the private mark is written and pinned near the end—on this piece of lawn here are the pin-holes, but the linen is not here—this is the part of the lawn where the mark was put.</p>

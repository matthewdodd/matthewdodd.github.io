               <p>On this day week I was in my warehouse, which is behind my house; I saw from the warehouse, the prisoner in the parlour, I then saw him take something from the side-board; immediately on his seeing me from the warehouse, he turned round to avoid me from the window; I came out from the warehouse into the street; I saw the prisoner walk out of the parlour into the passage and went in the street; I called to him and asked him what business he had there; he made no reply, I hastened after him and at the door laid hold of his collar; he was very reluctant; he resisted, I brought him back to the parlour, and rang a bell for a servant to come to me; he told me he wanted to see a Mrs. Smith, there was no such person; in my house, he said he had not seen her; I missed some of the things from the sideboard, and asked him if he had not got some of them, he said he had not; upon which I shook his coat and heard something rattle; I put my hand into his pocket and found this pair of salts, a wine funnel and two salt ladles; they are my property, they were in the parlour on the sideboard; I have no doubt of their being mine.</p>

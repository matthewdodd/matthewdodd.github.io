            . I am in the employ of the prosecutors - they received a case of goods - there was a deficiency in it - it was on one of the floors of the warehouse - it was brought in and opened by one of the workmen, and the contents brought to me in the counting-house on a paper - the prisoner generally accompanied the carman who brought the goods from Galley Quay - I am not aware on whose behalf he came - these goods came on a Thursday; I think it was the 15th of May - the goods appeared to be deficient from the account which was delivered to me of the contents of the case - I missed 12 dozen purses, and the other articles stated in the indictment - on the Monday following one of the young men gave me some information - I went to

            's, in Charles-street, Leather-lane - I found part of the property, and Mr. Barrett stated from whom he bought it - I was with the officer when the prisoner was taken in Thames-street - a person named Hollywell, who was with us, said to him, "Do you recollect my buying those purses of you?" the prisoner said, Yes; and he had bought them of a person on the quay - he was then taken.</p>

            . I am a general dealer. I know the prisoner - he came to my house on the 16th of May, I think - I had known him five or six months before- he has fetched me to see goods which I have bought of other persons - I bought of the prisoner eleven dozen and a half of purses, ten salad spoons and forks, for which I paid him a guinea - I sold them to Mr. Barrett the same day for 2l. 3s. 7d. - I was not aware of their value when I bought them - I was asked 30s. for them, and gave a guinea- a person named Lane was present, but he is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examined the things before you bought them? A. I did - I counted the purses - they appeared to be new - I think I got from Mr. Barrett the price I asked him - I did not think I bought them a particularly good bargain - I don't know whether they are worth more - I am not a dealer in toys - I never handled any of these articles before - I asked the price I did for them, as I have frequently been forced to abate something - I am always glad to buy any thing I can get a shilling or two by - I know the prosecutor's warehouse, but never was in it - I think I can swear I never was in it till after the prisoner was apprehended - there is scarcely a toy-warehouse that I am not in the habit of going to once or twice a week, except Mr. Joseph's - when I said I thought I could swear I never was in his warehouse, I meant I never had, but I turned it over in my mind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose these are not peculiar to your house in London? A. No - there are large consignments of such goods to other houses - I have no mark on these goods - I think they are mine - I paid the duty for such goods - I saw them put in the case again, and when they came home they were missing - they are worth between 6l. and 7l.</p>

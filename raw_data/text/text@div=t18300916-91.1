            . I am an officer. I have apartments in the same house; I looked for the prisoner and could not find him, till he was taken by Potter on another charge, in Surrey; the prosecutor on that charge did not appear, and he was detained on this - I said, "I want to ask you one question - what did you do with the pillows?" he said "I sold them to a Jew for five shillings, in Aldersgate-street;" I mentioned that Mr. Brown had lost them; Pooley forgot to tell you that he left his shoes, and ran down without them.</p>

            . I had the prisoner in custody on the 31st of August; I took him before the Alderman, and he was remanded - I sent to the prosecutor, and he was not at home; the prisoner was then remanded till the 2nd of September - he said, without having any promise or threat made to him, that he sold the pillows the next morning to a Jew for five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day I was taken, he had two glasses of gin and a pint of beer, and he confessed he did not know what he said nor what I said.</p>

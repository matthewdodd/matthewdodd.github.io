             I live at the Crown and Anchor, the corner of Saffron Hill. I stopped the prisoner with these things, on Sunday morning between six and seven; she and three men came to the house and called for a pot of beer; the evidence called me on one side, and said, he believed the woman had something she had no business with; he went out for a constable, and when he came back, she said, they were her brother's; she was a little in liquor. I thought proper to stop them till her brother came. I took her to Bridewell; she said, when taxed with the things, that they were her brother's.</p>

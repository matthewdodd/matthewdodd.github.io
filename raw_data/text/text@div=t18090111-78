               <p>Q. In the month of January last, and some time before, the prisoner, I believe, was in your employ as a clerk - A. He was, six years last July.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed and entrusted by you to receive money on your account - A. He was; I placed a deal of confidence in him as an honest man; that receipt is his own hand writing that Mr. Duzado produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the book that he made the entry first - A. This is the rough entry book kept by the prisoner entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he also make an entry in the cash book - A. He makes the entry there also; but that is Mr. Lyne's department; there is a letter B. that is Mr. Lyne's writing.</p>

               <p>Q. The entry respecting Mr. Duzado is the prisoner's hand writing - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that book, which is the entry of the ledger after the entry of Mr. Duzado - A. There is a B. Duzado twenty five pounds five shillings and sixpence, as a debt; 48 as the page of the ledger, in the prisoner's hand writing; 27th January, 1808, that signifies it to be paid on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever account to you any other way than in his rough entry book - A. In the cash book he accompted to Mr. Lyne; if I received money I always gave it to him, and he was to accompt to Mr. Lyne.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive the money of him of Mr. Duzado's - A. He never paid it to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. His duty was to receive money of a variety of people and to keep it till he took it to the bankers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His way of accompting himself was, by stating it in the book, and whenever he had a large sum to carry it to the bankers - A. Whenever Mr. Lyne ordered him to carry it.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner we are told kept the cash book - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had received money he was to enter it into the rough entry book, then in the cash book - when he accompted to you in the cash book did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110059"></xptr>compare the sums in that cash book with any thing else - A. They were posted in the ledger; we have another clerk here that posted it in the ledger, and I made a signature here that it was right; I compared this entry with the entry in the ledger, I found it was right; then I put a letter B. to denote that they corresponded.</p>
               <p>COURT. If it was found right with the cash book, then you put the letter B. to denote that it was right - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Does it correspond now - A. No, the entry in the ledger is twenty five pounds five shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you wrote that letter B. page 48, the accompt in the cash book was the same as in the ledger - A. Yes; it is now only fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence; the one before the five appears to be upon an erasure, and in the rough entry book it now stands fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence, and that one appears to be upon an erasure similar to the other; the prisoner accompted for money that he received in that cash book.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that cash book in you hand and tell me how much he has accompted to you for, as paid by Duzado - A. It appears only fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence, and casted up only as fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence, and paid into the hands of the bankers as fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence; it is fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence in the bankers book.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made the alterations in these books from twenty five to fifteen - A. I have not; I believe it to be his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. By the entry being made as they are now, without some suspicion arising, you would not have found it out - A. I do not think I should; it would not have been detected unless we had refered to the ledger. He remained in my service till the 5th of November; on the morning of the 6th of November, I received that letter. (The letter read.)</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any belief that the figure one is his hand writing - A. I cannot say that I have, it is so simple a thing, merely making a stroke.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other clerk besides him and you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Donaldson. The rough entry book, have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110060"></xptr>you altered that - A. I have not. The whole of the rough entry is in the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am sorry to be in so disgraceful a situation, of which I am innocent; I should have supposed that I was the last person in the world to be brought here by them; I was subject to their commands every hour. I admit I wrote the letters which have been read; it was done in consequence of the honour and the respectability of my family.</p>

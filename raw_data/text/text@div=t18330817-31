I saw the prisoner there the greater part of that afternoon; he was playing at skittles and betting - a person then asked him to play again - he said he could not, for he had no more money; in consequence of hearing of the loss of this money, I went down John-street, and went to the Antelope - I found the prisoner in a corner, and brought him back to my master's house.</p>

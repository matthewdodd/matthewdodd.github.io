On 5th July, about half-past seven, or a quarter to eight o'clock in the morning, I left my house secure, giving the key to a neighbour—I returned about half-past eight, or a quarter to nine, and found things littered about the bed-room, and the fastening out of the window, which was open—I missed several articles of wearing-apparel—they are my husband's—I have not recovered a quarter of them.</p>

It is three miles from Norwood to the public-house—I found the prisoner about two miles from Great Berkhampstead, in a wheat field—I was the other side of the hedge, and overheard him say to his sister, "Don't you think the police<lb></lb>man wants me for something?"—she said, no, she did not think I did—she had heard me say I did not—I had no warrant against him—he said, "I was afraid he wanted me for that Norwood affair"—I got over the hedge, and took him—I told him the charge—he said, "It is all over with me now; I shan't come here any more."</p>

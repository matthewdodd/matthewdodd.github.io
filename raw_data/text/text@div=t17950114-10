On the 10th day of November last I was very ill and a-bed, and between the hours of four and five in the evening there came Martha Peelthorpe to my door and knocked, and I refused letting her in several times, and all that I could get from her was, open the door, it is a friend! I refused four, five or six times for what I know. At last I knew her voice, and ill as I was, I got out of bed and opened the door. It is a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - Yes, she used to <rs id="t17950114-10-deflabel55" type="occupation">work in the slop way</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950114-10-defend121 t17950114-10-deflabel55"></join>.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known her? - About seven or eight months, I believe. I opened the door and she came in, and she asked me how I was? I told her I was very ill, and she sat down by the bed side and asked me if I would have any thing to drink? I told her if I had any thing to drink, it must be a drap of gin, and she took the bottle and went and fetched a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your usual remedy when you are ill? - When it came I could not drink it. I desired her to mix it among some mint and balm tea that was in a bason, and she mixed it, and seemed to lament over me that I was ill. I have no wife nor child; I have a single room, and have lived this forty years under the roof. Afterwards she withdrawed from the bedside and went to the fireside; she sat on the bed, when she was on the bed then she drank with me, and she withdrawed to the fireside where the watch hung underneath the mantle-piece.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140020"></xptr>Q. When had you seen it last? - I wound it up at half past three in the afternoon. I did not miss it till I was called at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Had any body been in the room between the time but her? - No living creature. When she had got the watch, I fancy she was so frustrated that she did not know what to do with it. At eight o'clock a little girl came and knocked at my door, and called me by my name, and told me the time of the night, and when she had so done I arose and got some part of my things on, and then I applied for a light.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought you the light? - I got it myself with the tinder box, as I usually did, and I took the light to see what o'clock it was and missed the watch, and it so surprised me that you might have knocked me down with a feather, and I put the remainder of my things on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the number or maker's name? - No, I did not. I put on the rest of my clothes and went after the prisoner; I followed her to her lodgings, and she had absconded from thence by robbing the servant girl of a box of clothes. She had been gone a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do next? - I went to my duty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have known this man some time, ask him if he did not strike a light and light me down stairs himself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was at eight o'clock when I struck a light.</p>
               <p>Court. She was with you before eight o'clock? - Yes, but she did not stay with me above twenty minutes, or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had she been gone when you struck a light? - Three hours at least.</p>

               <p>A few days after this watch was lost, the information came down to our office; I am a police officer at Whitechapel; me and other officers had been after this woman different times; on the 26th of December I found her in Whitechapel, in a public house, I brought her to the office and searched her minutely, but found nothing on her but the duplicate of an handkerchief and an old gown, which I went and saw, but they were of no value.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. When had you gone to bed and locked your door? - Just at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this woman come to your door? - A little before five. It is a spring lock; nobody could come in, and there was no key hole to the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have known this man some time, and I used to cohabit with him, and he used to come backward and forward to my lodgings, and he wanted me to come and live entirely with him. I met him one day in Whitechapel, and he desired I would call on him, and this day I had been at Whitechapel-road and I called on him, and he asked if it was me? and I said, it was Mrs. Peelthorpe. He said he was very glad I come as he wanted some gin; I went for some for him, and he desired I would come and lay down in the bed; I told him I could not stay; I fat with him and then went about my business; he said if I would come back again he would light a fire, and he got up and struck a light to light a fire, and lighted me down stairs, and told me to go over to the public house to get something and he would come over to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Simkins. How old are you? - If I live till next April I am seventy years old.</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you get into your room when you are out? - I have two locks on the door besides that spring lock; a padlock and a wooden lock, and I put the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140021"></xptr>spring lock back when I go out.</p>

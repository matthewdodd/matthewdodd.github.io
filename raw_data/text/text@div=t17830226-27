               <p>I am servant to Mr. Pratt, my master lost the things mentioned in the indictment on the 18th of January; I saw them on that day running about the yard, they were missed in the morning, about seven o'clock, I did not see them that morning; I was informed the poultry was at Hackney, and I went to look and found it all; the prisoner is the man that stole them: I did not know any thing of him before only by sight; having seen him go through the place that I look after; I keep a turnpike gate joining to Mr. Pratt's house; the turkey cock is all picked away under the gills; the cock has one foot bigger than the other; it is a game cock; one of the hens was a red speckled one, one white duck, and the other of a reddish cast, the gander is a grey one.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they were Mr. Pratt's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did you go to Hackney? - Between twelve and one.</p>

               <p>I pursued the prisoner, and overtook him in Back-lane, Clapton, that is about two miles from Tottenham; I asked what he had on his back, he replied fowls; I demanded to see them, he readily agreed to it, I immediately examined the budget; I drew out the turkey, I asked him what he had got else, and there was a gander, two cocks, two hens and two ducks, he said, he brought them from his mother's, and was carrying them to his uncle's at Greenwich; I asked him what he did there at so unseasonable an hour; it was half past two on Sunday morning the 19th of January; he said, he had been down at his mother's making merry, and he was a sawyer, and he came that road, and brought the fowls that way in order to get home in time, because one partner could not work without the other: I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>(Read.)</p>
               <p>Your petitioner humbly sheweth, that he has had the misfortune to catch the gaol distemper, which has reduced his constitution; and is so hoarse he is afraid he cannot inform this honourable court; therefore prays the following defence may be read. On Saturday I went to Tottenham-hill, to a person that owed me some money, coming home near Hilliard's ferry, I found the fowls in two bags, and the turkey with his legs tied; I told the watchman that I had brought them from my mother's, but little thought at the same time, that they had been stolen; but supposed they had been dropped from some cart or waggon.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I live at Brighton—I was a trustee under a deed respecting the affairs of Mr. Frank, a lunatic—there was a Chancery suit—Mr. Foster is a co-trustee of mine—I know Mr. Garey, the prisoner—he is a solicitor—he was employed by the younger children, and by their request we afterwards employed him up to a certain period, to save expense—we con<lb></lb>tinued to employ him up to the summer of last year—in June last I received this letter from him—it is his handwriting—I know his handwriting, having cor<lb></lb>responded with him—I never saw an order of the Court of Chancery, but he said an order had been made directing us to pay a certain sum into the Bank to the Accountant-General's account—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—"Southampton-buildings, 21st June, 1845. Dear Sir, On the other side I send you three checks for your signature—the first for 2,596<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is made up as follows:—Amount paid to Mr. Pease for principal, interest, and costs, directed to be paid into Court, with interest at 4 per cent, 1,241<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Interest thereon from the 16th of July, 1833, the time when the above sum was paid, to 23rd June, 1845, at 4 per cent., 591<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Amount of unpaid costs of the inquiries and pro<lb></lb>ceedings relative to the arrangement with Pease, directed to be paid into Court conditionally, 364<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Amount directed to be paid into Court, to an<lb></lb>swer the costs of Messrs. Foster and Evans, and Mr. Bull, of the application by them for payment out of the money to be received from the policies, if the Court shall order them to be paid, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; total, 2,596<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The second, for 915<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is made up as follows:—Amount of principal money secured by agreement, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; interest at 5 per cent., from 29th July, 1842, to 21st June, 1845, 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; total, 915<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The third is for my bill of costs for the proceedings in the cause of Waterman and Frank, and connected with these policies, which I send herewith. I have made an appointment with the Equitable Office to settle at twelve o'clock on Wednesday next, which I hope will suit your convenience. Mr. Triston has promised to have his bill, as connected with the policies, ready by Wednesday. I am, dear Sir, yours truly—<hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD BRYANT GAREY</hi>. To T. J. Bellamy, Esq.") On receiving this letter I signed this check, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>,) and wrote in it, "General unpaid costs account"—this is my signature, and I wrote across it, "Bank of England, on account of the Accountant-General"—that appears to have been since struck our, and "Messrs. Gosling and Co." has been written on it since it was in my hand—I believe that to be Mr. Garey's handwriting—when I had signed the check I think I enclosed it to Mr. Triston for Mr. Foster's signature—Mr. Triston is solicitor for Mr. Foster, my co-trustee, and he had been solicitor for me also—this is the letter I sent—between June and the January following I wrote to Mr. Foster respecting the money—I do not think I wrote to the prisoner or had any interview with him on the subject between Nov. and Jan.—I wrote to him requesting a copy of the receipt might be sent down—on the 18th Jan., 1846, I received from him this letter, marked A, enclosing this paper—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Thos. J. Bellamy, Esq., Montpelier-road, Brightou. 24, Southampton-buildings, 17th Jan., 1846. Dear Sir, I am sorry I was not in the office when</p>

I hope to get an order for payment of the funeral expenses at the petition-day after term. The report only waits for the completion of the taxation of Sir W. B. Cook's costs.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230044"></xptr>
               <p>complicated business—they had to go into the Ecclesiastical Court, for there was another will, and Mr. Garey had the conducting of the whole business—Mr. Triston received his costs, and Mr. Garey said they were correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that Mr. Triston had your authority to give Mr. Wakefield a brief to appear on the hearing of the petition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wrote to Mr. Garey, and then I wrote to Mr. Triston to go to Mr. Garey, and to see that it was done—I was informed that the order was drawn so that Mr. Garey was to receive the money—I said I should have no objection to trust Mr. Garey myself, but I could not as a trustee, and I desired Mr. Triston to see that the order was to pay to the trustees and not to him—there were two policies of insurance—I never understood they were to be handed over to Mr. Triston as my soli<lb></lb>citor—I acted entirely in this case under the advice of Mr. Garey, with the exception that when I heard he was to receive the money I said, "No, it must not be so; it must be paid to the trustees"—the policies were got through Mr. Garey's exertions—the commission of lunacy was taken out against Mr. Frank in 1825, I think—the commencement of his lunacy was declared to be from 1816—his income was about 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—in 1817 he made a deed of settlement of the Pontefract estate on his younger children—that deed became invalid, in consequence of the commencement of the lunacy being declared to be in 1816—there were two other children living at that time—after Mr. Frank became a lunatic, an allowance was made to himself and his family—that allowance to the younger children continued up to the time of his death—immediately upon his death the heir filed a bill to set aside the settlement of the Pontefract estate—Messrs. Foster, Evans, and Smith were concerned as attorneys for the younger children in the first instance—in consequence of Mr. Frank's death the three younger children had nothing except what their aunts chose to give them—their allowance was taken away the instant Mr. Frank died—Foster, Evans, and Smith were never concerned in the suit in Chancery—Mr. Garey was concerned as their solicitor at first, I think, but I do not know—Edward Bacon Frank, one of the younger children, had no property of his own—he was entitled to a rever<lb></lb>sion of one-third of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the death of his aunts Catherine and Elizabeth—he told me he had sold that reversion for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I advised him to go to his attorney directly, and pay the money, and get it back—I thought a court of equity would relieve him from such an imprudent bargain—Mr. Garey undertook the defence of this suit for the three younger children—he got an issue at law directed as to the validity of the settlement of 1816—Mr. Garey was then in the firm of Low, Garey, and Sweeting—I believe Mr. Garey was the acting man—it was finally decided by a verdict at law that the deed was a valid deed—he also succeeded in getting back the reversion—the proceed<lb></lb>ings in Chancery connected with both those matters, and the proceedings at law were very expensive—Messrs. Low, Garey, and Sweeting behaved remarkably well on that occasion, and did not ask the parties to advance much money, and immediately afterwards I paid them the whole amount—I do not know that Mr. Garey advanced money to go to trial out of his own private funds—I never heard of it—Mr. Garey, on the part of the three younger children, carried on the proceedings to recover the money on the policies—he was concerned for the younger children, and for myself at first, to avoid expense—he got the offices to pay the policies—it was a very difficult case—it was some years before the offices would pay the policies—Mr. Frank died a natural death—it is a question still to be decided whether the offices shall pay the interest on the policies—Mr. Garey quitted the firm of Low, Garey, and Sweeting about two or three years ago, when Mr. Low died—all these matters, of course, required outlays of money on the part of the solicitor, but Mr. Garey might have had any money he liked—before</p>

               <p>the deed was decided to be valid, I should say the younger children were merely dependent upon bounty for their existence—the whole weight of the matter was on myself, the contest with the elder brother as to the validity of the deed—I advanced them money before it was decided, and would have advanced anything—I went with 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—they asked me for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave it them—I would have given them anything—I forget what the proceedings came to—I think we paid 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as extra costs—the outlay was not so much as I expected it would have been—I think it was under 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other party had to pay costs—I do not know how much—it was a very heavy concern altogether—sales were made of portions of the Pon<lb></lb>tefract property—immediately I knew the value of the assistance we had from Low, Garey, and Sweeting, I said, of course, they ought to do the other business, the purchase, and they were employed—I think Mr. Garey always conducted the business connected with that—the monies upon those sales were paid to another attorney—Captain Mainwaring was my co-trustee, and he employed a separate solicitor—I employed Mr. Garey, because there should not be three solicitors—I do not know, of my own knowledge, that large sums passed through his hands in the progress of that business—they were paid into Coutts and Co.'s, by Mr. Govet—I think there was one sum paid in by Mr. Garey, and the rest by Mr. Govet, and one or two by Mr. Triston—Mr. Garey had the management of the business—he was to send the deeds to Mr. Govet, for Captain Mainwaring's signature—they were returned to Mr. Govet, and then Mr. Govet paid the money in—Mr. Garey did not receive the money from the purchasers—Mr. Govet did—he was Capt. Manwaring's solicitor, and Captain Mainwaring thought it right and proper that he should, he did not know Mr. Garey—I do not know that much of the money was paid to Mr. Garey, and by him handed over to Mr. Govet—I know that the money was carried to our account, as the trustees, at Coutts'—it may have all passed through Mr. Garey's hands, but I do not know it, and I do not think it did—I recollect that he received some deposits which I requested he would pay into Coutts', and he promised me he would—Mr. Edward Bacon Frank went with Mr. Garey to sell some part of the property, and Mr. Garey received the deposits—Mr. Edward Bacon Frank was Mr. Garey's client—I suppose Mr. Garey had a bill of costs against him, but not on that account—that would tell into the trustees' account—I do not know that his bill of costs against the three younger children was as much as 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Jan. last—that was the trust property—it had nothing to do with that—a bill of costs for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was delivered yesterday, I believe, or the day before—I do not know that a bill of costs is due by the Franks—I had no bills delivered to me till the night before last—I was told in coming to town, to go to the office, and there was Mr. Garey's attorney, with some papers, saying, they were indebted to him 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know anything about it—I should say Mr. Garey succeeded in getting for the three younger children, property to the value of between 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say the Pontefract estate was worth 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more, and the policies 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the interest on them is considerable—I do not know that Mr. Garey advanced money out of his pocket from time to time to Edward Bacon Frank, to support him—it is four or five years ago that the verdict at law was recovered—it was a long time pending after Mr. Frank's death—I do not know that the Master of the Rolls had pronounced the settlement deeds to be bad before Mr. Garey took it to issue—it is not so.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, and have chambers in Lincoln's-inn; I am co-trustee with Mr. Bellamy; Mr. Triston was my soli<lb></lb>citor. I recollect, in June last, his bringing me this letter—I recollect re<lb></lb>ceiving the check better than I recollect receiving the letter—it was imme<lb></lb>diately</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230046"></xptr>
               <p>after the date of the letter, about the 25th of June I should say—the check had at that time been signed by my co-trustee, Mr. Bellamy—I signed the check—I had an account at that time at Coutts', jointly with Mr. Bel<lb></lb>lamy—my impression is, that at the time I signed it the words "Gosling and Co." were not on it—when I had signed the check I gave it to Mr. Tris<lb></lb>ton to take it to Mr. Garey—I was not acquainted with Mr. Garey personally, except relating to this trust—he had not been acting for me, that I am aware of, in any way—in Dec. last I received this letter from Mr. Bellamy; I think it was the 8th of Dec.—in consequence of that letter I saw Mr. Garey at his place of business, in Southampton-buildings—I asked him if he had the office copy receipt of the Accountant-General for the amount of this money—he said he expected to have it in a day or two, or something to that effect—I had two or three interviews with him subsequent to this, shortly after—I cannot re<lb></lb>collect precisely what passed about the money having been paid, further than I was given to understand the money had been paid by Mr. Garey—I made an arrangement with him that the certificate or receipt was to be sent to Mr. Bellamy at Brighton—I recollect Mr. Bellamy coming to town about the 21st of Jan. on a Tuesday—I accompanied him to the Accountant-general's on the Wednesday, I think—in this month I accompanied Mr. Bellamy to the Chancery-office, Bank of England, and the sum mentioned in the order, 2,596<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was paid by me conjointly with Mr. Bellamy.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Solicitor for the trustees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I speak according to my own under<lb></lb>standing—by Mr. Triston's advice, I sanctioned Mr. Garey's employment to conduct the petition on behalf of the trustees—it was said it could be done in a less expensive way, if he appeared for all parties—the petition was, if I recollect right, to deliver the policies to Mr. Garey on behalf of all parties—I am speaking from recollection—the order directs that they should be delivered to Mr. Triston as solicitor for the trustees, after the cestuique trust have paid off Sir William Cooke's charges—I believe they were delivered to Mr. Triston—Mr. Triston attended with them at the office when the money was paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor. I was the solicitor of Mr. Fos<lb></lb>ter, and was also the solicitor for the trustees, Mr. Bellamy and Mr. Foster, generally—I recollect receiving this check from Mr. Bellamy—I took it to Mr. Foster and obtained his signature on the next day, and on the next day handed it to Mr. Garey—the words "Messrs. Goslings and Co." at that time were not on the check—it was crossed "Bank of England to the account of the Accountant-General"—in November I saw Mr. Garey two or three times, I think, on the subject of the Accountant-General's certificate and the Bank receipt—on that occasion I said that Mr. Bellamy and Mr. Foster wished to have the Accountant-General's receipt, and to know whether he had obtained it for the money paid in—Mr. Garey said he had not got it, that it was at the Accountant-General's office—I assumed in my question that the money had been paid in—I did not ask him whether it had—I asked him for the receipt for the money paid in—on each occasion he said he had not had time to send for it, or something of that kind—Mr. Garey conducted the business of the petition on which the order proceeded.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to ask him for the receipt for the money paid in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the check was paid to him for the purpose of paying in the money—I was to have the receipt at the re<lb></lb>quest of Messrs. Foster and Bellamy, as their general solicitor, as solicitor for the trustees—I delivered a brief, at a late stage of the proceeding, to Mr. Wakefield, and for a particular purpose, on the hearing of the petition, before the order was made—Mr. Wakefield's name is mentioned in the order—he was to represent Messrs. Bellamy and Foster—I sent in my bill of costs—the petition was pending only a few months, I think, speaking from recollection—the amount of my bill of costs at that time was 300 and odd pounds—it was a bill of costs running on for business done for ten years—I had not been paid for that time—it was relating to the policies—whilst those proceedings were going on I had not been paid—in the matter of the petition I should say that there was not above 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due—the next thing that was made on the hearing was the order—I had appeared on the petition in another capacity, as representing Sir William Cook, the committee of the estate—I had the policy in my hand as solicitor—I represented him when I delivered the brief to Mr. Wakefield—he appeared for Sir W. Cook—I took the petition to Mr. Foster—he perused and corrected it—I cannot say whether it was sent to Mr. Bellamy to be looked at—I do not think Mr. Bellamy saw it then—Mr. Foster corrected it for both of them—I think I did not say anything to Mr. Garey on the subject of the receipt before November—I have no recollection of that—I took the check to Mr. Garey myself—I recollect seeing him—I only handed it to him—I recollect no conversation, but I presume I must have said, "Here is the check from the trustees"—Mr. Bellamy was the only trustee in the suit in which Mr. Garey was concerned for the cestuique trust—Mr. Foster had nothing to do with that suit, only Mr. Bellamy and Captain Mainwaring—I was only concerned for Mr. Bellamy—when Mr. Garey took the case up it was considered to be a very difficult one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Accountant-General's office. When an order is made for any payment into the name of the Accountant-General at the Bank, the solicitor brings the order to the Accountant-General's office, and the clerk who takes the order reads it, to see what is to be done under it—whatever the order directs to be done the clerk draws—in such an order as this there are three separate sums to be paid into the Accountant-General's name to three separate and distinct accounts—one of these sums requires that the interest of it should be verified by affidavit, and then, as far as that sum is concerned, the solicitor must bring an affidavit of the amount of interest to be paid under the order—from such an order as this the clerk would draw three directions, one sum to go to one account, one to a second, and one, with interest, to a third—the certificates or directions are then handed over to another clerk to examine with the order—he then draws another certificate, which we call in the office a duplicate, but it is not exactly a duplicate, as the tense is altered—the first direction is to pay it in, and the other direction is, having paid it in; it is a duplicate with that difference—the first direction is taken into the Accountant-General, whose order the clerk proceeds to draw; and if the Accountant-General finds the certificates are drawn agreeably to the order he signs them—the second certificate is not signed then—it is put by—the first is entered in a book, and then delivered to the solicitor, who takes it to the Bank, pays the money, and obtains a Bank receipt—he then brings that receipt back to the Accountant-General's office, signed by the cashier, which is compared with the duplicate, and if found to be correct, it is annexed to the Bank receipt, signed by the Accountant-General, and taken to the office of the clerk of accounts, a branch of the Report-office, where they are both filed—office copies are then made of them—the originals are filed and kept in the Report-office, for the purposes of Court—the office co<lb></lb>pies are received by the Court as evidence—they are brought to the Account<lb></lb>ant-General's office, and put into pigeon-holes under letters, for the solicitors to take away—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the forged document</hi>)—this is very nearly in the form of such an office copy as I have described, but in those the price is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a wrong price is charged for it—they charge so much per folio at the Report-office for copying, and the price is always put in the margin—it has nothing to do with the contents of the order—the docu<lb></lb>ment itself is in the ordinary form of an office-copy, such as I have described—there is no price on the original—the "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is not a copy of anything—such a certificate as this would not be a certificate under this order, be<lb></lb>cause it directs to pay three different sums—the original could not possibly be drawn so, this is such a certificate as would be made if there was but one sum.</p>

               <p>early as the 10th—a direction to pay in money would have been attended to up to the very day of closing—there is generally a great rush of people before the office closes—a great number of orders are brought in for the payment of costs, which keeps the clerks employed—the office does not open again till about the 2nd of Nov., the first day of term—if the interest is calculated short of the day of payment we could not take the money—the Bank would not take it—the Accountant-General's direction is to pay in on or before, up to the date—there is no order that all sums paid to the Accountant-General should be paid in cash, and not by check—not one-tenth part of the railroad money has been paid in cash.</p>

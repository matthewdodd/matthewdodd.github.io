On the 8th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in to purchase a yard of cotton. I did not miss the print until the constable brought it to know who it belonged to. I looked at the print, and found my private mark upon it. He brought the piece of cotton with it that the prisoner had bought of me - that brought the prisoner to my recollection - she was at the watch-house when I saw her again.</p>

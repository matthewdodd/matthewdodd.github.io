After she was discharged, this Parcel of Cambrick was found conceal'd in her Bed; another Servant found it, and brought it to me. I examined the Stock in my Shop, and found I had lost Cambrick, but I cannot swear to this, because she has destroy'd the Mark. The Fan belongs to a Lady who came to my House on Lord-Mayor's Day to see the Show; 'tis a very particular Thing, and I took particular Notice of it, and swear 'tis the same. The Day after she was discharged, I went in pursuit of her, and found her; I tax'd her with the Goods, and she confess'd she stole the Cambrick while the Family was at Church, and that the Fan was at one Mary Brand's House; she took it off the Table in the Dining-Room; she own'd she took the Fan, the Cambrick, and this Apron. I did promise, (in order to bring her to a Confession) that I would be as favourable to her as I could; but I did not promise her that I would not prosecute her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, P</hi> 8). On the night of 30th, and morning of 31st Oct., I was on duty in the Old Kent-road, and about a quarter to 2 o'clock, I was passing the house of Mr. Roberts, a linen draper, in Bruns<lb></lb>wick-place—I heard a noise, and went up to the shop door, looked through a crevice by the side of the door, and saw the two prisoners—Simpson was holding a candle, and Mitchell was packing up goods in bundles—I waited five minutes looking at them, and then sent for another constable—I heard Neville coming, and sent Rowbotham to him that he should not speak to me—I sent Neville to the back of the house—I heard the front door un<lb></lb>bolted, and then heard something snap, as if it was a lucifer; a light then reappeared and was put out again almost directly—I then heard them unfas<lb></lb>tening the bar that was across the door, and in about a minute after that the door was opened slightly, and I rushed in and took Simpson into cus<lb></lb>tody—while I was in the act of doing so, he made a desperate blow at me with a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, but I caught his arm, and caught him by the throat with my right hand, and he did not strike me—I threw him on his back directly, and grasped his throat and arm—he said, "All right, all right, I will do nothing"—Rowbotham was close to me at that time—I saw Mit<lb></lb>chell in the room directly I went in, but he escaped through the back of the shop—I did not know him before, only by seeing him through the crevice—I left Simpson in custody of other constables who had come up, went into the shop, and found eight large bundles tied up with shawls very loosely, with knots across—I saw Mitchell again, between five and ten minutes afterwards, he was brought by Neville round to the front of the shop—I examined the premises, and found a desk broken open at the back of the shop—I then proceeded to the first floor window, and saw that a pane of glass had been broken, by which an arm could be put in, and the window unfastened—the broken pane was close to the fastening—the shop projects in front, and the first floor window opens on to leads—I took this small crow bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), from Simpson's hand, and in the shop leading to the back premises, I found this life preserver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mitchell must have gone that way—I took the prisoners to the station, searched them, and found on Simpson, six silver spoons, one electro plated spoon, one fork, a silver knife rest, 3 skeleton keys, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in silver, and copper, and a quan<lb></lb>tity of receipt and postage stamps—I found on Mitchell, a silver fruit knife,</p>

On the morning of 31st Oct., I was in the Kent-road—Rowbotham came to me, and in consequence of something he said, I went to Mr. Roberta's shop—I received directions from sergeant Pay, went to the back of the premises, got over the gardens to within two gardens of Mr. Roberta's, and as I stood on a wall I saw Mitchell coming from the back of Mr. Roberts's house, getting over the fence from the yard into somebody else's garden—I was about thirty yards from Mr. Roberts's garden—there were two gardens between—I followed him over several gardens, and took him without losing sight of him—he said nothing, but tried to escape, and was <hi rend="italic">tustling</hi> for a few minutes—I sprang my rattle, and the parties got up, and let me into the street—it was about two o'clock.</p>

I was aroused about 2 o'clock in the morning by a policeman's rattle, and a knocking—I got out of bed, went to the back bed room window, threw open the sash, and saw a policeman on the wall of the adjoining premises—he called out, "There are thieves in your house, for God's sake come down!"—I came down stairs, and in the shop found several bundles of goods, near the door; they were mine, and had been on shelves and boxes, and some in the window—I had gone to bed about 11 o'clock, the window fastenings were then secure—I believe I was the last person up, but not the last in the shop; my appren-tike has to turn the gas out, and he brought me the key of the shop—I found the counting house door broken open, and almost all my papers in the counting house disturbed, and my desk also, which had not been locked—</p>

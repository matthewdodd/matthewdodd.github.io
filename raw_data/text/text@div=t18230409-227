On the 6th of April, at seven o'clock, I went into the Bell public-house Ratcliffe-highway. The female prisoner was in the tap-room; she drank with me - we were together about an hour. She then asked me to go home with her, and took me to a private piece of ground near the fields; we stopped there about six minutes, and then a man passed me very close, (this was about eight o'clock at night). The man pushed before me, and in an instant I missed my watch from my fob. I instantly charged her with stealing it - she denied it, and said she did not know that I had got one. I said I would not let her go till she gave it me - she asked if I saw a man pass; I said Yes.</p>
               <p>"Well," said she,</p>
               <p>"he has got your watch, and I will take you to his home." She took me to a house in Seven Star-alley, to the male prisoner's mother - I took her to the watch-house. I only know that one of the two must have taken it.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I live at Norwood, in Surry.</p>
               <p>Q. Last Friday week were you in company with two persons of the names of Peake and Dimmock - A. Yes. Dimmock and Peake went out with me to a house in Petticoat-lane. I had fifty guineas in my pocket. I went into the house; I pulled out these guineas along with some silver. Davis came in and saw the guineas in my hand; he asked me to go to his house; he said he would give me a pound note and a shilling for every one of the guineas, and something to eat and drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him to his house - A. Yes; and

             and Dimmock went with me. Mr. Davis went with us. I put down the fifty guineas on the desk; he looked at them, and then he put them into a bit of paper.

             put some guineas down. I do not know how many; Davis, the prisoner, put them in a bit of paper also. Davis took a key out of the cupboard by the side of the fire-place. He took them up stairs, and said, he would bring down the notes directly for them. He went out of the room; he left me; Peake, and Dimmock, in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he came back - A. He was gone three hours, I dare say. When he came back, he said he had been to the Bank, he could not get change; he said he was very sorry he had been so long. He asked us to eat and drink; we had some beer. There came in another gentleman; he could not give change; then he went out; he was to meet us at a public-house in Mitre-court. Davis went with us to Mitre-court; the other man said he would go and get change, and come to us.</p>
               <p>Q. You three, and the prisoner, went to Mitre-court; he treated you with some liquor - A. We had some beer there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you and the prisoner stay together at the house in Mitre-court - A. Half an hour, I dare say, Davis waited there; he found this man did not come; Davis said, he would go and see for him; he went, and never returned.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your guineas again - A. No, not a farthing. A letter came at the Mitre; he sent a note in his name. The next day we went for the warrant. Saturday evening he was taken up and brought to the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. When did you come from Norwood - A. That day I was going to Smithfield to buy a horse and cart. Peake and Dimmock were going with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it you first saw Davis, and had this refreshment in Petticoat-lane - A. About eleven o'clock in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that - A. About one, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you dined - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You pulled out your guineas, and Davis said he would give you a dinner, he would give you a one-pound note and a shilling for each of them, that you are sure of - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He went out with a note in his hand - A. I did not see the note.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him hand it to the other man to get change for it, did not you - A. When he came back; and then the other man went away to get money for the note.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him give the man the note to get change for it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He took you from the first public-house he met you to his own house - A. Yes; and there he kept me some time waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he took you to another public-house, and waited there half an hour. In consequence of that note sent there, did not you go to his own house the next morning, and not finding him there you went to Worship-street Office - A. We went there twice or three times, in Petticoat-lane, and waited about, and then we went to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday morning you went to his house, and not finding him at home, went to Worship-street Office. There was a message left for you, if you called at three o'clock you should have your money; you went to Worship-street by eleven - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it brought you and your friends to Petticoat-lane - 
               <persName id="t18121202-107-person1075">A. Jesse Peake</persName>
             had something the matter with his child; he went to Petticoat-lane to buy a medicine for the worms.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard that guineas would fetch a great deal more than twenty-one shillings, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had not you asked twenty-eight shillings a-piece for your guineas before you spoke to Davis - A. No; nor did any person, in my hearing, offer them at any price, and that upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the sign of the house - A. No; I did not take any notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Now mind you are upon your oath. Did you never offer the landlord the guineas, or hear any person offer any, at any price from twenty-eight shillings to a guinea - A. I never heard any body, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard Peake, or any man, offer guineas for more than twenty-one shillings - A. No. We went to Davis's house and counted them out. He said he would give us something to eat and drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reckoning - A. We had a glass of liquor each.</p>
               <p>Q. And to pay that reckoning you pulled your guineas out - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the price you were going to give for your horse and cart in Smithfield - A. I do not know how much they would ask. I would have given twenty pound, or fifty pound if it had been a good horse and cart. I fetched this money from a person that kept it for me at Norwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man offer to pay you thirty-five pound in part, and say he would give you the remainder in the morning - A. No. Nor offer it as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Sir, I ask you again, was not the bargain between you and the prisoner entirely for the purchase of guineas for more than one pound and a shilling - A. No; I never offered any guineas to the landlord, or ever saw or heard any offered to the landlord.</p>

            . I am a labouring man. I live at Norwood. On last Friday week I came to town with Rowe and Dimmock. I went with them to a public-house in Petticoat-lane. Rowe took out his money to pay for the liquor; he took out guineas and silver. I saw Mr. Davis there. Upon Rowe taking out the guineas Davis called us out, then we went into his house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020070"></xptr>he asked Rowe were he was going to with them guineas; Rowe said, he was going to lay them out at Smithfield; then he called us into the warehouse, when we got there, he said if we would let him have the guineas, he would give us what we liked to eat and drink, and give us the change in notes; he would give us a pound note and a shilling for each guinea. Upon this Rowe took out of his pocket fifty guineas, he told them down on the desk, before Mr. Davis. Davis took them up, counted them, and looked at them very precisely, to see whether they were good; he wrapped them up in a bit of paper. I produced fourteen guineas; I told them down on the desk, he picked them up and looked at them, and put them in paper to the others, and kept them just the same as he had done with Rowe's guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. He never delivered them to you, or put them down on the desk again - A. No, he took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Now had you any intention of parting with them without a one pound note and a shilling - A. No; and something to eat and drink.</p>
               <p>COURT. You never expected to give him credit - A. No. I did not mean to part with them without a note and a shilling for them. He said, he had to go up stairs and fetch the notes down, in a few minutes he left the room, and I suppose he was gone three hours, or more. When he came back he said he had been to the Bank; he could get no change. He asked us whether we had any thing to eat and drink; we said, no. He said, it was our own fault, there was plenty of victuals; so there was, but there we were waiting for the money to come. He asked us if we could go out and have any thing to drink; he took us out and gave us a glass of rum each, and asked us if we would have any more; we said, no. He brought us into his house again. He said there would be a gentleman in presently, he dare say, he would bring the change. The gentleman came in, and said, he could not get change; he pulled out some kind of paper, he gave it to Mr. Davis's man to go out and get change; the man went out, came in again, and said, the gentleman that he had been to could not give change, he had sent all his money to the Bank; that was about five o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you first meet him at the public-house - A. Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did he get the guineas from you, and left his house - A. About a quarter to one. When the servant came back, and said he could not get change, then he said he would make another try; he took us to the Mitre, at Aldgate. The other gentleman went out of the house, he promised Mr. Davis that he would meet us at the Mitre. We went with the prisoner to the Mitre; he desired us to call for something to drink, and he would pay for it; we did. He stopped in the room half an hour with us. I asked him whether he would give me change, or else give me the guineas back again. He then said he would go out and have another try about it, and he would not be gone half an hour; he looked up at the clock, then he left us, and sent a letter. In consequence of that letter I went the next morning with the other men to his house, about five minutes before ten o'clock. Ten o'clock was the time appointed. He was not at home, and the servant said he had not slept at home since his wife had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about three o'clock - A. No, I never heard a word about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you and the other men stop - A. One man stopped in the house about two or three hours. I stopped with Rowe half an hour; we went into a public-house and got some beer; we went back again; I left Rowe in the house. I and Dimmock went as far as Gracechurch-street, and came back again, then we got something to eat and drink at Aldgate market. Rowe and Dimmock went to Worship-street. I bought some things and went home to my wife. The prisoner was taken up and taken to the Justice. I have never seen the money since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What business had you in Petticoat-lane - A. We all came to London together. I was going to Smithfield to buy pigs; I was going to get some worm-cakes for my children. We went into the Black Lion, Petticoat-lane; we stopped at this house and had some gin.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the conversation about guineas - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to the landlord about your guineas - A. No, not a word; I never mentioned it to the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live in the village of Norwood - A. I live upon the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that guineas were sold in London at a high price - A. No; I never heard any thing of the kind.</p>

            . I live in Norwood. I formerly used to drive the Norwood coach; I since drove the Greenwich coach. Last Friday week I came with Rowe, and Peake, to London. Rowe said he was coming to town to buy a horse and cart. We called at a public-house, in Petticoat-lane, and drank; Rowe was going to pay for it. Rowe took a sixpence out of his pocket; he might with it take a few guineas; I cannot say how many. As soon as Rowe paid for the liquor, I then saw Davis, the prisoner; he said, come here, my friends, follow me to my house, I live at the next door, I want to speak to you. We followed him; he went into his back room. He said, young men, you have got a few guineas, if you can let me have them I shall be obliged to you, it would be of service to him, we shall have a good dinner. He said he would give us change in notes.

             said, Sir, I am going to lay them out. Davis said, if you will let me have them I will make you comfortable. Peake took out fourteen, Rowe took out fifty, they took them out and put them on the desk. Davis took them up and put them in a bit of paper; he then wrapped up Peake's fourteen; he wrapped them up in a bit of paper and put them in his pocket; he then said, I shall not be above half a minute going up stairs; he left the room. He was gone three hours, he then came in, all in an hurry, wiping his face; he said, have you had something to eat and drink. I said, no, we have no money. He said, come along with me and have a glass of liquor, I am sure you must want it. He said, a gentleman would be in presently. The gentleman came in, all of a hurry, he said, he had been running about every where, he could get no change in all the world. - Davis said, you follow me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body sent out while you were there - A. No. He told us to follow him; we followed him through courts and alleys, and at last we found ourselves<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020071"></xptr>at the Mitre, at Aldgate; he staid with us about twenty minutes there. I and Rowe said, I wish you would be so kind as to get the money; he said, do not make yourself unhappy, I will be back in half an hour. He did not come back; we staid for his coming back. We had some note sent us. We went to his house the next day; we waited there from ten o'clock, all day, until dark. We went to Worship-street at five o'clock. He was taken on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How did you come to town - A. We walked. We got to Petticoat-lane between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. What business led you to Petticoat-lane - A. To call at a shop where they sell horse medicines and worm cakes. I told them where to go. Rowe, I believe, wanted the horse medicine, and Peake the worm cakes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the sign of the public house that you went into to drink - A. No; I had two glasses there, Rowe had one. Rowe took some money out. The landlord served us. I do not think I should know him again if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not there while you were drinking - A. If he was there I did not see him; I think it must be somebody else to tell him. Not a word about the guineas were said in that public house, or at the door, that I saw or heard.</p>
               <p>Q. When Rowe took his money out he said nothing about it; you did not see the prisoner until you came to the door - A. I am sure I never saw the prisoner in the house. Davis said in the street, come, my lads, here is the house, I want to speak with you; I only live next door. We never knew what we were going about, nor till after we went into his house. What I tell you is a fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose service were you in when you came to Petticoat-lane - A. None. I had been out of employ above three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard that guineas were sold for more than twenty-one shillings - A. I have heard that such things have been done. I never sold any. I should be afraid to do it least I should get into trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not mentioned about selling guineas in the public house - A. I never heard it mentioned to the landlord. I never heard the guineas mentioned. In the public house there was a Jew boy that comes about Gracechurch-street; he knew me; he had a glass of gin on my account. There was nothing passed about buying guineas in the public house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, these people agreed with me at the rate of one pound seven shillings and four pence each guinea. I never meaned to give any more than one pound one shilling for each guinea. I did not seem inclined to give any more than the real statute mentions for each guinea, and that I was ready to give. They would not take less than one pound seven shillings and four pence.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, about a fortnight ago, three men coming to your house - A. I do not remember; but one Dimmock, I remember him; it was between two and three, to the best of my recollection; he came in with another man; it was not either of these men. Dimmock had a glass of gin. The other man had not money enough to pay for one. Dimmock was the only man that had the glass of gin. It was last Friday was a week, I believe; it was the 27th. Dimmock took his gin; he said, will you give me twenty-eight shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever known the man before - A. I never saw him before with my eyes. Said I, guineas; he said, yes. I said, I do not do any thing in that way; I have enough to mind my own business. He said, have you no man in your house that deals in this kind of way. I said, I know nothing at all of it. I saw him go out afterwards with Mr. Davis, and I saw no more of them. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you attend at the office when the prisoner was examined - A. No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Rowe and Peake were never in your house - A. Never, in my life. I was in the bar when Dimmock was there. I am in my bar eleven months out of twelve; if you were to come you would see me there.</p>
               <p>Q. I shall not come, you may depend upon it, therefore if the others came before or after him you must have seen him - A. To be sure I must. I poured out the glass of gin for Dimmock myself. The other persons, they were never in my house, and if any person has sworn it, I do not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was Dimmock a stranger to you at that time - A. Yes; I saw him before that time, but I recollect his person; and the man that came with him goes by the nick name of Gatchey. Gatchey paid for a glass of liquor for Dimmock. I heard Dimmock say to Davis, I want you. Gatchey went out and stood at the window; he paid for the gin. Dimmock took Mr. Davis out with him, and I saw no more of them. Dimmock was in company with no other person but Gatchey, if he had I must have seen it; my bar is not big enough for three persons. Gatchey goes out with an old clothes bag; I lend him money to get his living; he has three or four children at home.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember a man coming there - A. Yes, Dimmock; I paid for a glass of gin for him there; two pence halfpenny. When I came from Greenwich I used to come by his coach. I met Dimmock as I was going out of the Black Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with him - A. There was one man, but if I was to see him I should not know him; there was one person with him. Dimmock asked me to treat him with a glass; he said to me, Joe, do you buy guineas; I said, no, I do not. He said to the landlord, can you afford to give twenty-eight shillings for a guinea; and then he said in the house to me, do you buy guineas; I said, no. The landlord said he did not deal in this kind of money at all. Dimmock said, may I go and look if there is a purchaser in the place. He went towards the tap-room door; I did not go with him; he opened the tap-room door. I saw nothing more but Mr. Davis coming out with him. That is all I saw.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prisoner at the bar. He lives in Petticoat-lane; he keeps a house there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming home last Friday week with three persons in his company - A. Yes, I do, about four o'clock in the afternoon; it was near Sabbath. I was present while he was talking to these persons; here is one of them, and there is the others. They were talking about guineas; my master was to give one pound seven shillings and four pence for each guinea; the person my master was talking to agreed for that. No other sum was mentioned. Fourteen old guineas and fifty old ones were produced. I am quite sure they were old ones; upon my oath. I just cast my head round; the fourteen were old and the fifty were old; I heard my master count them. I turned my head to look at the guineas. I was sorting of metal. I had not seen so many guineas for a long time together. My master examined them and put them in his pocket, and asked one of the men if they could give him the balance of a hundred pound note; they said, they had not change about them. My master went out to get change for them. He was gone about twenty minutes. He came back and did not get change. He sent me out with an hundred-pound note. I went to the Black Lion, Mr. Moses keeps it. I could not get change. I went to a butcher's shop; they could not give me change. I came back immediately. After I had shewed the note to these persons to whom I applied to get change I read the note; it was a good one. When I came back these persons were still with my master; then my master went with them, where I know not. I saw no more of the men till the next morning; it was then near eleven o'clock, when I saw them all three; they asked for my master; I said, he is just stepped out, he will be at home about three o'clock. I said that by my master's direction; when he went out he said he would be at home at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the men stay after they came to his house - A. One stopped about half an hour. All three of the men said, they would go and get something to drink, and stop with me half an hour after they had something to drink; they said they would call, at three o'clock. My master was at home at three o'clock; he dined at home at two o'clock. I informed him that these persons had been there. I told him that they were coming again; he stopped at home till about six o'clock in the evening. He was at home that night and the next morning. He gave no orders to be denied to any body. He was as public at home for time as for the fourteen months that I have lived with him. He was as easy to be found then as at any time in his life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What is your master - A. He deals in iron, marine stores, and rags.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not stop in the house above half an hour - A. Yes, they did; they stopped and had something to eat and drink. They stopped altogether about three quarters of an hour, not more; I am sure not an hour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Witness, recollect you were not here; three persons have been examined before you; all the three men were in the house; their evidence has been heard; therefore be cautious what evidence you give; do not give evidence without full consideration - A. No, not with a word of falsity.</p>
               <p>Q. Another thing, two persons have been examined on the part of your master - A. I will give nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020073"></xptr>Mr. Gurney. You all notice when the sabbath comes in, and leave off work - A. I left off at four. They came in just before four, and I left off work in a quarter of an hour. I am quite sure I did not work more than a quarter of an hour after they came in, and I am sure that is as true as all the rest I have sworn. They were shewn into the kitchen; the back room; the room behind the shop. The female servant was there; her name is Eldah Hart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you quite sure that no friend of your master's came in while you were there - A. Yes, no other person was there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if any person has said that another person came in with a note in his hand, and said that he he tried to get change, that is all false - A. Yes, it is; mine is the truth. Eldah was in the room, lighting the candles and cooking the victuals. No other person was there all the time in my presence. I only went out to get change. There was no other person there, that I can say, and Eldah was cleaning the place. She cooked fish and meat. The fish was cooked for my master's supper.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he and the men go out - A. I have told you before. About half after four, and he came in again about ten minutes before five. Then he got his supper.</p>
               <p>Q. Who subpoened you - A. My master. Mr. Harris came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his first name - A. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him by Harris the Lawyer - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He has examined you - A. No, he has never said a word to me nor I to him. He has never spoke to me about the business at all. I have not seen the gentleman until now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was not the men paid for the guineas - A. No. They stopped until master came back. They were not paid while my master was there; they were not paid in my sight. The men were strangers to me; I had never seen them before. My master treated them with civility. He gave them victuals, and drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they come about the next day - A They asked if master was at home. They did not complain at all. I told them he had left word he would be home at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. No friend whatever came in about the business - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard this bargain about one pound seven shillings and four-pence for the guinea - A. Yes. I am quite positive.</p>
               <p>JOHN SCRIVEN. I am a waiter out of employ.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a waiter on the 27th of last month - A. I was, at the Mitre, Mitre-court, Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming there last Friday week with any persons - 
               <persName id="t18121202-107-person1088">A. </persName>
            Yes; here are the three persons on my right. These three persons came in first, Mr. Davis came in afterwards. I did not see Mr. Davis until I saw these men. I was sitting in the tap-room when they came in. Peake and Rowe came in first, Dimmock next, Davis came in last; it may be ten minutes. I cannot say to two or three minutes. There was a pot of half and half called for; that was when Davis came in. That is the first order I know of. Davis had a glass of rum and water. Mr. Davis went out twice during the time they staid, and when he came back I was sitting in my seat where I was in the first instance. When he came back the second time he said you may have part to night, and the remainder to-morrow morning. What it was I know not. I did not hear any answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what time of day it was when they came - A. It was between four and five when they first came in, to the best of my recollection, and between seven and eight they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all go away together - A. That I cannot say; I might be called away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Davis stay out the first time he went out - A. About fifteen minutes; not so long.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that he did not stay to dine any where while these people were about. He could not have dined at five o'clock, in the time he was absent from the Mitre - A. He could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was there from between four and five until between seven and eight; he could not go and dine in the short time he was out It is a falsity if any body said he was staying at home at dinner this time - A. I do think it is. I have no doubt at all of it, because the men were there present.</p>

            . You have heard what this man has sworn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear now, your master came home at ten minutes before five, and staid to dinner, and never went out again - A. I did not say he never went out again; he came home ten minutes before five, took a something, and then went out again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Scriven. Did you hear Davis say when he when out and looked at the clock, he would be back presently - A. I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for the liquor, these men or Davis - A. Mr. Davis paid for one pot of half and half, and he paid for a glass of rum and water. They wanted more half and half; Dimmock said, Davis would pay for that. Mr. Shears said, I do not know Davis; you shall have what you like till to-morrow morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these men quite strangers to your master - A. I don't know. I had never seen them in the house before.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master said they might have what they liked on Dimmock's account - A. I beg your pardon, my lord. Dimmock said it was to be put down to Davis. Master said, he did not know Davis: Dimmock might have as much as he liked till the morning. I was there as a customer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Every body understood you called Shears your master - A. I beg your pardon.</p>
               <p>JURY. He did say so - A. I was taking a pint of porter there.</p>
               <p>COURT. If I had known you were not a waiter there I should have asked you where you lived - A. I lived there at the time. I was taking a pint of porter there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not give me that answer; we know where a man is drinking porter he must be alive. Where was your place of residence - A. No. 2, Ship-inn-yard, Borough. I went first to the Mitre on that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020074"></xptr>day, between ten and eleven in the morning. I was never waiter there. The last I had as waiter was the Star tavern, Nags-head-court. Gracechurch-street. That is more than six months ago. I never saw Mr. Davis before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to 
               <persName id="t18121202-107-person1090">
                  David

            . When your master went out with these people did you learn where he was going to - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he came home - A. He came home in about five or six minutes; he took a bit of fish, and went out again. He returned about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Dimmock. Please you, my lord, give me leave to speak a word. David Levy has given evidence concerning the money; he never came in the room. The gentleman was not in the room five minutes. He left us there three hours. Levy never came in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was never my intention to wrong these men. Dimmock in the case was the broker, and I hope, as a man, he will not fly in the face of God to swear as a falsity.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Dimmock Did you ever go to the prisoner as agent to these men to get the money for them - A. No. I never saw the gentleman before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there to get more than twenty-one shillings - A No, nothing else. I should not have gone there if he had not taken us in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not these people give the guineas into your hand, and you gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Dimmock. No, I did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I have one partner; we are goldsmiths, and live in Bartlett's buildings, Holborn. The prisoner was in our employ for more than three years as a journeyman—he had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week.—he was employed in working up gold.—a small portion of gold could be abstracted without our missing it—I had no suspicion of the prisoner till I received a communica<lb></lb>tion from Mr. Sirrel, I think, on the 15th or 16th of June.—the prisoner went to his dinner, at one o'clock that day, and was gone an hour or more.—he was not permitted to take out any gold, except for his wife to work up, which was then returned.—when Mr. Sirrel's young man came to me, I told the pris<lb></lb>oner he had been selling gold there, that we thought was ours, and I wished him to give an account of it.—he said he could to our satisfaction.—he said he got it from some person who worked at home, to tell for him, but he could not divulge his name or residence—after being pressed farther, he mentioned the name of Wood, and that was all We could get from him—he was then taken into custody.—this is the gold.—it is impossible to swear to such an article; but we had gold in all respects like this in the workshop—the prisoner had been employed on that gold on the Saturday previous—it is flatted wire principally—it had undergone part of the process—I have brought some to compare with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Thomas Ottrey Rayner, a surgeon in St. Matthew's-place, Hackney-road. On Thursday, the 19th of April, I went to bed at twelve o'clock—the house was then fastened up securely—I got up at four or half-past four o'clock next morning—I sleep in the kitchen—I went towards the surgery, and on passing through the hall to the parlour I missed a quantity of coats off the pegs—I had seen them hang<lb></lb>ing in the hall the night before when I went to bed—I saw some hats on the floor which had hung up the night before—I went into the surgery and called the boy who slept there—I observed the shutter of the back parlour window half way down, and the blind moved backwards and forwards with the wind—I got on a chair, and observed the top sash lowered completely to the bottom—I called my young master up, went to the kitchen, and found two cupboard doors open—I missed from the kitchen two silver table-spoons, marked "T. H. R." and four German silver tea-spoons—the back-door was unfastened, top and bottom, but shut to—it was fastened the night before—that must have been opened from the inside—the wash-house window had the bottom sash up at the top—I missed from the back parlour cupboard a pair of silver sugar-tongs, marked "T.H.R." and two German silver salt-spoons—a pair of steps which were kept in the yard were removed from their place, and put under the window to enable a person to get in at the window, and there was dirt under the win<lb></lb>dows and on the window ledge—I found things moved from one place to another, besides what was gone—I had awoke in the course of the night, and saw the reflection of a light shine on the dresser—I was frightened, and covered my head over—I afterwards saw the light through the key<lb></lb>hole—I listened, but heard no noise, and went to sleep again, thinking I might fancy something.</p>

When I went before the Magistrate I lived in Essex-street, Commercial-road—I am an unfortunate girl—I have known the prisoner two or three years—on Friday morning, the 19th of April, I lived at No. 3, Green-gate-gardens, Hackney-road—a young woman named Douglas, lodged with the prisoner—Terry was at home on the night of the 18th—he went out between eleven and twelve o'clock, and returned between three and four in the morning—he knocked at the door—I let him in—he had a gentleman's cloak on—I never saw any cloak like it before—it was a blue-black, or black—it had two tassels and a velvet collar—when he came into the room he pulled off the cloak and three coats—whether he had them on I do not know, but they were on his person—he pulled them off, and put them on the foot of the bed—they were a pilot-coat, a dress-coat, and a frock-coat—some had silk linings—there were four silver tea-spoons and two silver table-spoons—three of the tea-spoons were broken in halves; the table-spoons were not—there were two salt-spoons of a kind of gold</p>

               <p>colour, and a pair of silver sugar-tongs—the prisoner went out, leaving the articles on the table—he said he thought the spoons were German silver—there were two white silk handkerchiefs, one figured all over, and the other plain with a figured border, and scented with musk very strong—Mary Ann Douglas asked him, when he came in, where he had been—he said, "To the doctor's shop at Cambridge-heath"—she asked How he got in—he said he got in at the back window, and stepped over a man-servant in bed, and he was going back again for three coats he had left in the back garden—he went out about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after—he was gone about half or three-quarters of an hour; and when he came back, he said he could not go because there were brick-layers at work—he went out about six o'clock, and took the things with him in a box—he returned home between seven and eight o'clock—when he came in the morning he gave the girl Douglas 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in the afternoon he gave me a sovereign to fetch a pot of beer, and I brought him the change back—I saw a pair of pincers in the house—the prisoner put them in the fire, made them red-hot, put them on the hearth till they were cool, then with a rasp broke them—this is part of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know this iron chisel—I have seen it before in the prisoners's house—I was there from the 17th till the 20th, at my sister's house—I saw it there on the 17th and 18th, but not afterwards—I did not have any share in the property, or assist in disposing of it—I was taken into custody by the police, and told what I knew about it—I and Douglas had a quarrel six weeks ago last Sunday—I was taken into custody a week after that—the quarrel had nothing to do with my giving this statement.</p>

On the morning of the 19th of April, I went into Mr. Miller's, and received these three coats from Charlton—about half-past twelve o'clock on Sunday, the 12th of May, I was on duty in Kingsland-road, and met the prisoner in company with three other men—I followed him, and met another officer—I had received information relating to him—I took him into custody, and told him I wanted him to go to the station-house—he said, "For what?"—I told him, "For a robbery"—he said, "I'm b—if I shall go"—I had got hold of him—he got away from me—I made an attempt to retake him—he took up a stone about five or six pounds' weight, and said, "You b——b——, if I <hi rend="italic">pitch</hi> into you I will dash your b——brains out"—I remonstrated with him, and said, "You had better put the stone down; if you use any violence with me you will suffer for it"—I drew my truncheon, and said, "If you don't put down the stone I will knock you down"—he threw it down, and ran into a court, called the Land of Promise—I followed, and brought him out—it is a court where very low people live—I had my truncheon in my hand—he laid hold of it, and we had a scuffle for it for ten minutes—he said several times, "You b——, if you do not let it go I will kick you"—a mob of about a hundred and fifty collected—he let go of the truncheon, and ran away—I attempted to stop him, but was stopped by the people, and he got away—it was about half-past twelve o'clock.</p>

I was on duty in Kingsland-road, on Sunday, the 12th of May, at a quarter to one o'clock, and I saw the prisoner corning out of Black Horse-court, leading to the Land of Promise—I had information, and took him into custody—we had a severe struggle for a length of time—he scaled two gates, but I pursued him, and he did not succeed in getting away—he bit me severely, and kicked me several times, and threw my truncheon away—I at last took him in Maria-street, with the assistance of police-constable <hi rend="italic">N</hi> 203—I had some con<lb></lb>versation with the witness Wilkinson, on Monday, the 6th, about a quarter to nine o'clock—she gave me information about this.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 82.) I apprehended Ann Wilkin<lb></lb>son on Sunday, the 12th of May—the prisoner was brought to the station-house that day in custody—when Wilkinson came there she gave in<lb></lb>formation of the robbery, which was taken down in writing—she bad told me about it once before—I think it was two or three days before—she met me in Kingsland-road—I did not take her into custody till the day the prisoner was taken—I have not given her any information at all about the robbery.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you know of her being in custody before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she did not state any thing to me about it then, she did to somebody else—I have been a policeman nearly ten years—I was on duty when I saw her in Kingsland-road, it was in the evening—I have known her two or three years—I do not think I had seen her above twice for a month before—I might have seen her between the 19th of April and the 7th of May—I do not know that I did, for she had been in prison, I be<lb></lb>lieve—she came out a few days before the 19th of April, now I recollect—I had information of the robbery the morning after it was committed—I had no grounds of suspicion for taking Wilkinson on the 7th of May—she told me about the robbery, and who committed it—I took her on the 12th, on my own responsibility—I did not think proper to take her on the 7th—I reported her to the inspector—it was no use to take her till I had taken the prisoner—I apprehended her at night, and he was taken in the after<lb></lb>noon—I am not related to Wilkinson by marriage—I know somebody she may call a cousin—I do not know whether she is—my wife is not related to her, but I believe once, when I had her in charge, she said, "Give your own cousin a month!"—I was suprised at her saying so, and asked her what she meant, and I found that a cousin of hers, a very re<lb></lb>spectable man, had married a cousin of mine—I know her as an unfortu<lb></lb>nate girl, seeing her about the street, but not in any other way—I was on the look-out for the prisoner—I made every inquiry that laid in my power—the robbery might be well known in the neighbourhood, and was stated in the police reports.</p>

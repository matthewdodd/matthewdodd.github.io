On the 15th of September, about half past seven in the morning, I locked my door and went out; I live in the lower room, my landlady does not live in the same house; I am sure I locked my door, and I took the key in my pocket; I fastened my door with a padlock. I came home between eight and nine o'clock the door was wide open, and my chest wide open. I lost two gowns and a pair of breeches, and five shillings in copper. I was informed the prisoner was in a public-house; I went in there; she offered as soon as she saw me to go into a room to strip.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew her before, did not you - A. Yes, she lodged with me about two weeks. Instead of her going into a room, she went out at the back door; she had one of my gowns on. Between two and three o'clock the very day she robbed me I took hold of her, she knocked me down, beat me, and made her escape while I was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recover any of your property - A. No. She promised to return them; she said she had pawned them.</p>

She sat herself down on the stairs, and stopped for him. I went away and came back again in a few minutes, I found her in the room; I asked her what business she had to take Buckley's lock off the door in his absence; she told me to go along, she wanted to go to bed.

            . I am an officer of Union Hall. Me and Clark received information of the robbery. On the 25th of last month the prisoner was brought to us at Union Hall, I charged the prisoner, Catherine Burke, with the robbery; she told me that she knew nothing of the robbery, that her name was Conner. I told her I had seen her tried so often by that name I was sure of it. I kept her in custody.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARKE. I know what Goff has said to be true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lodged at this woman's house about five weeks; I follow the market, selling meat and butter. The prosecutor has got a key to the chest and this prosecutrix another; she took the things out to pawn, and I gave her a shilling a week to fetch them out of pawn. There were some words passed between us, she swore she would send me over the water. This woman that she has brought against me knows nothing about it; she is a common prostitute in the streets, and she would go twenty miles for a glass of gin; she knows it is false what she has sworn against me.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutor.

            . I was called out, and saw the prisoners just making a start to run: they ran through the gate, and I called to them to stop; Ottaway said, "I shan't stop," and ran on about ten yards farther - Collison jumped over a gate into a plantation; I pursued Ottaway - he said he would beat my brains out, and struck me over the head with a stick; he struck at me a second time; I caught it on my arm, seized him, and took the stick from him - I brought him back to the prosecutor's, and asked him if he was not ashamed to rob a poor man, who only had 12s. 6d. a week; I then went and took Collison in the plantation; he could not get out any other way - I am quite certain he is the man I saw get over; I was within two yards of him.</p>

               <p>Ottaway's Defence. I did not strike him. I had been to look for work, and met a friend, who took me into a public-house, and this young man came in - we were going along the road, and I never went out of the road.</p>
               <p>Collison's Defence I had been travelling all day for work, and went into the public-house, and saw this man - we had rather a drop too much, and stopped late; I went on, and kicked against this bit of chain on the side of the road - the geese were on the side of the road; we did not drive them.</p>

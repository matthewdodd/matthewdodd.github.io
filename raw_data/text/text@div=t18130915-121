            . On the 30th of August, about half past seven in the evening, I was called out of my parlour to assist in serving some customers that came in. I saw Price and Holland in a little room that I have backwards for the ladies. White was in the front shop, they did not appear to know each other. Price made an offer that could not to be taken. She went out; White followed her, and just at that moment Huggins, the officer, brought Price back with a pair of shoes in her hand, which he saw her take from a nail.</p>

            . I am an assistant officer of the court of Requests. On the 23d of August I was waiting at the corner of Denmark-street, about half after seven o'clock, close by the side of Mr. Bartlett's shop; these three women came by me in company together; they stood talking to each other; presently two of them went in; Price and Holland went into a little shop backwards; White went in with a little boy that she had with her; Holland was trying some shoes on. I saw Price take a pair of shoes and put them under her apron. As soon as

In about a quarter of an hour after I had taken charge of Holland and Price, a woman came to the watchhouse door; she said, Mary. I desired Mr. Bartlett to go round and see whether that was the woman that had made her escape: he went out, and brought her in. I searched her, and found some money about her. These are the shoes that I received of Mr. Bartlett.</p>

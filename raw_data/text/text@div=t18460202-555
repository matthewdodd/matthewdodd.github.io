                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Thomas Bayley's employ—on the 23rd of Dec. a person named Dennis received directions to fetch a hogshead of sugar from the docks to Mr. Bayley's—he went about twelve o'clock—the sugar ought to have come direct from the London Dock to Cannon-street—Old Montague-street is quite out of the way—the prisoner had been in our employ a short time before, and was dismissed—I understand that he is the brother of the man who drove the wagon, but the prisoner gave a different name to us—on the 23rd of Dec. the hogshead of sugar was brought to us, late in the day, by the policeman—it weighed 16cwt. lqr. 16lb., which was a deficiency of 3qrs. and 4lbs.—there was a bag of sugar brought to our ware-house afterwards, which weighed 3qrs. 4lbs.—that would exactly make up the deficiency—it was exactly the same sort of sugar as was in the hogshead.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you cause the wagon and hogshead to be taken to Travers's, in Swithin's-lane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not empty it—the hogshead was weighed with the sugar in it—we have nothing to do with the weight of the hogshead—I only speak of the gross weight.</p>

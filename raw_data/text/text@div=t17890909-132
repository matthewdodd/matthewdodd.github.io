               <p>I live at Wisbeck in Cambridgeshire; I went to see the soldiers exercise on the 10th of September, in the Court-yard, St. James's, to relieve guard; coming back in the narrow passage, coming into <placeName id="t17890909-132-crimeloc653">St. James's Park</placeName>

I put my hand to my pocket, and said, no, I have lost my money; my pocket was half out, and my money was gone, nine guineas in gold, and near twenty shillings in silver; and there were two small keys in the purse; and a gentleman hearing it, said, that villain in the green coat has got it; that was the prisoner; he had a green coat on; my son and me ran after the prisoner; my son caught hold of him by the collar; there was another man with the prisoner, they both put themselves in a position to fight us; I cannot say whether the other man was in the passage; I called out stop thief! there came plenty of assistance; the other man ran away; and we took the prisoner, and held him; we had him to one of Mr. Bond's men; and he searched him; nothing was found on him belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time you was jostled in this place, how far was the prisoner from you? - Just by.</p>
               <p>Court. None of the men said any thing to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see his hand in your pocket? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you feel any body's hand in your pocket? - No, I did not; it is impossible in that croud, so as I was jostled.</p>
               <p>Who was that gentleman that said, that villain has done it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Counsel. Then there was a great croud? - Yes; they made a great croud.</p>
               <p>It was just after the guard had relieved? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Many people going away, and many coming in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were a great many people in the whole? - Yes; there were many people going through, to be sure.</p>
               <p>You did not observe that man touch you? - I was as near to him, as I am to my hat.</p>

               <p>I am a son of the last witness; on this day my father and I was in the Court-yard, St. James's, looking at the soldiers relieving guard; and I saw the prisoner, and two more, looking very earnest at my father; when we came out, they followed us into the passage; they were behind us; and then the prisoner stepped betwixt me and my father, and shoved him up against the wall; parted us; he stood right between us with his hands.</p>
               <p>Did he do it with violence? - With a shove; I turned round, and said, father, come along; he made answer that these fellows had stopped him, and would not let him go on; my father was shoved close to the wall; I said, have you lost your watch, father? he said, no; he felt to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090180"></xptr>pocket, and said he had lost his money; I followed the prisoner immediately; and my father caught him; he made a posture of defence; I had not seen the prisoner do any thing.</p>
               <p>Was any body else with the prisoner? - There were two more, but they ran away; one before we caught him by the collar, and the other after.</p>
               <p>Did that one that stood behind, put himself in a posture of defence? - I saw two put themselves in a posture of defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Did you take such notice of the prisoner, that you should have followed him, if he had not been pointed out? - Yes; I was not directed to pursue him; I did it, because I saw him look at my father.</p>
               <p>Was there a very great croud of people in that passage? - Yes; but not before that shove was.</p>
               <p>Have you been told there is forty pound for the taking of this man? - No; I hope not; I hope for nothing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Yesterday week, I went to see the soldiers relieve guard; and a woman passed me, and said, what a shame it is to take the old gentleman's watch from him; after I came into the Park, I saw the prisoner and two more young men walking on the paved stones, towards the Park; I saw the prisoner put something into another young man's hand; but what it was, I cannot say; I saw the prisoners in the Court-yard; I did not observe him near Mr. Ward; I never saw the prisoner in the passage at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. And when you saw him in the Park, he was walking quietly along? - Yes; very soberly.</p>

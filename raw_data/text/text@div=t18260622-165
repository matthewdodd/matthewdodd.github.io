            . I am master of St. Luke's workhouse. The prisoner was a pauper in that house for about five weeks. On Sunday, the 14th of May, I went with Worrell, another pauper, to the stable, where we found the prisoner, and, about one or two yards from his feet.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220060"></xptr>this piece of lead - it weighs about 50lbs. I compared it with that on the roof, and it appeared to have been cut from there - it matched exactly.</p>

            . I am a pauper in the house. The prisoner was there - the sick ward overlooks a shed belonging to the workhouse; I saw the prisoner on the roof of that shed - he took off some tiles, and put them into the gutter - he then stooped down and took up something, but I cannot tell what; he had been walking backwards and forwards on that gutter - the building joins to the poor-house.</p>

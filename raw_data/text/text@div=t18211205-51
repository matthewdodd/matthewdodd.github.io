On opening it I missed a coat and waistcoat and some money, I saw them safe the night before. I expected him to sleep there the next night, but he never returned to the lodging. He had a small box in the room, which he kept locked. I saw Mrs. Whiting break it open about six weeks after, and found a duplicate of my property. The coat cost me 4 l. 5 s., and was nearly new, I had only worn it about three weeks. There was only an old shirt and some stockings in his box.</p>

I did not know he was going to leave, he paid me for his lodging, and gave me to understand he was going to stop. I did not see him again till he was in custody, which was about the 17th of November. He had left his box in the room, locked. About five or six weeks after I took it to the ironmongers, they had no instrument that would open it - it was in the same state as when he left it. I at last broke it open in the prosecutor's presence, and found two old shirts, a pair of stockings, and a duplicate of a coat and waistcoat. It was his Sunday great coat and nearly new.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles's. I apprehended the prisoner in Crown-street, Soho, on the 12th of November, and found several duplicates on him. I told him I took him for robbing a young man whom he lodged with. He said he had committed the robbery - was sorry for it, and did it through distress.</p>

I wrote a note by the Barnet coach to say it was uncertain when I should return; and just as I came to town I was apprehended. I lived with Mrs. Keath, the widow of the late rector of Barnes. Three other men lodged in the same room.</p>

I am in partnership with my father Thomas Botterill, and brother, in Northumberland-place, Commercial-road which is about a quarter of a mile from Castle-street; we are upholsterers, In June last I had a large green truck—on the night of the 25th our side pre<lb></lb>mises were broken open, the lock taken away, and the truck also—I head of Mr. Jutsum's property being found, and went to the shed, where I found the whole of the body of my truck broken up—the springs, wheels, axles and all the bolts and nails were gone out of it—the body is here-(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I am positive this is ours—I saw it at the station-house—I have lost all the valuable part of it.</p>

I live at 37, Castle-street—I have a shed at the back of my house—I let it to the prisoner—I cannot say the month, but it was about a month before Fairlop fair—I have been in the habit of seeing pieces of trucks in the shed since I let it to him, and now and then a bit of a cart—he said he mended trucks, and they were for the purposed of mending—about the Coronation-day I saw a large green-bodied truck them—it was a whole truck at that time—I did not see it brought in—the pri<lb></lb>soner told me he was taking the wheels off to get it painted, to get it ready for Fairlop.</p>

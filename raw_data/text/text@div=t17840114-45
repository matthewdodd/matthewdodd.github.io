               <p>I am servant to Mr. Steele; when the prisoner returned I was present, and before they returned, I went into the back shop, and looked if any thing was laying about, I looked particularly on the ground and there was nothing.</p>
               <p>Could not it lay on the ground and you miss it? - No, it could not, the book shop is very small, where we took them into: after they came back Mr. Roger changed Mercer, she denied it; we sent for constable to search them, they had closed once or twice before, and we parted them, there was nothing lay between them, I looked particularly, I stood before them all the time and watched; I suspected they would drop it; just as the constable came in Smith went up to Mercer, and we parted them almost most immediately, and there the card of lace lay just by under Mercer, just between them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. Might not Smith have gone away if she chose it? - No.</p>

            . I am chambermaid at the Bull Inn. I attended the prisoner to his bed-room, and turned down the sheets for him. I asked him for the money for the bed - he said he should not go to bed, he should sit down and write. I went to the room about ten o'clock next morning, the sheets were then gone, and the key of the bed-room door; he had locked it, and taken the key with him - we opened it with another key. He slept in the room No. 24.</p>

About two o'clock on Friday, the 15th of April, I left a bundle in the shed, which was locked; there were two pairs of sheets tied in a blue silk handkerchief, which were going to be washed. I received information from two boys about five o'clock; I then went to the shed, and missed the bundle; I have never seen it since. The prisoner used to bring me grains for the cows; I had employed him about a week: I took him into custody at a public-house in Thornaugh-street, and charged him with it - he said he had not been there at all. I have a great deal of property in my shed.</p>

I was in the fields between three and four o'clock on the 15th of April, playing with about fifty other boys; I saw the prisoner get on the top of the cow-house - he pulled off a board and got in, and came out in a quarter or half an hour, and threw down a bundle in a blue silk handkerchief; he then got down himself, took it up, and went off with two other young men; one of our boys said, "There go the thieves," and one of the prisoner's companions took up a stone and threw it at him. I am quite certain of his person; he had the same dress on then as he has now.</p>

            . I belong to the Irish charity school. I was at play with Kennifie, and about fifty other boys. I saw the three young men come across the field; the prisoner got upon the cow-house, and pulled off a board - he then got in; I saw him come out with a bundle, tied in a blue silk handkerchief; he threw it down, and fell on it - then took it up, and walked away - one of the boys cried Stop thief! and one of his companions threw a stone at him.</p>

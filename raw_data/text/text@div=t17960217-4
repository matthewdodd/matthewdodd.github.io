A young man, of the name of Lumley, pursued him, and took him, he was brought back directly; he was the least among them. I did not see his face till he was brought back; I watched him more particular than the rest, because he had a black coat on; I saw him before I went into the house for a stick; he stood right facing a doctor's shop, that I could very well perceive him, where there were three lights in the shop-window.</p>

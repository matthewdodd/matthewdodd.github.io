                  </hi>. I am a draper, in partnership with John Parker, and live at No. 29, Ludgate-hili, in the parish of St. Martin, Ludgate. The prisoners came to our shop on Friday evening, the 16th of March, between seven and eight o'clock—I saw them in the shop, and in a short time my young man, Clemow, informed me he suspected the younger prisoner had purloined some article, she having gone out of the shop at that time—we immediately went after her and brought her back—she was waiting just below the house—we charged her with taking away something, which she positively denied—on lifting her cloak on one side, we discovered this piece of silk under it—seeing that she had several bundles at the time in her hand, I sent for a police-officer to examine them, and he discovered two shawls and various other articles in them—I found the private mark of some shop on the shawls, but not of our shop—the silk is ours, and men<lb></lb>sures eighty-four yards and a half—it is worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can swear to it—I believe some has been cut from it, but it is now eighty-four yards and a half.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shopman to the prosecutor. On the Friday evening, the prisoners came into the shop together, between seven and eight o'clock—the elder prisoner asked for flannel—I sold them one yard of flannel—she then inquired for muslin—I had to fetch the muslin from up-stairs—(in consequence of alterations in the shop, the muslins were taken up-stairs)—I sold them a short length of muslin and some calico—the younger prisoner asked her mother for a length of silk—on the counter, by the side of the prisoners, was a pile of silk, three or four feet high—the girl wished to have a piece of black figured silk taken out of that pile—the mother preferred a plain silk instead of figured—while I was fetching a piece of plain black, for which I went seven or eight feet away from them, the younger prisoner upset some shawl handkerchiefs off the counter, a the floor—I told her to be more careful, and not throw the goods about a that way—I sold her half a yard of the silk which I fetched: and while I was getting some other things, this piece of silk was pulled out of the pile over where I took the black silk from—the girl pulled it out herself, out of the four-feet pile—I was convinced there was something not right, seeing her hand constantly under her cloak, and she had a bundle before her on the counter—while I was doing up their parcel, I went round to inform my master—the girl said to her mother, "I may go now?"—the mother said, "Yes," and she went—I immediately acquainted my employer, and we both ran out and brought her back—she was next door, just below our pre<lb></lb>mises—she had turned round to look, and was stopping when I first saw her—we found this silk under her cloak—the mother was still in the shop, and when the girl was brought back she made some exclamation—I can<lb></lb>not positively swear I had seen this piece of silk in the pile, but I saw the girl take it out of the pile—our mark is on it—it is my master's—I had seen it before—I cannot exactly say when—I know it is the piece she took, because it was taken out next to the one I had taken out just before—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the elder prisoner could not leave the shop, after I told my master, as there were several young men there.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Shorediteh. On the 20th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was going up the City-road; I met the two prisoners, each of them had a bundle under his arm, they saw me, and threw the bundle down and run away; I called for assistance, and pursued them until they were taken; one of them threw a dark lanthorn out of his pocket, and there was a bundle of matches picked up; I took Mayo to the watch-house, and took a turn-screw from his pocket, his other pocket was turned inside out, as if he had shook the lanthorn out of it; I found the bundles to be two blankets and a looking-glass. Abery broke out of the watch-house the same day; I took him again on the 24th. I am sure they are the men that I saw with the bundles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Mayo was let at large becaute the other could not be found.</p>
               <p>JAMES CORCORAN. I am a headborough. On the 20th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, my brother officer gave me the signal, I saw the prisoner running; I picked up the property, and found an iron crowbar near to where the property laid, I am sure they are the men.</p>

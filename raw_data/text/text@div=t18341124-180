                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Francis Bessey, and live in the Wands worth-road. The prisoner came into my service on the 10th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, and had only been five days with us—she was our only servant—on the 15th, about one o'clock, I went to the wine cellar—we are not in business—the wine cellar is an inner cellar—the outer cellar is the beer cellar—she was in the kitchen—I took out a bottle of port wine, and locked the inner cellar door—I went up stairs, and put the key in its place—she was then in the kitchen—about half-past two o'clock I walked up the garden, and saw the key of the outer cellar taken from outside the lock, where it always was, and found she had locked herself in the outer cellar—she had no business there at all—I knocked at the door—she made no answer—I went round the garden, and returned—I saw the outer door open, but the key was not in the lock—I asked her for the key—she hesitated to give it to me—I pushed the door open, and saw the wine cellar door ajar—it had been forced—I saw a chisel which had been taken out of the tool box, and laid on a box—I came out and told her that was the tool, I supposed, she had done it with—the door had the appearance of a chisel having been used—I told her she should not remain another night in my house—she made no reply—I sent for an officer, and went with him into her own bed-room—I called her up stairs, and examined her boxes—I found nothing there—at last I found two bottles of rum between her</p>

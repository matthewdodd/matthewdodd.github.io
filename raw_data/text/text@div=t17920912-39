I asked her if she remembered a bustle coming out of the church, and taking hold of a lady's arm: she said yes. I said the lady had lost her purse, and I suspected she had it, and should detain her. Backrack was standing by Jones; she was there the whole time; afterwards there was a search made of both of them in our presence: eight guineas was found on Backrack, and a dollar; the dollar was found under Backrack's foot; Jones was searched; nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There was a considerable crowd? - Rather a crowd.</p>
               <p>Before these persons were searched, they were asked what money they had, and they each of them told you as the fact turned out, Jones that she had none, and Backrack told you what money she had? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not find on that day, I believe, Mrs. Dean's purse? - No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones readily acknowledged that she had been at church, that she had been a party in the bustle, and that she had laid her hand on the lady; and every thing else to which you interrogated her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did Backrack go away from the bar for any purpose? - She went out; I went with her.</p>
               <p>How far did you go out of this room? - A very little way.</p>
               <p>Was that before she was searched? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who else went with her? - Miss Clarke.</p>
               <p>You went with her for the express purpose that she should make no ill use of that opportunity? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you see either of the prisoners at the bar there? - Not till I went after Miss Richardson, and the other young lady; I did not see the prisoner till I came to James-street; in the middle of James-street they were both together.</p>

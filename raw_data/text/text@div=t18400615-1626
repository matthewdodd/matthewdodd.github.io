                  </hi>I have one partner—we are furnishing ironmongers, and live in Wells-street, Oxford-street. The prisoner came as a char-woman every Monday morning for several years—we have lost a great number of articles, and suspected a servant—we at last desired Smart to conceal himself, which he did early in the morning of the 1st of June—he afterwards made a communication—I desired him to fetch a policeman, and to follow the prisoner—in about half an hour I saw her in custody in our kitchen—the officer produced to me two pairs of candle<lb></lb>sticks, a tin teapot, and a glass vinegar-cruet—she said, "Oh, for God's sake, forgive me; " and said it was the first time—these are the articles produced—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they are worth 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>I am shopman to the prosecutor. I was desired to conceal myself in the warehouse on the 1st of June, and saw the prisoner come into that warehouse where she had no business whatever—I watched her, and saw her take these two pairs of candlesticks off a shelf—she then went out of the warehouse, and was for about a quarter of an hour cleaning the stairs which lead down to the warehouse—I informed Mr. Burton—he directed me, and I got a policeman—I saw the prisoner coming out of the house with two bundles—I pointed her out to the officer—he brought her back to the house—I was in the kitchen when she was brought down—she said, "Oh, for God's sake, don't let these things be found on me"—I said, "I have nothing to do with it"—these are the candlesticks that she took from the shelf.</p>

On a small bench under the window—it was impossible for her to see me—I know these candle<lb></lb>sticks by the numbers—she took one pair at a time, and as she took the first pair one knocked against the other—I know them by the piles.</p>

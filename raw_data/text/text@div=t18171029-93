On the 22d of October, about ten minutes after ten o'clock at night, I was in the <placeName id="t18171029-93-crimeloc500">New-road</placeName>

I called to the watchman, he came up immediately, pursued and took one of them-it was Levy. I am positive he is one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I was sober. Norris snatched the watch-chain, Levy saw him do it. I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I am an officer of Shadwell. I took Norris into custody from information which I received, on the 23d, which was the next day.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL GIDEON. I am a fruit-dealer. On Wednesday week, at night, the prisoner, Norris, came to me and asked if I knew a lame gentleman, who lived in Back-lane? I told him I had seen him about. He said he had made a snatch at the gentleman's watch, and the chain broke; Stop thief was called, he ran away, and threw the seals in the mud. I told him it was nothing to me - He went away. I only know him by his buying fruit of me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came he to tell you about it - A. I do not know. He stopped me in Wells-street, and told me, about half-past ten o'clock at night. He came to me again at eight o'clock next night, and said, "You know the concern I shewed you the over-night." He said he sold the chain and seals for 12s. - this was on Thursday night - He then said he only sold it for 8s. He afterwards said to Lewis Cohen," You know the concern I shewed you last night?" Cohen said he should know it again. He said,"Here is a piece of the chain, and here goes." He threw it away. He said, he threw it away because the property should not be found upon him if he was taken.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How long have you known him - A. He used to buy fruit of me.</p>
               <p>LEWIS COHEN. I am a tailor. Last Wednesday week, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was standing at the posts, at the corner of Wellclose-square, the prisoner, Norris, came up to me, and shewed me two seals and three keys, hanging to a piece of chain. He asked me to buy them. He said I might have them for 15s. - I refused; he went away. Next night, I was talking to Gideon, he came up, and asked me if I should know the things which he shewed me the evening before? I said I should - He said he had sold them. He took half the chain out of his pocket, and threw it away. I then searched about Wells-street for it a long while.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS GULLEY. I am a watchman of St. George's in the East. On the 22d of October, about ten minutes after ten at night, I heard the rattle sprung. I ran towards Betsey-street, and saw a party running across Ratcliff-highway, down John's-lane, calling out, Stop thief! I turned round, and ran down Artichoke-hill, and met the prisoner, Levy at the bottom - He ran into my arms. He asked me what I took him for? The people came up, and said he was the man. I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said he had done nothing.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH SAVAGE. I am a watchman. On the 22d of October, about a quarter after ten o'clock, I heard the alarm, and saw two persons running, I sprang my rattle; I lost sight of them and turned back, thinking they would come round another away. I met Levy in the custody of Gulley.</p>
               <p>NORRIS'S Defence. I was at home at the time.</p>
               <p>MANASSEH GULSTON. I am a slop-seller, and live at Shadwell. On the 22d of October, the prisoner, Levy, was at my house between nine and ten o'clock - He left my house about twenty minutes before ten-Ratcliff-high way would be in his way home.</p>

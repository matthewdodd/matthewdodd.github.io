               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where was the closet? A.Inside the bar; customers do not go there - the tap-room is between the bar and front door; there were three men in the tap-room - I locked the bar door and left the key in it; I persuaded the prisoner all I could to tell me where it was.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody; the witness Fleet handed the box to me.</p>
               <p>EDWARD FLEET. I searched by the direction of Lloyd; I went into the yard and saw two or three persons looking for the box - the prisoner was in the yard, doing his work - I asked him if he knew any thing about the box of money which was lost; he said he did not - he did not point out where it was; I found the tin box up in a loft where lumber was kept - I had been up there once or twice before for a former landlady who lived there, and I thought it might be thrown there, and there I found it; I called to Mr. Brown to come and receive the box from me, but he did not, and I handed it down to Wheeler, who gave it Lloyd.</p>
               <p>ANDREW LLOYD re-examined. Whether Wheeler or Fleet gave it to me I do not know, but the prisoner kept his eye on the loft, which made me suspect it was there, or in the cess-pool.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He kept his eye on the loft, and yet you thought it was in the cess-pool? A. Yes; the loft and cess-pool are both together; I meant the place where the water comes in; Fleet was reaching up there when the prisoner was looking up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner did not tell you where it was to be found? A. Just at the moment it was found, he told me where it was, and when it was found he told me he had stolen it to buy him clothes; he said, "You will find the box under the rafter on the left-hand side," and at that instant Fleet called out,"I have got it."</p>
               <p>MRS. BROWN. This is our box - it contained twenty-six sovereigns and 7l. 11s. 6d. and this purse; I left no servant in the room with him - the maid servant was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before you lost it had you seen it? A. Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and it was found in about half an hour; I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110035"></xptr>not exactly say how much was in it, but I know there was as much as this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You left him in charge of the bar, and found him still there? A. Yes; he said he had never lost sight of the bar; he was only four weeks in my employ, and slept in the house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

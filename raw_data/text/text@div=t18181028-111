I had hired him on the road, to assist me to drive my cattle, which were in the field. I had 65l. in my pocket. About one o'clock I awoke, started up, and saw him get up from my side. He was picking up some notes. I found my pocket-book was safe, and thought he had not robbed me. I asked a man who laid on the other side of me, if he had lost anything? He said No. Next morning I found some of my money gone. I gave information to the Police; and, some time after, when I was in Ireland, I heard that he was taken. I came to England and saw him, and am sure he is the man.</p>

            . On the 16th of August I was informed the prisoner had been laying out a great deal of money, and showing it in his hands. Next day I saw him at a play at Hampstead. About eleven o'clock that night I found him in a shed on Hampstead Heath, and told him I understood he had a great deal of money about him. He said he had not got a farthing about him. I found a watch on him. I found a pocket-book in his breeches, between his thighs, with three 5l. notes in it. I asked him how he got them? He said he found them near Battle-bridge. I took him to Bow-street. He then said he found them within three miles of Rumford.</p>

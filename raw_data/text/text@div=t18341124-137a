                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Ayres, and live and sleep at his shop in the Commercial-road. Last Saturday the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at a watch, marked 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about nine o'clock in the evening—there was another marked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which hung in the window—I showed him them both—he said he would consult he friend whether he would give so much, and return again in half an hour—he came back about ten o'clock—he said he had been gone longer than the time he mentioned—he asked for the watch—I showed him one of them again—he then asked for the other, to look at them both again—he then asked what was the least I would take for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one—I told him five guineas—he then asked if I had keys to fit them—I went to the glass-case, on the counter, to get the keys, and while I was getting them he ran off with the watches—the lad in the shop pursued him—he was taken up immediately, taken to the station-house, and searched there—he took both the watches—I saw them that evening at the station-house—I saw him searched—the watches were not found on him—the policeman produced them—I knew them again immediately—these are the watches—I am certain he is the man—Mr. Ayres pays die vent and rates of the house.</p>

On the 1st of December, between three and four in the afternoon I saw the prisoner put his head out of a lower window of a warehouse on the wharf; there were several people working over his head: I went in and asked him, what he was doing there? he said he was doing nothing. Observing something bundled up in his frock, I asked what he had there; he said, it was sugar and he would put it in the hogshead again. There was some sugar in the two pair of stairs warehouse, but none in this place: out of one of these hogsheads a great quantity of sugar was taken.</p>

               <p>I found the sugar on the stairs; I happened in the dark to run against Mr. Jones, and he took me up, and said I had stole this sugar; the sugar was lying scattered on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Jones. It was wrapped up in his frock before him.</p>

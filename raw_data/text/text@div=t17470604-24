               <p>Clee. I am Constable in St John's Street, and I was sent for in order to take this Person up for stealing of this Coat; I went before Justice Poulson, and he ordered that I should have this Coat in my Custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there?</p>
               <p>Clee, I saw Harding and the Prosecutor there.</p>

            . Give an Account of that Coat you deliver'd before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Harding. The Day that my Wife bought this Coat I was out. I read the Advertisement, and carried the Coat upon my Back, and went and demanded the Money that my Wife paid for it.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Harding. The Prisoner came to my House, (I keep a publick House) it was the 3d of May, as near as I can guess, the Prisoner came in and call'd for a Pint of Beer and smoak'd a Pipe; so he ask'd me, if I would buy a Coat for my Husband, for he had an extraordinary Bargain . I said his Coat would not come upon one of my Husband's Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for it?</p>
               <p>Harding. Sixteen Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by it?</p>
               <p>Harding. He said he traffick'd in Brandy, and the Coat was pawn'd for 7 s. that he had bought it of a Gentleman in the Fleet, a Portuguese Gentleman . I gave him 16 s. all but 4 d. for it.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Have you any Witnesses that saw you buy the Coat .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not know my Trial would come on. I have dealt with this Mr Harding, have sold him Liquors, and gave him Permits with them. I had the Coat in lieu of some Brandy at the Fleet.</p>

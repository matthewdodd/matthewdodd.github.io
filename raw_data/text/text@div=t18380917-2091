                  </hi>. I am a wholesale butcher, carrying on business in Whitechapel. I have a shed in Harrow-alley, where I keep my carts. On Saturday night, the 21st of July, I had a green painted cart there, and a leaden cistern—the cart cost about 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was new within eight months—the cistern was old, but perfect, and weighed be<lb></lb>tween 4 and 5 cwt.—I had also a large truck there, which was turned on the tail-board, the springs, and axletree, and scroll-irons, were torn off from that, which I should think would take two hours to do, and taken away they were missed next morning—two or three days afterwards, Dudman came, and gave me information, in consequence of which, I found a por<lb></lb>tion of my cart—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the tail-board</hi>)—I know this to be mine, by</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. On the 25th of July I received information that Mr. Jutsum had lost his cart—I know a shed in Castle-street Whitechapel—Warwick, (who was convicted last Sessions,) and the prisoner, kept trucks in that shed—I searched it, and found there a por<lb></lb>tion of Mr. Jutsum's cart—a portion of a truck belonging to Mr. Botterill, and parts of several others—the portion of the green cart I have produced was found there.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in Mr. Jutsum's service. On Sunday morning, the 22nd of July last, about half-past four o'clock, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in High-street, Whitechapel, drawing a green cart—it was the way a person would be going from Mr. Jutsum's cart-shed to Castle-street—I knew it to be Mr. Jutsum's cart—I saw his name on it—I had driven it for three months myself, and knew it—I did not know whether the prisoner might not be in the prosecutor's service—there was another person with him—I watched the prisoner, and waited till he returned, which was not five minutes—I spoke to him—he gave me no answer, but walked away up Gulston-street—a day or two afterwards, hearing Mr. Jutsum's cart was stolen, I called, and informed him of what I had seen.</p>

On the 22nd of July I lodged in Castle-street, Whitechapel—about half-past six o'clock that morning I had oc<lb></lb>casion to go into the back-yard, which encloses a shed occupied by the prisoner—I saw the prisoner there, with a hammer and chisel, breaking up the body of a green cart which was on the ground—I saw the axletree and wheels standing against the wall—on the following day, Monday, at a quarter before eleven o'clock, I observed the prisoner take the axletree and wheels away—they were the same as I had seen in the yard on Sunday.</p>

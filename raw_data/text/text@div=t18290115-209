             pointed out the prisoners to me - Butlers had this property; I went and asked how he came by it - he threw it down, and ran away; I caught the white cotton and the yellow handkerchief as he dropped them -I then pursued, and took him; I had never lost sight of him - he only said the other man gave it to him, as they had been in conversation in coming up Alpha-road; I am quite sure Ray is the person who was in conversation with him - I had never seen them before; they were nearly half a mile from Mr. Belcher's.</p>
               <p>ISAAC PARKER. At half-past six o'clock that evening I was going from my own house in Wellington-road, and saw the two prisoners: Butlers had something in his apron, and Ray had this piece of blue cotton under his arm - I suspected something, and followed them some distance; when I got to the end of Alpha-road I saw the watchman, and told him - they then came up: Butlers then had a bundle in his hand, tied up in a yellow silk handkerchief - I told the watchman to go to him, and he threw it down; the watchman caught the calico and handkerchief. and pursued him: I went and took Ray - he said, "What have I done? I have done nothing;" I said, "You are one of them" - he said, "I have done nothing;" when I first saw them they were about three times the length of this Court from the prosecutor's: they went up Caroline-place, and to the top of the Alpha-road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RAY. I was only just speaking to this prisoner; I left him, and walked on - the watchman came and pursued Butlers. Witness. Ray had the piece of blue cotton till they came on to Caroline-place; I then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150094"></xptr>turned another way, and when they came up the road Butlers had it in a bundle, with the other.</p>
               <p>RAY's Defence. I met Butlers with this bundle - he said he had been on an errand; I said, "I must make haste home;" he said, "Good night:" the gentleman then came up, and said, "I want you."</p>
               <p>BUTLERS' Defence. I left work at half-past six o'clock, and went on an errand - I came back, and kicked something before me; I took it up, and put it into this handkerchief: Parker acknowledged himself that he had been a thief, and said he knew where the fence was.</p>

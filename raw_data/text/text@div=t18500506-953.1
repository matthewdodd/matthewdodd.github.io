                  </hi>. I am one of the turnkeys at Giltspur-street. On the 16th April I found this watch in the prisoner's boot—I asked if this was the watch referred to in the warrant of commitment, he said, "No; they have got that; this is my own property."</p>

                  </hi>. This watch is mine—It was safe about three o'clock the same day that I lost the other—I missed it about half-past three, and gave notice at the station—I know the number of it—it is 1570—I have the book where it is entered—this is not my book—it is the person's book where I bought it—I know the watch itself—I do not put a mark on everything I buy—it is a mock jewel one.</p>

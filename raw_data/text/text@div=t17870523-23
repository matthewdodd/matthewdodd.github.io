               <p>Had either of the half-pence or the farthings any thing singular about them? - There is one half-penny that is crooked and scratched; I only point it out; I had it some time in my pocket; I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watson. Mrs. Reynolds, do you remember any thing of a disturbance in the house about some man not paying for six penny-worth of something he drank at the time? - I recollect that while I was speaking to that man, these men rushed out of the door.</p>

               <p>Did the person with whom you disputed about the payment of the liquor come in with these men? - No Sir, not that I know of, he came in just after; they drank one bowl together; there were two more in company; the other two went away first; these staid behind; when I found they were gone, I could not get the reckoning, and while I was discoursing with this man, the prisoners went away; there were five of them; two went off without paying, when I was applying to the third for payment, these two rushed out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watson. Do you remember some strange man coming into our company and drinking a share of six penny-worth, and paying three pennyworth of halfpence and no man else drank in our company? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon the oath you have taken, you do not come here upon any resentment about the reckoning? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>I had been spending the evening, and in coming home I met this young fellow; I went into this house; I had been drinking before; we had two or three six-pennyworths; I was rather in liquor; I asked Mrs. Reynolds what time her house shut; she said, two o'clock; I came away, and every thing was paid for as it came in; if the last was not paid for, it was by no wilful intent; we went to the Pilgrim; in came a friend; says he, the last six-pennyworth was not paid for; very well, says I, we will go back; we were going back to pay for it, and they took us; it has been attended with the loss of my charactr, and I have been in gaol a great while.</p>

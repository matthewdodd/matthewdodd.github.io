             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: On the 19th of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, as near as I can recollect, the prisoner at the bar came to our shop, and brought a three barrelled brass pistol to pledge, upon which he wanted a guinea and a half; he had but one pistol; I told him I had had information of a pair of pistols, of that description, being lost by Mr. Essex, in the Strand; I enquired of him how he came by them; he told me they were given to him by a friend of his then at sea, it was about a year and a half since he gave them to him; I told him I must detain him while I sent for Mr. Essex, who had lost the pistols; when Mr. Essex came, he claimed the pistol; he stopped voluntarily with me till Mr. Essex came; this is the same pistol.</p>
               <p>Essex. I have not the least doubt that those are my pistols; the prisoner's person I am very positive of, but as to the pistols, there are so many made like one another, that I cannot positively swear to this; when I went with him to the watch-house, he complained of cold for want of his great coat and boots; I said, if he would let me know where his lodgings were, I would go with the constable for his great coat and boots, and perhaps I might see my other pistol; I went to the lodgings of a Mr. Cardon, No. 15, Fenchurch-buildings, and sent the coat and boots; I got some information about the other pistol; I got a search-warrant, and found the pistol in Mr. Cardon's room, with whom the prisoner lodged.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Michael Levy Green—we are wholesale clothiers, at No. 10, Houndsditch.

Trueman, Acton, Middlesex, called on me, and wanted clothing—they referred me to a Mr. Golding, in Cullum-street—I was not satisfied with the reference—I communicated with them, and said the reference did not suit, and it being the first transaction, I should like it to be a cash trans<lb></lb>action—the second time they called they said they would give me a better reference, which was Henry Dawer, No. 22, Ashford-street—I called on Dewer, who was the prisoner at the bar—I asked a person there for Henry Dewer, and was told he was not in—a female said he was only in the neighbourhood, and she fetched the prisoner—I asked him if I had the pleasure of addressing Mr. Dewer—he said, "Yes"—I asked what he knew of the Truemans—he said he had known them for twenty-five years, and would have no objection to become security for them in any way I pleased—I asked if he had any objection to sign an acceptance to a bill—he said, "Not in the least"—on the 9th of Sept., in consequence of this, I</p>

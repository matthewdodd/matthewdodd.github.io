The neighbours run and took him; I took him before an alderman; there he said he was fuddled, which made him do it.</p>

               <p>I had been to measure a gentleman for a pair of breeches, and I went in there to buy 2 skins to make the linings; I design'd to pay for them, but being a little in liquor, and the man came and call'd stop thief, it frighted me, or I would have paid for them.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>A Serjeant. The prisoner is a soldier in the first regiment of guards, and has been a soldier ever since the 10th of last August; he behav'd well as a soldier, as to his private affairs I know nothing of.</p>

               <p>Q. Could a man carry that out of your shop without your perceiving it. - A. He might, I had not the least idea of any person taking the clock away, it was standing about six inches to the left where I was sitting, I was very busy at the time.</p>
               <p>- TURNER sworn. I am a pawnbroker at No. 1, Lower John-street Golden-square; on the 21st or 22d of February, I believe I received that clock from the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man. - A. I am, I bought the clock of him, I gave him five pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. I never saw him before; in about a fortnight after the prisoner came again, to know if I would purchase a clock that he had in pledge, I told him that I was busy, if he would call again the next day I might, I wished to have time to take him in custody; he came the next evening, I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor.) Are you sure that clock is yours - A. I have known it these thirty years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime that is charged against me. On February last, I was in a public house, a genteel man came in and asked me to pawn this clock, upon which I went.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the brig <hi rend="italic">Woodside</hi>, of Glasgow—she was in the Wappin-basin. On the 10th of Feb. I was on Tower-hill—I made use of my handkerchief, and returned it to my pocket after I had done—I felt a hand, and my handkerchief, was gone—I tuned and saw the prisoner—I detained him in my possession for a quarter of an hour—several persons came by and hissed me—a gentleman came and said, "Hold him a few minutes, and I will fetch you a policeman"—I did not find my handkerchief—where it went, I could not say—it was near the Nag's Head—there was a woman came out of a passage, and called the prisoner by name—I could not say what name she called him—I said to her, "You keep your respectful distance, or I will give you in charge as well as him"—I know it was the prisoner's hand which was in my pocket, because there was no person but him present at the time—I caught hold of him directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Upper Chapman-street, St. George'<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I was crossing Tower-hill between six and seven o'clock in the evening on the 10th of Feb.—I saw the prosecutor near the steps of a beer-shop in Postern-row—he was putting his handkerchief into his pocket—the prisoner was close against me—the prosecutor had scarcely taken his hand from his pocket, when the prisoner put his hand in and took the handkerchief out—a woman came and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, what is the matter?"—he either gave the handkerchief to her or dropped it—it was a red one—I saw it in the prisoner's hand.</p>

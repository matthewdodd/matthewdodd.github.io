            . I am a private in the Coldstream Guards. On the 1st of March I was sentinel at the King's palace, St. James' - I saw the prisoner a few minutes before four o'clock in the morning; she showed me a watch, which she took from her bosom - I asked her to allow me to look at it; she gave it me - I detained it, informed the serjeant, and gave him the watch.</p>

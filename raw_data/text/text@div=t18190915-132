On the 9th of July the prisoner came and asked for a dozen of twelve-penny velvet, and one dozen of eight-penny - I delivered it to him, and asked who they were for? he said for Mr. Boyle, who is a customer of ours, and lives in Friday-street - they came to 28 s. I gave him a piece of paper, and asked him to write the gentleman's name; he wrote</p>
               <p>"Messrs. Boyle and Co." I said Mr. Keymer would send the bill up - he said</p>
               <p>"Very well," and left. In about twenty minutes he came again, found fault with them, and said they were not liked where he had been, and would not leave them, but asked to see more - I found I had no more, and said, when Mr. Keymer came in he would change them. He went away, and would not leave them.</p>

            . I am in partnership with Messrs. Boyle, Fisher, and Walford, who are haberdashers, and live in Friday-street, we deal with Mr. Keymer. The prisoner is a perfect stranger to us, was unauthorized to get articles, and never delivered them to us. He was brought to our house afterwards from Keymer's. He had rolls under his arm, which appeared like goods, but upon opening them they contained waste paper.</p>

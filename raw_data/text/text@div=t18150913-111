These powers of attorney were never sent to India, for they were brought to me by the prisoner's father in law, and have since been sent to India; and the postage paid out of my pocket. Messrs. Windle sent in a bill for the sealing of them, what has also been paid The powers of attorney were brought to me, about a week after the prisoner was discharged from my service. I did not get the prisoner into custody until about a fortnight ago.</p>

               <p>A letter was now read in court directed to Mr. Whitten, and signed by the prisoner, confessing he had embezzled the money: imputing it to an intimacy he had contracted with bad company; acknowledging a considerable balance due from him to Mr. Whitten, which should be set to rights; offering to call upon Mr. Whitten, to give assistance in an explanation of various frauds which he had committed upon him; and praying pardon on account of his wife and child.</p>

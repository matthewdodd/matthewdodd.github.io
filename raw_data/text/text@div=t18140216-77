             covered the ribbons over in the ribbon drawer with a bonnet; seeing that, I suspected they were going to take ribbon; one of their hands was under her bonnet, and with the other hand drawing the ribbon over the bonnet, seeing how the ribbon would look upon the bonnet, and in about a quarter of an hour they fixed on a ribbon. I cut the ribbon off, and gave it her, and they offered me a dollar; I refused the dollar, not thinking it good.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the ribbon to come to - A. About ten-pence halfpenny. Then Hannah Brown went out of the shop, and said she would get change. She returned, and gave me a shilling. I took for the ribbon, and they went out of the shop; and after folding up the ribbon and placing the drawer, then appeared two vacancies in the drawer, as if two pieces of ribbon had been taken out. It struck me that they had taken them. The two prisoners came about one o'clock again, and asked to look at some ribbons again. I asked them, what sort; they said, it is not material. I shewed them a different drawer to what they had out the first time. They covered the second drawer with the bonnet, the same as they did the first. I cut them off the quantity they wished; they paid for it, and left the shop. I told Elizabeth Dimes if they came the third time to keep a sharp look out, and if she saw them take any ribbon to give me a nod, and say, yes, as I had suspected them twice; then between four and five o'clock, just at dusk, the two prisoners came again; then after they had been looking at the ribbons a quarter of an hour,

             to give me the ribbon that belonged to me that she had taken. She said she had not taken any. I moved her a little further, and picked up on the shop floor one piece of ribbon, and suspecting they had more about them I sent the boy to Hatton Garden office for an officer. Wood came; he searched them, and, I believe, did not find any thing on them. I gave him the ribbon, and he took them into custody.</p>

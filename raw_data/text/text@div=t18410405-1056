                  </hi>. I live at Farnborough-hall, at Farnborough, in Kent. On the evening of the 8th of March, I was coming out of the old Com-Exchange, Mark-lane—the gateway was stopped by a number of persons coming in; I got close up to them, and was in the act of going out, a person came up to my side, and pushed very hard against me for half a minute—I did not observe who it was—he was on one side of me, over my shoul<lb></lb>der—as soon as the space was cleared he got out—I kept my eye on him, felt immediately in my pocket, and missed my money, and followed him directly—this was the same person who pushed against me—there was no body going out but him and me that I saw—there must Lave been other persons close by—I followed the person, and called out "Stop thief"—I came up to him, seized him, and charged him with it—he was about the width of this Court from the place where I was pressed—when he found he could not get away, he turned his head over his shoulder, and called to somebody; he put his hand behind him, and I suspected he gave the pro<lb></lb>perty to that person—the prisoner was the person that came up—I let the person go, and seized the prisoner—he struggled, and got from me for a mo<lb></lb>ment, and got into a place between the two markets—I did not lose sight of him—as he turned round I seized him—we went out of the street toge<lb></lb>ther, and he was taken—he was searched in my presence at the station—I had two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes, three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

About three o'clock this afternoon I was in Mark-lane—I saw Mr. Stow scuffling with a man, when I first saw him from the steps of the market-place—I came down into the road—as they were scuffling, I saw the man he was scuffling with throw a paper parcel from his hand, which came towards me—I picked it up, and handed it over to Robins—I did not see the man's face who the prosecutor was scuffling with—his back was towards me; but whoever he was scuffling with threw away the paper—he was taken into custody—he did not get away.</p>

               <p>GEORGE PETERS. I live with my father, who is a gentleman's butler. On the 5th of September I was bathing in the <placeName id="t18320906-443-crimeloc2496">Regent's-canal, Regent's-park</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far was I from where your jacket was when I was stopped with it? A. About three yards, but you ran away with it - you threw them down, and was going to strike Lewis, and ran off, but I said you had still<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060173"></xptr>got some money - I had seen you take it out of my pocket; you did not ask me for it.</p>

I was by the canal, and saw the prisoner fishing - I went up the hill, and saw him go and take up these clothes and make off with them; I turned, and ran after him - seeing me, he threw them down; I secured him, as Peters said he had the money; we scuffled; I heard money rattle in his breast - he stripped to his trousers, and said he had no money, but 2s. 6d. fell from his person; he resisted, and we both fell together - he got from me; I followed him, and told him to give me up the 1s. 1d. - he said he would; he then pulled out a knife, and attempted to strike me - but the crowd prevented him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not threaten to throw me into the canal if I did not give up the 1s. 1d.; I then told you to mind, for I had a knife? A. Not a word of it is true.</p>

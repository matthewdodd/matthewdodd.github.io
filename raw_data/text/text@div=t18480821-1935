                  </hi>. I am a servant at 63, Lower Sloane-street, Chelsea. On the night of 11th July, about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, I was in Sloane-street, and saw the two female prisoners there—they acosted me—one came on my right, and the other on my left side—they invited me to come along with them—I declined, and told them to go about their business—they would not—Pickett, who was on my left, snatched at my watch, and dragged my silver chain, gold seal, and common key from my watch—the guard, which is now round my neck, saved it—she flew into the road—I immediately <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> after her—she up with her fist and knocked my hat off, and I received a tremendous blow at the side of my head—I stooped to pick up my hat, and as I rose I received another tremendous blow at the side of my head—the prisoner Keates then came up, and said, "Did you strike that woman?"—I said, "Yes"—her shawl fell off, he picked it up, and said, "Do you mean to strike her?"—I said, "Yes"—she ran as hard as she could down the street, calling out, "I will follow you home"—I said, "Do you mean to keep that shawl?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I will thank you to give it to me. till I get my property back"—he said, "No"—he took it and gave it to Tapson, who was on the pavement—she said, "I know who that shawl belongs to"—I said, "You shall give it to me"—she said, "No, I shall keep it"—they walked on down Sloane-street and I followed them, and insisted on having my property or the shawl—there were two more <hi rend="italic">bullies</hi> on the pave<lb></lb>ment—at the corner of Exceter-street a policeman came up, and I gave Tap<lb></lb>son in custody—I did not charge Keates then.</p>

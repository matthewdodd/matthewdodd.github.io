            . I live in Coppice-row. On the 25th of March, I was with Mr. Thompson, coming down Holborn-hill, and observed the two prisoners following a gentleman, and attempting his pocket. They kept close to him, till he got to the Swan Inn, Holborn-bridge; they stopped at the corner of the inn gate for ten minutes - They then came back again, and followed Mr. Pater; Wilson attempted Mr. Pater's pocket - They were both together - We followed them to the corner of Field-lane, and then Dracas took a handkerchief out of Mr. Pater's right-hand coat-pocket. We then collared them. Wilson said,"Dracas have you got it." On turning round, I saw the handkerchief in Dracas's right hand. We had followed them for a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of March, I was coming down Holborn-hill, and saw the two prisoners following a gentleman, who was going towards Cheapside. They attempted his pocket, and followed him to the Swan-inn gateway - They stood there a few minutes, and Mr. Pater came by; they immediately followed him. Wilson first attempted his pocket. Just before they got to Field-lane there was a crowd-Wilson left the pocket, Dracas slipped in, and Wilson closed in to hide him. I saw his arms move - I collared him, and told Mr. Pater he had lost his handkerchief. He said, "if it is mine, I have the fellow one in my pocket." He produced one, which exactly matched it.</p>

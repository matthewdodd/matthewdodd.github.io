            . I am a smith, and live in Ironmonger street. On the 8th of October, about a quarter past seven o'clock, I was in Goswell-street, talking to a friend, and saw the prisoner make a rush at the prosecutor, and run down a turning; I followed him till he was taken, which was in about three minutes, and never lost sight of him. Woodward stopped him when I was about a yard from him - he was taken back to the prosecutor, and detained. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I keep a millinery warehouse in Goswell-street. On the 8th of October I was standing near my door, talking to Mallin, and saw the prisoner rush against the prosecutor - he immediately ran away; we followed, and did not lose sight of him till he was taken. I was not two yards from him, and am certain of him. Several people were running behind, but none between us and him.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Attfield-street. I was returning from work, and at the corner of Baltic-street, I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running violently towards me, and stopped him; nobody was running before him. The two last witnesses were within two yards of him. Next morning, about six o'clock, within a yard of the very spot where I took him I picked up a seal, three keys, and part of a watch chain, and gave them to the officer.</p>

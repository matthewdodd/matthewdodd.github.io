               <p>I live in Cleveland-street, Frtzroy-square; I lost my handkerchief going to Cannon row, the foot of Westminster-bridge; I had been in the City, and as I was going by Westminster-bridge I missed my handkerchief, nearly, out of my pocket; at a considerable distance, from Temple-bar, I missed it partly out, but not quite, then I put it in, going on, partly to Charing Cross, I missed it partly out again; I put it in again; very near to Cannon-row, I observed the prisoners behind me, almost to Cannon row, in <placeName id="t17940430-63-crimeloc333">Cannon-row</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were they together when you observed them behind you? - Yes, I did not turn about to look particularly at them, but I observed them just behind, just at the end of Cannon-row, I had an occasion for my handkerchief, and I put my hand into my pocket to feel for it, and the prisoners immediately ran forwards before me, which gave me every reason to suspect they had got it, one of them. I run after one of them, and called, stop thief! they went towards the foot of the bridge, from Cannon-row; I laid hold of one of them, the tall one, which is Sullivan, and I told him that either him or the other had got my handkerchief; which he strongly denied, and he pulled a considerable quantity of handkerchief out of his pocket, but I perceived there were neither of them mine; I then took off his hat, and found the handkerchief concealed in the crown of his hat; the other was secured by the people about, at the time Sullivan was stopped; he did not run, he would have run if he had not been secured. From thence they were taken to the justice and committed, I have the handkerchief, there is a black stain nearly the middle, and several holes and white spots; the letters of my name are on it, in the midle, but I did not know it at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure they were both together when you looked behind? - Yes, and they both ran forward together.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you take him after you pursued? - He did not run fifty yards, and the other ran with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen any thing before the prisoners ran by you? - Not any thing.</p>

No, says he; thank you, sir, says I, I am very much obliged to you; with that I walked on, and the man cried out stop thief! and stopped me close by the watermen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Pasmore. I was going over Westminster Bridge, and I met this young man, and he asked me where Captain Ogleton lived? I told him I did not know, and when I came to the watermen I was stopped; I did not see what it was for.</p>

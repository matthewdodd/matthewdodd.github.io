She told me, the Prisoner had. I went in pursuit of her, and found her at a disorderly house in Beech-lane, on the 7th of Nov. between one and two in the morning. I asked her, what was become of my work? She said, she knew nothing of it. I said, yes, you do; you are a thief. At last she owned she took two bobbins weight nine ounces, and twelve penny weight of gold thread, and Stevenson delivered ten ounces of silver waste to me; but she had burnt a good deal of it - She said at first that she found it; but she said afterwards she had carried it back again, and hid it under a bench by my shed door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were taken out of your warehouse?</p>
               <p>Panton. Because when our people had done work, I locked up the warehouse door; and I am sure these goods were in the warehouse at that time, for I had but just made an end of them.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Peter Poland. On the 12th of July I was at the back of his shop, No. 351, in the <placeName id="t18320906-212-crimeloc1197">Strand</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not at first say you had lost three half-sovereigns? A. Yes, but I afterwards recollected I had given out two at the time I counted the money; there had been ten, before I gave out the two, and I left eight - there had been no customers in - the till was not locked; there was another person there who attended to the shop, but she had not been to the till - Phillips was laying across the counter, and I saw his hand in the till.</p>

             (Police-constable C 171). I was in the Strand, and observed the two prisoners on the other side of the way, not far from Mr. Warren's; I followed them - they were in company; they went, I suppose, into twenty different shops, and when they came out, I or my brother officer went and inquired what they had been for; when they came to Mr. Poland's, I saw Phillips go in, and Reardon stood at the window, and make several motions with his head and his fingers; Phillips then came out, and Reardon went in - he then came out, and went a little way off; a woman then went in, and we crossed - Phillips was just coming out, and Stone took him - I went and took Reardon, who was then running.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STONE. I was with Kent, and saw Phillips go into the shop - Reardon waited outside, and made motions to him; then Reardon went in, and came out again - a woman then went in; Phillips came out - I stopped him, and found a half-sovereign in his right hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you caught Phillips by the throat? A. No; we were both in plain clothes.</p>
               <p>Phillips' Defence. The young lady said she missed three half-sovereigns, and the officer seized my throat, put his fingers into my mouth, and nearly strangled me.</p>
               <p>Reardon's Defence. I went to get a situation, and when I came out, the officer took me.</p>

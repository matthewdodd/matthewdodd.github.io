About one o'clock, the guard of the Sheffield coach informed me that the prisoner had stolen a parcel out of his coach. I asked him where the prisoner was; he said, he was run away. He gave me the parcel; I locked it up. The next morning I opened it in the guard's presence; it contained fourteen dozen of small files, a ten-pound bank note, a five-pound bank note, and two five-guinea Sheffield notes, and this invoice, and letter. One of the notes I have saved in case I should ever find the prisoner. I found him on the 15th of April, in the Saracen's Head yard, Friday-street; I asked the prisoner to walk with me to an office, and there I gave him in custody.</p>

            . I am guard to the Sheffield coach. On the 9th of March, as I was going across the yard I saw Clark in the coach examining the seats inside of the coach; he came out of the coach and shut the door. He got on the fore-wheel of the coach and opened the boot-lid where he put the luggage in; he turned a few of the parcels over that were at the top, and took out a small parcel, put it under his arm, and went into a bye shed in the yard with it; he turned out of the shed and stood by the side of the coach. I went to him, and said, Clark, I wish you would bring back the parcel that you took out of my boot; he said, he had not taken any parcel. I told him I was certain he had: I saw him take it out of the boot myself; he went into the stable. I went to the shed to look for the parcel; there was an empty chaise with one of the windows open, I found the parcel there, underneath the seat. I gave Mr. 
               <persName id="t18140420-25-person289">Robinson</persName>
             the parcel. At that time the prisoner was gone away. I am certain I saw him take the parcel out, and put it under his left arm, and walk to the shed with it. The next day Mr. Robinson met me; he opened the parcel in my presence, in the coach office; the parcel contained a ten-pound bank note, a five-pound bank note, and two five-guinea notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. I produce a five-guinea note I reserved, and this invoice, containing an account of the parcel.</p>

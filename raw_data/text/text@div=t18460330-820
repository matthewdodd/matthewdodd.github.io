                  </hi>. I am one of the vergers of St. Paul's Cathedral. The prisoner lived with me about three years as a servant, or to do anything he was required—he assisted me in the discharge of my duty as verger—part of the time he boarded and lodged in the house, but did not receive any wages, except it was when he was engaged at the church—he had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on Thursday, the 26th of Feb., I went with my wife to Green<lb></lb>wich—he was then in my service—he had the care of the house till I came back—I left about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon—I re<lb></lb>turned about six o'clock—the prisoner was then gone—I went up into my bed-room, which is the front room third floor, and found my door, which had been locked, unlocked and open—I had taken the key in my pocket—there was a cupboard in the bedroom in which I kept my money—that was locked when I went out—I found it unlocked—I had a little cash-box in the small ward<lb></lb>robe drawer—the purse was not in that, but in the closet—there was, as near a I can guess, a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and I think about eighty sovereigns or so, in the purse when I went away, amounting in the whole to about 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that purse and money was gone and the cash-box, there was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the cash-box in silver and gold, and a promissory note for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not the numbers of the notes—I have since seen the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which was rather conspicuous, being cut in two—the amount of the notes shown me corresponded with my loss—the purse has been shown me and the cash-box, but it has been very much dilapidated since I lost it—I also lost a carpet-bag—I have since seen one which I believe to be mine—my box I cannot swear to.</p>

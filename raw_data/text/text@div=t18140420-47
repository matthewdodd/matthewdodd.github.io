On Sunday evening, the 20th of February, about eight o'clock, I was in Newgate-street; I was going further into the City. When I was in Newgate-street, I am quite certain I had my pocket-book in my coat pocket. My pocket-book contained several letters, and about twenty-one pound in notes; a ten pound bank of England note, a five pound note, and six ones. There might be more ones, six I am sure of. I felt some person at my coat pocket. I was quite sober. Upon my feeling some person at my coat pocket I turned round to see who it was. The person that I saw had something tied round his waist; it afterwards proved to be a blue apron. At the time I saw the person he was just turning from me; I saw no other person near me. I did not recollect at that moment that I had a pocket-book in my pocket; I felt for my pocket handkerchief, it was in my pocket; afterwards it came into my mind, I found my pocket-book was gone. I set off after the person; I overtook him about an hundred yards. I did not see him until I came up to him. I seized the prisoner by the coat, and desired him to deliver me my pocket book. He solemnly declared he had not got it. I asked him if he was willing to be searched; he said he was perfectly willing. He was then searched by a person who was with me; nothing was found. I had lost sight of the prisoner. About an hundred yards off my pocket-book was found; it was picked up about a yard off the prisoner; a person picked it up and brought it to Mr. Bellchambers. The person that brought the pocket-book said he picked it up about a yard off the prisoner. I am certain it was my pocket-book; it had my letters in it, and the notes, a ten pound bank note, a five pound bank note, and either six, or more, one pound notes. The pocketbook contained all my letters and notes. I lost nothing.</p>
               <p>JURY. Can you positively say the prisoner had an apron on when you overtook him - A. I can positively say he had an apron on then. I cannot say he had that blue apron. When I first saw him he had something round him.</p>

            . I am a wine merchant. I live in Southampton-row, Bloomsbury-square. I was with Mr. Uthwart when he lost his pocket-book in Newgate-street. We were walking to see his sister, who lives in Dowgate-hill. It was soon after seven o'clock, Mr. Uthwart said he had lost his pocket-book. I said, my God, have you indeed, step after me. He clapped his eye upon the prisoner; he said, that is the man. From the prisoner's confusion at the moment I began to think he was the man. We had turned back about an hundred yards, and before we came to Snow-hill, Mr. Uthwart laid hold of him; he charged him with taking his pocket-book. The prisoner said he had not. Some person called out, search him. He had a jacket, with a blue apron on. I felt about him; he opened his jacket and apron. I immediately stooped to the ground, imagining he might have dropped it; and some person said, here is the book, sir. I was close by the prisoner at the time, and the person could not be more than a yard from the prisoner. I then gave the pocket-book to Mr. Uthwart. He went into a spirit shop in Newgate-street to see if the contents were right. The contents were all claimed by Mr. Uthwart. I think the bank notes in it were twenty-four pounds. It was reckoned; it was near thereabouts. Mr. Uthwart said it was all right. The prisoner went down upon his knees, and begged for mercy, or pardon, something of that kind.

            . I am a journeyman carpenter; I live in Noble-street, Falcon-square. I saw the prisoner when Mr. Uthwart had hold of him; not before; he had already hold of him. When I came up I picked up the book about a yard from the prisoner; who dropped it I cannot tell. I sung out, who belongs to this book? Mr. Uthwart said, me. I went with the prisoner to the Mansion-house. I left him in charge in the Poultry compter.</p>

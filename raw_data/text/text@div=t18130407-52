When I went home I found I had lost my pocket-book; it contained five one-pound bank notes. I know I lost it in the Court of King's Bench.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Saturday, the 6th of March, I, in company with Branscomb, was attending the bankrupts in Guildhall. I observed the prisoner coming down the steps under the clock, and seeing him rather in a bustle, and knowing of him, I told my partner that I thought something was amiss. We let him go down the steps by the Town Clerk's office, into Basinghall-street; I then followed him to the corner of the White Bear, Basinghall-street. I laid hold of him, and I unbuttoned his coat, and immediately perceived this book half way in his breast pocket. I asked him what he had got there. He immediately began to cry. I gave the book to Branscomb, and proceeded to search him. In his pocket I found a little silver, and a pair of scissars. I then took him to the Compter, while Branscomb went to Guildhall to look for the owner. This is the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my pocket-book; I lost it in Guildhall.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070038"></xptr>- BRANSCOMB. I know no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Saturday being a leisure day I went to Guildhall to hear the trials. I came out of Guildhall, and picked up this pocket-book on the steps. I came out, and went into Basinghall-street. Mr. Brown tapped me on the shoulder with a cane; he said, Isaacs, what do you do at Guildhall. I said, nothing but to hear the trials. He opened my coat, and took the pocket-book away, and afterwards he took me into custody.</p>

On the 23rd, or early on the 24th of February, the prosecutor came and broke open my door, at No. 9, Salutation-court, which is very near Lascelles-court—he actually tore my wife out of the house—he said, "You b—y w—e, you have robbed me of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I told him he had made a mistake, but I was ill with the rheumatic gout at the time—it was between twelve and one o'clock—my door was partly open—I was having my supper—I am a journeyman plasterer—I worked for Mr. Cubit for seven years, and since then three months for Mr. Theobald, of Islington.</p>

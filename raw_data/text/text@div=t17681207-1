            . I lodge in the prosecutor's house; I had been out, and came home about a quarter before ten that night; I found the door fast; I walked up and down Ormond-street; I met these two men about the middle of the street; I walked as far as Queen-square, and returned back; when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070003"></xptr> I came into the yard, I saw one of the prisoners standing at the prosecutor's door; I call'd George, thinking it had been my bed-fellow. Then I walked on towards the door; when I came within ten yards, I call'd George again, then the man came from the door, and the other out of the house: they had each things under their arms. I past by them, and took no notice of them, and let them pass me, there being nobody in the yard to help me. They went towards the Foundling-hospital, I went and saw the door open, I shut it, and went after the prisoners: I watched them down as far as the Hospital; I could not see any body to assist me there. I came back, thinking they would come again, as they had left the door open; I got behind a piece of wood, and saw them come and cross over and down the yard; then I went and got assistance; I met them coming out of the yard, I told the watchmen they were the men; they had been at the house and found the door fast, and were coming back.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get in the first time?</p>
               <p>Kelsey. That I do not know. I am sure these prisoners are the men; I had fight of them three times; they were searched, and four keys found upon one of them, I cannot say which: I tried them with the lock, but neither of them would open it: After that we went to look for the goods, and found them tied up in a table-cloth, hanging on a tree in the Foundling-field. (The goods laid in the indictment produced.)</p>

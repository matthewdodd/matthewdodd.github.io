            . On Saturday, the 3rd of July, my father sent me with the saddle to Mr. Blackwell, Oxford-street. As I was coming from Church-street a man came and asked me which was the way to Hanover-square; he asked me what my father was, and where he lived; I told him he was a sadler, and lived at No. 19, Church-street, Soho. He asked me where I was going with the saddle; I told him. He gave me three cherries, said, good bye, make haste home, and then when I got a little further another man came up, and said holloa, what was I about; Mr. Blackwell had been waiting for the saddle ever so long; and after I had walked a little way further a third man came up, and asked the prisoner which was the way to Church-street; then the prisoner said I was to give him the saddle: I said, no; I must take it. He then untied the string that fastened the saddle to my shoulders. The person that came up, and asked the way to Church-street said he would give me some money to shew him the to Church-street. Then we went as far as

            . I am stable-keeper. I had been at Mr. Kendall's mews; after I came out of his stable I met two men, one of them had a saddle. I said friend, is that saddle to be sold; he said, yes, for three pounds. I said two pounds ten shillings will do, but I will have the girts with it. They left the saddle at Mr. Prior's. I called again about seven o'clock in the evening; they never brought the girts. The officer came and claimed the saddle as being a stolen one. The prisoner is the man I bought the saddle of, and I paid him for it.</p>

            . I am a private patrol - Mr. Pige's house is in my beat. On Sunday morning, the 25th of March, about a quarter-past five o'clock, as it was just getting light; I saw a chap come down a court, leading to the back of Pige's house; I went up there, and found the privy door shut - I asked who was there - the prisoner answered, "It is Hopcroft;" the parish watchman came up, and knocked at the door - he opened it, and this lead was behind the door; no other person was there; I said,"This is your game, is it Mr. Hopcroft?" he said he knew nothing about the lead, and came there for a certain purpose - the privy is common to all the houses in the court; I tried to seize him - he fought very hard, and struck me in the jaw; I got assistance, and took him to the watch-house; I then went to Mr. Pige's, called him up, and asked if he had lost any lead; he looked round, and said he had; I applied this lead to the roof; it fitted exactly, and covered that part of the roof near the chimney, and exactly matched with what was left; I have no doubt of its being the same.</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-yard, George-street, Bethnal-green - the prisoner lived next door to Pige's. Between five and six o'clock that morning I saw the patrol at the privy door; the patrol drew his cutlass, and said he would cut his head off if he resisted; I did not see him resist; I called out to him not to commit murder; I was at the window, and he was inside the privy.</p>
               <p>W. LOYAL. I did not strike him till he jammed the door too, and struck me; he said, "I will muzzle you;" I then drew my cutlass.</p>

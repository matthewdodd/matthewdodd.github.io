               <p>Mills. I was following my Man up Stairs, and found this Man coming down between one Story and half a Story; and I said, my Friend, where are you going? to get a little Sugar? I must see what you have got. He had an Apron hung down to his Knees, and a Bag: There it is: And in that Bag was the Sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. This being found upon him, what did he say?</p>

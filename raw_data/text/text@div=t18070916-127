Soon after this child was seen in our passage. it came out, I saw it at the window, I knew the child by the head, it was white; it was stripped of its frock. I got the child to be taken care of. Soon after I saw her at the window; I ran after her and took her against St. Martin's watchhouse; I secured her and sent for Goodenough, he took her to Qeen square; I was ordered to attend with the frock.

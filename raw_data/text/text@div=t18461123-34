                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the 17th of Oct. I went with Brannan and Bryant to the Wheatsheaf public-house, Edgware-road, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, and found the male prisoner in company with other men, in front of the bar—I took hold of him, and told him he must consider himself in custody for casting counterfeit half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, at Westminster—he said, "That be d—d and b—, let us have some gin before I move a step?"—he then resisted very much—we took him away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he would have jumped out if we had not pre<lb></lb>vented him—he attempted to put his hand into his right-hand pocket—I searched him at the station, and found a shilling, a sixpence, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, (good money,) a knife, and a latch-key—I left him at the station, and went about eleven o'clock with Brannan to a house in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove, with the key which I found on the prisoner—I saw Mrs. Hollis in the front parlour—she gave me information—I went up stairs with her—she pointed out a room, and called "Mrs. M'Donald" several times—there was no answer—the door was fast—I forced it open—there was nobody there—we searched the room in the presence of Mrs. Hollis, and found a work-box on a chair, and in it was this galvanic-battery—on the table I found a jar containing fluid, which is now in this bottle—the battery can be placed in the jar—on the same table was a jar with powdered plaster of paris—I found a saucer with a quantity of wet plaster of paris, two faives covered with plaster of paris, on the table, a brush full of plaster of paris, and two leather bands, which are used in making moulds—on a shelf I found four bottles containing different liquids—on the floor I found a washhand-basin, quite wet, containing plaster of paris, and four packages of copper-wire were hanging on a nail—while I was there the prisoner Wright came into the room—she appeared drunk—she attempted to put her hand into her bosom—I immediately laid hold of her hand, and took from her bosom two packages containing twenty-three counterfeit four-penny pieces—she had a basket containing a pair of women's new boots, and several other articles—I took from her pocket a box, with 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 5 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in it—after the search she was left in my care in the room—the rest of the officers went down stairs—after Brannan returned he produced several moulds and a bag with two counterfeit half-crowns in it—I took her to the station where Anderson was.</p>

We went out with a Light and overtook the Prisoner and the two Children, before they came to Grub-street. I ask'd her where she was going with these Children. She answer'd what's that to you? I enquir'd what she had got in her Apron, she told me nothing of mine. We examin'd her Apron and found the Children's Clothes in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. Going by the Farrier's shed in Finsbury, I heard a Woman say, damn you you little Bitch, stand still. I mistrusted what she was about, and went to an Ale-house Where Mr. Pye was, and taking a Candle we follow'd the Prisoner, and took her with the Children's Clothes in her Apron. <rs id="t17340227-39-verdict178" type="verdictDescription">

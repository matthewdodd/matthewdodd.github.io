Last Monday evening, about seven o'clock, as I was standing about four doors from my own house, I saw the prisoner Wynn and another go past the shop; my shop-windows were lighted up; they made a full stop, and looked round; then went on; I had not been out five minutes; after they went several times back wards and forwards;

(The cheese produced and deposed to.) The weight is about twelve pounds; it cost six-pence per pound.</p>

On the 25th of September, at night, I was serving a customer behind my counter; as I was turning myself round, the gentlewoman said she saw a man's hand come in at the window; I looked, but did not miss any thing that night; and I being ill, did know nothing of it till the next night: then I missed ten pair of silk stockings; and on the Saturday morning, a man came with a boy, who shew'd him where and how they took the stockings: I being ill, could not then attend at Justice Fielding's.</p>

            . On a Wednesday night, Byfield asked me to go along with him, to the Jew that is here a witness, to borrow some money; we went together, and when we came to go towards Temple bar, where the prosecutor's shop is, he told me to stop; I stopped at the next door, while he took an opportunity to take the stockings. He put his hand in at the door, and took them out of the window; there were ten pair: we went on to the Red Lyon in Whitechapel, where we were to meet the Jew; then it was about half an hour after eight o'clock. We sent for him, and Byfield pulled out the stockings form his pocket, and shewed him them; he told them over, and paid Byfield 20 s. for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell the Jew where he had them?</p>
               <p>Downs. He knew we stole them. Byfield gave me 10 s. of the money. The next day after that, I went and delivered myself up to Justice Fielding, and told him what had passed the day before; then I was admitted an evidence, and Byfield was taken up the next morning; this was on a Friday, about seven o'clock.</p>

            . I am a Jew. I bought ten pair of stockings of the prisoner, on that Wednesday night: I have one pair of them here, the rest are sold. (Producing a pair of silk stockings).</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell the nine pair for?</p>
               <p>Territchino. I sold them for three shillings a pair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Jew told us, if he went into any shop, he could buy such for 3 s. a pair: these are not the first things he has bought of us. There is a boy in Newgate now that he has bought things of; and he has given diamonds to him to cut glass windows with. (See the trial of Hatton and Whitfield).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. (He takes the pair of stockings in his hand). I sell these for 12 s. or 13 s. a pair: this pair is the worst among the parcel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say. This Jew used to encourage us to do so; he used to give us diamonds to cut windows, and he said, if we got in trouble, he would bail us. He has encouraged several little boys to thieve: he gave 8 s. for a large pair of silver buckles that were worth 30 s.</p>

             (City police-constable No.61). I went to this place in plain clothes - I saw the prisoner put her hand into this man's pocket, and take out the box - the prosecutor had before taken a half-sovereign out, but whether the prisoner saw it or not I cannot tell - I found this box in her bosom.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this man - he spoke to me and gave me a bundle to take care of - he went home with me - he then asked me to go to this house and hear a song - when we were sitting there, he turned to me and said,"These men are trying to get my money" - I said, "Give it to me, I am more sober than you are" - he said, "Put your hand into my coat, and take it," which I did, and the officer took me - the prosecutor was very tipsy - he had known me seven or eight years ago, before he was transported.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BEAUCHAMP. I have never been transported - I have been four voyages to the East Indies, and four years on board a man-of-war.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CRAWLEY. The prosecutor was not drunk - when I took the prisoner she said, "I thought you had been a b - y thief too."</p>

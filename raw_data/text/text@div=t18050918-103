Yes, about half past eleven; I saw these two children (pointing to them) walking with little Henry; I saw the prisoner at the bar having hold of little Henry's left hand with her right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these children before? - A. No, I said to the prisoner, poor little fellow, he can hardly walk alone; she said, no, Madam, he can but just walk; I took no further notice of the prisoner, I went to my employ. About half past one I heard of a little child being lost; I ran down stairs upon their saying it was with a little boy in a brown coat, and I said I saw a woman take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180088"></xptr>a child away in Lincoln's-Inn-fields. On the Tuesday after that I saw her sitting on Mr. Wood's steps, in Chancery-lane, and there I said she was the person that took the child away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the woman that you saw with these three little children in Lincoln's-inn-square? - A. I am positive of it; she had on, then, a coarse black bombazeen gown, and a velvet bonnet; I am sure it is the same woman though she is not in the same dress.</p>

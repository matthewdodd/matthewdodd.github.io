            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Wilson, of Eyre-street-hill. I was in Brook-street on the evening in question; I saw Mr. Jones there, and three or four young men about him - the prisoner came in front of him and snatched his watch from his fob; it appeared to be a silver watch - they all ran over the road and up Fox-court; I was taken to a house in Drury-lane about ten or eleven o'clock the same night, and the officer brought the prisoner down to me - I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This occurred all in a moment? A. Yes, the prisoner was a stranger to me; I went on to Leather-lane after I saw it, and when I got there it was about five minutes past seven o'clock; when I went to the public-house, the prisoner was brought down to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, consider; did you not say when you saw him,"I think he is the man?" A. No, I did not; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you did not say "I think he is the man?" A. The policeman brought him down and said"Do you know this man;" I said he is very much like him - he then turned round and I said, "That is the man, but he has changed his waistcoat."</p>

             (police-sergeant G 5). I heard of this about nine in the evening, from the son of the gaoler at Hatton-garden; I went to Johnson, and he described the prisoner - I went to the Great Mogul in Drury-lane, saw the prisoner there with three or four other men; I brought him down, and Johnson said, "I think it is him"- I said, "Be sure;" the prisoner then turned round, and he said, "I am sure it is him, only he has changed his waistcoat" - I have known the prisoner a long time, his parents are respectable - I can't find the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 16th of April, from six o'clock till half-past eight, I was at work for my father at his house, No. 21, Tash-street - I was polishing a watch ready for gilding; when my father came home, he gave me a shilling - I went to the Great Mogul, and the officer came and took me.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. I am a watch-finisher, and live at No. 21, Tash-street - on the evening my son was taken, I went from home at six o'clock, leaving him at home at tea; I returned a quarter before nine; I had left him a piece of work which he could not do in less than an hour and a half or two hours - the work was done.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You live but a short distance from Brook-street? A. No, the prisoner might have gone out - I can't account for the officer picking him out in Drury-lane, but I believe he frequently went there in the evening - my son was in trouble once before, I think it was for stealing a plane.</p>

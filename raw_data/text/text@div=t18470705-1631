On the 30th of June, about eight o'clock, I was coming along a street leading from Portman-square with a lady—I felt a tustle at my pocket—I turned round, and caught Henry Bradford's hand at my pocket—I said, "You have been robbing me, or taken something"—I felt for my purse—it was gone—I caught his hand—I did not see my purse in it—it was gone—he declared solemnly he had not taken it—he pulled his hand from me and ran—I caught</p>

                  </hi> I am a private in the Scotch Fusileer Guards—on Wednesday evening, the 30th of June, I was coming down Wigmore-street—I had a female on my arm—I saw the prosecutrix and another lady in front of me—Henry Bradford stepped forward to them—he walked about three yards by the side of the prosecutrix—he put his left hand into her pocket on the right side, and took a brown article out and put it in his left hand coat pocket—the prosecutrix caught his hand—he made a spring from her, and made a start across the street—she caught him again—he slipped his coat of the sleeves caught his hand, and the coat hung on his back—Mary Ann Bradford stepped up to him, took the same article from his coat pocket that he had put in, and passed it to some man who came round her—that was the last I saw of the article—I could not say whether it was striped—it appeared brown.</p>

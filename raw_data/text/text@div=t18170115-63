            . I am watchman to Mr. Brown of Millbank. On the 21st of December, between eleven and twelve in the morning, I saw the prisoner lurking about the house, as I passed, when I returned he was gone; I looked in at the gate, and saw the windows open, heard a door rattle, and saw the prisoner put his head of the parlour-window. I shook my head at him, and he came to the door to me; I asked him why he went into the house? he said the door was open; I told him that it was false, and that he got in at the window. He wanted me to let him go. As I was taking him to Mr. Bramah he threw a screw-driver into the garden. I went back and found it.</p>
               <p>JOHN COBHAM. I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to Queen-Square, and I found two locks in his coat pocket, and the nobs in his other pocket. I went, with Taylor, to the house, in Union-place, Millbank, and found eight doors with the locks off: those found on the prisoner fitted two of the doors exactly.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was taken ill, and went into the house. The locks found on me are mine. I am continually pestered with officers. I was once transported, and since I received my pardon I will defy any man to say I I have robbed anybody. I can produce a hundred locks of the same description.</p>

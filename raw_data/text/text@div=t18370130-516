                  </hi>. I live in Mill-lane, Deptford. My husband's name is Thomas—I am separated from him—I carry on the trade of a dealer in marine stores—I entrusted my cart, with the mule and set of harness, and the bones and rags, to Thomas Jackson, on the 18th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning—he is no relation whatever—he lodged with me for four months—I refused 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the mule three days before this—I found the mule by advertising it, at Old Windsor just six weeks after—it was the same mule I had lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I received a sovereign, and a mule, and cart from Louisa Jackson, on the 18th of August, to purchase rags, and iron copper, brass, bones, and any thing I could—I was to go about the country—I was in the Borough till about tea time, and then we had to go to a gentleman's house, where we were to be at two o'clock—we went to have a bait at the corner of George-yard, Whitechapel—the man that was working with me said, "Give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I want to go to see a person I know"—he went away, and brought the prisoner up, and I said, "Come, jump, it is time for us to go home"—we went out to buy and sell, and if we bought any thing we had the profit and paid her for the mule and cart—<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Jones was a partner with me in buying and selling—it was a little before four o'clock—the prisoner jumped into the cart, and took the reins out of Aylesbury's hands—I was stopping outside—I never thought that the prisoner was going to take it away,</p>

Did not I meet you at the Seven Stars, with your three comrades, and you said you would treat me to a pot of beer?—we went to George-yard, and sat there two or three hours, and got quite in<lb></lb>toxicated—I came out; some of them said, "Jump up," and I drove away, and the next morning I left the cart in the street, and turned the mule into the field, and sent word to Mrs. Jackson where the mule was. <hi rend="italic">Willness.</hi> He was not drunk—we had not more than three or four pots of beer among seven or eight of us—I dare say we were two hours there—it was a little after two o'clock when we went there, and a little before four o'clock when we came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Waterloo-road, Lambeth. On 1st Jan. the prisoner came to my shop, about half past 4 o'clock, for two ounces of Bermuda arrowroot—he laid down a half crown on the counter before me to pay for it—I did not take notice of the half crown; I only took notice that it was a good one, that is all I know—I served him, and I took the half crown off the counter and put it on the lid of a jar, where there was some small silver, but no half crown—I gave the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he said his mistress told hina it was to be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him it was the best arrowroot, and it was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a lb.—he was talking a good deal, and I had a little suspicion of him—I had put the half crown on the lid of a jar first, but immediately afterwards I dropped it into a drawer, suspecting him—there was nothing in that drawer but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, wrapped in paper—the prisoner said he could not take the arrowroot, and I gave him back the half crown—after I gave him the good half crown back, he hesitated a minute, and said "Well, I don't think I can do any harm by taking it;" and he put out his hand and put a counterfeit half crown in my hand—I put it down directly on the counter, and saw it was bad—I could tell that by its sound when I threw it down—I told him it was bad—he said his mistress gave it him—when I went to look for a policeman, he began to move out of the shop—I followed him—I gave the second half crown to the policeman.</p>

's-worth of silver wrapped up in the drawer—I threw it back on the counter to the prisoner—it might have been a minute before he gave me the other half crown—he did not take up the arrowroot—directly I put the last half crown down, my wife said, "That is bad"—I put my hand on it, and my wife tried it in the money trier, and I tried it myself—the prisoner did</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I recollect the prisoner coming on 1st Jan.—I saw him throw the first half crown down on the counter—I was not watching what my husband did with it, I was watching the prisoner—I saw the half crown given back to the prisoner—Mr. Brooks threw it down on the counter, and it <hi rend="italic">jinked</hi> as money will; it sounded like a good one—some conversation passed between Mr. Brooks and the prisoner about his taking the arrowroot, and after a short time the prisoner fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a half crown, gave it across, and put it in my husband's hand—I said. "That is a bad one;" there was something in the manner of the prisoner that induced me to say so—I put the half crown in the trier—the prisoner came to the trier, and I took it from him—both our hands were on it, and it was bad—Mr. Brooks took it out in his hand, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

            . I am a patrol at Harlington; the prisoner lived at Strandswell, which is eight miles from Harlington. Hearing of the robbery, I told Edwards that the prisoner's cart had been seen out. We got a search-warrant and searched the prisoner's house - We found a sack there which Edwards claimed; we went to his loft and found three sacks of barley-the prisoner was there at the time; he said there was nothing there but his own property.</p>

             M'Donald. I am a constable: about half after ten o'clock, on the 22d of November, as I was on my watch, I met one of the prisoners, who had a great boiler upon his head; the other had a sack, and had some likewise in his hand; the man with the copper threw it down and ran away upon my seizing the other; the copper was picked up within two minutes after; Kirby was the man that had the sack; the other had the copper. I had seen them often before; I knew their persons. I brought Kirby to the watch; I met Lyons; he said he believed he could find out where the other man was gone that had thrown the copper down; we went to a place in Coal-yard, St. Giles's parish, that leads into Drury-lane and Holborn; there I found this Robinson in a house, and the things that are produced in that house where Robinson lodged.</p>
               <p>- Lyons, the constable, confirmed this account.</p>
               <p>A woman, that cleaned the house, deposed, that when she left the house, about three weeks ago, the things mentioned in the indictment were safe in the house.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the matter; I had not the copper upon my head.</p>

               <p>A man threw down the copper and things and asked me to help him to carry them home; as it was near my house I said I would; he was about fifty yards before me.</p>
               <p>He called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was it he asked? A. When I came up, I heard him say, "I have got a tilt in my cart;" he got up and touched it - he did not throw it down; he has been nine years in our employ; he had not quarelled with the other men. I believe many of my men are Catholics - I know nothing of the prisoner having conformed to the Established Church.</p>

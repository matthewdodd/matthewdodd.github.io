               <p>down to the prisoners' house, and found two jackets, a pair of trowsers, and a shirt on the bed of Thomas Jenkins—I was holding them up and asking who they belonged to—I said, "Whose are these?" not particularly addressing him; but he said there was nothing there but what belonged to him; there was nothing there but his clothes—that was after he had got up—he did not say any thing more—he claimed the shoes as his property, and after being questioned, said he had made a mistake.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you take on yourself to say, that his saying it was a mistake, did not apply to the whole of the property, or to the shoes only? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the shoes, because they were shown to him by themselves—I had not searched the bed at the time the shoes were shown to him.</p>

I have known the old man working for Mr. Wingfield about three years—I never heard any thing against him—I really do not think he knew any thing of the robbery—as to receiving them I can say nothing about—he always seemed a very industrious man.</p>

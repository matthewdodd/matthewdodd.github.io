            . I work at upholstery work. I was near Angel-alley, and saw the prisoner and two others standing at the corner of George-yard, about twenty yards from Angel-alley; they passed me all of a sudden, and a little further on, one of them snatched the ridicule from this lady, and ran up the alley. I am sure they were all in company together. The prisoner did not snatch it, but he was in company with them, and was the second that run up the alley; the third stood at the end of the alley, as if to bid defiance to any one who went up - I am certain of the prisoner. I met the officers and described him; he was taken in ten minutes - he was then warm as if he had been running.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker. I saw the prisoner in company with two other men pass us up George-yard in a hurried step, and take the ridicule and run up Angel-alley. The prisoner did not take it, but stood behind ready to receive it, and was in their company, and ran away with the boy. We met the officers, went with them, and saw him taken at the door of the George Inn, George-yard, about 200 yards from the spot.</p>

On the 9th of December, a piece of cheque was taken out of my shop in the evening. I miss'd it the next morning; as she was the only person that had been there that we could suspect, I concluded it was likely she might cut it into pieces, to make away with it, by way of sale, or pawn. At the first pawnbroker I went to, I found 2 yards of my cheque; this was in the same court in which I live: I got a warrant, and took her up. She said, if I would let her go to her room, she would give me the remainder of my cloth: upon which, the justice ordered me and the constable to go and search her lodging. We went; she would not open her door; we took her again to the justice: he committed her to Bridewell on suspicion. On the Monday, we had a search warr ant; we went and found her husband; he admitted us into the room; we told him we had a warrant to search his room: he took out about 4 yards and 3 quarters of cheque, that was hid under the bed. We found at Mr. Siers's shop, a pawnbroker, on Clerkenwell-Green, 7 yards pledged there, for 4 s. 6 d. and at Mr. Warner's, a pawnbroker, in St. John's-street, we found 6 yards: then I had found near 20 yards. Returning home, by Hatton-wall, I saw at

The pieces all correspond, and all circumstances agree; and the prisoner loitered about my shop that night a considerable time; I have no doubt but that they are mine: what were pledged, was in her own name.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Sharp. I shut up the shop about 5 that evening, the piece of cheque was then in the window; about 7, the prisoner came to pledge something; she refused to take the money I proffered to lend her; she still staid in the shop: when a person came into the shop, she said she would take it: I went up stairs, and bid her stay till I came down; then I gave her the money, and she went away. She came in again, in about an hour after, and brought a hat to pledge; I denied taking it in; she went away, and in about a quarter of an hour she brought in a pot of beer, and asked me to drink; I denied it, and would not a good while; but before she went out of the shop, I did drink: she said it was paid for, and went out of the shop. I never miss'd the cheque, till my master miss'd it; there had been no person but she in that place, from the time my master went out; the other person that came in, was in a different place.</p>

               <p>Q. You know Messrs. Longman's and Dickinson's. - Yes, it is of the other side of Ludgate church; he was coming from their warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to Passley, what did he say to Passley. - A. He asked him to take them two reams of paper for him to Goldsmith street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that place. - A. Near the King's printing office near Gough square. Passley asked him if he did not know the way; he said if you do not, if you will go with me and pay me I will shew you. Then they parted from the street and went into Mr. Temple's wine vaults the corner of Fleet street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Randall before. - A. I have seen him come out of Longman's and Dickinson's, I knew he was their porter. They did not remain long in the wine vaults; Randall came out first and Passley almost immediately followed without any reams of paper, he went in again and took out one; he took it down to Mr. Goddard's, wax and tallow chandler; he went into two or three shops first; when he came out of Mr. Goddard's he left the paper behind him. I then followed him up to Harp alley; and then I came up to my stand, I saw him come up to the wine vaults and take out the other ream of paper; he went to Mr. Goddards with it; I saw Mr. Goddard receive the paper and give him some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him join Randall afterwards. - A. No, I did not; then I told the officer what I had seen, and that I would go with him and shew him from where the property was stolen; I went to Mr. Longman's and gave the information, and afterwards I went to Mr. Goddard's shop door, but I did not go in.</p>
               <p>Randall. - Q. Did you see me give the paper to Passley. - A. No, you went into the liquor shop the corner of Fleet market, you had the paper then.</p>
               <p>Passley Q. Did you see me receive the paper from Randall A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the paper to have been stolen then. - A. by his saying take the paper to Goldsmith street, I suspected it.</p>
               <p>Passley. If I had known the paper to have been stolen, I should have concealed it.</p>
               <p>MR. GODDARD. - Mr. Gurney. On Saturday the 30th of April, did the prisoner Passley bring any paper to your house. - A. Yes, two reams of paper. I had seen the prisoner twice before that. He came to me that morning, he asked me if I wanted any paper; I asked him the price, he said twelve shillings, six shillings a ream; I asked him how he came by it, he said he had it by the waggon from the country, it was returned for goods sent; he appeared like a waggoner; I had no suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought you two reams and you paid him twelve shillings. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Shortly after Mr. Ford, Mr. Longman's clerk, came and you gave him the paper. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who said so? - The two men that were in the boat, they both spoke, I told them our orders were to watch the water as well as the land, and, says I, I am afraid it is something clandestine, or you would not land it at this time in the morning; I asked them what it was, and insisted that they should not land any more, they had unloaded about a third, we sent for Calladine and the constable of the night, and they did not know what to do, and one of them went to advise with one of our common councilmen, the boat was detained all the while, and they said they would go on shore and have something to drink, so they went up to the middle of the wharf and laid their heads together and came back and loosened the boat, and rather shoved it off, and one of them took up a scull and said, he wished it was a pistol, he would blow our brains out, they left the wood they had landed on shore, I know Young, he was one of them, I cannot be positive to the other.</p>

               <p>I am another watchman of this ward; on the 18th of October, between two and three, Commander gave me a signal, and when I came up there were two more of our watchmen and him and me, and we went down to Paul's wharf stairs, and there was some wood laid on shore, and there was a good deal of wood in a boat, and the two prisoners were trying to shove the boat on shore, and we asked them what they were about, they said what was it to us, we were watchmen on land and not by water; and I left them there and went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140129"></xptr> fetch the patrol, and when he came he was as ignorant of the affair as ourselves, he sent for the constable; Young was one of the men, and he said the wood belonged to one Mr. Harrison, of Spittalfields, who was coming there with his cart for it; there was a cart drove along Thames-street to the end of Paul's wharf, and some men came down, and Young asked them if Mr. Harrison was coming, and one man said he was, and another man said, what Mr. Harrison? then he said he was coming; that man not knowing the name of Harrison gave us a suspicion, then Young said we will go and get something to drink, and Power came back and followed them, and Young said they may keep the wood and be d - d, it will not fetch them above three shillings, they will not let a man get a shilling, I know both the prisoners, they were both the men that were there; Young took up one of his sculls and said he knew him very well, and he would take the number of his head wherever he met him, and he said, d - n you, I wish this was a pistol, I would blow your brains out, they pushed off their boat, and away they went, and we took the wood to the watch-house, here is some of the wood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wisset. This is sapen-wood, which is worth fifty-eight shillings per hundred, a very small quantity was sold at the sale, being a new article.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long might all this conversation take up? - About an hour.</p>
               <p>What all you watchmen left your stands to hold this conversation, which has been told here in two minutes, and it took up an hour; was you acquainted with Power before? - No, Sir, I was not.</p>
               <p>This was the 18th of October, when did you see Power again? - I think the 11th of last month, it was three weeks and a few days.</p>
               <p>When did you see him the next time? - At the Justice's, at Shadwell, at the bar with Young.</p>
               <p>They told you that he was one of the parties that had been robbing on the Thames? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not Nicholls tell you so? - I do not know Nicholls.</p>
               <p>How happened it, that you are so much more able to swear to this man, than any body else that was there? - I am here to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>What cause of knowledge have you superior to all the rest of your fellows that were there? - I stood and looked at some wood all the time.</p>
               <p>Do you know that this man's life is at stake? - He was dressed in a brown jacket, and a round hat, it did not flap down much, it was up on the sides, it did not hide his ears nor his eyes; I swear to him by taking notice of him, and when I saw him again, I knew him.</p>
               <p>Had you given any description of him to any body? - No, do not you think I could swear to him as well as I could to Young.</p>
               <p>What reward do the East India Company give upon the conviction of these persons, that are suspected of robbing them? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what reward is to be got, if these men are cast? - I am not a thief catcher.</p>

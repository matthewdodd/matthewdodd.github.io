                  </hi>. On the 25th of September, after Holmes was ap<lb></lb>prehended, I went to a house in Manchester-square—(On that Sunday morning) Crane came to the door—I asked I fa person named Crane lived there—she said that was her name—I went and called the officers, whom I had left round the corner, into the hall—they told her they must searched her boxes, as they suspected she had something not her own—she said, "No such thing, you shall not do it"—we told her she had better submit quietly, or we should do it whether she would or not—we went down to the room where she said she slept occasionally, and we asked which boxes belonged to her—she pointed out two, and said they were hers—we searched them, but found nothing relating to this charge—there was a third box—we asked who it belonged to—she said a fellow-servant, and she would go and fetch her down stairs—she went out—one of the officers followed her—I remained in the room—the officer returned accompanied by a female servant and the prisoner—I told the other females not to own that box unless it was really her own—at first she said it was her box—that was before I gave her the caution—she then said Crane had told her</p>

               <p>to own it—Crane was present—the girl who came down fainted, and Crane assistant her—Crane said the box was hers about the time the girl was fainting—I then examined the third box—it was locked—we opened it with a key which Crane gave to the other girl—I did not see that—I do not know that the other girl said where she got the key from—she had given me the key before she fainted, when she came down and said it was her box—I found in that box the articles stated.</p>

                  </hi>. In September last I was in the service of Sir Hugh Munro, in Manchester-square, as parlour maid, and am still in the service—Crane was there as Cook—on the day on which the officers came there I was up stairs—the prisoner came to me in the bed-room—she said the constables were below, for things that had been stolen, and she had a box on the table with some things in it, she did not know what they were, but she wished me to own it—I told her I could not own it, and she begged me then to unlock it for her—she had a bunch of keys in her hand—she showed me the key that would undo the box, and in coming down I missed the key—I did not know it when I came down—I did not speak to her, but she put the keys into my hand—when I got into the room I found a box on the table—it was not mine—I had not a thing in the room—it was hers—I saw her bring it there about a fortnight before—I have seen Holmes at Sir Hugh Munro's two or three times—I saw him there the day before this search took place, in the evening—I was not when he came, but he used to come to see Crane.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 42, King-street, Spitalfields, and am a chair-maker. My wife is a velvet weaver—I have a lad of the name of Beacham in my employ as errand-boy—on Saturday, the 3rd of February, I gave him some silk velvet, worth 30/., in a large green box—he was to take it to Mr. Morrison, in Fore-street—I started him about ten minutes after eight o'clock in the morning—I never saw him again till he came home a little before two o'clock, and said he had lost the box—there was a leathern strap round it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed by Mr. Wisbey—on Saturday morning, the 3rd of February, I remember being sent with a box to Mr. Morrison, in Fore-street—a tall man met me, and asked me if I was not Mr. Wisbey's boy—he said he wanted to take the box to Brook-street, and I would not let him have it—all the way along he said he wanted to take it to Brook-street—he told me to run all the way back and tell my mis<lb></lb>tress to get some ribbons—I went with the man as far as Smithfield, and then he gave me three parts of a quartern of gin—he then went into Hol<lb></lb>born, and had a pint of porter—I had part of that—I sat down in a house—we stopped there a good bit—he wanted me to run out and fetch a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, but I would not stir—he then went out himself—he was gone a good bit,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260210"></xptr>
               <p>—he might have been half an hour—he then came back, and had left his coat somewhere—he had a large coat on when he went out—he said he had left his coat over the way—he waited outside the door, and said he was waiting for a person—while we were waiting there the prisoner came up-after a little while he asked me if I was cold—before that, he asked the tall man how trade got on—then they went a little farther, and we all three went into a public-house, but before they went in, the tall man paid the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we then all three went into a public-house in Holborn-we had some rum there—they gave me two glasses—when I got into the street after taking the rum, I felt very bad, and we all three went to another public-house, which is Mr. Pike's, in Clerkenwell—I had got the box, but the tall man carried it a little way—when we got to Mr. Pike's, we went into the tap-room, and I put my box under the bench, and after a little while, the tall man put it on the bench—the prisoner went away as soon as we went in—I did not see him again—I fell asleep, and when I awoke I went to the bar to the landlady—my box was then gone—I have been very ill ever since—I ran all the way home—I did not know the way, but I asked people.</p>

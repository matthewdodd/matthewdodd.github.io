            . I am constable: I found the two pieces of serge in the street while the last witness was pursuing the prisoner, they were in the great coat, and the prisoner's dog stood by them. I heard the prisoner say before the Justice, he took the goods mentioned out of the ware-house of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030008"></xptr> Mr. Day, and had given two pieces to a woman; but said, he would not say any more, and would rather suffer himself than bring any others in.</p>

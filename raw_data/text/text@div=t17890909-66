            ; on the 16th of July, I left my parlour about a quarter before five, as near as I can guess; I went up stairs and fastened my back parlour door; and fastened my window; I came out at my fore parlour door, and locked it; I went up stairs; my house is a common lodging house; I came down between five and six; I stopped no longer up stairs than while I drank a cup of tea; as I turned on my stairs, I saw my back parlour door open, which I had bolted; I was surprised at it; and I then saw the prisoner come out of my back parlour door, which was open; the back parlour door opened into the passage; I was half way down the one pair of stairs; I asked the prisoner what he wanted, and who he wanted; he made me some answer; I cannot say what: and as he ran along the passage, I heard the spoons rattle in his pocket; and I pursued him; and never lost sight of him till he was taken; I had my left hand on his face, and my right hand on his left hand pocket; I pursued him about two hundred yards; I never saw him before; my pint mug, and all the other things, were in his left hand pocket; I saw them taken out; they are here.</p>

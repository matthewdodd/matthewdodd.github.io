                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Sarah Avila, a pawnbroker, who lives in Mile-end-road. The prisoner Barrow was in her serviceon the 16th of May I searched in his trowsers pocket, and found this letter which is in his handwriting—I went, in consequence of that, with Low and Hunt, to the residence of the prisoners Ruffs, in Wellington-place, Stepney, about three quarters of a mile from my mistress's—they keep a toy shop—we arrived there about a quarter after three o'clock—we found both Henry and Robert Ruff in a little parlour behind the shop—I went in first, and said to them, "You are the very men we want"—they said, "What do you want us for, William?"—I said, "You must know what we want you for"—the officers then came in—we proceeded to search the back parlour, and among other things we found this dagger, these five wine<lb></lb>glasses, and the other articles stated—this dagger I can positively swear to—it was the private property of Mr. Samuel Avila, who died on the 16th of March—since then it has been my mistress's property—we had missed articles similar to these other things from the shop—they had been pledged there—the prisoners were then taken into custody—when I found this letter in Barrow's pocket, I took it to Mrs. Avila, and then went for a con<lb></lb>stable—he went into the parlour first, and then I called Barrow in—I told him I had found this paper in his pocket, and asked him what it all meant—he said, "I will tell you all about it"—I then commenced reading is to him, and asked him who these Ruffs were—he said they were two brothers, and he seemed very anxious to have them taken into custody—he gave me a list of the articles that had been taken, and I wrote down the list as he stated it—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—"Mr. Henry Ruff,—I wish to see you on Sunday morning particularly, when I go for the milk, at seven or a quarter past seven o'clock—my father is coming to meet me, and I cannot come to year house in the morning—I will be sure to come in the afternoon—I have five wine-glasses, and one pair of glass salts, which were in for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—bring me half-a-crown in the morning—I hope you will be sure and come at that time, or else I shall be found out.

               <p>GEORGE KEMP. I am a constable - I was in Old-street-road last Saturday, and saw the two prisoners and another one with them standing by Tyler's shop window, as if looking in at the window - they left for a few minutes, and walked towards the Curtain-road; and I then saw Holding and the other two cross the road, and observed something under his jacket - I laid hold of him, the others ran away - I took these three pocket-books from under Holding's jacket - he said, "I did not take them from the window; those boys took them and gave them to me" - I searched him and found these eleven pencils on him - I knew who the other two boys were - Roworth was one of them, I am quite certain, and as I took him to the office, he told me they went to sell the flutes, but could not sell them, and chucked them away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020008"></xptr>in Curtain-road - I had cautioned him not to say anything- there were two flutes lost.</p>
               <p>Holding. He made me take him and show him where the shop was.</p>
               <p>KEMP. I did not, I took him directly to the shop.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHEPHERD. I apprehended Roworth - I told him that I took him for something in Old-street - he said he had not been with any boys, nor had he been in Old-street- I took him to the station-house, and saw the prisoners together at the police-office - I neither threatened nor made them any promise - Roworth said, "The other two boys have got away; I had none of the property, but I picked the putty from the glass."</p>

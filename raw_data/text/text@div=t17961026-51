               <p>THOMAS GREEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a brewer; upon entering the tun-room, I heard a person in the adjoining store-house, moving about, and I found Dunn in a dark part of the store-house, I enquired his business, and he told me, that he was assisting the tun-men, placing the barrels; there were no barrels for him to place, as the business was already done; I looked about and found these keys, which I had heard him, upon entering the store-house, let fall; I consequently took them, and bringing them to the light, I found they were the keys of the lobby and iron-house; I took them to the counting-house to Mr. Sweet, and told him I had discovered the means by which his money went, and immediately went into the yard and called the prisoner, charged him with having taken the keys, and insisted upon his appearing before Mr. Pearce to clear up the matter, and I took him to the counting-house to Mr. Pearce, where I left him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You heard the keys fall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not make any great noise, but such as if a man was going along and these keys were lying on the ground, as if he had kicked against them? - A. They were not upon the ground; they fell into a utensil about four feet from the ground, and six inches deep.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after you went in that you heard it? - A. As I entered the store-house.</p>

               <p>I was in the counting-house with the younger Mr. Pearce, when he acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to induce him to confess it? - A. Mr. Pearce told him, after the constable came, he could not-do any thing in it, but it would be better for him to confess it before he came; and I saw him pull out of his breeches pocket a five shilling paper of halfpence, (produces it.)</p>
               <p>Sweet. This is one of the papers that I had marked; the piece sits in, and the number too; I swear this is one of the papers I marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay your workmen some halfpence and some silver? - A. Yes; according as their pay is; I used to pay them about seven shillings in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no great wonder therefore that any man should have five shilling or six shillings worth of halfpence? - A. No; but it was odd he should have those that had never been in circulation; it was marked by me for the purpose of detection.</p>

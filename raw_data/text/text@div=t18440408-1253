               <p>this year, and two days before Frederick Shaw was taken—I was standing at my door—James Shaw came to me—he said, "I have had a few words with my father," and asked me if I would come and help him carry some things—he took me up into his bed-room—took out some gas pipes, a brass lamp, and a blue bag, and we took them to Mercer-street, Long-acre—we came out—had a drop of drink, and I left him—it was between twelve and one o'clock in the day.</p>

I am a brush-maker, and live in York place, Somers-town—I was in Mr. Shaw's shop on the 3rd of Feb.—Radford came in and brought a bundle—he said he had got a job lot of brushes and Dutch leaf—he asked James Shaw if he would purchase them—he said "No, but I will take them to one of my father's customers in the evening after I have done work"—I heard nothing said about a price—I left Radford there—I saw the brushes and the Dutch metal opened, but I did not minutely examine them—I waited there to see the elder Mr. Shaw and came away.</p>

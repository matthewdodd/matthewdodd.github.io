            , lives in the house, and is in business with him. I don't know whether it is the house of the firm, or not - I don't know how the rent and taxes are paid - on Wednesday afternoon, the 1st of May, I was going towards the door, when a gentleman told me that three men had cut our window, and gone up Sun-street; I pursued, and saw a person who I thought had got the property; I went on to a second person, and he called to the prisoner,"Run it;" the prisoner then ran down Peter-street, and I pursued him; he turned into Dunning's-alley, which I suppose he thought was a thoroughfare, but it was not; and I came up to him and seized him; I kept him till I got assistance - we threw him on the ground, and while he was there he raised himself and turned from his pocket this pair of pistols, which are my employer's property - we got to the shop, and I found a pane of glass had been cut, and piece of glass had been pushed in - these pistols and salt holders had been within reach of that place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Was it the window in Crown-street which had been cut? A. No, the side window in Long-alley; there is no shutter at the back of that window - I had my attention called to that window within twenty minutes, I know it was secure, and at that time I saw this property safe - our private mark is on this pair of pistols, it is Mr. Attenbrough, Seniors mark; I had them in my hand, and have cleaned them several times - the prisoner had got about forty yards from the shop, when he turned the corner; he was about twenty yards before me - it was rather dusky - there were not more than three or four persons round the prisoner when he dropped them; he scuffled with me, but I picked up this pair of pistols while we were scuffling; three of us could scarcely hold him; the scuffle lasted twenty minutes, but the pistols fell from him in two minutes - another of these pistols afterwards dropped, which I took up, but I did not see it drop from him.</p>

            . I live in Elder-street, and am a carpenter. I was passing Crown-street on the evening in question, I saw a gentleman go into the prosecutor's shop, and give information that some persons had cut the window and robbed them - I saw the witness in hold of the prisoner, who knocked him down almost, and began to fight - I saw the prisoner pull the pistols out of his right-hand pocket, and throw them close to my toes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear that he took them out? A. Yes, Sir; I was close to him, and he kicked me- five or six persons had hold of him, and there were other persons came round; there might be eight or ten persons - he was on the ground when he took the pistols from his pocket - the witness took three of the pistols; another pistol and the salts then came from the prisoner's pocket; I took up these salts, and another man took up the odd pistol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never had the salts; I plead guilty to receiving one pair of pistols, but I did not have the others; I did not break the window - there were above thirty persons round us when the officer came up, I was under a cart, with seven on the top of me.</p>

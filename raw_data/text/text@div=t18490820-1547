                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Kalloway; we keep the Golden Fleece tavern, in Queen-street. The prisoner was our waiter—in consequence of suspicion I put four marked sovereigns in a bowl on 26th July—the prisoner soon after came into the room where I had placed them—I missed one of them—a sovereign has been found, which is one of those I marked.</p>

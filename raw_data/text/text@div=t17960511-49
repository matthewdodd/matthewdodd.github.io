               <p>SHERLAND HILL SWANSTON sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am the son of the last witness; by direction of my father, I marked five guineas, on the 15th of February, by a dent on the reverse side, not the head side, about ten minutes before the prisoner came, I saw the five guineas in the desk, the key of the desk was given to me, and I waited in the counting-house till the prisoner rang the bell, till which time nobody was in the room but myself; I concealed myself as soon as the prisoner was left in the hall; while the servant was gone down stairs, I saw him cross the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the way to your father whom he was to shave? - A. No, quite out of the way; where I was I could not see the desk, but I saw him within a foot of it, and passing towards it; I heard the desk unlock, the lock snapped so loud that it was heard up two pair of stairs, I heard money chink, and the desk locked again; I saw the prisoner return from the desk at the same distance that I saw him going to it, and he then went up stairs where my father was waiting to be shaved; I came from the place where I was concealed, and opened the desk, I found a guinea was missing out of the five; I had my father called down stairs, and informed him of it; a constable, and another person in the house, were called up stairs, and I went up with them; the prisoner was searched by the constable, by the direction of my father, in my presence; a kind of skeleton key was found upon him, and one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110112"></xptr>of the guineas which I had seen in the desk that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to swear that was one of the marked guineas that you put into the bureau? - A. Yes; the mark was upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. When this was taken from him, did the prisoner say or do any thing? - A. He at first denied it, till he found the money was marked; I said, that I knew that to be the guinea; then he entreated to be dismissed; he said, he would go down upon his knees a thousand times if my father would not give him in charge to the constable; my father did give him in charge, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt, when you saw it, that it was one of the guineas? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say no person had been in this room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time you left the room and the time of ringing the bell? - A. It was instantaneous.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after you had charged the prisoner, and was going to deliver him over to the constable, that he offered to go upon his knees? - A. No; he denied it at first; and when he found the guinea was identified, he begged not to be delivered over to the constable.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in waiting at Mr. Swanston's, I was called up stairs; Mr. Swanston, the elder, was saying to the prisoner, "Joe, you have broke open my desk, and robbed me;" which he absolutely denied; however, they told me to search him; I searched him, and in his waistcoat-pocket, I found a guinea, which Mr. Swanston, junior, immediately knew to he his; in another of his pockets, I found a guinea, a shilling, a sixpence, and a key. I was as much agitated at that time as he was himself; then I found, under his watch in his fob, this key, (producing a pick-lock key). it opened all the four desks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say or do any thing after that? - A. No; he begged for mercy, but made no kind of resistance; he behaved as well as a man could do in his situation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sherland Hill Swanston. This is one of the guineas that I marked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You describe it as a dent? - A. Yes; a hole done with the point of a pocket knife, but not smoothed.</p>
               <p>Q. You have, perhaps, marked guineas before in that sort of way? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You marked five at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The key I certainly confess I had about me; I got the key upon Tower-hill, to open a box that I had lost the key of, I gave ninepence for it; and as to trying Mr. Swanston's desk I did not; I had two guineas about me, one of which he thought proper to own; if he had examined the other guinea, I dare say that would have been marked as much as the other.(The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him an excellent character).</p>

            . I am one of the constables of Tower-ward; on the 5th of last month, about nine in the evening, a person came and told me they had detected a person with some sugar in the warehouses. I went; the prisoner and sugar were delivered into my care; I carried him to a public-house, he said it was sweepings; there are nine pounds of it (produced in court) some he said was given him by a mate of a ship that lay near London-bridge; I went and haled the ship, the mate came on shore, he declared he gave no such person any sugar; I looked into the handkerchief, and found it all to be very good Barbadoes sugar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went on board a ship to see two shipmates; coming from thence, they called. Who will work? I had a handkerchief of sugar, I went and put it down on the kay; they said I stole it; I said I would take them to the man that I got it of; they would not go, but took me to a public-house, and said I must down on my knees and beg pardon, or go to goal that night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Austin. Did he ask you to go with him to any person.</p>
               <p>Austin. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire him to go on his knees and ask pardon.</p>
               <p>Austin. No, I did not.</p>

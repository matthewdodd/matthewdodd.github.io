On the morning of the 15th of May we missed this lead off the privy in the back garden - I saw it safe two days before. I was awoke about a quarter past four o'clock in the morning by a female servant, who said somebody was stealing it - it was daybreak. I got up; we searched the garden, and found three pieces of lead - one piece in the garden, one on the parapet, and another in the next garden, they were rolled up. I left the watchman in the garden and went up stairs for my stockings. I looked out of window, and saw a man going over three garden walls into Mrs. Hoffman's garden, he had a long coat and a hat on. I saw him in custody before five o'clock that morning. The watchman brought him out of Southampton-mews. By getting over the walls he might drop into that mews. He had the same kind of a coat on as the man I saw get over the walls.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Hoffman, of No. 57, Russell-square. About three o'clock in the morning I got up, went to the window, and saw a man at the corner of Mrs. Fraile's garden, he was stooping. I opened the window, he tried to conceal himself behind the trees. In a few minutes I heard a noise like a hinge or something knocking, which alarmed me. I called the watchman, he sprang his rattle, and another came. I saw him get over Mrs. Fraile's wall and seven other walls, the last of which led into the back of Bedford-place and Bloomsbury-square, he could then get into the mews. He had a bottle-green loose great-coat on. I saw a man jump from a house at the corner of the mews, and run along the mews about three-quarters of an hour after. I watched him getting over the walls till that time.</p>

            . I am footman at No. 59, Russell-square. I was awoke a little before four o'clock by the watchman's rattle. I looked out of the window, and the watchman asked me if any man was in the gardens? I then saw a man going out of the gardens over several walls; he had a dark loose great coat on. I had a side view of his face, and can swear the prisoner is the man. It was quite light. I and the watchman went into every garden in Bedford-place till we came to Bloomsbury-square, I then saw him at the top of the stables in Southampton-mews, sitting behind a chimney. I called to him, he came towards me, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is no use making a resistance." As soon as he came to the parapet wall, which is twenty feet high, he jumped down and the watchman took him at the end of the mews. I am quite sure he is the man - I had a full view of his face.</p>
               <p>JOHN SIMMONDS. I am a watchman of Russell-square. About a quarter past four o'clock in the morning Oakley alarmed me; I placed watchmen in different directions, and went round myself to the mews, hearing he was coming that way, and stopped him - he had a loose brown great coat on.</p>

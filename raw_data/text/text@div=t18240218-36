Bank note, seven sovereigns, 6 s. and a cheque upon Messrs. Barclay for 10 l. 19 s. to take up a bill which laid there due on that day. When he was gone, I found I had given him 9 d. short, and waited his return, and not coming in a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes. I went to the banker's saw Mr. Smith, and found the bill unpaid. I went to his brother-in-law's, where he lodged, but could not find him; but on the Monday following, I found him at Portsmouth, and asked why he had absconded with the money, if I had used him ill; he said voluntarily that I was a very good master; he could say nothing for himself, and was very sorry for what he had done - the 10 l. note was stopped at the Bank. I found a boy in town whom I understood he was acquainted with - he behaved well. I believe it to be his first offence.</p>

               <p>AUGUSTINE GAVILLER. I live at Lower Clapton - on the 20th of January I was in <placeName id="t18340220-82-crimeloc483">Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. I was looking for my father - I saw the gentleman's handkerchief on the road, took it up, walked towards the gentleman, and said, "Sir, is this your handkerchief?" - he collared me immediately.</p>
               <p>Witness. He did not say a word of the kind - I know it was in my pocket five minutes before - there was another one with him, I believe, but I cannot be certain he was in his company.</p>

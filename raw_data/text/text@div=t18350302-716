                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Crown Life Insu<lb></lb>rance Society, and reside at No. 33, New Bridge-street, St. Ann, Black-friars. I came to town on Sunday, the 15th of February, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and found somebody had entered the house—my dressing-case was broken open, in the front bed-room, on the third floor—several drawers were also open, and the contents of the dressing-case taken away, and the case itself thrown under the bed—there were marks of a knife or sharp-pointed file, which I picked up in the room—a closet in another bed-room on the same floor was broken open—the draw<lb></lb>ing-room was entered, and a cabinet of minerals opened, and several things taken away—the silk of the piano-forte cut off, and some wearing apparel taken away—I saw the print of a foot on the floor of the front attic, from the window to the door—I saw marks along the leads of the house—my opi<lb></lb>nion was, that the thieves had entered that way—I have made inquiry, and rather think one window had been left open at eight o'clock at night—the amount of the property taken was from 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner is a stranger—he had no right on my premises—I thought I knew his coun<lb></lb>tenance when I first saw him.</p>

On Saturday night, a little before eight o'clock, I was going out at the street door, and saw something dark in one corner of the ground-floor passage—I called my mother two or three times, and then I saw it move—I screamed out, ran into the street, and shut the street-door after me—I had the door open when I saw it—what I saw was down in the passage, by the stair-case, not near the door—I rang the bell—my mother came with a light to open the door, and saw two bundles on the mat, which did not belong to us—I then went for my father, who came home—he and the officer brought the prisoner from the cellar, as soon as my father came home—he was quite a stranger to us.</p>

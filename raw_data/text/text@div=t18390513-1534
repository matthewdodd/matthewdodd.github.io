                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's niece. On the night of the 16th of April I was in the kitchen, and I heard a great scuffling in the shop, and afterwards three very loud kicks at the door, which aroused me—I opened the window, got into the area, and called "Murder"—two officers came to me—I told them they were murdering my uncle, and to break the door open, or he would be gone—they broke it open, and when they came into the house I went up stairs—I found them helping my uncle, who was in a state of insensibility, bleeding at his nose and mouth—I afterwards went to sit on a chair in the shop, and found a large hammer which did not belong to the shop—I had never seen it before—the prisoner was there at the time—I asked, in his presence, who owned it, but no one owned it—nobody had left the house—my uncle came to his senses at last, when they got him into the parlour—the prisoner was in the parlour—somebody asked my uncle what had happened—the prisoner stood before me—my uncle said, "Oh, that Jones," and then related what he had done to him—he said he had stopped his mouth with a handkerchief, and dragged him to the wash-house-door—the prisoner said, "Oh, Mr. Harlcy, don't accuse me of that, it is a serious charge"—he was taken into custody—the officer has</p>

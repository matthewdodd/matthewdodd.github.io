               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing? - Yes, on Monday evening, between eight and nine o'clock. A person came in to look at some stockings, (not the prisoner) and I shewed the person one parcel of stockings out of the window, and he asked for some more, and I was getting this second parcel of stockings out of the window, for the person to look at, and I heard some person, and I saw some person brush against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold those stockings at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person looking at them at the time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brushing against the door of the shop? - No, a door that stood against a side of the counter, a door in the shop, close up to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What short of a door do you mean? - It was a door that belonged to another place, and we had no screen to prevent people from taking any thing out of the window, as they went past, and this door was taken from another place and put there as a screen. After my hearing this bustle against the door, I withdrew towards the window, and I saw a man's back parts, and I called out stop thief! and he flew from the counter with the cloth, and I saw his face as he turned round the counter. With my seeing him take the cloth it rather confused me, and I should have taken him if it had not been for the person I was selling the stockings to, he gave me a push with his hand, when I got over the counter, and if the counter had not been there I should have been down on the floor; I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080141"></xptr>What he meant by giving me that push? he said, sir, I beg your pardon, I did it to secure the thief. I having no assistance in the shop, nor durst not call any in to secure this man, or I should have secured him, and this person who pushed me down he said he was not absolutely a companion of this Hardy's, indeed, he said, he was not, and he hoped I would not secure him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cloth was it he took away? - About twenty yards, as nigh as I can't recollect, worth about four pounds; I laid it in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a round hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure of your man? - I had three patent lamps, and a candle on each counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Look and see whether you see your man? - (pointing to the prisoner) That there is the man, I am perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be in the shop altogether? - He was not above a minute and a half in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the property never been found? - No, never been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray, did you lose nothing else the night the shop was robbed besides the cloth? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. No stockings? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What description did you give your master of me? Did you tell him I was lame in my hand? - No, I did not observe you was lame in your hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give your master any description of his person? - I gave my master the description of the person, that the hat was high crowned and pulled down behind and before, and that he had a great coat, with large white buttons, whether plated or metal, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when your master took him up? - I did not see him till I saw him at Guildhall the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he at Guildhall? - He was in the prisoners box, besides him there was another person in the box, but I cannot say whether it was a prisoner or whether it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him immediately? - I knew him immediately, as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was the constable that was with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know him to be a constable? - No, I did not till I was told.</p>
               <p>Court to Tharratt. Do you mean to be positive? and you must be cautious in swearing to the man; but you must tell the truth; according the best of your knowledge, are you satisfied that he is the man? - I am satisfied he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Why did you take this man up? - I took him up in consequence, when I first saw him go by the door -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him up for the robbery of yourself, or for the act of robbing another, because the boy tells me that he had given you the description of his person? - He had given me a description of his person, but I took him for attempting to break into Mr. Leopard's.</p>
               <p>Court to Tharratt. Had he such a great coat on at Guildhall as when you saw him before? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not take him on Tharratt's description, because he gave me the description subsequent to my taking of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Newgate-street, about half past eight o'clock, this gentleman took me and two others, and said, that I robbed a stationer's shop in Newgate-street; I went back along with him to the stationer's shop, the gentleman said, no, and gave no charge of me; directly he said, no, the prosecutor said I should go for a soldier; and when he found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080142"></xptr>I was lame in my right hand, he said he would send me out of London. The next morning they brought this lad to see whether I was not the lad that robbed the shop eight days before; accordingly he came in, and said I was the man; that he could swear to me by having my hat lopped, and having a great coat on; and and that I was the person that had taken the stockings out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Had you at Guildhall charged this man with taking the stockings out of the window? - No, nothing but the elastic cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the elastic cloth woollen cloth? - It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had witnesses here last session, when the prosecutor moved to put my trial off. I have been in gaol twelve weeks.</p>

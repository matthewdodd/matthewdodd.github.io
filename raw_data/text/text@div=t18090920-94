On the 2nd of August, or thereabouts, I was at my desk, writing; I saw some person reaching into the shop, and taking some books, he took four books into his right hand, I expected him to put them down again, but he walked off, I came down from my desk, I saw him between a kind of a half run and a walk, I called stop thief, and ran after him; when he got into the Old Change, he threw the books out of his hand into a building, where some carpenters were at work near the corner of the Old Change; he continued to run forward, and I pursued him, a gentleman from some warehouse stopped him, I never lost sight of him until I had hold of him myself; I brought him into my shop, and when I came into my shop, I believe the street keeper was there, I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I reside in Paul's chain, I was going home at the time this circumstance happened, there was an alarm of stop thief, I like other people ran; Mr. Simmons came up, when some people stopped me, and supposed I was the thief, no person came forward and said I was the thief, no property was found upon me, now I leave it. I have a wife and five children at home, my wife is very far pregnant; I am very sorry that Mr. Simmons should come here to bring a charge against a man, when no property was found upon me, and nobody saw me.</p>

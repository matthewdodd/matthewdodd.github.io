            . Last Saturday was sev'night between nine and ten at night, I was coming up the Fleet-Market, and about the middle of it I was surrounded by about half a dozen women, who forced me into a house in <placeName id="t17440223-24-crimeloc136">Love's Court</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was not she with you before?</p>
               <p>Cox. She was not one of the women that forced me into bed. They left me with the woman they forced me into bed to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in bed when you went into it?</p>
               <p>Cox. Yes, there was. The Prisoner came up into the room and took my breeches from under the bolster, and took six-pence, a knife, and some papers out of my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you had in your breeches pocket?</p>
               <p>Cox. When I went in I had eighteen pence, (they brought up liquor, and said I must pay for it;) that was all I had then. The Prisoner had given my waistcoat away to another woman before, and she had my breeches in her hand: She said, if I would not give her my handkerchief, and the buttons out of my sleeves, she would fetch up half a dozen who were below in the court; I stung my handkerchief to her, and took my breeches out of her hand; then she said she would go and call some people up: I went directly out of the house, got some assistance, came and broke the door open. I found only the woman whom I went to bed to and another in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner is the woman that took the six-pence out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Cox. I am sure she is the woman; she took six-pence, a knife, and a handkerchief, and threatened my life, and she gave my waistcoat to another woman, and it was carried down stairs. I carried the two women before a Magistrate, and he committed them to hard labour, and a man who pretends to be the husband of one of them brought my handkerchief and waistcoat; the Alderman told him, if he did not give a good account how he came by those things, he would send him to Newgate. The man said he would produce the woman who had them; and the Prisoner was taken. I was sent for before the Alderman, I knew the Prisoner, and he committed her to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you were hurried up by 2 dozen women.</p>
               <p>Cox. It was by half a dozen Women.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a market night, and a great many people about?</p>
               <p>Cox. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you call out?</p>
               <p>Cox. I could not, for they stopped my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. When the waistcoat was taken from you, you said you run down stairs, did not you complain to the people in the market about it?</p>
               <p>Cox. No, I went directly to my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go to those people who were nearest you?</p>
               <p>Cox. Because I did not know whether they would be so ready to assist me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge the other two women with abusing and robbing you?</p>
               <p>Cox. Not with robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you order the waistcoat to be pawned for your convenience at that time?</p>
               <p>Cox. I did not.</p>
               <p>- Hebborn, the Constable, said, that last Saturday was sevennight at night Mr. Cox charged him with two Women, and charged them with robbing him, and he sent them to Bridewell.</p>

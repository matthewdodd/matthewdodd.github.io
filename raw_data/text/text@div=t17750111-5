I will have your life or your money. Upon saying this, I struck him with my fist, on the side of his face, and I knocked up his heels. Upon which the smallest of the two prisoners (Banfield) said D - n you, why don't you go it, then they all surrounded me, I struck at, and fought them all, I had not any thing in my hand, nor did I at their first coming up to me, perceive that either of them had any, but afterwards I saw a long knife in Dugard's hand, he aimed a blow at me, which would I believe have stabbed me to the heart, but I received the stab in my hand, which penetrated as far as the bone would admit, he struck at me again and cut my ear, then one of them struck me a violent blow, which broke my head, it bled very much, some of the blood is yet to be seen, in my hat, I secured Dugard, my wife screamed out, and the watch came to my assistance, and then Dugard threw away the knife. The other prisoner was taken almost immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you did or not, begin the conversation with them, and whether, what they did was not in their own defence?</p>
               <p>Bruce. I did not begin with them, and upon my oath, I verily believe they intended to rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>

            . I am a watchman, I saw the two prisoners, in company with two others pass by my watch-house, not a minute before the prosecutor was attacked, I took notice of them then, I heard Mrs. Bruce call out. I rung my rattle and ran to their assistance, I saw Mr. Bruce, at that time he was very bloody, and was almost spent, he had then hold of Dugard, the other prisoner was taken in less than half a minute.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bruce attacked us, without the least provocation, he cut my head, we both dropped our hats, in the scuffle he put mine on instead of his own, and that made his head bloody.</p>

               <p>We did not attempt to rob him, his wife or he blowed a wistle, and had us taken up.</p>

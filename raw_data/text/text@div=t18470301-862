I said "Yes"—I thought it was some kind person who heard I had been robbed, and no sooner had he said that then he made a grasp at my guard, and I hit him in the mouth—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner Williams, but I will not swear to it—I would not swear to him in the morning, but by the appearance, and his having a cut in the mouth—I said, "Who gave you that cut in you mouth?"—he said, "I have had it some time"—I said, "I have got you <hi rend="italic">old chap</hi> "—I did not see what sort of mark I had put upon him—I had not spoken to any one before this women came up to me—from the time I shook hands with my friends, no one stopped me or spoke to me—the policeman has the watch and guard.</p>

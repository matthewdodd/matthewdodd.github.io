On the 20th of June, about three o'clock, I went to clean myself in a room in the one pair of stairs. I tied up my linen for my washerwoman, and put it on a back shelf in that room. A person came into the shop for some books, and when that person went I shut the door after him; then I went into a room to get my boots, and when I came back I found the shop door open; I had left the shop door fast, it fastens with a latch; I then looked for my things, and missed them directly.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Wednesday, the 20th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went into the King's Head public-house, in Threadneedle-street, I saw the prisoner offering a shirt for sale in the tap-room to a customer for five shillings. He had two bundles with him at that time, one was open, and the other tied up. I suspected him. I asked him how he came by that shirt; he said, his captain gave it him. I asked him who his captain was, and what ship, to which I had no answer. I looked over the two bundles, they contained all the articles claimed by Mr. Kelly, and bearing his mark. I searched the prisoner, on him I found the laundress's hooks, with all the articles set down, signed at the bottom

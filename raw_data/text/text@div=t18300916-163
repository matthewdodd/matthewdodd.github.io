On the 6th of July I met Myers and Goff at the Two Angels and Crown, in St. Martin's-lane, between eleven and twelve o'clock, by appointment; I was searched, and supplied with seven shillings and two sixpences by Mr. Goff, in the presence of Myers - I then went to my lodgings in St. Andrew-street, and stopped there till a young man named William came; Myers went to my lodgings with me - my lodging is fifty or sixty yards from where I saw the officers; Myers had not left me before I saw William; I do not know William's surname - he took me to <placeName id="t18300916-163-crimeloc844">West-street</placeName>

            . I am an inspector of the Police - I was then constable. I have known Birt some time; I applied to him to assist me in detecting the prisoner, what he did was by my direction; I applied to him about a fortnight or three weeks before this transaction; on Tuesday, the 6th of July, I was at the Two Angels and Crown at the corner of Upper St. Martin's-lane, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock - Myers and Birt were present; I satisfied myself that Birt had no coin about him - I then gave him seven shillings and two sixpences to make a purchase; he left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160081"></xptr>me, and remained in the parlour of the public-house, but I saw him and the prisoner meet about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock; I saw the prisoner come and wait till Birt came to him - I saw some paper pass from the prisoner to Birt, and something pass from Birt to the prisoner; they remained together about five minutes, or not so long - they then went away to the right; Birt returned in about half an hour - they went out of my sight, but I had directed Myers to follow them; they went in a direction towards Compton-street - when Birt returned, I received sixteen half-crowns from him, these are them; I believe the prisoner was taken on Saturday last - we met on the next day at the public-house to make another purchase, and to endeavour to take the prisoner, but he did not come - Limbrick afterwards took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did not you apprehend me when you saw the money pass? A. Because we meant to take you the next day, when you were to bring a larger quantity; I believe William is about the Court - I do not know why he is not a witness; I do not know that he has been a witness before; he has given me information.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know his surname? A. Yes.</p>

            . On the 6th of July I was at the Two Angels and Crown - what has been stated is correct; when Birt had left the public-house, I followed him to his lodgings, which is at an open shop, and he stood with his hand on the door-post for about five minutes - shortly after William came and took Birt to West-street; I was on the other side of the way - I then went to the parlour of the Two Angels and Crown, where I had a full sight of Birt and the prisoner; I had not lost sight of Birt before he saw the prisoner - they were just in the act of joining when I went into the parlour; Birt and the prisoner had some words together - the prisoner put his hand into his right-hand pocket and pulled out a small parcel, and a paper fell from it; Birt took the parcel and gave the prisoner something - they then went to a public-house in Compton-street; I followed them in, went to the bar, and had something to drink, that I might have a view of them - Birt then came out, and went to the Two Angels and Crown; I followed, and saw him give Goff the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was no money found on me, good, bad, or indifferent; it is very evident that these people will swear any thing; the reason William is not brought forward is because he cannot show his head in this Court.</p>

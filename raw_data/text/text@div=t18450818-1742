                  </hi>. I am a smith—I live opposite the gas-works at Old Ford. On Saturday night, the 10th of Aug., I was at the Dog and Part-ridge, at Bow—I came out there a few minutes before twelve o'clock—on my road home with some friends we had a little conversation—I walked a few yards past my own door, and we stood talking about some working affairs—a stone was thrown, as we supposed, from a window opposite, and it struck a young man named Kingdom on the back of his head—Bristow was not there then—we then had to retreat from a party who interrupted us with sticks, &amp;c.—we ran towards the railway arch at Old Ford—we waited there a few minutes—Bristow then came up to us in his way home—we stood at the corner of the street he was living at—Carroll had been with the party before—I do not know whether he was there at that time—I went back to go home, and we had to go past the house where the disturbance took place, and Carroll was walking in a kind of concealment, with the poker under his coat—Thomas Smith, who had been struck previous to that, in passing along by himself, hallooed out, "There is the man that struck me"—I did not hear Bristow say anything—I was then about four-teen or fifteen yards from the door of the house, and the prisoner was about ten yards—he was near enough to hear Smith say, "That is the man that struck me"—as soon as he heard Smith say that he went to the door, and rapped twice with the head of the poker—by that time Bristow</p>

               <p>had got a few yards past the house—I was perpendicularly opposite—Carroll seized Bristow by the collar, and struck him with the poker by the side of the head—in consequence of that Bristow fell—the rest of the Irish party then chased me and those who were with me, and we ran back again to the railway arch—we missed Bristow, and did not see him for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, when he was coming back with two police<lb></lb>men—he had been to the station-house—I am sure the prisoner is the man who struck him with the poker—he had not spoken to the prisoner, or to nny of them—he was smoking his pipe, and when he was struck the pipe fell, and the lighted ashes made the light more brilliant—the pipe fell before Bristow did.</p>

               <p>I saw the deceased about a quarter past five in the morning—he was suf<lb></lb>fering from the effects of concussion of the brain—I found two wounds on his head, and from their external appearance, I should say the wound over the right temporal muscle caused his death—he died about three hours after I saw him—it was his body that Mr. Garman afterwards saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did you see him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At his own house—he had been bleeding, but not very much—the blood was stopped when I saw him, and I should say it had been for two or three hours—he died about eight o'clock in the morning—when a person is in a state of coma, as he was when I saw him, the pulse is very low—it would not be right to bleed him then—a man is as if he were asleep—had he been bled at first, it would probably have reduced the circulation—one of the wounds was not more than a quarter of an inch long—the one over the temple was large.</p>

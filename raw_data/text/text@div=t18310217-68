I stood about two hundred yards off to watch the premises - I saw the prisoner go in; I went nearer the door, and saw him come out - I said I must search him; I felt down him, but did not feel any thing - he said he had come from the Coach and Horses to look for a job; I said I would go there with him - in going along I felt this saw by his side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How do you know it had been there? A. I saw my partner using it just before he went to dinner - there was no one left in the house - about four persons had been employed there.</p>
               <p>EMANuEL BARLEY HEATH. This is my saw. I had been using it at that house, which is undergoing a thorough repair - I left it there when I went to dinner, and to the best of my belief, I left it on the bench.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you know whether you did or not? A. To the best of my recollection it was on the bench.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness asked me what business I had at the work - I said I was a painter, and had not been at that house, but to a house in the Strand to ask for work, and in coming back I had seen the saw lay and took it up - he took me to the Coach and Horses, in going along I gave him the saw - when the prosecutor appeared at the office he said he would not prosecute, but the Magistrate said he must.</p>

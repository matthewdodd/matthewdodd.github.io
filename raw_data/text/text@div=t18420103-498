About the middle of November the prisoner, Ann Gifford, (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 390,) came to me for a situation—we agreed on the wages—she gave me a reference to a lady, at No. 45, North<lb></lb>ampton-square, Clerkenwell—it was at eleven o'clock precisely when she left my house, and I appointed to see her again at the lady's house, where I was going for her reference—she was to was there till I went and received her answer, on my ascertaining the truth of the reference—I went, but found no such place in Northampton-square, as she referred me to—there are but thirty-six houses in the square—I found no such person as the lady she referred me to—I returned home about half-past four, and missed my husband's silver watch from the drawing-room mantel-piece, and nice spoons, out of the plate-basket in the kitchen—they were safe when I left the house—I had given the spoons to the servant to clean, and they were placed on the kitchen dresser—I saw the watch safe on the drawing-room mantelpiece.</p>

               <p>my mistress had gone out—I went to the door and said my mistress was not at home—she said she had seen my mistress in the court, and she had told her she was to come and wait till she came back, and that she was to go into the same room as she was in in the morning—believing what she said, I showed her into the drawing-room, which was the room she had been in before—in about a quarter of an hour she came down into the kitchen to me, and said she could not wait any longer, for she should be too late for the train, and if she was too late for the train she would call again in the evening—I did not miss the spoons till after my mistress missed the watch—I had seen them safe when I was in the kitchen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the G division. I appre<lb></lb>hended the male prisoner, on the 10th of December, in Aske-street, Hoxton—I searched him at the station, and found in his trowsers-pocket a sovereign, a shilling, a sixpence, three halfpence, and a farthing—I was proceeding to search his fob, when he said, "You will find nothing there but the ticket of a watch which was my father's, some tickets of some tools, and a watch-guard"—I found the ticket of the watch, which led me to Mr. Pickford's, where I found it—the male prisoner lives at No. 41, Aske-street—I have seen him in company with the female prisoner at their lodgings—he said she was his wife.</p>

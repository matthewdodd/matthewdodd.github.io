            . I am in Mr. Alger's employ. The two prisoners came to the door on the 6th of December - Rush took these boots, which stood on the floor, within the door - he could just reach them by putting his foot on the step; I was near the window, behind the counter: I ran round the counter, and followed Rush down the street- he ran on, and Bentley followed him; I passed Bentley, intending to take Rush: Bentley took hold of my clothes- I fell down, and he too; I kept him down till I got assistance, and when I came back to the shop I found Rush there, and the boots also. I should have passed Bentley, and taken Rush with the boots, if Bentley had not laid hold of me.</p>

I was on Ludgate-street, between nine and ten o'clock on the 6th of December,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060099"></xptr>and saw three persons running; Rush was first with a pair of boots in his hand - Bentley and Hockley were following him: I stopped to see if Rush was taken, and saw Bentley and Hockley fall down - I pursued, and took Rush, with the boots, just turning into the Old Bailey, and took him back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BENTLEY. Q. Did you not say in the shop,"I am a poor man - this will make a very good thing for me?" A. I did not; my own employ suits me much better than this.</p>

               <p>Q. You are not a married man I hope?</p>
               <p>Pruant. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed with them?</p>
               <p>Pruant. Between nine and ten o'clock on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Pruant. Not very sober; a little time after I had been in bed they took three guineas and a half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had that money?</p>
               <p>Pruant. I gave a shilling for the bed, and then I saw the money; it was in a purse; I staid there all night, but they went away and left me by myself; I went to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this woman in the house at the same time? she was not in bed I hope?</p>
               <p>Pruant. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Only these two?</p>
               <p>Pruant. Only one was in bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Fagan?</p>
               <p>Pruant. That young woman; the other two were at the fire; the woman (Fagan) took me from the Swan just by there; the other two women I found in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. She had been drinking there?</p>
               <p>Pruant. I went to have a mug of beer there and saw her; I missed it about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they gone then?</p>
               <p>Pruant. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lie there then?</p>
               <p>Pruant. My breeches were gone; the old woman brought them; she got a light and got them from the bedside.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she bring the breeches?</p>
               <p>Pruant. About twelve at night I believe.</p>

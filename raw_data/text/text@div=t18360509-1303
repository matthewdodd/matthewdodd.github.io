                  </hi>, I live in King-street, Tower-hill. I am a headbo<lb></lb>rough—on Tuesday, the 3rd of May. I was in Brick-lane, between four and five o'clock—I saw a cart with the name of Dale on it—there ap<lb></lb>peared to he two hogsheads of sugar in it; and at the tail was a bag about three parts full of what turned out to be sugar—the prisoner Reeves went to the tail of the cart, accompanied by Waterman—took the mouth of this bag over his left shoulder, and Waterman lifted it on his back; waterman then drove the cart on towards Spitalfields-church—Reeves went down Thrawl-street, and I followed him, with this bag of sugar on his back—he went into the private door of a coal-shed in Thrawl-street—I watched at the corner, and never lost sight of the house till a policeman, No. 118, came up—I told him what had happened, and he went after the cart—I watched the house for upwards of half an hour—dur<lb></lb>ing that time the female prisoner, Mary Ring, came and looked over the hatch of the door, three or four times at me; and likewise a girl that was in the shop came and looked at me—the policeman. No. 118, brought No. 40—I walked across the street to speak to him—the prisoner Reeves then came out of the shop, and ran down Thrawl-street—I called out, "That is the man, stop thief"—he followed him to the bottom—Evans and I returned to the house—the female prisoner refused to let the policeman enter, and wanted to know where his authority was—I said, "The man's coat is autho<lb></lb>rity enough, go in"—she was like a termagant—we took her to the Spital<lb></lb>fields station, and left Birch in possession of the house—we then returned, got a truck, and took the sugar away—I went the next morning over to Mr. Dale's yard, and there I saw Waterman—I said, "This is the carman who was with your cart yesterday"—Dale desired me to go for a policeman—I said there was no occasion, I would take care of him—I took him, and in going along I said to waterman, "Was not you in Brick-lane, Spitalfields yesterday, with two hogsheads of sugar?"—he said he was—I said, "where did you bring that bag from, that that man had in the cart"—he said he was in Ratcliff Highway, and a man asked him to give him a lift—I told him it was very wring to take any thing from strangers, and said, "Where were you going with those two hogsheads of sugar?"—he said, to take them to Dock—I said, "Who to?"—he said, "Mr. Tokely, I will show you"—we walked down to Dock-head, and went to Mr. Tokely's shop—I saw Mr. Tokely's young man behind the counter—I asked if the young man brought two hogsheads of sugar there yesterday—he said yes, was any thing the matter?—I said, "Nothing particular, but weigh them;—think you will find them 1cwt. short."</p>

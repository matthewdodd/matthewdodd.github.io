               <p>Court. Q. Do you sleep there yourself? - A. Now and then I do; there are three doors, one of them is only secured by a latch; this door is left upon the latch for the man that works in the night to come in and draw himself some beer; on this man we depended, because there is one man up all night all the year through.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing beside this latch to secure that door? - A. Nothing else; it opens outwards; there are three doors, each of them goes with a leaden weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Must any person who came in to get at these cloaths have opened the inner door? - A. Yes; he goes through the manufactory, and then there is another door that he must open to get into the place where the cloaths lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the last person up in these premises? - A. My sons went to bed a little before ten o'clock, by my desire; and I very soon after went to bed; I did not see the place fast that might, I left it to my sons.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the outer door that leads to where the cloaths were the night that this matter took place? - A. Yes, I saw it at ten o'clock; it was shut then.</p>
               <p>Q. Will the door stand open if it is not propped? - A. No, unless it is thrown quite back; that night, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard a noise under where I slept in the laundry, which is about ten yards from where the cloaths were taken from; I got up and came down stairs; when I came down the doors belonging to the laundry were all wide open; there were three of them; they all run with pullies, and I found the ropes tied in knots to prevent their running; the rope of the door that leads up to my bed-room stairs was cut; the outside door was open, and tied with a knot also.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door that goes into the street? - A. It was tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you discovered that any thing had been lost at that time. - A. No; there was a stick found upon the premises, but not by me, it was one of our men.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first discover your loss? - A. About six o'clock; I had not seen the things for a fortnight before.</p>

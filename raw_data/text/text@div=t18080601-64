            , and the prisoner standing together, they stood a little while in conversation; the prisoner then left him and went up the street; my porter came over the way and rung the bell; one of the servants let him in my gates that lead down to the wharf; I keep my oils at the back of my premises; I watched my porter; he opened the gates that lead into the street and went to a stable, which I have nearly opposite, of the other side of the way; while he was there a few minutes, the prisoner came with a basket in his hand and went down the gateway, leading to where my oils are deposited; immediately after Croft, the porter, brought the horse down the gateway; about five minutes after that I observed White go out of the gateway with a basket on his shoulder, and apparently something heavy in it; I immediately went out and followed him up St. Peter's Hill into Old Fish street; I asked him what he had got upon his shoulder; he said nothing of mine; I said I supposed he had got some of my property there; he immediately threw the bottle down with all the force he had upon the curb stones and broke it all to pieces; I tasted and smelt it; the bottle contained rape oil; it was of a similar quality to the oil that I had in the warehouse; it was a five gallon stone bottle. It appeared as if it had been full by the quantity spilled on the ground; it cost me four shillings and three pence a gallon. I secured him; some friends coming up at the time, I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the porter - A. I took him up to Guildhall; Mr. Alderman Combe thought the evidence could not be brought home to him; they were obliged to let him go; I have never seen him since. I asked him how he got the oil; he did not make any answer particular; he did not like to be kept in the street; he desired to be taken into a public house.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the basket was taken into your warehouse was it empty or had it any thing in it. - A. It appeared to be light; he was swinging it in his hand as he was carrying it.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the weight of five gallons of oil - A. About thirty seven pound; with the bottle forty three pound.</p>

            . I am a porter; I work for Mr. Perkins, chemist, Bennett's Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I have seen him; I do not know how he gets his living; I saw him on the morning he was taken, standing at the end of Mr. Vicars' warehouse; I went down their gateway to borrow a truck for my master; I left the prisoner there; he was alone and had nothing with him; I did not see him do any thing.</p>
               <p>- VICARS. I am Mr. Vicars' son; I saw the prisoner talking to our porter in Thames street, a few minutes before seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him when he was talking to your porter - A. No; the gates were then shut; about half after seven o'clock I saw the prisoner come down the gateway with a basket in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be light or heavy - A. He was swinging it about in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any business or employment down your gateway - A. None; there was no business carrying on there but our oil warehouse; in about five minutes he returned again; he had something covered with straw in a basket, which he carried on his shoulder, it appeared to be heavy; I and my father followed; when I laid hold of him we asked him where he got it; he said he did not bring it from our premises; my father said he was sure he did; before he said that, he chucked it upon the curb stones and broke it; it appeared to be a five gallon bottle; we sent for a constable; he stooped down and washed his apron in the channel, which was all over oil; I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. The porter is not here - A. No; we turned him away directly; I tasted the rape oil; it appeared to be of the same quality as the rape oil-in my father's warehouse.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COWARD. I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. Mr. Vicars charged him with stealing a bottle of rape oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any oil in the street at the time you came up - A. Yes, a large quantity on the curb and part of it in the channel. The prisoner said to me, are you to take me; I said, yes; I was very sorry to see him in that situation; I had known him before; I asked him what could induce him to steal it; he said he was employed by a man at the warehouse to carry this bottle of oil to a pitching block at the corner of Fenchurch street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who that man was - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner - A. He was a porter to Messrs. Howell and Atlee, Thames street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent; I was hired by a man to carry it to a pitching block in Fenchurch street; he said he had got another house to go to; he would be there as soon as I was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

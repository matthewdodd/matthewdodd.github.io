            . I am porter to Mr. Crutchfield; I have lived there about two years; the receiver stands in the distill house, I went in to lend them a hand; I saw the prisoner go to my master's warehouse and fetch a sack on his back, between two and three in the afternoon the latter end of May; he went with the sack to the still, turned a rundlet out of the sack, and filled it with spirits of turpentine, as full as it could hold, out of the receiver; he could hardly put the cork in; he called me and asked me to wet a piece of brown paper to put in the bung-hole; I refused, and said I believed it was not right, that he had better put it in the receiver again, and he told me to go about my business: I saw him carry it away out of the gate-way; he returned in about half an hour; I did not know whether he had any right to carry it away; I made enquiry, and when I found he had no right, which was a day or two after, I let my master know of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never say he was the third man and not one of the first - A. Not to my knowledge; he was the last of the two. I never said he was the one who joined them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any particular mark by which you knew him - A. It appeared to me as if he had a coat, and laced half boots - I said I knew him by a dirty apron, and laced boots; he was the shortest of the three, and I swear to his face - they were all three young. I found him at the house next morning, in the same dress as he wore the night before - I said he was the man, I had no doubt; we found some lead melted up at the house - I am sure the wood is part of the frame, as there is one piece that comes out between the holes of the mould; I was near enough to touch them at times - I faced them at the corner of Queen-square; it was dark when I got to Crown-street.</p>

            . I am an Excise officer. The prosecutor was under my survey. I saw the candles at Bow-street, and took four of the prosecutor's candles, and compared them, and have no doubt of them being part of his stock. I have been in that department twenty years. Particular melted tallow would have a particular appearance, smell, and colour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When they have been made a long time, they get the same colour - A. Yes; but I am certain they are not old candles, not three days old - they were not cold when they were found. They corresponded in smell, size, and age.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. HUXTABLE. Q. Had you some new moulds from Seakins - A. He made up one new frame; I lost three frames; they were made by different manufacturers - he had made one of the frames; the maker of the others is dead. Each frame contained twelve candles; they were on the stones cooling.</p>

            . I live at No. 17, Long-acre; I lodge on the second floor, and am a clerk - I am out of employ. I came from Liverpool about eighteen months ago, and have not had any regular employment since. Hollingsworth is landlord of the house. On the 20th of February, last, about two minutes before six o'clock, I was coming down Crown-street, Soho, and a gentleman accosted me, and asked if I had any commands to Liverpool he would take them - I told him No; I did not know his name. He was going to Ireland that way; I had seen him once or twice, only, at two or three inns in London. We stood in conversation in the street, opposite Mr. Martin's door; our conservation lasted upwards of twelve or fourteen minutes, as near as I can recollect, during which time I saw

               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell me the name of any person for whom you have acted as clerk during the eighteen months - A.

             how he did I suppose - A. No; I was standing in conversation. I cannot tell the name of the person, who was in conversation with me; he was going to Ireland by way of Liverpool.</p>
               <p>A. When your friend left you, why not go over and ask how he did - A. It was of no material consequence; it was on a Thursday. I had sold him a few brushes and various kitchen utensils, and a pan or two belonging to the lady, they amounted to about 10 s. in all. He always paid ready money. I sold them within four months. He was never at my lodgings. I told him where I lived, when I lived in Rose-street, Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him at any other time - A. Yes; nine months ago or more, I lived in Rose-street about eight months ago. I have been seven months where I now am, and previous to that I was there. I did not keep company with

               <p>Q. All the articles you have dealt in, only amounted to 10 s. - A. It might be 1 s. more, they did not ask where I lived, after I had told them once; I lived in Rose-street, then, I do not recollect his asking where I lived afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to swear, you told him you lived in Long-acre - A. I think I told Mrs. Martin so, because she was mostly in the shop. I will swear, I told her I lived in Long-acre. I told Mr. Martin where I lived in Rose-street, and think I told Mrs. Martin, I lived in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to, to be a witness - A. Last Friday, Mrs. Martin applied to me. I was going by the house, on the 21st of February, and saw Mrs. Martin, at the door and asked her how she was; she said she was in a little trouble about her son and Mr. Martin; then she related the circumstance to me; this was about noon.</p>
               <p>Q. Noon is twelve o'clock in the day - A. Yes; she told me then, that her son and Mr. Martin were taken up; about noon. I swear that positively; she did not say who had taken them. She said they were taken at her house, at least her son was. I believe Mr. Martin was not taken there.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you at noon, that they were both taken up - A. At noon the following day.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you this on the 21st of February, at noon, that Mr. Martin and his son were both taken up, do you swear that positively - A. I do - she said her son; was taken there, and her husband at Clerkenwell, she told me so at noon; Clerkenwell, is half a mile from her house; she said they were taken to Bow-street. I said nothing more to her, but wished her good morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then tell her, you saw her son the day before, at the time he was charged with this offence - A. Yes; I forgot that; I immediately replied</p>
               <p>"I was by here last night and saw your son Robert." I told her the very time I had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that the time was material - A. I said I was by a few minutes before six o'clock, talking to a gentleman, and saw him last night; she asked me what time I had seen him - I told her it struck six o'clock just as the gentleman accosted me, and we were twelve or fourteen minutes together. She said they were taken up for some candles I believe; nothing else; she did not mention about candle moulds. I did not go to see Martin.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you told Mrs. Martin where you lived - A. Nine months ago. I told her I lived in Rose-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How then could they find you out in Long-acre - A. I believe I told her that four or five months ago. I called in and told her, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you positively swear you told her you lived at No. 17, Long-acre - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear she said Martin sen. was in custody, as early as noon that day - A. Yes.</p>

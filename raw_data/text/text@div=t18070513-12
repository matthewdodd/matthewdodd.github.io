             Q. You are an apprentice to the prosecutor. - A. Yes. On the 15th of April, about ten minutes past seven in the morning, I was at the corner of Hill-street, Finsbury-square; I saw the prisoner come out of the manufactory with a piece of floor cloth upon his shoulder; I followed him, I see him go into Mr. Benson's, a chandler's shop in Gee-street, with the floor cloth. I waited till he came out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come out with any thing. - A. No. I went immediately to my master, and gave information of what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. How do you know that what you saw the prisoner carry was floor cloth. - A. I had seen it before in the factory.</p>
               <p>MRS. BENSON. - Mr. Knapp. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I do; he came to me, I believe it was the 14th or 15th of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, he came to me with a floor cloth; I purchased it of Stokes, I paid him thirty shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the piece of floor cloth that was taken by the officer. - A. I believe it is; it was sold to Mrs. Fletcher.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. You bargained with the prisoner's wife for the floor cloth. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to purchase it of him. - A. The first time I knew the prisoner, I wanted a carpet painted; Mrs Fisher recommended him to me.</p>

On the 15th of April I apprehended the prisoner; I asked him what he had done with the floor cloth, he said he knew nothing about it; I told him he should go to Mr. Benson's in Gee-street with me, and there he should find it; he then said he was very sorry, but he had sold it to her for forty shillings. We went to Benson's house with a search warrant; Benson went over with us to the little girl's mother; the little girl was in the room; I took the piece of floor cloth up. It has been in the office ever since, in the custody of Armstrong.</p>

I went with Goff—I asked him his name and address—he gave his name, "Ashley, No. 11, Stockbridge-terrace, Pimlico"—I asked if he meant to say he lived there—he said he did—I went there—I afterwards went with Goff to No. 3, Allington-street—Goff had a key, which opened a chest of drawers, and in a drawer I found another bunch of keys, which opened a box in the room—I found some pawnbroker's tickets in it, one of which refers to these spoons—I also found three files.</p>

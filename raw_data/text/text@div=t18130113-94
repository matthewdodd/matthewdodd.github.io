            . I am an officer. The prosecutor came to the office; he said he had been robbed of a great coat, a hat, and a pocket handkerchief. I found the handkerchief in a pail of water, in the prisoner's room. This is the handkerchief. She said she knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief. It was in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you see the prisoner take the coat and hat from the room - A. I did. There was no other person in the room then but she and me.</p>

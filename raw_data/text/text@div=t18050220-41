               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This stable, in which these articles were found, all the servants had access to? - A. Yes; they all went there.</p>
               <p>Q. The gardener had access to this stable as well as the other servants; I do not mean to implicate the gardener at all? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. No light in the stable? - A. There was light sufficient for me to see the stockings fall as he went up the ladder.</p>

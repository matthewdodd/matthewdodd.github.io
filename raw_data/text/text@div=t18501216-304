                  </hi>. On Saturday, 30th Nov., I was in the West-minster-road, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—I did not notice the prisoner till she came behind me and took hold of my arm—she wanted me to go with her—I told her I wanted to go home—she let go with one of her hands, and got her other hand in the sleeve of my coat—she began feeling my person, and got her hand in my left-hand trowsers pocket—she</p>

The prisoner was brought in there; she appeared to be in liquor, but she knew what she was about—I searched her; she kept one of her hands closed, and down by her side—I said, "What have you got"—she would not open it, and I was forced to call in a policeman—we got it open, and found in it this bag and duplicate, and a half-sovereign.</p>

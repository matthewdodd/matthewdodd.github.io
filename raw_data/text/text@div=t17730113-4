On the 14th of last month, I went down to Salt Peter-bank, hearing there were some glass houses there, to enquire for any person that worked in a glass house, having a curiosity to see glass blown. I met with

            ; I told her what I was seeking for; she said her husband was a glass-blower, and she would take me to her house, in order that her husband might shew me; I went with her; she carried me up into a room, where I expected to see him, but instead of that, she fastened the door upon me, twitched me upon the bed, and swore a great oath I should be concerned with her.</p>
               <p>Q. And had you been talking to her upon no other subject but glass-blowing?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had no familiar conversation passed between you?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. No, none at all; I refused to have any thing to do with her; upon that she opened the door and called Hagan; Cassoy then threw herself upon me, and took my money out of my pocket, and Hagan took off my handkerchief, then they both ran down stairs: I followed them but could not catch them; I informed the neighbours of it, and they were taken soon after.</p>

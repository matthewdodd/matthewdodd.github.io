                  </hi>. I was at the Old Horns, Millpond-street, Bermondsey, on the night this took place—there were several persons drinking there; the deceased was one—the younger prisoner was trying to set one of the witnesses and a person they called Fabie, fighting, and white so doing, Mrs. Prestage came in to ask her husband to come to his tea, and she told young Boxall he ought to be ashamed of himself, as they had all been drinking together—he said she ought to hold her tongue—she said she would not, and he then said, "You b—y cow, I will make you"—the deceased got up, and told him not to call her that again—he said, "I tell you what,<hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>,I am not afraid of you, old <hi rend="italic">cock,</hi> and never was," and he then ran at deceased, and knocked him down with his head, at the bottom of the deceased's stomach—Mrs. Prestage said, "You coward, to do that," and he struck her, and as the deceased got up, he said, "You coward, to hit a woman in the way she is" (she was in the family way)—he then turned round, and ran at deceased again in the same way, caught hold of his leg, threw him again, and they both went down together—his head was then at the bottom part of the deceased's stomach—they fell in that way—he pushed his body right into him like—the father then interfered; he had taken no part in it up to the time the deceased received the injury that was afterwards discovered—he came in, and sat down just as they had the few words—when they were both down the second time, the father struck the deceased with his fists somewhere in his head—the deceased was holding the son down, and the father struck him, and tried to get him away—one of the witnesses struck him, and got him up—the father then caught hold of the leg of a table, and in pulling it off it struck the deceased's wife, and he said, "Here <hi rend="italic">Stephe,</hi> take this, and kill the b—r."</p>

I am a dresser at St. Thomas's Hospital—I saw the deceased after he was brought there—the symptoms he had when he came in were those of very great prostration, and severe pain in the abdomen, and inability to pass the urine, though he had great desire at the time—he came in on 22nd at noon, and died on 25th, at half-past five o'clock—I assisted in making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found a rupture of the bladder, with peritonritis and inflammation, arising from extravasation of the urine—those appearances were sufficient, in my judgment, to account for his 
death—it was such an injury as would he caused by a blow, or the falling of a heavy weight on that part—in other respects, he appeared to be perfectly healthy—I found no other bruises or anything to account for death—the rupture of the bladder</p>

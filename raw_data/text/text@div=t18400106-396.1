                  </hi>I am a shoemaker, and lodge in Poole-terrace, City<lb></lb>Road. On the evening of the 1st of December the prisoner came into my house, and brought a sailor with him—they were introduced to me by a young man named Davis, who lodges in the house—they went up stairs, and after a few minutes' conversation I was called up—Young produced this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) and said, this John Freeman had 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. price<lb></lb>money to receive—he read the paper to me, and asked me whether I would oblige the sailor with the loan of a sovereign until the 12th of De<lb></lb>cember, when he was going to receive his money, and he would be sure to return it to me again, and he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the loan of it until the 12th—he told me the sailor's name was John Freeman, which was on the paper—he read the paper over to me, and told me it was quite right, for he (Young) had been to Mr. Goode's, No. 15, Surrey-street, to see the books, and it was quite right—I gave Young a sovereign, which he passed to the sailor—I parted with it, believing the account which he gave me to be true—he said he had to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to see the books—the paper was left with me—I saw Young two or three times in the course of the week, and he said it was quite right—I have never got my sovereign—the sailor came afterwards, and drew 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more on the same paper—I made inquiry, and caused the prisoner to be apprehended.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Previous to the 1st of December, had anybody asked you to advance anybody a sovereign? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No—Davis told me the sailor wanted to borrow some money on a paper, and that he had some price<lb></lb>money to receive—he did not ask me to lend any one a sovereign—I had seen you two or three days before—I did not send Davis to you to say I wished to advance money on the paper—Davis told me you said the sailor did not want to borrow money on the paper, but that you were very much in want of money, and if the sailor would borrow it you would be very glad, as you could have it then—he told me the sailor was in work, and did not want any money—you did not come to me about it before the 1st of December.</p>

               <p>company with Davis, who was present when the sailor produced the certi<lb></lb>ficate out of his hat, and asked me if I knew any respectable person who he could leave the certificate with, and would lend him a few shillings to maintain himself, till he could get his money. I said I did not, unless my own father would. Davis said, "Well, you can go and ask your father, and I will ask my landlord if he will lend the sailor a sovereign." The sailor accompanied me up to my father's, and I only ask, if it is at all likely that I should be such an ungrateful scoundrel, as to go and ask my father to lend a sovereign on it, if I meant to rob him. I had not the slightest idea the certificate was not good. I had never seen such a thing in my life. I had no object whatever in serving the man, further than considering he was in difficulties, and to advance a trifle if it would help him. As to my saying I searched the books, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Mole and Davis well knew that I had not a shilling to bless myself with. I had been from home twelve months. I had been in trouble that twelve months, and it is not likely I could go and pay that money to search the books. I have a witness to prove I never saw the man till that time. I never asked Mole to advance him the money, but Davis came to me and said, "Have you done any thing with that certificate? " I said, "No, my father will not advance the money." He said, "I have asked my landlord, and he made me no reply." I said, "I shall not trouble further about it; " but in the evening the sailor asked me to mind the certificate for him, as he was going out. Next day Davis came and asked me if I had done any thing with it; I said I had not, and could not; he said, "There is a young man in our house to whom I have named it, he says he shall be glad to lend the sailor a sovereign or two, if he would give him interest; " I said if I saw the sailor I would let him know. Davis came to me next day; I said in all probability the sailor had got work, and if so, to let it rest. Next day I saw the sailor, who had been at work down at Shadwell, and I said nothing to him about Davis having offered to lend the money. He went away, and on Saturday Davis came to me again; I told him the sailor had got work. On Sunday, the 1st of December, Davis came to me again, and asked me the same thing; I told him, very likely I should see the sailor that day, and if he chose to lend him money he could. I saw the sailor in the evening, and told him a person in Davis's house would lend him money; he said, "Well, I only earned 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. yesterday, and I will go to him." He asked me to accompany him. I handed the certificate to him, and we went to Davis's house, into a front room on the third floor; Mole was called up. Davis said, "This man wishes you to lend him a small sum of money, and he will lay in your hands a certificate entitling him to prize-money." He asked him if he knew what sum it was; he said he did not, and asked me the same. I said, "I tell you what would be your best plan; it would be, to go down to the office where he says the certificate is payable, and ascertain if it is correct; " he said, "There is no occasion for that, " and immediately laid a sovereign on the shop-board,; whether I touched it I cannot say, but I know I never had any money out of it. I saw Mole frequently afterwards; and so depressed was I in circumstances, that I asked him to purchase a du<lb></lb>plicate of a brooch of me, which he did; and I believe, on the following day, I asked him to buy the duplicate of a gown-piece. I do not deny accom<lb></lb>panying the sailor to his house, but I did not make any false representation about the certificate.</p>

I did not make any proposition about taking a silver watch—I know nothing of it—I neither sent any body, nor went myself—I never said I would compound the felony, and if they could make up the money there should be no prosecution, nor any thing of the sort—I never saw that man till he was at Worship-street—the woman came to me on the Saturday, and told me Mrs. Young wanted to see me—I went, and she asked me, if she was to make the money up, whether I would not appear against him—I told her I would let her know in half-an-hour—I did not send any body to her nor to the prisoner—it is all false—they asked me to make it up—I said I dared not, because I had gone too far with it—I have tried all I can to take Freeman into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Sir Alexander Hood on the 11th of August—I was with his family at Brunswick-terrace—I received this letter on the 11th, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—it was forwarded to Lady Hood, and she forwarded it to Sir Alexander.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letters read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>"Sir Alexander Hood is sorry to trouble Mr. Green upon the subject of that worthless person, who has been such a nuisance to his family, Samuel Hood. He has been to Brighton and alarmed Sir Alexander's family in his absence, and fortunately no gentleman being then present to advise them, he was not placed in the hands of the police; but they were induced by threats to say in writing that something might be given him through Mr. Green. His apparent desire was to go to Spain; if, therefore, he should put himself under the command of an officer in that service, Sir Alexander requests Mr. Green will advance to such officer, or acknow<lb></lb>ledged Spanish agent in London, to be paid only when he is in Spain, and then only for clothes and necessaries, five pounds; but on no account to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170216"></xptr>
               <p>himself; and sir Alexander will, immediately upon Mr. Green's having done so, send the amount. Sir Alexander thinks it advisable to have him watched by the police, and requests Mr. Green, if he is on the same opinion, to mention the name of some vigilant person of that description to whom he may write to take him up if he comes into the country again, obtaining money under false pretences and threats. The five pounds can only be paid through one of the established agents, so that there may be no cheat<lb></lb>ing. The person is no relation of Sir Alexander's us he calls himself,—Wooton, Glastonbury, August 10."</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's letter was then read</hi>.) "Green's Hotel, Monday, August 20,</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi>, I have just read your infamous epistle to Mr. Green. This is the second time you have endeavoured to swindle me out of what you pro<lb></lb>misled in writing, which I can, and will produce to the world, Shame! Shame! can you, Sir, stoop to deceive and defrand a distressed relative! 'If you call on Mr. G. in London, you shall have some money.' When I get there, I find I am to go to Spain—and when I should have got there, I should find Sir Alexander's word as much respected as it was at London. You have deceived me once before this, when you sent me to Plymouth, there years ago. You shall not, I swear by the great God of Heaven, deceive me again with impunity—no, you have goaded me to des<lb></lb>peration by insult, deception, and falsehood. Perish I must, for I have no means of existing; but you, Sir, who promise but to deceive, shall not live to exult over my misfortunes. <hi rend="italic">Were</hi> I to go to Spain, I should go as an officer, and the promise made to me, for your mother of yourself, must be fulfilled without conditions; the promise was made to me; on that I left for London. None but those lost to every feeling and prin<lb></lb>ciple of honour and honesty, would thus basely, for the sake of a few pounds, forfeit their written pledge. I write to you once again, Sir, from here; and I now state to you that the assistance promised me at Mr. Green's, must be given without any conditions; and then Sir, neither you nor any of your family, will hear from me again. I wait until Wednesday morning. If I have not any communication at Green's, I will call upon you at Brighton. My doing so, will at least give me an opportunity to prove that I did not take advantage of your absence; and it will most likely give me an opportunity of stating publicly, that you (in my opinion, and in the opinion of many hundred others), either cajoled old Lady Brid<lb></lb>port into giving you all her property, or made the will yourself; the world will then have an opportunity of knowing Sir Alexander's chartacter as it really is, not as it may appear at this moment, superficially. If the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. promised is handed over to me, punish me for a perjured liar if I ever make an application to you again. I will call on Mr. G. on Wednesday morning, if I have no reply from him, I shall leave London directly for Brighton; that at least I may die at your threshould, the victim of your veracity and honour; but I will not die alone, worthless as you have dared to call me, I will prove that my carcase will be as valuable as the proud Sir Alexander Hood's. You drive me to madness, Sir, by your brutal and unmanly conduct. Why did your mother promise, if you or she intended to deceive? I wish to go to Spain, but not in the way you pro<lb></lb>pose; I would much sooner blow your and mine own brains out, than submit to your ungenerous conditions! Why not have said at once, when I was at Brighton, that nothing should be done for me; why <hi rend="italic">dishonourable</hi> cheat me into a belief that I should have it on my arrival in London; why inhumanely trifle with one who is almost starving—is this an aristocratic</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170217"></xptr>
               <p>feeling? No; no man of honour would forfeit his word, even a trades<lb></lb>man would have more honour than to shufile in the paltry was you have twice done with me. But rest assured, Sir, that I am not to be played with like a child. You have, by your insulting letter, roused feelings that even I regret to say, possess my wind in an excruciating degree. I repeat, Sir Alexander, that if you will allow the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. promised to me, to be given to me on Wednesday next, that I will immediately embark for Spain, and never trouble you or your family again, and will give Mr. Green an un<lb></lb>detain to that effect, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> to leave England in three days from thence. I am sure, after the promise made to me at Brighton, it will be impossible for you to refuse compliance with this request; and if I do not fulfill it, punish me as I should then merit; but which I do not, I thank God, yet deserve.—<hi rend="largeCaps">SAM. HOOD</hi>.</p>
               <p>"Sir, If you will permit Mr. G to hand me over the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will engage to leave England in three days from that time, and give an acknowlege<lb></lb>meant that the money is advanced to me for that purpose, and that purpose alone, and; not to be applied to any other than forwarding my departure for Spain; this Sir, will be sufficient, and will enable you to punish me as I should disserve, if I appropriate the money to any other purpose. To accept the money under your conditions, would be to blast my hopes and prospects at once, and I might as well stop and perish here, us go abroad without a hope of rising in my profession. I am Sir, your obliged, but cruelly treated relative, <hi rend="largeCaps">SAM. HOOD</hi>."</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, in a long address, stated that he had made frequent applica<lb></lb>ions for pecuniary assistance—and that upon hearing the letter produced, read to him, to Mr. Green, he had written the one in questioin, under a state of great excitement, which he now regretted.)</p>

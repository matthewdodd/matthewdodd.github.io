               <p>ABRAHAM D'AUBANT, Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>Some time before the 7th of this present month, I had reason to be convinced that the man at the bar, who was then one of my <rs id="t17870221-8-deflabel50" type="occupation">servants</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17870221-8-defend139 t17870221-8-deflabel50"></join>, had at different times taken money out of my purse when it came into his hands; and on the 7th of the present month, it became necessary to have another evidence as well as myself, to be sure of the man's impropriety of behaviour, and I desired this gentleman to come to my house; I then went into my study with this gentleman, having first unlocked my door, having previously informed him that I meant to make a trial of the prisoner's honesty; I put a purse on my writing table in my study; it contained a certain number of pieces of money; I wrote down a list of the pieces of money, their number, and the kind that they were; and Capt. Demerick, who was with me, did the same thing on a separate piece of paper; the pieces of money were then returned into the purse; the purse carefully drawn and laid on the table; we then left the room, and I locked the door, and put the key into my pocket, which was on a ring with others, and went down with Captain

             and I were: I then gave the keys to the prisoner, and told him to go up into my study and bring down a letter that was sealed laying on the table, and my watch; he took the keys and was absent a few minutes; he then came down, and brought the keys, the watch, the letter, and the purse in his hands.</p>

               <p>Had you told him to bring the purse? - No, I do not think I did; I do not remember I did; but it was very usual whenever he saw my purse laying any where to bring it to me; I desired him to turn the money out of the purse on the table, and count the money; Captain

               <p>Now, it will be necessary for you to say what money this purse contained when you left it upon the table? - Yes, my Lord, there were ten guineas, two half guineas, six shillings, and half a crown; I made a memorandum of the money turned out of the purse; I desired the Captain to take notice of the same; I wished not to have an officer in the house; I thought it was very probable the man would struggle; I thought the best way was to take him to the Magistrate's; the carriage was at the door; it was his turn to go behind it; and we went to Covent Garden piazza; and I got out opposite the Bedford Head coffee-house, and I desired the servants to wait there, and I went with Captain

             to Bow-street; I told Sir Sampson what I have now been relating to the Court, and Sir Sampson sent one of his men for the prisoner, who was waiting with the carriage; the prisoner came to Sir Sampson's, and my information was read to him: Sir Sampson desired him to empty his pockets before him; he emptied the pocket on his left side, and there was I think half a guinea,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210025"></xptr>and a small piece of silver in that pocket; Sir Sampson Wright then asked him where the guinea was that he had taken from me; the prisoner then put his hand into his right hand waistcoat pocket, and he took out a guinea which he put on the table before Sir Sampson Wright; Sir Sampson asked him if that was the guinea he had taken from me.</p>
               <p>Court. In the first place, I ought to ask you, Sir, whether any thing that the prisoner said was reduced into writing by the Magistrate? - The Magistrate reduced what I had said into writing.</p>
               <p>But was what the prisoner said reduced into writing before the Magistrate? - There was a clerk employed writing, and I should imagine it was taken down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The examination is here.</p>
               <p>Court. Then we must not receive parol evidence of it; were there any promises made to the prisoner of favour in case he would confess? - I have not the least recollection of any such thing.</p>
               <p>Or were there any threats made use of? - No, I am sure there were not.</p>
               <p>You are positive as to the number of guineas that were in the purse? - I wrote down their number; I am sure of the number; I presume the paper I wrote it on, is not necessary to produce.</p>
               <p>Alderman Watson. Did you entrust this man with your purse, Sir? - Yes, frequently; I had an entire confidence in him; perhaps I am saying more than is necessary; and I wish in that case to be directed; I purchased him in America, and made him a confidential servant; and I cannot say till lately I ever suspected him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was applied to by the last witness to come to his house and count some money.</p>
               <p>Did you see him produce his purse? - The purse was laying on the desk in the study; I opened it myself and counted the money, and found it contained ten guineas two half guineas, six shillings, and two half crowns; I then replaced the money in the purse and shut it; the Colonel and I went out of the room, and he shut the door, and left the purse on the desk.</p>
               <p>Was the door locked afterwards? - Yes, the Colonel locked it; we went into the drawing room, and the Colonel rung for his servant, that is, for the prisoner; the prisoner came, and he desired him to go up into his study, and bring a letter, but I do not believe he mentioned his purse, but he desired him to bring a letter, and some visiting cards; the Colonel gave him the keys of the room, he brought down the letter, and the Colonel's purse; the Colonel told him to empty the money out of the purse which he did, and the prisoner counted nine guineas, two half guineas, six shillings, and half a crown; there was one guinea deficient.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about that deficiency at the time? - No, there was sufficient proof at that time that he had taken the money; I went with the Colonel to Bow-street, where he gave evidence, and the man was apprehended; I then related before Sir Sampson what I have told you, and the prisoner was taken into custody; he produced half a guinea and a sixpence; an examination took place, which was reduced into writing.</p>
               <p>How was this purse secured, with strings? - It is a purse that slides; I think a kind of rings; I think it is a green purse. (The purse produced.) That is the purse.</p>

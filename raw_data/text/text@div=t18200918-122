            . I am a constable. I was attending the Sessions, and observed a crowd coming down. I and Taylor immediately went to Ludgate-hill; I saw Akers at the corner of the court by the picture-shop, and five or six persons round him. I saw the prisoner take hold of the ribbon of Mr. Akers's watch - he kept pressing round him; I then saw the watch in his hand. A witness laid hold of him, and told Akers. In the scuffle the ribbon broke, and two keys fell on the ground, which I produce. Several tried to get the watch away, while we were securing the prisoner; he was never out of my sight.</p>

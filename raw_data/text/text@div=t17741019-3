            . I was in the coach on Friday evening, the 26th of August last, with the other gentlemen; this happened between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, at Turnham Green, between two houses that have each the sign of the Pack Horse. I sat back on the right hand; Mr. Churchill on my left hand; there is in that place a row of trees railed from the common road that are before some houses; just at the corner of the rail, to the best of my belief, stood

            's that the man had at that time, but I cannot be positive to the person of the man; I asked Mr. Churchill what he thought of that fellow; seeing him there, he replied he thought he looked very suspicious, and then this man ran a-cross the road to the other side of the coach; he said nothing at that time, nor did I see any weapon that he had; when we came about twenty yards further, another man rushed out, who I believe to be Tomlin; he kept on our side of the coach; upon which I leaned out of the door, presented my pistol at him, and threatened to fire if he did not keep off; still he continued to pursue us, apparently with a design to reach the coach door, but before he could get so far as that, he put his hand to his breast, and took out a pistol, which he presented and fired. I am pretty sure that Tomlin is the man: I can speak much more positively to him than to Knight. It was a moon light night; I leaned out of the coach with the pistol in my hand, and kept looking at him; therefore I am more positive to his person than I can be to Knight. Upon his fireing I opened the coach door and jumped out, and Mr. Churchill followed me, and pursued the fellows; but they went off by a bye path, which I since find goes to Acton Common, and escaped.

               <p>I lay at Dartford on Saturday and Sunday night, with an acquaintance; on the next night<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177410190005"></xptr> he and I came five miles to an old fellow servant's on the road; there we lay on Tuesday night; on Wednesday night I lay at Kent-street; we both lay at the Bull at Kent-street end on the Tuesday and Wednesday night. I went to the White Bear in Piccadilly, there I had my things directed to the Ship at Turnham Green, in order to go down to see my friends; going along Piccadilly I met a young woman and a young fellow; she picked me up; I went with her to Kensington; there two young fellows came after me; one struck me; in the mean time Tomlin came up to me; I said I could not stand as there were two men against me; I asked Tomlin to hold my clothes; I charged the watch with them; when the watch came to Tomlin, I found Tomlin had a pistol in his pocket; I said to the men I had business in the country, I would depart and make it up; Tomlin said he had a pistol in his pocket, he would stop a coach; between the Adam and Eve at the turnpike, came a coach, which he was going to rob, but I catched the pistol out of his hand; when I came to Hammersmith, there was a light in the road; we went into a house; I told the landlord there was a man upon the highway, and insisted upon his aiding and assisting me; Tomlin then said I was confederate with him; the landlord asked him if he knew me; he said he knew nothing of me.</p>

               <p>The first acquaintance I had with this man was at the Adam and Eve; he was quarrelling with two men there; I was coming by at the same time; he said, young man hold my clothes while I fight these two men; I held his clothes; after the quarrel was over, he said he would treat me for my civility; as we were walking along I saw a pistol in his pocket; I said what have you here; he took it out of his pocket and shewed it me; I said it does not belong to me, I will not meddle with it; we went into the White Bear; he had the pistol in his hand; I followed him; the landlord came in directly; the landlord saw the pistol, and snatched it out of his hand.</p>

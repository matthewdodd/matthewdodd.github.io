I had seen him before - when they got opposite to the alley, Wheeler ran and passed Abrahams, to Wolfe's door; Wolfe was standing with his door open; Abrahams followed Wheeler up to the door, and both went in; we went over and the third man (who was with them) ran away; when we got to the door it was being closed; I put my shoulder against it and pushed very hard - Wolfe said,</p>

Wheeler said he came in to buy a hat, and said to Wolfe,</p>
               <p>"I have been here this hour, have not I maser;" Wolfe said</p>
               <p>"No, I know nothing at all about you;" I took the parcel which contained woollen cloth, and shawls, and found this invoice in the bale with the goods; they exactly corresponded with it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of December I met the prisoner, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, in the Edgware-road - he was about twenty-four miles from the prosecutor's - he lives at <placeName id="t18290115-74-crimeloc367">Bovington, in Hertfordshire</placeName>

            . I am the son of Ephraim Ware: he lives in Hertfordshire, about twenty-four miles from London. On the 28th of December, my father's horses were all safe in the stable, with their tails on; and at four o'clock the next morning, I missed all the hair off four horses; I have matched it to the horses, and can swear to this bunch in particular, and the other I believe are my father's; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

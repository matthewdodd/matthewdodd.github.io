I told him he might depend on it I should not quit him; he had these things in his hand together, we got out of the area together, I took him to the public-house nigh, and I said to him, I believe you are the villain that stole the tools about a fortnight or three weeks ago; he immediately made answer and said, I am; then said I, you have them about you, or have the duplicates; he immediately put his hand in his pocket, and produced thirty-nine duplicates; I asked him if these were all stolen tools, and he said they were.</p>
               <p>Had you promised him any thing to confess? - I did not; I took him to the Rotation-office, and there I was bound over to prosecute, but not with these men, I have none of the duplicates in my possession except three; these goods of Mr. Mead's were traced by himself.</p>

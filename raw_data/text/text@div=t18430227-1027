                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Parker, of Marylebone-lane. On the 16th of Feb. Wyld came to our shop for a patch, to repair his trowsers—I said we did not sell cloth—he left, and in ten minutes Hannon came for a waistcoat—he looked at a dark one—he got to the door, and pointed to one in the window—and while I went to get it, I heard the horse that the trowers hung on fall—I turned, and the horse was right across the shop—I did not miss the trowsers till the officer brought them, about half-past three o'clock—these are them—they are my master's—I had seen them safe at half-past eight in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Park-place, Bayswater. Between two and three, on the 16th of Feb., I saw the two prisoners and another just going into Manchester-square—I looked up the street, and saw they were followed by an officer whom I knew—I spoke to him, and we followed them down High-street, into Marylebone-lane—three doors from the corner they all three stopped—one looked into the prosecutor's window, and one went into the shop—I cannot say which went in first—he very soon came out, and they all three went some distance, to the corner of the mews—they there had some con<lb></lb>versation—all three came back, and Hannon went into the shop, and Wyld went in at the street-door—after some time my attention was drawn from them for a moment—I then saw them all three hurrying away from the house, and turning into the mews—I left the officer, and went to Wigmore-street, where the mews comes into—the officer then came to me, and I saw Wyld going along with a bundle—I seized him, and took the bundle from him—I was obliged to drop it in the struggle, and he kicked me very violently.</p>

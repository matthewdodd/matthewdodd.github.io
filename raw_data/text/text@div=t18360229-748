                  </hi>. I know the shop of Mr. Joseph Roadnight, who lives at Uxbridge, and is a butcher. On the 14th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I saw a sheep there—it had been killed and was hanging up, and I saw the prisoner and two others near shop—I knew the prisoner as long as I can recollect—I went to school with him—he lives at Uxbridge—I do not know that he worked at any thing—he went into the shop—I did not see him do any thing—nor take any thing—nor did I see him come out—the shop door was shut—I do not know whether it was latched—I saw it open, and he went in.</p>

                  </hi>. Between seven and eight o'clock on Sunday I was walking in Vine-street, about one hundred yards from the butcher's shop, with Frederick Taylor and another person, and saw the prisoner with the carcase of a sheep on his shoulder—I thought he had stolen it, and ran after him and overtook him—he threw the sheep down at my feet—I then knocked at Mrs. Copeland's door, and carried it into her house.</p>

On this evening I was sitting in the parlour, and Mrs. Roadnight heard some person go out of the shop—she called to the servant to know who had gone out—I missed the carcase if a sheep, and found it again at Mrs. Copeland's house—it weighed about seventy pounds—I am certain it was mine.</p>

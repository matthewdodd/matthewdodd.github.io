On Sunday, the 14th of Dec., I was living at the house of Mr. Thomas Hamblin, No. 3, Crayford-road, Cold Harbour-lane, Camberwell—it is a detached cottage—Mrs. Hamblin was at home, and Mr. Phillips, Mrs. Hamblin's brother-in-law, was there—Mr. Hamblin is an invalid—a few minutes before eight o'clock I heard a knock at the door—I answered it—I found a man at the door with a note in his hand—that man was afterwards tried at this bar, in my presence, by the name of Thomas Smith—he offered me the note, and said, "Deliver that to the lady of the house"—I said I should not deliver it unless he told me where it came from—he said, "Do you choose to deliver that to the lady of the home: if you do not I will shoot you;" and he produced a pistol from his pocket—(the outer door was not shut at that time)—that alarmed me, and I took the letter and delivered it to Mrs. Hamblin, who was in the kitchen at the time—I believe this to be the letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—she took it through the dining-room into the drawing-room, to Mr. Phillips—the street door was open at that time, to the best of my recollection—Mr. Phillips was in the drawing-room with Mr. Hamblin, who has been confined to his bed for the last eighteen months—Mr. Phillips came into the passage, to the man who was standing in the hall, and asked what business he had there—I did not hear him answer—Mrs. Hamblin came into the passage—a few minutes after she went up stairs—the man still con<lb></lb>tinued in the passage—after she had been up stairs a few minutes, he called out, "Is that lady coining? I will give two minutes"—Mr. Phillips went up after her, and came down, and said he had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his pocket, should he give him that, and Mrs. Hamblin said, "Yes"—Mr. Phillips came down with the note, and said to the man, would he go quietly if he had that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he produced—I did not hear his answer—Mr. Phillips gave him the note, and he went away—as he went through the passage, Mr. Phil<lb></lb>lips went up the steps to follow him to the street door—when he came into the hall, after I had taken the letter, I observed that he had a dirk or dagger in one hand, and the pistol in the other—I saw the handle of the dirk plainly.</p>

On Sunday night, the 14th of Dec, Mrs. Gallavin brought me a note, a little before eight o'clock—I was in the kitchen—this is the letter—it terrified me very much on reading it—Mr. Phillips was by my husband's bedside at the time—he had been paralysed for twelve months, and that was known in the neighbourhood—I showed the letter to Mr. Phillips—he came out of the room, and passed on to the hall—I had seen a man standing in the hall—that man was convicted here by the name of Thomas Smith—Mr. Phillips spoke to him—I went out at the back door into the garden, to the next door neighbour's, through the garden door, to give an alarm—the man could not see me go out at the back door, as the hall is not straight—on my return I found the man in the passage—Mr. Phillips told me if I would give 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the man would go out quietly—I said if I could find 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would—Mr. Phillips produced a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I allowed him to give it from the fear of all our lives—after saying I did not know whether I had got 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I went to the back door, and said I must pass through to get the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Smith placed his back against the door and shut it to, and said, "You don't pass here"—at that time he had a pistol and dagger in his hands—I after<lb></lb>wards went into the drawing-room and opened the shutter—the man, hearing</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Newberry, a gold-beater, and live at No. 43, Brook-street, Lambeth—a man named Thomas Smith came to lodge at my house last Christmas twelve months, and stopped four or five months—that same man was tried here—he came to us by the name of Jones—I have seen the prisoner at Jones's—he was there nearly every day, I believe, while they were there—Smith had a sister named Lucy—I have seen the prisoner write letters to her, and write directions for her, and have seen them after they were written by him—I have had such opportunities of seeing his writing as to enable me to form an opinion of his writing—he has written bills for me—to the best of my belief, this direction on this letter, "For the lady of the house," is his handwriting—the rest of the letter is written larger than I have seen him write—I cannot say whether that is his or not.</p>

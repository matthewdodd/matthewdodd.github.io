On the 2d of June I was with my dray in Whitechapel-road; I had received a great deal of money; there was 2l. odd in copper in the dray-box - I lost 1l. 3s. 6d., which I had received for my master's beer, but I am accountable for it. I left the dray for about three minutes - I had not seen the prisoner near the dray, till the officer had him; the box was locked, and I had the key in my pocket; when I came back the box was unlocked - it was about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening; the officer had this bag, with the copper in it.</p>

            . I was passing, and saw the prisoner go up to the dray, and take out this bag, with the money- he ran across the road, into a pawnbroker's passage; I pursued, and took him - the box was not locked then; the lock was hanging on the catch, but it was quite open- there was no time to unlock it.</p>

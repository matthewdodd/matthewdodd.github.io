On the 31st of July I was sitting at work, in the right-hand parlour, on the ground floor, about twenty minutes to three o'clock, I heard my little boy cry—there is a window which opens from the parlour on to the front garden—I went up stairs, leaving my gold watch, and gold chain attached, in a rosewood case, on the mantel-piece—it was three o'clock when I came into the room again—I noticed that the flower<lb></lb>pots had been removed from the window—I looked on the mantel-piece, and found my watch and chain were gone—the watch was worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the chain about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should know them again.</p>

On the 31st of July, from twenty-five minutes to three o'clock till three o'clock, I was standing at my mother's window—the prisoner passed under my mother's window, close by it—I was up one story high—I remained at the window, and looked down upon the man as he passed, and he looked up at me again—I still remained at the window, and in about five minutes he returned on the opposite side of the way with a boy—the boy sat down on the step of the next gate, adjoining Oakwood-cottage—the prisoner went into the garden of Oakwood-cottage—there is a gate there—he was in about five or six minutes—he came out and spoke to the boy, as he sat on the steps of the gate—the boy then went into Oakwood-cottage garden, where the prisoner had been, and the prisoner walked up the hill about half a dozen houses from the house, not out of sight of the house—the boy was not in a minute and a half—he came out, and overtook the prisoner—I saw no more of them—they walked up the hill together—the prisoner had dark trowsers on, something of a pepper and salt coat, and a black hat, with the brim turned up on each side—I had sufficient opportunity to see his face, as I took particular notice of it as he passed down, and when he returned on the opposite side again.</p>

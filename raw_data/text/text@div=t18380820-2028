On the evening of the 9th of August I went to Mr. Attenborough's shop—I there received charge of Smith—I took him to the station-house-in going along, I said to him, "You have been up to you old tricks again"—he said, "I suppose it is all up now"—that was all he said—I afterwards went to No. 8, Jackson's Buildings—I went up stairs to the first floor, broke open the door, and in the cupboard I saw this box, and up the chimney, some distance, I found these two books—I then examined a large chest, which I broke open, and in that I found this dressing-case-in the front room, one pair, which is Mary Williams's, I found this thermometer, and under the he bed a lot of parchments, and two stamps—the prisoner Williams was not at home—I found many other things, which Mr. Powell was allowed to take away with him by the magistrate—on the following morning I went to No. 10, Huish-court, Water-lane, Fleet-street—I found a woman, named Hibbert, lived here, she was not at home, but I went to her—I there found these papers, which wore identified by Mr. Powell-Smith did not tell me where any of the things came from.</p>

In the room—she said, yes, she had, and she produced the key—I took her to the station-house—she said in going along that she knew nothing of the robbery, but afterwards that the things were brought there, and that her sister Ann was there.</p>

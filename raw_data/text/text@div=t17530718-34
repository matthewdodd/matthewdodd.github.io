               <p>Ann Row. I am servant to Mr. Hall, and was serving in the shop at the time the bacon was stole. it stood on the outside of the door upon the cheeses for a shew, when I had serv'd my customer, and turn'd round, I missed the bacon, and saw the prisoner at the bar run; he was taken and brought back to our shop, then he was carried to the watch-house, 'till my master and mistress came home, to know what they would do with him.</p>

            . I live at a fishmonger's, about two doors below, as I was shutting up shop between nine and ten o'clock, I heard a cry of stop thief, I ran out and saw the prisoner run, I ran after him, and when he came to the gully-hole in Thames-street, he slung something out of his hand, I did not look what it was, but pursued and took him. I brought him back to Mr. Hall's shop, and then sent my brother for the bacon, who found it in the gully-hole, and brought it back.</p>

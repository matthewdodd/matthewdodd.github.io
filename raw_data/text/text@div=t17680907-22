            . I was once in trouble with the prisoner at the bar; that night I was going down the Old Jewry, the prisoner turned down the same; I asked her where she lived; she said, in Tenter-alley; she asked me if I was going home; I said, yes; she said, cannot you go my way; in going a little about, we came down Coleman-street together, we saw this gentleman cross the way to Bell-alley, I believe it was then betwixt one and two o'clock, he was a little in liquor; she said, there is a gentleman, I will go after him; she went after him, and said, come, Polly, will you follow me, which I did; she took hold of him, and said, shall I go in with you; what answer he made I cannot tell, I was at a distance; he put his hand to his right-hand pocket, and unlocked the door, and went in, and she after him; I went and stood at the door; I heard the gentleman's spouse call from the top of the stairs, and say, my dear, you are in liquor I believe; I cannot say what he said in answer; in some minutes after the gentlewoman came down, and catched hold of the prisoner; she cried out, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Appleton. I believe she cried out murder.</p>
               <p>M. Brown. Then I ran away, I was making off towards my own house, the prisoner came after me, and said, take hold; I said, of what, I perceived it was a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she overtake you?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. I ran first, she overtook me a little before I came to Little Bell-alley, I refused taking it several times; at last she gave it into my hand, I told her I was frighted; she said, take it, and go off; I took it; she bid me take it home to my room, I gave it to her directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a chain to it?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. I do not know whether there was or not, it was a large watch; she asked me where I lived; I told her at Mr. Simpkins's, in Three Tun alley; we parted, she came to me in my room at nine that morning, and asked me if I knew where to pawn or sell the watch; she had it with her then; I said, I did not know where; she said, if I did not know she did, and went away, and took the watch with her: between five and six o'clock that evening, knowing me to be low in the world, she took me with her, and left me at an acquaintance's house in Whitechapel for above three hours before ever I saw her; when she came she said, never be dead-hearted, for I will give you something to make you recompence, because I have known you a great while; she gave me 5 s. of the money, but she took some of it back again; we had some liquor, I had about 4 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you and she known one another?</p>

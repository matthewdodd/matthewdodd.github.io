               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I the person who took it? A. I cannot tell from his appearance, but the moment it was taken I turned, and kept my eyes upon the person who had it till it was taken from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then you saw it taken from the man who took it from you? A. Yes.</p>

            . I live in Bedford-street, Vauxhall. I saw the prisoner and another soldier at the gate - they had been before me for about two hundred yards, and appeared intoxicated; at the time they got to the gate I saw the prosecutrix there - they were close to her; she appeared to me to be falling, as if the men had run against her; I came up, and she said, "The soldier had taken my parcel from me" - I saw the prisoner with the parcel in his left hand; I went to get it from him, and he struck me, but I got it from him - another person came to my assistance, and I followed the prisoner to Portman-street barracks - when he went in I called the serjeant, and spoke to him on the subject; I am certain the prisoner is the man - I gave the parcel to the other person who came to my assistance; I did not see him give it to the prosecutrix, but she says he did - I have no doubt the prisoner and the other were both intoxicated, though he denied it, and so did the serjeant - it was as near nine o'clock as possible when they got to the barracks.</p>

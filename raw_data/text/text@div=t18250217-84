            . I am an officer. About 4 o'clock in the afternoon I was in Smithfield, and saw the prisoners. I was going to take the cart to the green yard, as no horse was in it. I took hold of it, and the prosecutor came and claimed it. The prisoners were near it at the time, and went away directly it was owned; - I secured Burrett, and Winston took Britten.</p>
               <p>BRITTEN'S Defence. I was in Cow Cross; - a man came from behind this cart and said, "Give this a push to the sheep pens, and I will give you a pint of beer," and said he should be at the corner public-house; and as I was going away, the officer took me; - I said a man was to give me some beer to push it.</p>
               <p>CHARES MATTHEWS. He said he was hired to draw it, and at the Compter he said they were to have 5 s., but told the Magistrate they were only to have some beer.</p>

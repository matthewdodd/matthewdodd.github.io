                  </hi>. I live at 192, Ratcliff-highway. One the evening of 30th Dec. I went out for some beer, about half-past eight o'clock, I saw Dawson with another sailor—I saw the prisoner—she had one hand round Dawson waist, the other on his pocket—I went four doors further for my beer, and came back and saw Dawson and the prisoner standing in the same manner—I stopped and watched—the prisoner remained in that position about five minutes—she then left the man, and went up the turning by our house, and I saw her put something down her bosom—she and heard Dowson complain that he had been robbed—I am quite sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

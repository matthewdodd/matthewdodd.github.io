On Sunday, the 9th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came down to my room with a candle, and asked me to lend him my bunch of keys, in order to look for his own, which he had left in his master's chambers; my bunch had keys on it which opened all the doors of the chambers which I attend; I lent them him without any suspicion - he returned them to me in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; some time after this my servant gave an alarm, and when my husband came in we all went up to look at the different chambers- we went into Mr. Lawrence's chambers first, and found the door open; no violence had been used to it; all his drawers were open, as he has stated.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and live in Field-lane. On Sunday night, the 9th of November, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I was out, and was sent for; when I came in two persons were standing at the door - I found the prisoner inside; he had some gentleman's clothes in a portmanteau - I said it was rather an awkward night to bring clothes, and I should not buy them; I said, "How came you to bring clothes on Sunday night?" he said his master was going away early in the morning; he said he, or his master, was going to leave town that night or early in the morning: I left him in the shop, and went out to look for an officer; I returned in ten minutes, when he and the two persons were gone; the clothes were left behind - I took them to Hatton-garden next morning, and gave information; I was desired to go to Bow-street, and took the clothes there between eleven and twelve o'clock, and found the prisoner in custody; I had left the clothes at Hatton-garden for three hours, with Limbrick; I have no doubt that I took the same to Bow-street - they were shewn to Mr. Lawrence there; I had never seen the prisoner before the Sunday - he was dressed in livery that night; I have no doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. What opportunities had you of conversing with him? A. I might have been in the shop five minutes: I had a candle - I saw they were new clothes, and directly said, "I don't buy anything on Sunday night;" I was not at home when they first came - I found the clothes lying on a chair, not in a bundle; I went for an officer in about five minutes, and when I returned they were gone - I did not see him again till next day at Bow-street; the clothes were three coats, two pairs of trousers, two handkerchiefs, and a table-cloth - they were not in the portmanteau; I put them into it, and gave them to Limbrick at ten o'clock, and left them at the office till one, when I think he gave them to me. I think the prisoner is the man; I do not think I have the least doubt of him.</p>

            . These are the articles the prisoner offered for sale, and the same I delivered to Limbrick; they are of a peculiar make - I have no doubt of their being the same; I cannot speak to the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>MR. LAWRENCE. I have no doubt of these clothes being mine; they have been worn - I should be sorry to say they were worth more than 3l. or 4l.: I cannot say that I saw them before I went out that morning, but I have no doubt they were there.</p>

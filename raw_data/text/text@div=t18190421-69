On the 13th of April the prisoner came into our house with another man, who went away; between five and six o'clock Limbrick came in, the prisoner endeavoured to pass him, but he seized him; the prisoner looked confused, and threw a parcel into the bar, I took it up, and threw into the passage again. They were scuffling together.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I was with Read at the Lincoln's Inn coffee-house; we sat down and had a pint of beer, and saw the prisoner there, reading the newspaper, and leering under his hat at us; I went out, returned in less than a minute, and saw him coming out of the tap-room - he seemed very much confused, looked at me, and went towards the bar. I saw a paper parcel in his hand, he appeared to throw it on the ground, but whether he threw it into the bar or not, I cannot say; it was done while I turned my head to call Read - I saw it lying in the passage, and seeing him going to the back of the premises, I laid hold of him; he immediately threw a small parcel down the privy, which was at the end of the passage. I brought him back, picked up the parcel in the passage, and delivered it to Read. I waited at the privy till Edmonds came, I let him down, and he brought up a parcel which I opened, it contained five 1 l. notes. The parcel found in the passage contained four parcels, each containing twenty 1 l. notes, and ten 1 l. notes in another; and a small bag, containing twelve 2 l., ten 5 l., and six 1 l. notes, all of which I marked (looks at them) - these are them. Those found in the privy have names written upon them, and were folded up separately; the rest are new.</p>

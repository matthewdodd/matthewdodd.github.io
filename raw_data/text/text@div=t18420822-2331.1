                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, Brook's-market, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 6th of July I left my wife in the house, and went out a little after nine o'clock in the morning—I occupy two rooms on the ground-floor, which open on to the landing—the land-lord does not live in the house—it is let out in lodgings—I returned about five minutes after four, and found the room-door on the right-hand wide open, and the padlock and hasp, which I had left on in the morning taken away—my wife had been out, and returned about two minutes before me—I missed a coat, two gowns, two frocks, a blanket, a sheet, a shift, and a band—the street-door ought always to be shut, but most likely it was left open.</p>

On the 6th of July, I was Jiving at No. 19, Peter-street, and Bird lodged with me—the other two prisoners are acquaintances of hers—she went out that morning—about one o'clock Sullivan came to my room, and asked for Bird—I said she was not at home—she had a bundle with her—she went away again, and then they all three came in together each with a bundle—Sulli<lb></lb>van had the same bundle that she had brought before—they opened the bundles in my room, and sorted the things—I saw two frocks, two gowns, a coat, and a band, which I thought was a pillow-case—one gown was a mourning one, and the other a light one—they each took some things, and Bird left behind her the padlock and two sleeves belonging to a gown, which I gave to the policeman next morning.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 12th of June, about twenty minutes after two o'clock in the morning, I and Forbes saw the prisoner coming down Cow-cross, with a bag of halfpence on his shoulder - I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there? he said they were halfpence, that his name was Matthew Beadle, and that he was going from Mr. Turner's, of Spitalfields-market, to carry some halfpence to Covent-garden to give change. I told him that was the wrong way to Covent-garden - He said the cart was gone on with a load of potatoes, and there was not room in the cart for the bag. He said he was going to a coffee-house in Clerkenwell first to get some coffee. I told him he must go to the watch-house. He said Mr. Turner was a potatoe-dealer, and mentioned several potatoe-dealers in Cowcross. I went to the market, but could not find Mr. Turner's stall. I had a full opportunity of seeing the prisoner. I came back to the watch-house, found him gone, and the halfpence left behind him. On the 16th, I saw him at the watch-house again-Forbes had taken him. I have no doubt of his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had a great deal of conversation with him. I am positive he is the man.</p>

I did not suspect him from the references he gave. He said he wanted to go into the yard for a necessary purpose. I told him to follow me; I turned my back, and thought he was behind me - I heard the door open; I ran out and found him gone-he got away. On the 16th I saw him again, and am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer, and work for my father, in Paul-street. I remember the Monday that the prisoner was taken up, and the Wednesday before that, I lodged with the prisoner's father, in Clifton-street, Northgreen, Holywell-row, Curtain-road; he deals in asses-milk - I slept with the prisoner in the same bed. On the Wednesday night we went to bed together about eleven o'clock; the door was fastened inside. I got up between six and seven o'clock in the morning, he was still in bed. I awoke once in the night and found him in bed - I have no reason to think he was out of bed all night. In the morning, about six o'clock, a young man came into the room, he lodged up stairs, he is a japanner; he said he was going to work; the prisoner's father locks the door, and keeps the key. I remember his fastening the house that night, in the usual manner, atten o'clock, or a little before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What makes you remember that night - A. Because we all went to bed together; he did not go to bed generally till after me, we slept in the kitchen. The prisoner's brother slept in the same bed with us. I lodged with the prisoner since Whit-Monday; that was the first time I ever lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before this matter happened - A. I think about two, months.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know that Wednesday was the day the prisoner was charged with the robbery - A. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020052"></xptr>sitting at my father's door on the Thursday morning, which was the next day after the robbery was committed. The prisoner's father came to me, and told me that he was taken up on suspicion. This was the next day after I had slept with him on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not taken up until the 16th. What reason have you to know that you slept with him on the Wednesday night - A. We all supped together that night. I removed somewhere else about a fortnight ago, but sleep there again now. I do not usually sup there, but was invited on that night, we sat down to supper, about nine o'clock - We had about a dozen boiled mackarel for supper; the prisoner's sister, who is married, was there, his grandmother, and the prisoner's brother's wife (twelve of us altogether). The prisoner's grand-mother and the married sister went home - I am certain the prisoner slept in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Snaith sup with you that night - A. I do not remember. My grandmother did not sup there that night. If there had been a dozen mackarel for supper I should have remembered it. I do not remember that any person came into the room before I got up.</p>

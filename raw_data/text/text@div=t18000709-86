            , he lives in the house; he has the same communication to his apartments that I have: On Thursday last, the 10th of July, I left the room, and left the key in the door, for the convenience of attending a bit of meat that I had roasting, and went up stairs into the garret to work; I am sure I locked the door; I was up stairs about a quarter of an hour, and when I came down I found the room-door wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mildred himself at home? - A. Yes, and a lodger up in the garret; just as I entered the room-door, my wife was entering it too; upon inquiring of Mildred, we entertained a suspicion of the prisoner; we went to the pawnbrokers to give information, and then we were going to Rosemary-lane, and in our way there, we met with the prisoner at the bar, in Chiswell-street; my wife accosted her, and asked her if she was going to our apartments, she was then buying fruit at a greengrocer's; she said, yes, in half an hour, will that do; we walked with her to the end of Grub-Street, and when she had turned the corner she ran away; I ran after her, laid hold of her, and brought her to our own apartments; I fetched Cartwright, the constable, who insisted that my wife should search her, I did not see her searched; after the search, my wife brought two duplicates into the room, one of them led to the gown-tail and the silk; she confessed where the muslin gown was.</p>

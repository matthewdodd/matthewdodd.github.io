               <p>Q. Was the prisoner known to you - A. No, she is an entire stranger. I never saw her in the house. It is a private house; the door is generally open. When I went out I double locked my room door.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you went out was your husband's watch on the mantle-piece - A. It was, and in the room were all the things mentioned in the indictment. The articles were all safe in the room when I went away. I went out about two o'clock; I was not absent an hour; when I returned I found my door open. The lock was not injured. Whoever it was that entered the room must have got in by a false key, or a picklock. When I entered the room I first missed my husband's watch. Upon my looking round the room I missed all the other articles I had an hundered hand bills printed, and I distributed them to the different pawnbrokers for them to stop the things. On the Monday following I was going down the Strand to deliver them bills, I saw the prisoner walking before me in the street, with my gown on, my black velvet spencer, and the silk handkerchief tied round her neck. I took hold of her by the arm and took her into a shop I told her that she had robbed me; she denied it, excepting the clothes that were on her back. She could not deny that they were mine. I was positive they were mine before I laid hold of her. She said that she knew the things were mine, if I was the person that belonged to the room. I sent for a constable; Mr. Westwood came and took charge of her.</p>

I searched the prisoner; I found a small box with a duplicate of a pair of stays. The stays were delivered to me by the duplicate. Mrs. Jackson claimed the stays. The prisoner then told me that she had pledged the watch in Watling-street. She took me to the pawnbroker's shop, and Mrs. Jackson claimed the watch. The prisoner then told me that she had sold the other things in Play-house-yard. She took me to Mrs. Price's.

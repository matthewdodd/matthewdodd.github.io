                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. On the 9th of May I went to the Shakspeare public-house, at Woolwich—between six and seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner came to the bar and asked the landlord if there was a letter there in the name of M'Greggor—Bland, the landlord, said, "Yes," and asked him how he came to have his letters directed there without his leave—I did not hear his answer—Bland said, "How am I to know you are the person? is your name M'Greggor?"—the prisoner said, "Yes"—Bland said, "I must have a receipt for it; it may contain money, for aught I know"—the prisoner said, "Very well, I will give you a receipt"—I stepped forward and asked him who authorised him to send or write to Mrs. Campbell for money—he said, "Her brother"—I then said, "You must go with me"—I allowed him to take possession of the letter, and took it from him directly—on the way to the station he said, "Can't this be settled, sergeant, without its going any further?"—I said, "No; I don't know the exact particulars of the case, but it is said you had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before"—he said, "Yes; I am a runed man; what a fool I must be"—I asked him where her brother was—he said, "On board our hulks; I mean her husband"—I asked him who wrote the letters—he said, "A man named Jones, who went away in the last <hi rend="italic">Bay ship</hi>," (meaning Botany Bay)—I asked him what he did with the money—he said Jones had it—I said, "You did all this for nothing, then"—he said, "Only for good nature"—I found this little book on him, and all these letters—(<hi rend="italic">the book contained entries of different names, among them "Campbell, Edinburgh, Scotland. Shakspeare Inn, Power-street. Campbell, Edinburgh Scotland, to be left at the Shakspeare Inn, Woolwich, till called for. 22nd April"</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a convict keeper at Woolwich. I have known the prisoner two years and a half—he always bore an honest character, and was a humane man towards the convicts—I know that convict keepers and officers in the hulks have been suspended for being parties to sending letters—about eighteen months ago, one Hubbard was suspended for six weeks for receiving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a prisoner's friend, till it was made good to the friends again—I have known parties discharged for sending communications from prisoners to their friends—I have detected two myself—we are not allowed to send or receive letters for prisoners without communicating with the authorities—it does not require much management to conceal it.</p>

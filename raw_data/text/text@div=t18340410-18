             (police-constable F 158). I was in Drury-lane - I saw the prisoner slip from behind the prosecutor with something in his hand - I knew him, and followed him down Charles-street - I called, "Stop thief!" - he then ran as fast as he could - his cap fell off - he did not stop to take it up, but ran on - he went into No. 8 - I followed him; and when he got to the foot of the stairs, I saw him throw down this handkerchief - I took it up, and followed him up stairs - I took him back to the prosecutor, who had been stopping in the street - the prisoner said he had not seen the handkerchief at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he came into the room where I was, he said, "Come along, it is no use." Witness. Yes; I did - I was glad to get him out, as there was a bad set there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the handkerchief under a gateway; I put it in my pocket, and did not run till he called "Stop thief" - I then threw it down.</p>

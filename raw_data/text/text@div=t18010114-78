             sworn. - I live at Tottenhamhigh-cross, about three miles from Mr. Duckless; the prisoner came to my house on the 5th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner offered me a table-spoon for sale; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140085"></xptr>him how he came by it; he said it was his own, and I said, I doubt you stole the spoon; I asked him where he was quartered; he told me at the Cock, at Hounsfield; that is the name of the place where the prosecutor lives; Mr. Duckless keeps it; then I said, I will stop you and the spoon both; I went across the high-road for the constable, and left him in my shop, it was only just across the road, and when I had got the constable we saw him, and I gave charge of him.(The officer produced the spoon in two pieces.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I had bought it of a travelling man on the road, and gave 6s. for it.</p>
               <p>Hart. He said so before the Magistrate, but he said no such thing to me.(The spoon deposed to by Mrs. Duckless.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. She would not swear to the spoon before the Magistrate, till the Magistrate said he would send her to the cage if she did not, and rather than leave her children she swore to it.</p>

On the 23d of December, about nine o'clock at night, four dead geese laid in my window. I was cutting some bacon, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran towards the door, two boys said a boy had stolen a goose from my window, and that he was coming towards the door again. I collared the prisoner, they said that was him. I asked him how he came to take the goose? he said he did not. The patrol came by, and I gave him in charge; he then said he had 3 s. in his pocket, if I would take that and send to his father, he would pay the rest for the goose - I said I would do no such thing. One of his comrades picked the goose up after he threw it down, and ran off with it.</p>

            . I keep a second-hand book-shop in Carnaby-market-the prisoner has sold me books three times. He said he had lived with a clergyman, and when he lost him he lost the best friend he had, and that he gave him the books. On the 4th of April he brought a quantity of books; having some suspicion, I paid him for them, and communicated my suspicions to Mr. Sewell, whose name was in a Watts's Hymn-book, which the prisoner sold me. Mr. Hunt, and another gentleman called on me on the Monday following. We agreed that I should stop the prisoner when he came again. On the Thursday he came, and I stopped him. I produce the books he sold me.</p>

A window had been opened by taking out a pane of glass, they then entered the chapel, and broke the vestry open in the same way - A great many books and other things were taken; they broke open a desk. I lost seven books out of the drawer in my pew- I had them safe on the Sunday. Rippon's Selection, which has been produced, belongs to me. I saw the chapel on the Friday night; it was not broken open then.</p>

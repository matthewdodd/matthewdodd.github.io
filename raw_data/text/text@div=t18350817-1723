                  </hi>. I live in Brick-lane, Bethnal-green, and am a grocer. I employed the prisoner occasionally—on Tuesday, the 14th of July, I marked some half-crowns, having missed money from the till—I placed three of them in the till—I then went out, leaving the prisoner behing—I returned in an hour and a half and found him in the shop—I looked into the till, and found the three half-crowns safe while I was out, I sent Mrs. Hargrave for some goods, with two more marked half-crowns—I found one of them was not in the till—I charged the prisoner with one being missing—he denied it for some time—I sent for an officer—he fell on his knees, and said if I would forgive him, he would tell me all about it—he then pulled half-a-crown out of his pocket; he said his mother was a very poor woman, and he had taken it—the four half crown I found all marked as I had makde them—this is the one the prisoner gave me—I gave it to the officer—this is marked as one of those I gave Mr. Hargrave.</p>

On the 22d of January, about two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and engaged a bed for the night - we open about that time - he went to bed. About a quarter of an hour after I went to see if my aunt's bed-room door was safe, and found the prisoner's door wide open. I suspected something, went into his room, and found him lying on the bed, with a pelisse and sheet wrapped round him; he was dressed. I asked him how he came by them? he said a coachman, who slept up stairs, gave them to him. I examined further, and found all the articles stated in the indictment concealed in his bosom and in his breeches. He was intoxicated. I was going to leave the room, he said he would go and shew me the man who gave them to him - I pushed him on the bed, shut the door, and gave the alarm; my aunt and one of the lodgers came up. We found he had escaped out of the window - the window was a little open when I first went into the room. The officers came directly, and traced his footmarks in the snow on the tiles, to the window of some back premises.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I was fetched to the house about two o'clock in the morning, saw the footmarks on the tiling, and heard a man's voice faintly say,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake let me in!" - he was at the window of a house in the court. I and Reeve went up Red Lion-court to the house - two women were terribly frightened on seeing him come in at the window. I went up stairs, and found the prisoner sitting in a chair under the window, with a great deal of blood about his person. I asked him how he could rob the people? he cried, and begged for mercy, and said another man gave him the things to bring down stairs. He appeared very much in liquor. I found a bolt broken off the closet door of Rickards's bedroom, where the property was stolen from.</p>

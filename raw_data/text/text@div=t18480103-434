On 1st Jan., a little before two o'clock in the morning, I was in Field-lane, Holborn, by the One Tun public-house, of which Mr. Low is landlord—I heard the sound of copper money, and called the sergeant's attention to it—he rung the bell—I heard a man in the house say, "Here he comes"—I went round to the black of the house to Plough-court, which is no thoroughfare—there is a wall there belonging to Mr. Tite's house—an alarm was given—I ran in pursuit, and saw Humphries with the prisoner in custody—he was taken to the station—I searched him, and found ten sixpence and some silent matches in his waist<lb></lb>coat-pocket—I asked his name and address—he refused to give it.</p>

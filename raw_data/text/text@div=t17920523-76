               <p>The prisoner came into Mr. Dobbin's shop, and asked for some shawls; my mistress and I shewed her some, but she said there were none she liked. I turned round, and as she moved her hands very quick, I suspected the had got something, and I was resolved I would see what she had got; she bid 2 s. 4 d. for a shawl which I offered at 2 s. 9 d. She said she wanted to go to the pawnbroker's; I suffered her to go to the door, and then I jumped over the counter and followed her, and she dropped the shawls; I have had them ever since; they are my master's property; I am sure they are his property by the mark.</p>

               <p>I was going by the door and a young woman coming out in a hurry dropped something. I never did such a thing in my life; they took me before a justice and swore to me. I hope you will have mercy on me.</p>

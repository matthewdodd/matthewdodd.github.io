I was with my sister, waiting for a carriage to pass - she caught hold of her bag, and said her purse was gone; I turned round, as the prisoner trod on my heels, and I saw him draw his hand from my side - there were two others with him, but they went away; I am positive he drew his hand from my sister - he was the nearest person to her.</p>

               <p>Q. Could he have done any thing without your seeing him? A. Not that I am aware of; I kept hold of him for a few minutes, till an officer came up - no purse was found on him, nor any instrument to cut with; he could not have given either knife or purse to any body after I saw him.</p>

After we had talked a while about the House they told me they could help me to the Watch I had lost*, and if I would> give him a Guinea, they would get it directly: Upon this Account I went to Goodyere's House, between Seven and Eight o'Clock in the Evening, and there was the Prisoner and two other Women. We fell to drinking Gin, and after we had drank a while, Richard Goodyere began be quarrelsome, and said he believed I had not Money to pay the Reckoning, I pull'd out my Bag, to shew them that I had Money, and the Prisoner snatch'd it out of my Hand, and Richard flung me down, and I fell with my Head against a Chair, the Blow stunn'd me for some Time, and I got up as soon as I could, - but every Soul of them were ran away, there was no one left in the House but myself: They all ran over into the Marshalsea, where they had a Friend who took them in, and it was a Week before I could take them; there were three of them concerned, but I took only the two Goodyeres, and carry'd them before the Lord Mayor, where she said nothing at all, and he confess'd he had my Gold.</p>

               <p>Summer. But I am sure I was robb'd the 29th of July. She took the Money out of my Hand the 29th, and I charge her only, with taking it in the Warrant: I am positive she is the Woman. I saw her (I believe) once before, in Smithfield; she is a remarkable Woman, and is a little humpback'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he did not ask my Husband to give him some of the Money again, and if he did not tell him he had none of it?</p>
               <p>Summer. I did ask him to give me some of it again, before he was committed; I should have been glad to have got some of it again. <rs id="t17390906-38-verdict176" type="verdictDescription">

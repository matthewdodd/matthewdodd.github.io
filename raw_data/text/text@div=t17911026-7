               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Etherington, of Kilburn Wells, I am collector of the tolls. The 15th, Saturday morning, the prisoner came to the gate, I asked him how far he was travelling? he said he was going to London; he had the geese in a bag on his back; I said, have you been robbing a hen roost? the bag was bloody, I stopped him, and in the bag I found four fowls and six geese, all dead, but quite hot, they were brought to Bow-street. The prosecutor appeared on Tuesday. Mr. Wilkinson saw all the things. The prisoner said he did not know who they belonged to. The prosecutor swore to them.</p>

               <p>I was coming over the common, and I heard these geese cry out, as I went up to them there was a man ran away, therefore I took them and put them in my sack.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

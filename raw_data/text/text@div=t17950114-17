               <p>Q. Where was the sheet? - On the bed; the candlestick one of the young men had it to light him to bed; I believe, to the best of my knowledge, John Barnes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever employ the prisoner at your house? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it you saw her go out? - Between twelve and two at noon, on the 30th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the woman afterwards? - I see her the next day when I took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the woman you took was the same woman that you saw go out of the house? - I could not swear to it because it was through a glass partition. The sheet and candlestick are not found, but the other property, belonging to my two lodgers.</p>

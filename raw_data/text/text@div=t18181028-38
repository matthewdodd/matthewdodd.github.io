            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I was going up Holborn, and saw the prisoner, with another person, near Middle-row, following the prosecutor. When they came to a window which had a light in it they stopped to let him pass, then made up to him again, and followed him down Fetter-lane. I crossed over on the other side of the way, just as the prosecutor came opposite a grocer's shop. I saw the other man take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to the prisoner, who was close by. I ran over, and seized the prisoner - They were then about a yard before him, the other ran off. I told the prosecutor he had lost his handkerchief. I took the prisoner into the grocer's shop, and found the handkerchief under his coat.</p>

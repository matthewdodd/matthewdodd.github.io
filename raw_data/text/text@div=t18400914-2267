                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old on the 29th of this month, and am in the service of my uncle, Mr. Robert Martin, a lithographer, of No. 26, Long-acre—I know the prisoner—he had been in my uncle's service, and had left about a fortnight I believe before this happened, but I am not certain. On Saturday, the 22nd of August, be came to the premises—I had let a person out of the shop—when I let him out, the prisoner rushed into the shop from the street—there is a little counting-house in the shop—I went in there, thinking he might have something to say to me—I thought he wanted to speak to me—he followed me into the counting-house, and made a blow at my head with this basket-maker's bod<lb></lb>kin—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he struck at me with the pointed end—it was thrust down at me—the pointed end was towards me—I put up my left arm to defend my head—he struck me three times, and wounded me with the pointed end—it took effect on my arm in three places—he called me a b—heretic—I did not understand what he meant by that, but I believe he is a Catholic—I called out, "Murder," and some men came down to my assistance—as they were coming down, the prisoner went into the street—I followed—I did not see him secured, I was in the shop at the time—I saw him just after he had been secured in the street—I bled a good deal—I got my wounds dressed at a surgeon's—I had not had any quarrel or dispute with the prisoner—on the morning before, he met me in Seven-dials, and said he wanted to have two minutes' conversation with me, but I did not stop to speak to him, because Mr. Martin had told me if I met him in the street I was not to speak to him—I had not been con<lb></lb>cerned in any way in his being dismissed—I never had a quarrel with him to my recollection in my life—my uncle told me not to speak to him, be<lb></lb>cause he was such a man he would be very likely to ask me to get him back again.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Martin—I shall be fifteen years old next November. On Saturday, the 22nd of August, I was at work at a side shop—I heard the alarm of murder, ran in, and saw the prisoner with this dagger in his hand, using it it in this way—(<hi rend="italic">stabbing</hi>)—this is the instrument—I ran up stairs for assistance, and when I came down, the prisoner was going out into the street, and he was concealing the instru<lb></lb>ment up under the sleeve of his coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the parish of St. Martin. On the 22nd of August I saw a crowd in Long-acre—I took the prisoner into custody—he was walking away from Mr. Martin's towards the eastward—a person in the crowd said it was a pity he should be allowed to go away, as he had been murdering the boy—we had a little tussle together at first—he had his hands in his pocket—I took them out, thinking he might have some instrument there—he then said to me, "I know you very well, and will go quietly along with you; I have done very wrong, I am free to confess it; I meant for three days to murder him, and thank God I have not killed him"—he said he had deprived him of his bread—I cautioned him against making use of such words, and asked if he had not been drinking—he denied that he had, and repeated the same words again six or seven times—it was about nine o'clock in the morning—I received this instrument from some person at the station-house—the pri<lb></lb>soner said when he saw it, "Ah, that is it."</p>

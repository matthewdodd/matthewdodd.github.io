I returned home about twelve o'clock; the prisoner was in the shop; I examined the till and missed some of the marked money they told me they had laid out. I keep the key in my own possession; I never suffer any body to give change out of it; there is a hole to put the silver through; the shillings were marked with a notch in the edge above the head; there were three missing; I sent the prisoner over to Mr. Collyer to get change for a ten pound note, and followed him immediately, and desired him to go into the compting house; Mr. Collyer was there. I then told him I had lost money several times, and believed he was dishonest; he said he wondered I should think so; I said I had reason for it; I asked him how much he had in his pocket; he said he believed about twelve shillings and a guinea and a half; I desired to see the silver, and he took it out, and laid it down on the desk; we looked at it, and Mr. Collyer picked out a shilling that he had marked about an hour before, and sent to my shop; there were two other marked shillings that were laid out by Mr. Hughes; then he begged I would forgive him; I told him I had lost money several times and was determined to make an example of the first I could detect. On his cross examination, he said he did not recollect whether they were queen Annis shillings or no; that he did not know how much ought to be in the till; that if he had a fancy to the shillings, and put others in the room, it would have been the same; that he could not tell whether any shillings were put in the room of the marked ones .</p>

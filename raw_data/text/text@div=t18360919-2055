On Wednesday the 17th of August, my father was in a very bad state of health, and sent for me—he lived at No.7, Richardson's buildings, Goswell-street—I went to him, with my sister, and he gave me sixty three sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and £22 in silver, and a few shillings over—there were about 700 sixpences among it, as near as I can guess—he gave it me, and said if he should die I was to divide it between my self and my sister—I brought it away to my place, at the Hercules' Pillars, on the Friday, and acquainted my mistress of it—I took it up stairs, and put it on my clothes at the top of my box—it was in a dirty piece of linen rag, or calico—the gold was wrapped in a piece of calico rag by itself, and the rag was either linen or calico which the silver was in—I put it into my box, locked it, and put the key underneath the box, were I always kept it, that was in my bed room—the prisoner was living in Mr. Lee's service when I first went there—he occupied the room opposite mine, on the same floor—he continued there till the Friday when I brought home my money—he is a journeyman baker, out of employment, and used to clean the windows and knives in the house, and do odd jobs, for the sake of his victuals—my father died on Saturday the 12th of August—on the following Monday I went to my box to get some money out, and missed it—I found the key were I had placed it—I opened the box, and all the gold and silver was gone—I afterwards saw the piece of calico rag, and knew it again—I am sure it was the same—Mr. Lee's house is in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-fields.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. On the 14th of August, at ten minutes past nine o'clock at night, I drove up to my brother George's door, in Church-street, Shoreditch, and noticed one of the first-floor windows a little way open, and a light—I called out, "George"—nobody answered, and as the light was going away, I thought he was coming to let me in, but he did not—I went to the door, and rang the bell—nobody answered for several minutes, at last the door opened, and two persons rushed out—the prisoner was the last—I laid hold of him—he dragged me across the road in trying to escape—I gave him to Walker.</p>

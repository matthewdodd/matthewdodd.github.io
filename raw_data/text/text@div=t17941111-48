I took him down to the watch-house, and sent for the keeper; as soon as I got them in the watch-house and got a light, I asked them what was in the bag? he said at last, they were four gowns; I told him I did not chuse to go to Cow Heel-alley, I asked him to give a direction where he brought them from; he did not give an answer for some time; I said, I insisted on knowing where you brought them from; he then said, he did not know the gentleman's name; I then asked him if he knew the name of the street? and I would endeavour to find out the house; he told me, no, he did not know the name of the street; and then I insisted on knowing how he came by them; and he told me that a man in the street told him he would give him two-pence for carrying them; that was all the account I could get out of him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I never was married to such a person - he must allude to some other person.</p>
               <p>Witness. I knew him before, and he knew me; he worked in Cheadle for the person who made shoes for me- I have not the least doubt he is the man.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Q. When did I live in Cheadle? A. In 1824, and worked there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You are wrong, I never worked in Cheadle in my life; I only came from the East Indies in 1823 - if any woman can swear to me, let her come forward; who was the person who gave my wife away? Witness. I do not know, perhaps I might myself; I saw his wife alive three weeks ago.</p>

I never struck the woman in my life; but I could not bring home five or six guineas a week - and nothing would do; I gave her a pound or two when I could - she was jealous of another woman. Witness.

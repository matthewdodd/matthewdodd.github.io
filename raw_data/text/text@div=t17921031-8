               <p>Wright. This seems to be the same; it is marked 4683; there are two initial letters, G. C. they signification are of the ship the General Coote; we had three chests by the same ship; they were amongothers in the front shop.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about it; they asked me to cary it, and said they would give me 6 d. I said I would if I could, but it was too heavy.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of the tea? - don't over value it, place it rather under than over the mark? - It is worth at least 10 l. my Lord.</p>

                  </hi> I am messenger at the General Post-office. On the morning of 1st Feb., about nine o'clock, I was on duty in the Inland-office—the prisoner was employed there, sorting letters to go by the morning mail—he sat at a table—I saw a letter on his left side—he threw his handkerchief over it, and then put the handkerchief into his right trowsers pocket—there was no letter then—I went round the office, returned in about half an hour, and saw him put another letter under his left arm, which was along the edge of the table, not toughing it—after he had sorted all the letters in his left hand, he pushed the letter out of sight, under some French newspapers—he then put his hand under the newspapers, moved it, drew it out, and put it into his left breeches pocket—I could not see anything in his hand—I told the president on duty.</p>

                  </hi> On 1st Feb., at a quarter past nine o'clock in the morning, I was on duty as president at the Post-office—Forbes told me something, and sent for the prisoner into the superintendent's room, and said, "Mr. Eagle, it has been intimated to me that you have letters secreted about your person; is it so?"—he gave no answer, but shook his head—I said, "have you any objection to be searched?"—shook his head again, and murmured, "No,—Peak, who was there, searched him, and took a letter from his left trowsers pocket, and another from the right—I put my initials on both—on was addressed to Mr. Wheatley—these letters would come to his hand in the course of business that day—he was sorter of the South western Railway letters—if a letter had been put in overnight at Barnsbury-park it would bear the impression this letter to Mrs. Wheatley bear, and would be in the division he was sorting.</p>

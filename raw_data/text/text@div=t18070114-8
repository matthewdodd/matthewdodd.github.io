               <p>Q. What age was the child. - A. About seven years old. When a mob of people collected, and in the mob I saw the prisoner in the act of pulling my watch from my fob; I observed the prisoner drawing the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master and family went to the play that night. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were carrying a girl in your arms, and while you were carrying this girl to the coach you found somebody take the watch from your pocket. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then. - A. I collared him; I said, you rascal you have robbed me; my master called out to me to give him the child. Then I laid hold of the prisoner with both hands, I called out to the watch, to whom I gave him in charge; I saw him shift the watch from one of his hands to another; I called out there goes my watch. After stopping twenty minutes two other watchmen came and took him to the watchhouse.</p>

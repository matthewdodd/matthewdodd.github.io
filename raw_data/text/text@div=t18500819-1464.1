                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper at Messrs. Joseph Somes and Frederick Somes's dock, at Poplar. On 2nd Aug. I went with another man to seek for a pump—I came to a ditch, 300 or 400 yards from Messrs. Somes's—when we got near it we heard a knocking, and when we got a little further on, the four prisoners, who were in the ditch, rose up, and walked away—they saw us—we walked after them, and then they all ran as fast as they could—we followed them, got help, and gave them into custody—we went back to the ditch, and found these two pieces of the pump there—I know it, and have no doubt of its being the prosecutors'—I found these chisels, a hammer, and another piece of the pump, in another ditch, a little distance off—I know all the prisoners by sight—Hillier has worked on the prosecutors' premises.</p>

I went with Thomas Slater in search of the pump—when we came near the ditch the four prisoners rose up; they walked a short distance, and then ran—I had heard a noise of a hammer and chisel, which appeared to come from the ditch, close by the pump—I pursued them—they ran very nearly across the second field—they crossed a ditch—I came up to them—I passed between Burke and Welch—I then passed Hillier—he said, "What the h—are you running after us for?"—I said, could not I run in the marsh as well as he?—he said he thought we were running after him—they stood a while, and looked about, and then came together again—one of them threw himself on the ground, and said if I wanted him I might carry him—we got assistance, and took the pri<lb></lb>soners—I went back, and found the pump, these hammers, and a chisel—Welch said he should get into trouble for having a drink of beer with them.</p>

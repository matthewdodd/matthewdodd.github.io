               <p>JONAH SMITH WELLS. I live in Zion-gardens, Aldermanbury. On the 30th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was on <placeName id="t18310630-102-crimeloc549">Ludgate-hill</placeName>

               <p>FRANCIS WARDEN. I was in company with Mr. Wells. I saw him collar the prisoner, and take the handkerchief from him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BECK. I received him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the gentleman's handkerchief - he turned round, said it was his, and took it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>MR. WELLS. It was in his hand when I seized him and he put it into his breast - he did not say he had picked it up, but complained of my tearing his clothes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On the 26th of December, I was at Mrs. Levy's house, in a court in Rosemary-lane, when the officers came in; the prisoner Shirley came in first, with a bundle tied in a blue apron, and then the woman came in; he put his on the counter, at the right-hand side as he came in at the door; when the woman came in, she bolted the top bolt of the street-door, with her left-hand, she had a bundle underneath her brown cloak, and then Shirley took the bundle off the counter, and came into the back-room; then there was a knock at the door, and an old gentleman opened it, and the officers came in; then he dropped the bundle immediately, and the woman slipped a parcel of leather from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Shirley's defence. I work at the water-side, and this woman brought these things home, she picked them up; I was very uneasy about their being in the place, and I did not go home all that night, or the next day, I did not like to come home; we live in Hackney-road, and I went with her to Mrs. Levy's house, for she said she could leave them there, and then I could come home.</p>
               <p>Ewen's defence. I had occasion to go out of the road a little, and trod upon this parcel; I picked it up and brought it home, and when my companion came home, he was very angry, he went away, and would not come back till it was gone, he was afraid, and we took them to leave them at Mrs. Levy's house, that my husband might come home again, and when we got into the house, this gentleman laid hold of us.</p>

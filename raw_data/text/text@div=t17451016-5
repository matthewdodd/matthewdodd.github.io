            , [master of the workhouse.] The Prisoner belongs to the parish of St. John, Hackney, and has been in the work-house. These goods were lost out of the work-house; I had a suspicion of the Prisoner, and sent after her, and heard of her in Castle street. She had broke over the wall, and took the things away. I have known her about three years and an half, she is about 26 years of age, and able to work, but does not love it. She says the gentlemen shall maintain her without working.</p>
               <p>White. I am out of my senses sometimes, and I have hanged myself , and the master of the workhouse has cut me down again. Ask him whether he has not.</p>
               <p>Fletcher . No, I never did cut her down. She can sham mad when she pleases. I do not take her to be mad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever attempt to hang herself?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174510160004"></xptr>Fletcher . Yes, she did when we brought her in a cart to Newgate. She would put a string about her neck sometimes, and make us believe she would hang herself; but she has more wit than to do that.</p>

             . A person belonging to the work-house said, when he heard the work-house was robbed, he suspected the Prisoner, and went into Castle street, and found the things at Mr. Smith's, where the Prisoner had left them, and she found the Prisoner at, lodging house, and brought her to her own house. That when the Prisoner saw him, she said, d - you, what do you do here? and he said, he came to take her for robbing the work-house, but she denied the fact, though she had a shift and a hood on that belonged to their people: and the other things were in the bundle she brought there.</p>

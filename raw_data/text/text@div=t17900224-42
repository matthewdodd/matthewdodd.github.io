               <p>I am not a housekeeper; Mr. Povey is the landlord, and lives there, and lets the rest of the apartments: I lost the things by the room door being forced open, and two boxes; it was the 8th; I went out about seven in the morning, and came back within a quarter of twelve at night.</p>
               <p>How did you find your door when you came back? - I locked it, and carried the key down to the landlady, to make the bed; when I came home I found the door open; the staple of the door was forced back, and I went and looked at my boxes, and found them broke open, and all my property gone; I have never had any of my property but one shirt; it is in the constable's hands; the constable has it here.</p>
               <p>As to the door of the house, was that broke open? - I cannot say to that.</p>

               <p>The house belongs to my husband, we live in it; and let part of it to lodgers. I went up stairs, as usual, about four o'clock, to make the bed, and at that time every thing was safe; I had the key till the time he came home? I know Mr. Close had boxes in the room, but I know nothing what was missing.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner in custody on the 19th of May, between nine and ten o'clock; he was lying down in the street when I first saw him; the prosecutor came up and was taking hold of him; Forbes said "What is all this? the prosecutor said "This young man has robbed me;" he took him up and was leading him to the public-house; I followed about a yard behind them, and saw this handkerchief fall from the front of the prisoner; I said "Here is a handkerchief;" one of our patrols took it up and carried it into the public-house - I saw him give it to Forbes - Carrick owned it.</p>

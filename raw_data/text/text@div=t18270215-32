I am servant to Mr. Morees, the violin player, and had been assisting him at a party that night; I was perfectly sober, and was going straight home; I had taken no liberties with her.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was calling twelve o'clock in Skinner-street; the watch was called - I went up, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner together; he charged her with having robbed him of better than 14s.; she said nothing to the charge; I took her to the watch-house, and the inspector found four half-crowns, three shillings, and two sixpences on her. Baker described the money as being in those coins.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch; the prisoner was brought in; Baker said he had lost four half-crowns, three shillings, and two sixpences; I asked what money she had about her; she hesitated, and at last said she had 9s.; I asked her to produce it - she took from her bosom one half-crown, three shillings, and two sixpences, and 5d. from her pocket; I desired her to loosen her clothes, which she did; I shook them, and three half-crowns fell from them; I found no more on her; she said,"Recollect, I told you at first I did not know how much I had about me;" she had said so at first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He met me, and took me up a turning, and gave me this money, not knowing what it was; I said I would sooner go home with him than go up there; I said, "You go up the turning, and I will follow you;" but I ran away, and he accused me of the robbery.</p>

            . I am a jeweller at Temple-Bar, the prisoner about six weeks ago, brought a diamond ring to me, and changed it with me for a gold watch and chain, he said he was going to France. I sold the ring to one Jacobs.</p>
               <p>- Jacobs. I bought a ring of Mr. Warree, which I sold to Mr. Polock.</p>
               <p>Polock. I sold the ring to Mr. Plank.</p>
               <p>Plank. I broke the ring up, I returned the diamond and the setting to Mr. Polock.</p>
               <p>- Polock. I have got the diamond so returned, and the setting is in the hand of Henderson.</p>
               <p>Henderson produced the setting and Diamonds.</p>
               <p>Green. I can swear to the setting and diamonds, the setting is made in a very particular fashion, according to my own fancy.</p>
               <p>- Henderson. I originally set the ring, it is a very particular one, such as I never had before nor since, I am positive this is the setting I made for Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>Green. I lost it out of my bureau, it was kept there in a case, I did not use it very often, I did see it one day I think in August, the prisoner did once see me put it up.</p>

               <p>I found the ring in the passage.</p>

            . I am a cane head maker and chaser. On Monday was fortnight, about six at night I was at Oliver's, the Queen's Head,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180039"></xptr> in Vere Street, Clare Market. Crompton was there ; Oliver and he were talking about some money Crompton was to be paid; Oliver gave him a direction, he asked me to write it, it was to enquire for Proven, at the Cooper's Arms, in Saffron Street, Saffron Hill. When I gave him the direction we walked out together as far as the Hay-market; we returned again about eleven o'clock, then Crompton told Oliver, who is a shoe-maker, that he must let him have a pair of shoes for the girl he lived with, and produced a measure. As we were going home, just at the end of Drury Lane, Jealous came up with a cutlass, and stopped Crompton, and said, if he stirred he would cut his head off; and took him away. The next day I saw Jealous at the Golden Cross; I asked him what he had done with Crompton, and told him, I believed I could give him a direction where he would find some things; and gave him a direction to Proven.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the direction again?</p>
               <p>Hyde. He gave it me that day when he was fully committed, to give to Dugard, and I gave it to Jealous; Jealous and I, and Cross went to Proven's, where we found the skins.</p>

               <p>Dugard's Defence.</p>
               <p>Going through Leicester Fields on the Saturday night, I found the leather by the rails. I went to Cranbone Alley, and met with Crompton; I asked him to help me to carry it to Oliver's; we carried it, and asked him if he would buy it; he said no, but he would bring a man that would buy it and a cart load more, if we had it. We went to the public house, and he came, and said, there were eighteen skins, that he had looked over six of them, and those six came to twenty-three shillings. Proven was sent for, and talked about buying it, and said, he would get in the mony that night >, if he could.</p>
               <p>Crompton in his defence, said the same as Dugard had done.</p>

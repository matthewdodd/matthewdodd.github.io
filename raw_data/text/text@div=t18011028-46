               <p>BENJAMIN BILBO sworn. - I am a patrol at Hampstead: On the 7th of October, about half past seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner with four fowls tied by the legs; I stopped him, and asked him where he got them; he said, he bought them; I asked him how far off; he said, eighteen or twenty miles; I put my hand to them, and found them hot and bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from Mr. Inglish's? - A. I don't suppose it is a quarter of a mile.</p>



               <p>Mr. Inglish. I have seen the fowls, and I have no doubt they were mine; one of them was without a head, and the head was found in my yard; one of them was a bantum cock; two or three of them were rather remarkable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

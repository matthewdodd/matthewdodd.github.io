               <p>How came you to take it? - I took it from him, and gave it to the child that very instant, within ten minutes of the robbery; the boy remained with me all the time; we took care of him, for fear the rest should be gone.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time the prisoner Damant was holding Meason up, was the bag taken out of Meason's hand? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>I only apprehended the prisoners Mitton and Read.</p>
               <p>PRISONER DAMANT's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, I was not nigh the place; I was just come from my father's; I was coming down Golden-lane, and this man took me back to the place, to the boy, and the boy directly said, I was one.</p>
               <p>PRISONER READ's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I live in Grubb-street, and three officers came and took me out of the room; I knew no more about it than a child unborn.</p>
               <p>PRISONER MITTON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming through Cherry-tree-alley; and I saw the boy crying, and there were a parcel of watch materials laying on the ground; and two men ran away; and one of them dropped a watch case; and I picked it up and gave it to the woman, and desired her to give it to the boy that was crying.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Mitton called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

            , Esq; the prisoner married a fellow servant of mine; they were permitted to live in my master's house, while the family were in the country. They came to town on the 24th of October; then the goods mentioned in the indictment were missing.</p>
               <p>Court. Name the things.</p>
               <p>J. Baterson. There was a silver saucepan, 7 linen tablecloths, 2 shirts, 1 damask napkin, and a pair of black velvet breeches; these were the property of my master: one pair of black silk stockings, a crimson velvet shag waistcoat, and a black coat and waistcoat; these were my master's son's. We had a suspicion of the prisoner, because the young woman said nobody was in the house but him and her. We took him up, and he confessed he had taken the things, and where he had pawned them. I was at the finding them at the several pawnbrokers.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. East, we went out of town in July. My master let the prisoner and his wife stay in the house till we returned, which was in October; then all these things mention'd were missing. We took the prisoner up, and he confessed in my hearing he had taken them, and also where he had pawn'd them. Justice Fielding granted a search warrant, I went with the other witness, and we found them all again.</p>

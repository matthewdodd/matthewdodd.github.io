               <p>It appear'd that about Eight at Night, the Prosecutor's Wife having just served a Customer, was going out of the Shop into the Kitchen, when she heard a Noise behind her, and turning back, saw the Prisoner with the Drawer in his Hand. He ran out; she cry'd, Stop Thief. He was pursued by some Neighbours; and finding himself in Danger, he threw the Drawer down, and cry'd Stop Thief as well as they; but then it was of no Service to him, for he was presently taken. <rs id="t17251013-29-verdict140" type="verdictDescription">

             is the landlord, and lives in the house. On Saturday, the 6th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I went out and did not lock my door. I had a chest of drawers in my room, which were not locked. I returned between eight and nine o'clock at night; and between eleven and twelve, when I went to bed, on opening the lower drawer I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which I had seen safe on the Wednesday or Thursday previous. I saw part of them again on the Monday following at a pawnbroker's. The whole are worth above 3 l.</p>

            . I have seen the prisoner three or four times; on Saturday afternoon, the 6th of March, she came into my room for something I had to wash for her, and enquired for Mrs. Sims, and asked me to pawn these things for her, as she knew a young man who was in trouble, and wanted to make up some money for him - I took them from her, believing them to belong to the young man she lived with. I pawned the same articles she gave me without opening the bundle, for 25 s.; she stopped in my room while I went, and when I returned I gave her the money. Before I took the things I saw her put a pair of trowsers on a chair in my room, and she left them there, and on the Tuesday they were claimed, and I gave them to the officer. On Monday morning, in consequence of a message from the prisoner I got 5 s. more upon the clothes; I sent to her to say I wished to speak to her, but did not see her.</p>

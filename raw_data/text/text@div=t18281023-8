            . I am a turnkey of Giltspur-street Compter. I was asked to walk down Snow-hill with Herdsfield; I saw the prisoner with two others in company - I crossed over, met the prisoner alone, and took him to the Compter; while I was searching him he put his hand into his breeches pocket, produced the handkerchief, and said he did not think I had seen him pick any body's pocket - the prosecutor came in with Herdsfield, and claimed it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230011"></xptr>Herdsfield went after the others, and brought one of them to the Compter.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Cheapside, and at the corner of Newgate-street I saw the handkerchief on the ground, and took it up; when I got further the two persons came and said it was their's - I asked them to describe it; they said it was a black Belcher; I said it was not, and I should not give it to them - they turned round, said, "Here is Charley," and left me; Herdsfield took me.</p>

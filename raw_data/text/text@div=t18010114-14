               <p>Q. Was it a common thing for the men to go out with their aprons tied up? - A. No; Mr. Pike desired him to untie it, and told him, he believed he had got something that did not belong to him; he had got a piece of cloth containing thirty-six ells; Pike asked him how he came to do such a thing, and then he begged for God's sake we would say nothing to Mr. Dixon about it, he was only going to take it home to have some shirts cut out for his son, and he would have brought the remainder of the piece back again; he requested we would say nothing about it, and we let him go home to his breakfast; then we called Mr. Dixon from his breakfast, and

               <p>Norman. His great-coat was tied up in the same paper, I had seen him tie up the great-coat with it, while I was at breakfast, which gave me the first suspicion; he was then eight or ten yards from the door; he had enquired of every one for a bundle handkerchief, and no one would lend it him; then he took his apron, and took this piece of cotton, and tied it up with the great-coat in the apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you speak to him then, at that time? - A. Because I was not justified.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were not you justified? - A. Because a man might have a piece of cloth to carry forward, but he could not have it for his work, for five hours from that time, at least, for he had ten pieces of Irish linen then open before him, to cut into shirts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never in my life, directly, or indirectly took any thing from Mr. Dixon's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140019"></xptr>shop, with intention to defraud him; Mr. Dixon has told me, I might, it any time, have any goods that I wanted, and pay him as I could; I took this piece, meaning to put it down on the other side, for Mr. Dixon's inspection, against I came back from breakfast; Mr. Pike called me back, and I stopped directly and put it down.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Dixon.) Did you ever authorise this man to take any goods for you to price them afterwards? - A. Never; if they want a coat or a shirt, or any thing I deal in, that they want, I let them have it at what it cost me.</p>

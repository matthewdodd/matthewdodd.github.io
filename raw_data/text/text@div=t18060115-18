               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix has taken a false oath; the first time that I saw her she was very much in liquor, she was put to bed, and some person went to bed to her, she said she was come to town to walk London streets; she had lost her character at Feversham; I am a wife and a mother, though I have a blackguard husband; I took the liberty of putting these things on, as any body might have done the same with my things.</p>

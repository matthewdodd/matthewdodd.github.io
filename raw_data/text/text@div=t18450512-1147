                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Sir William Magnay, who has one partner. The prisoner was in their employ as out-door clerk—it was his duty to collect orders and to receive money, which it was his duty to enter in his own book, and pay it over to me the same day that he received it—the book he kept was one in which he ought to enter the goods he sold, and the money he received; and in the evening he would say what monies he had received, and pay them to me—he did not pay me a check for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor the proceeds of it—he did not at any time pay me a check of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor the proceeds of it—if he had paid me the checks they would have gone through our bankers—these checks have not been through my hands at all—he never paid me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash on account of Mr. Watson—it was his duty to pay checks and money to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you, the cashier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was hit duty to pay it over to me as soon as he received it—that was the rule of the house—it is very likely I might have told him it was his duty to do to—I have no knowledge that Mr. Magnay has done so in my hearing—a month has not intervened between the times of his accounting to me—when I receive money I enter it in a book in which I enter money for the bankers—on Saturday, or any other day, the prisoner comes about five o'clock and pays me, and I enter the sums—he has never brought in large sums which have been collected during several days—this if the cash-book—I enter in this book from whom I receive the money—it agrees with the bankers'-book—I do not put down the prisoners name in this book—I put down the money as received from Mr. Watson, if it was received from him—this book would not tell from whose hands I received it—I sign the prisoner's own book as having received the money—this is it—the whole of this book, I believe, is the prisoner's writing—here is the month of Nov.—here is no entry of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 16th, the 18th, or the 19th—he enters in this book the goods he sells, and gives credit for the cash he receives—they are entries of orders from different persons, and of cash—here is one entry, "Donnison, by cash, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and some others—these are goods sold by him—some of them have a credit entry under them, and some have not—those which have no credit under them would not be paid at the time—if he receives the money he enters it, gives me the money, and I sign this book—the ledger will show all the money I received from him, but the entries are not in his name; it will only indi<lb></lb>cate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120132"></xptr>
               <p>that I received the money from Watson, or from any other customer—the prisoner had no access to the ledger—the ledger and cash-book con<lb></lb>tain the amounts of all the money I receive from all the clerks—this book of the prisoner's contains my signatures for what money he paid—the largest sum he has paid me is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one individual—he never paid any sum in gross, composed of more than one debt—I would not have taken it so—if in the course of his business he re<lb></lb>ceived 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he would pay it when he came in at night—he was there every night, and I was there, and this pass-book passed between us every night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Sir William Magnay. The prisoner was in our service—it was his duty to receive money, and to account for it the day he received it—he had to collect orders in London only, not in the country—there is a country traveller and a town clerk-about two months ago I spoke to the prisoner about 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from Teape and Son—I said, "It is very strange that Mr. Teape has not paid his account, being so wealthy a man"—he said, "It will be paid next Saturday"—that had reference to the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you have been very unfortunate in your servants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a great portion of them have been taken up, and are to be prosecuted on some charge of felony—they were charged before Sir Peter Laurie, and were remanded—in the first instance I charged the prisoner as being one concerned in that felony; in point of fact, with stealing paper—he was remanded at my request, but if he could have found bail they would have taken it—Sir Chapman Marshall, I be<lb></lb>lieve, heard the case first—he admitted him to bail, but he did not find bail, and continued in custody—I think he was not in custody on a charge of felony more than a week, and then we brought this charge—he was remanded on account of the embezzlement—our first charge was that be stole our property, and he was remanded on that charge—we did not at that time make a charge of embezzlement—the second time he was brought up before Sir Peter Laurie, and I am not quite certain whether the charge of larceny was gone into against him—I think that was the time that the charge of embezzlement was made against him—I told Sir Peter Laurie we had charges of embezzlement against him, on which he remanded him at my request—I told Mr. Clarkson we had charges of embezzlement—when we made the charge of embezzlement the charge of larceny was</p>

               <p>not abandoned, but we have abandoned it now—he it not now here on a charge of larceny—I think he was taken up about the 18th or 19th of April.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Within a few days afterwards, did he not tender, through his soli<lb></lb>citor, all his accounts, and the whole balance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to me—his friends had got the money, and wanted to make it a debtor and creditor account, but I would not—the money was not produced—they said, "We have got the money, if you will abandon the charge"—I do not know that any account was produced—it was not produced to me—I have seen no account—the money was not tendered—the expression made use of was, "The money is in my pocket, if you like to take it"—I had not then been examined on oath on the charge of embezzlement—I think I was examined on oath to substantiate this charge on the 14th of May, which was a few days after the person told me he had the money—but I had intimated that I should have a charge of embezzlement against him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

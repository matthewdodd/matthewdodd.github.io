               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. I suppose you had a great deal of conversation with him? A. I charged him in consequence of losing some gun metal - I then found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040089"></xptr>the drawer where these cocks had been was perfectly empty - I did not say it would be better for him to tell me - I said, "This drawer was full of cocks, and they are gone" - he then said, "I have taken from six to eight."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say any thing more? A. No; only expressing my belief that he had taken other things - he had no authority to take them - he said he took them to pieces to make them more portable, and he had sold them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Did you say one word of that before the magistrate? A. I am not certain, but my father did - I was sworn to tell the whole truth - my deposition was read over to me - I was not asked if I had any thing to alter or to add to it - the clerk gave me the paper, and told me to read it and sign it, which I did - I will not swear whether the clerk asked me if I had any thing to add to it - my father swore that the prisoner said that he took them to pieces for the purpose of taking them off - I don't know whether that was taken down - I think my father stated that - I will not swear that he did - my impression is that he did say it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALEXANDER GALLOWAY. I was present when my son brought the prisoner into my counting-house, stating that he had missed a number of cocks, and the prisoner had admitted he had taken six or eight, and sold them to some man in Turnmill-street. I expressed my astonishment that a youth like him should have so degraded himself as to take property with which he had been intrusted, and I asked him how he took them - he said he had separated the parts and taken them in his several pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the officer present at this conversation? A. No; my son and the prisoner and myself were present when he stated this, and asked for mercy and forgiveness - I then sent for the officer, and he never denied any statement that he had made in the presence of me and my son.</p>

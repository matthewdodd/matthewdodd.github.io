            . I am the wife of Charles Lindfield - we took the White Swan public-house, Chandos-street, Covent-garden, and left it on the 10th of March; I employed the prisoner to move our goods from there to <placeName id="t18270405-43-crimeloc241">Dorset-place, Pall Mall East</placeName>

The door must have been opened by a false-key.</p>

            . I am a clerk, and lodge in the next room to the prosecutor, in Dorset-place. I went home on Tuesday evening, the 21st of March, and the landlord said he suspected a man was concealed in the prosecutor's room - we went up, and unlocked the door, but could not get in, as it was bolted inside; we then heard the window open, and a cry in the street, that a man was getting out; I turned the key, and ran down stairs; the person then got into the room again - in a few minutes the prisoner rushed out at the front door; he must have forced the room door open - he was stopped about one hundred yards off; I am confident of his person - he threw a great coat away as he ran, and that is lost - he got from us again, and was taken in an hour or an hour and a half, at a house in Maiden-lane, Chandos-street. I found every box and drawer in the room broken open - nobody but him came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time was it? A. About a quarter-past six o'clock - we took him about a quarter past eight, coming down the stairs of No. 43, Maiden-lane.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fleming, a pawnbroker, of Fleet-market. On the 21st of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner pawned a snuff-box, seven tea-spoons, and a pair of sugar-tongs, for 26s., in the name of James Lingfield, No. 3, Turnagain-lane; I am certain he is the man - I saw him in custody again the next day, at twelve o'clock - he stood close against the gas-light. I am certain of him.</p>

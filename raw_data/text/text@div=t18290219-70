            . I am a stationer, and live in George-yard, Snow-hill. On the 7th of February, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another in the yard, watching about; four firkins and a chest of oranges stood ready to be loaded - I saw the prisoner take this firkin on his shoulder: the other person run away - he had been watching the booking-office while the prisoner stood at the cart; they hallooed after them - the prisoner threw the firkin down, which burst the lid out; he ran away, and was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the other man of more respectable appearance than the prisoner? A. No; they were about the same - he said a gentleman employed him to take it; I believe he got away from the officer, and struck him.</p>

            . I am a constable. About two o'clock I was under the gateway of the George inn, and heard something very heavy fall - I turned round, and saw the firkin lying down; a man called out Stop him! the prisoner ran towards me, and as he came near me he put his fists together, and fought his way by me, but I struggled with him about two minutes, and secured him, with assistance; when I got to the end of the yard, and turned my head to beckon to a man to assist me, he slip<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190032"></xptr>ped out of my hand, and ran off; he dropped a handkerchief, which I suppose was meant to detain me: I did not stoop to pick it up, but ran and took him - I only lost sight of him as he turned the corner; I tore his jacket in the struggle, and found it still torn.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lost sight of him? A. For one minute; when I attempted to take him he shewed resistance.</p>

            . I was on the near side of the cart when the prisoner was on the off side; I did not see him take the firkin, but saw him come from the cart with it, and I called after him; I saw him throw it down, and called Stop him! I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was not long in sight? A. I did not lose sight of him - they brought him back.(Firkin produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was going through George-yard, and a gentleman asked me to take a cask for him over Blackfriars-bridge; he said, "Come this way, and take that up;" I immediately took it up, and had not gone for before I heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned round, a man collared me, and the cask fell down.</p>

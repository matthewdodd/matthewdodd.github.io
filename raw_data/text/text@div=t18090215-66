            . On the 28th of January, Mr. Phillips and I were coming to London; just by the debtor's door at Newgate, there were three or four ran against Mr. Phillips; as soon as we got inside of the debtor's door of Newgate, he observed that he had lost his pocket book; I then observed to him that he had a check of mine for seven pounds seventeen shillings, that I had given him some days previous; it was payable at Mr. Lefevre's; I immediately ran off to Mr. Lefevre's as fast as I could; I was desired by the clerk to stop a little while, in all probability it would be brought into the house; I stopped about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and the check was brought in by one Farmer, a ticket porter; I followed the porter at some distance, until I was at the Antigallican coffee house; when I came there, the porter said he was not in the place; in consequence of waiting three or four minutes, I saw this young lad, the prisoner, he was standing inside of the outer door, as if he was looking for the porter; I went and took hold of him, I said my lad, I believe you are the gentleman that I am looking after; the porter came out and said this is the man that gave me the check; I went immediately to Mr. Lefevre, and from there to the Mansion house.</p>

            . I am a ticket porter, at the Old Stock Exchange. The prisoner came to me and gave me a check to get it cashed; I am certain the prisoner is the person that gave it me; I took it to Mr. Lefevre.

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the Mansion house; I searched him; I found upon him five one pound notes, and a sham bill for one hundred pounds; he gave no satisfactory account to the lord mayor, how he came by these notes; the lord mayor ordered me to keep them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Moore. Look at that check - A. The 14th of December, that is the date of it; that is the check I gave to Mr. Phillips on the Thursday before this happened; I have no doubt of it in the least; I took this check in payment; I kept it till the 26th of January, I gave it to Mr. Phillips, as he was going in the City, for him to call at Mr. Lesevre's and get the money for me.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a boy came into the banker's shop - A. When Mr. Phillips was stopped; I noticed two boys; I suppose there were four or five; these seemed to be about ten in all; I was noticing a man asking Mr. Phillips if that was Newgate; he said it looks like Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner near him then - A. I did; I told Mr. Churchyard; I saw no boy in the office; there might have been a lad; I never saw any lad there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, this note you gave to Mr. Phillips on the 26th of January, you were with him on the 28th - A. Yes. On the 27th Mr. Phillips was coming to town, he did not come; on the 28th I said I would come with him. I know the note was dated the 14th of December, and payable at Mr. Lefevre's, seven pounds seventeen shillings. I told Mr. Lefevre so in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Phillips. What did you do with the bill that you received from Mr. Moore - A I put it in my pocket book, and to the best of my knowledge never saw it any more; I never took it out to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the date of it - A. No; I know when the check was produced; he told me it was payable at Cornhill, and when I was at Cornhill I should have looked to see where it was drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any of the persons that were about you at Newgate - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of your other property been found - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. In your pocket book had you any notes of the value of one pound each - A. No; I had two five pounds notes, no lesser.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the time when you received a bill from Mr. Moore - A. I recollect it was on the 26th, and I recollect putting it in my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken the book out of your pocket for the purpose of looking into it - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your pocket book in the course of that time been out of your possession - A. Not to my knowledge; I never make a practice of taking my pocket book out of my pocket; when I take my coat off I leave my pocket book in it; I had in my pocket book a great number of memorandums and receipts, that I cannot show now.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 28th, at the time when you were before Newgate, you lost your pocket book, might not you have lost the note that I have in my hand, between the 26th and the 28th - A. I do not know but I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you took out the pocket book for various purposes between the 26th and the 28th - A. I had; I went back to the chambers to see whether I had left it there; I knew not where I lost it; at No. 10, Furnival's inn I knew I put it in my pocket; when I came to Newgate I found I had lost it; I went back to Furnival's inn to see whether I had left it there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you apt to lose notes out of your pocket book - A. Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep your notes so careless in your pocket book - A. Yes; I put it among papers, where I do not put notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Because it belonged to your friend - A. I cannot say whether it was there or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the burthen of your story, you cannot say whether it was there or not.</p>

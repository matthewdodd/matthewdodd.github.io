                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Temple-place, New-cross, Old Kent-road. On Friday, the 2nd of June, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was in a room at the bottom of my passage, saw the house-door open, and found the prisoner in my back room—the door was shut before, I believe—he must have come in through the shop to the back room—I stepped for<lb></lb>ward in the passage and took hold of him, as he came through the door—he got from me—I called "Stop thief"—he was pursued, taken, and brought</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner run down Mason-street, about 150 yards from the prosecutrix's house, and several people hallooing "Stop thief"—when he got opposite our shop, I saw him take his hand out of his pocket, and throw something down—I could not tell what, till I got across the road, into the garden—I there picked up a watch—I brought it back to Mrs. Hammond—a butcher secured him, but an ostler brought him back.</p>

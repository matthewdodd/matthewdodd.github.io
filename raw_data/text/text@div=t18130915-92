               <p>Q. At that time did you see the other prisoner - A. I did, he was on the left of Farthing, and in order to let them pass I looked into a shop; they passed me and proceeded forward two or three doors; I had a full view of the prisoners; I am certain they are the same men that was behind me when I felt Farthing's hand in my pocket. I then passed them. They followed me. I did not observe that until a little time afterwards, when I felt some one behind me again. I looked round; the prisoner, Farthing, was on my right hand, and Wright on his left hand, the same as before. Soon afterwards I felt a hand in my pocket; my handkerchief was there then, and when I felt two doors further my handkerchief was gone. I immediately turned round when my handkerchief was gone, and the prisoners were gone. I then went back to Temple-bar; I saw two officers; I told them the circumstance, and that I could swear to my handkerchief. They went after the prisoners. I saw them searched; my handkerchief was found upon Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. They were together when you found them - A. They were.</p>

We searched them; in Wright's hat there was found two cotton handkerchiefs, and in his pocket three silk handkerchiefs. This is the handkerchief the prosecutor claimed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief.</p>

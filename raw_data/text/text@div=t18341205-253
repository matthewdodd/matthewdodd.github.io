                  </hi>. I keep the Bedford Head, in Old-street. On the 5th of December the prisoner came to my house with a man—the man asked for her to go into my yard—I gave permission—she went and staid a long time—I went to see after her—my servant said she had been in the kitchen—I met her in the passage, and asked her what she had under her cloak—she said nothing—she was examined by a constable, and this set of fire-irons was found under her cloak—they belong to me, and had been in my kitchen.</p>

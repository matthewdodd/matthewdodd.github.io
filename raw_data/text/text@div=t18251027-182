I am nineteen years of age. I met the prisoner, who was alone, about half-past six o'clock on the evening of the 26th of September, in Whitechapel - I was quite sober - she asked me to go down Wentworth-street with her - I went to a house in <placeName id="t18251027-182-crimeloc1045">Woodgate-court</placeName>

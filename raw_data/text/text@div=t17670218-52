I went up stairs with him to the next room to the lodge-room, upon the same floor; he asked me to give him two half guineas for a guinea; (it is a general rule to deposit half a guinea when a mason is made) I pulled out my purse, there might be 30 or 40 guineas in it; I put it on the table; the master of the lodge immediately called; the prisoner had given me his guinea; I in a hurry took up part of my money, but I left some upon the table; I can safely say there were five guineas left; I went that moment into the mason's room, I had not time to take it all up; (I had put it down in order to look out two half guineas for his guinea) I was not absent I believe a minute, nor two I am sure; and when I came back, the prisoner and money was gone; I went down stairs immediately; he was got into the bar, in order to take his great coat, as I apprehend since; (he went then by the name of Thompson) I said, Mr. Thompson, did you take any money off the table; he said, yes, I did take five guineas; I said, what did you take it off the table for; he said, I took it only to secure it, as you was gone; he bell rang again, and I ran up stairs; I don't suppose I was absent three minutes, and when I came down again, he was gone with his great coat; that night I took some friends with me and pursued him; I understood he used the night houses about Covent-garden; I dare say I spent more than 10 l in looking for him; I had been there every night; I had mentioned him to a gentleman that knew him, and I found he was a person of very bad character; last Saturday night a person came and said, run out, Walker, he is just gone by; I ran out, and found him in an earthen-ware shop, cheapening some things; when he came out of the shop, I laid hold of him, and said, Mr. Thompson, I want to speak with you; said he, I am in a violent hurry now; I said, I must speak with you; I am in a violent hurry, said he again; I said, I take you up as a thief, you stole my money in my house; said he, what, for them few guineas; go with me into Queen-street, Cheapside, and I'll give you security for your money; I said, no, you shall never be discharged till you come to the Old-Bailey; I took him into my house, and kept him there till I had time to send for an acquaintance to assist me with him to the Compter; when I took him out of the house to go to the Compter, he offered to give me a note of hand for the money; but going along, when he found I had got an officer to take him to the Compter, he swore he would make it a dear taking up, as ever I paid in my life; this was as we were near the pump in St. Paul's church-yard; he said, you villain, did you not give me that five guineas for b - g me; I got him in at the Nag's Head in Cheapside; he went down on his knees, and swore I had served him in that way, and had given him a bad disorder; and this he told the people when we got him into the Compter.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there nobody in the room but the prisoner when you went into the mason's room?</p>
               <p>Walker. No, there was not; there was nobody near him but the tyler, that was obliged to stand at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he took this money from the table in order to secure it for you?</p>
               <p>Walker. He could not pretend any thing of that, though he told me so below.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the money gone that you left upon the table?</p>
               <p>Walker. It was, there was not a single piece left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never talk of bringing a writ against him for the recovery of the money?</p>
               <p>Walker, No, not for this; I did for a debt that he owed me; I had lent him half a guinea, and hired a horse for him, and he had run some in liquor; the debt was about 53 s.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he come the first time you saw him?</p>
               <p>Walker. That night he came in a coach; Mr. Gill that lodges at my house brought about three in the morning; Mr. Gill requested he might have a bed at my house that night; I had all my beds full, as all the Chester traders come to my house; I had no bed empty; I said he might lie with me, as I should be up in about two hours time; so he lay with me; I got up in about two hours after; I think he said he had been knocked down in Covent-garden; in the morning, about eight, he had a bason of tea carried up, and about ten he desired a dish of coffee.</p>

Thornhill *; he said he had been making interest for him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176702180035"></xptr> Lord Shelburne; he asked me if I was in any employ; I said, not at present, but I expected I should soon; he said it was a pity such a young fellow should be out of employ, and proposed he could do something for me; after that, one night he came home with me to Mr. Walker's, in a coach from Covent-garden; he wanted to borrow half a crown of me; he said he had been abused and struck by a person there; he pretended he could not get in at his lodging, so he came home with me; I went to Mr. Walker, and said, here is such a gentleman, I beg you will let him have a bed here; he said he could let him have no other than to lie with him, and he should be up in an hour or two, so he went to bed; the next morning when he came down stairs, he told Mr. Walker he was going to petition Lord Shelburn on my behalf, and said he would be proposed a mason; I went out, and came home at eleven o'clock, and Mr. Walker told me, that gentleman has stole five guineas from me that you recommended; then I went to Lord Shelburne's to enquire after him, but could hear of no such person there.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the Marshalsea court; I went to Mr. Walker's house to-morrow will be a week at night; there was the prisoner there; Mr. Walker said, I sent for you, for this is the fellow that robbed me of five guineas; then I said, charge him as a thief; said he, I do; he had the prisoner by the collar; the prisoner wanted sadly to get from him at the door; the prisoner said, don't lead me in this manner, charge me as a gentleman; Mr. Walker said, you know you took the five guineas; the prisoner said, I know that; just as we came to the pump in St. Paul's church-yard, said he, do you know, Mr. Walker, what you have done; yes, said Mr. Walker, I have done justice, as every man ought to do. Ah! said the prisoner, no, you have not; do you know what you gave me the five guineas for; said Mr. Walker, I gave you none at all: the prisoner clapped his hands together, and said, (turning to me) he gave me this five guineas for b - g me; and to make you more satisfied it was so, I will make it appear before surgeon Sharpe; said I, this is very hard to say this against a man of such credit; the mob rose about us; the prisoner desired to go in at the trunk-maker's; we went in till the mob dispersed; after that, who should come but Mr. Pain; said I to Mr. Pain, I think you have a right to take charge of this man; said he, I had rather not, but am willing to aid and assist, for I have heard what he has said all the way you came, for I kept close behind you; we went from there, then the prisoner begged to go into the Nag's Head; there be made use of such expressions as was a shame to mention; he said he would send for surgeon Sharpe, but he would not, nor did not; he acknowledged the taking the five guineas, and said he would give a note or satisfaction if we would go to the bottom of Queen-street, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to these words, that the prisoner said he took the money?</p>
               <p>Oliver. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went to Mr. Walker's house on Thursday the 5th instant; he took me up stairs; I told him there in the room, I had not money then to be made a mason, what I had was but 3 s. 6 d. The reply to me was, he would lend me any money that I wanted, and pulled out a sum of money from his pocket, and offered me five guineas into my hand; said he, I will make you a present of this money, if you will not mention the case that was when you lay with me at five o'clock in the morning; after this, I told him I would not accept of that sum of money upon any such terms, but if he would lend me the sum of five guineas, I would be much obliged to him, and pay him very honestly; upon this, he consented and lent it me; I took a guinea out of them, and desired two half guineas; he took it and gave me two half guineas, and then took one of the half guineas and went into the lodge-room to propose me as a mason; after he had been into the club-room, he came out to me, and told me he had proposed me; he went down stairs with me; there I staid some time in the bar, and then told him I could not stay any longer; I wished him a good night, and went away.</p>

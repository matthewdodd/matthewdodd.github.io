                  </hi>. I am foreman labourer to Ditchburn and Mayor, of Blackwall. On the 8th of June, about half-past nine at night, I met the prisoner at the entrance of White Hart-place—he said, "You b—y in—I son of a b—h"—I said nothing to him—he came close to me—I put my hand to him and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away, and said, "Be off from me"—I did so again, then went into my own house and sat down-there was a knock at the door in four or five minutes—my wife answered it—I heard him say to my wife, "Open the door, I want to see that b—y son of a b—b"—when I heard that, I went out—the prisoner came up close to the door, with his hand right clenched—I said to my wife, "Go in, he has a knife in his hand"—he was within six feet of me—I cannot swear I saw the knife, but thought so by the manner he held his fist—he was within six feet, and must have heard me say he had a knife—he came up close to the door—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him from me—he came up to me again violently—I did the same again, to defend myself—I put out my hand—he laid hold of me-we both <hi rend="italic">tussled</hi> and went to the ground together, and before we could get off the ground, I got a stab, and after that was senseless, and do not know what happened—I was in the act of getting off the ground at the time I received the blow—it was done with a sharp instrument—the prisoner gave me that blow—there was nobody but him near me—when I came to myself I was in doors, in my own house.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Poplar, On the 8th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prosecutor—he was very faint-the left side of his head and face were covered with blood-the back part of his head had an incised wound, penetrating to the bone, laying it bare—on the forehead was another wound an inch and a quarter long, merely dividing the skin—they were incised wounds—a clean cut done with a knife, I should say—they both bled—the one on the back of the head, considerably—they must have been made with a sharp instrument—the falling on the curb could not have done it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—my husband came home about a quarter-past nine o'clock—a few minutes after, the prisoner knocked at the door—I opened it, and asked what he wanted—he used bad expressions, and said he wanted that vagabond of a husband—my husband came out of the kitchen, and asked what he wanted—he gave him great abuse—my husband told me to go in doors for he had a knife in his hand—the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

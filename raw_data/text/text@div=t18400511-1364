                  </hi>. I have one partner, and we carry on business in St. Martin's-Jane. The prisoner was our errand-boy—in con<lb></lb>sequence of circumstances, I had five half-crowns and ten shillings marked and put into a canvass bag, which I locked in the iron chest, in the count<lb></lb>ing-house, on the 26th of April—on the morning of the 27th I watched and saw the prisoner come into the counting-house with a key in one hand and the canvass bag in the other—he unlocked the chest, and put the bag into it—I then went from the place where I was concealed, and took hold of him—I said, "I have been waiting for you, and have caught you at last"—he said, "What for? I have done nothing"—he then pro<lb></lb>duced this key, and said he had found it in the dust—I went to the bag, and found that a portion of the marked money had been restored, and was in the bag—this is it, but two half-crowns were gone out of it and ten shillings, the rest is in the bag now—this bag has never been out of my possession since—I had put the key of the chest into my pocket when I locked the bag up—the key the prisoner had was a false key.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Francis William Vant, linen-draper, of Woolwich. On the 6th of Aug., about six o'clock in the evening, the pri<lb></lb>soner came, and asked for some long cloth—I served her with some—she then asked for some thread edging—I served her with some, and with three-quarters of a yard of wider lace—while I was serving her I saw her draw two wide pieces off the counter, and put them under her cape—there were ten yards in one piece, and thirteen yards in the other—I made out her bill—she paid me, and went away—I followed her fifty or sixty yards from the shop, watched her all the time, and never lost sight of her—I then said to her, "I</p>

               <p>have missed some pieces of lace, will you come back?"—she said, "O yes certainly"—she came back with me—I brought her to the spot where I had served her, and felt the lace-cards in her pocket—I then put her in the back parlour, and left her there by herself—I set the shop boy to watch—I went for a constable, and he took her.</p>

            . I am an officer of Islington. I heard of the robbery at Mr. Robinson's; there was a reward offered for the fowls: I knew the prisoners, and about twelve o'clock on the Monday I went to John Hancock's house, in White Conduit-fields - I had before that been to Mr. Robinson's premises, and found the lock had been forced off the hen-house door - it appeared as if it had been done with a three pronged fork; I saw footmarks on the ground of more than one or two persons - one was a very large footmark, and the welt of the foot was worn away in one part.

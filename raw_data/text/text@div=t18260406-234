            . I was taken up about this matter, and examined by the Justice - he told me to say nothing, as it might hurt myself. I was at the Angel public-house, at Isleworth, on Friday evening, about nine o'clock- Harris, Ayres, and White were there; we all said, "Let us get a few turnips;" we walked by the Chaise and Horses public-house, and Harris said, "Let us go and get something worth while;" he took us up to Sion-lane - I did not know what he was going after till we came past Mr. Iron's; Ayres, Harris, and White then got over the pales - I could hardly get over, but Ayres eased me over, and we went on till we came to the cow yard - there are some pales round it, and some persons live in the little house by the side of the barn. Ayres and Harris got over the pales - White lifted me over; I waited there - Harris and Ayres got on the top of the cow shed; I heard them pulling the tiles off, and I ran to the other side of the pales. Harris called to White to ease it off the tiles - I did not then know what it was; I went up, and saw White under the tiles, with the lead on his shoulder. - Ayres and Harris got off the tiles, and carried it through the field, till they came to the hedge - Harris then lifted it on White's back, and they got on the sand heap in the Whale field, where they divided it into three pieces - this is one of them; Ayres sold one piece for 2s. 2d., and I sold one for 2s. 3d., and gave the money to Ayres, who shared it; the third piece was left in the sand house, under the straw; we went away; the next day Ayres, Harris, Rowley, and I, went birds' nesting; Harris and Rowley were a-head of us, and got into the Whale field, about a quarter of an hour before we did. I did not see the witness in the field; I heard Harris say somebody had sprang the plant, and I saw Gardner go and say, "What would you give to know who it was?" he said, "I would not mind two pots of beer and a punch of the head."</p>

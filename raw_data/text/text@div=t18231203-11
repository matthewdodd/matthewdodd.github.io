            . I am a constable. On the 5th of November, between one and two o'clock I was in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and at the corner observed the prisoner and two others lifting this package on a post; the prisoner took it on his back, and went a few yards down St. Martin's-le-Grand. I went up and said, "You have got a very heavy load, what does it contain?" (the others had gone down Newgate-street) - he said he did not know; I asked if he had a bill of parcels; he said No, that he was going to Gray's Inn-lane with it, and brought it from Mr. Cowley's in Lombard-street - I said if he was a regular porter he would have a knot; he said he would go with me to where he brought it from. I found the direction was covered with mud, but could see the name Dudley, London. I left it in a shop, and took him to the prosecutor's, which is about twenty-eight yards from the spot - he then said he had done it from distress.</p>

I said I was going towards Gray's Inn-lane, as I lived there. I said I got it somewhere there, but could not find the house.</p>

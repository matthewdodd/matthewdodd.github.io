Wicks, Douglas, and Stonehewer, had not been long in my house, merely calling for my children to walk out with them. I formerly knew their parents, and having a feeling towards their offspring, merely sheltered them through humanity, till, through persuasion, they were reconciled to return home. I bought the property in question at my own door, of two young men, entirely strangers to me; but questioned them as to the property being their own, to which they replied in the affirmative, and I purchased them without hesitation, thinking to make my son a present, as he was on the point of marriage.

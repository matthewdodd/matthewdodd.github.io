"—I said, "John, mind what you are about, for you are going to receive money"-. he gave him a letter, asked for pen and ink, and wrote his name on a card, and my son went, taking the card and the letter—after he was gone the prisoner asked me if I had a back yard—I told him no—he went up stairs, returned down again, went to the door, returned, and said, "I want to go about forty paces, and if your son returns before I do, I leave you in care of the money"—he then left the house—my son returned while he was out—he came into the yard about seven o'clock in the evening—my son saw him, and they both came into the house together, and shortly after he was taken into custody.</p>

I am very, very sorry when I heard of this, and I am surprised you would take it upon yourselves to apprehend him so suddenly, without acquainting me with a letter, to know if all is correct or not. I hope, Gentlemen, for the sake of myself, and the respectability of their family, which for the last twenty years me and my brother Henry has been acquainted with them, that you will immediately, after you receive this, go to the Magistrates and get him liberated immediately from that dreadful punishment. It is a matter of impossibility for him to forge such a thing as that. How was he to know that I had any connexion with your bank? You have now de<lb></lb>tained him a week past the time, he ought to have been at home on Fri<lb></lb>day last. Consider, he was sent from here to London to transact business for his uncle, Mr. Jackson, who is a wholesale linen-draper, &amp;c. I trust and hope you will most handsomely compensate him for this usage, and I particularly request you will cash him the order for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., immediately he is at liberty, and place the same to my account; likewise the charge for discounting you may charge him accordingly.

               <p>No. 4. "Giltspur-street Compter, July 30, 38. <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi>,—I hope you will excuse me taking the liberty of writing to you, after doing what I have done towards you, in committing so base an ac<lb></lb>tion, for forging an order for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon you, at Messrs. Masterman and Co. I trust and hope you will look over this, as I am very very sorry for what I have done. I am now undergoing a severe punishment of confine<lb></lb>ment for it, which nearly breaks my heart. I can assure you, Sir, I would not have done it, only necessity compelled me. I could not obtain a situa<lb></lb>tion, as I have tried and tried again, during the time I have been in Lon<lb></lb>don, but owing to it being too late in the season for my business, (a linen<lb></lb>draper, &amp;c.) is the only cause. I can obtain a most satisfactory re<lb></lb>ference from my last employer in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, with whom I lived as an assistant for a year and a half; also, I can obtain another one from my employer in Nottingham, whom I served five years with as an apprentice. Let me earnestly beg of you to look over this for my own credit sake, and likewise for my dear mother, who is heart-broken. I am only a fatherless child, and always been brought up respectable and with strict integrity. I was very grieved on Saturday last when I appeared at the Mansion House before his Worship, the Lord Mayor, and found they had received a letter from you, giving me such a bad character; likewise a newspaper from you, with my name published in a paragraph, stating I was a notorious swindler, and had deceived a great many people during the short time I was in Douglas. I can assure you I am quite undeserv<lb></lb>ing of such a character, for I was only in the island for four months, and I always kept myself respectable and steady; I did not wrong only one per<lb></lb>son in Douglas, and that was only for five pounds, and I gave him security for the amount; and had he behaved in a proper manner to me, as he ought to have done, I would not have left him in debt. It is well known by a great many respectable people in the island, the ill-treatment I re<lb></lb>ceived from him. He would not give me time to settle with him, or otherwise I would have been there now. I only regret that ever I visited the place, as the injury it has done me, no person can ascertain like myself, through nothing but their base, slandering tongues. And I trust you will not think me the character that the paper states. I have, fortunately, by me now, the receipts of bills for many pounds that I have paid there, which they accuse me of; and I am innocent. I should have got my dis<lb></lb>charge on Saturday last, had it not been for the newspaper giving me such a base character. Unfortunately I now have to await my trial, and most likely I shall get transported, and that will break my friends' hearts, as well as my own. Ten thousand pardons do I ask you, and I beg forgive<lb></lb>ness. Do be so kind as not to come forward to prosecute me, but write a letter to his Worship, the Lord Mayor of London, begging of him to show mercy towards me, as I will for ever thank you, and pray, for your kind<lb></lb>ness. This punishment will be a warning to me for my life, and I will for ever after become respectable and gain a honest livelihood. Take pity upon me, if you please, and write to the Mayor of London again, Saturday next, as I am tried that day. I remain your obedient Servant, "<hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD KISSACK</hi>.</p>
               <p>"I hope you will write by return of post, to the Lord Mayor, so as he may receive it on Saturday next, which is the day of my trial, begging of him to be merciful to me; and I hope I will get off for a little imprison<lb></lb>ment.</p>

               <p>My friends have got two highly respectable gentlemen, of London; Sergeant Wilde, M. P., and Charles Pearson, Esq., are the two persons; they have spoken to Messrs. Masterman and Co., as to the respectability of our family; and they, from what I can learn, will forgive me this time providing you do, and I hope you will, if you please, I will promise you never to do the like again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On the 9th of August, I was at the tap-room of the Commercial Tavern, Poplar—the prisoners came in while I was sitting there, at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon—I went to the privy in the yard there—they both followed me into the privy—I was a little the worse for liquor—not a good deal—they pulled me about I felt a hand in my pocket, and missed my purse, containing seventeen sove<lb></lb>reigns—I told them to let me alone, and not pull me about—after I missed my purse, I told them—I was robbed—they were both close together—I think Scanbury took the purse and gave it to the other—Richardson came to the door—my money was in a bag.</p>

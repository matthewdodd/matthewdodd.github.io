On the 15th of July I went to the house of Mr. Morris; he told me he had better horns than he could have of me; the next morning I went again; there I found some harts horns in the prisoner's bag, two pounds and a half of them; they are Hamburgh horn, I know them to be our property: on this I took the prisoner up; I held the bag up to him and said, do you know any thing of this bag? he said, yes, I do; (the bag produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be the prisoner's bag?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I have seen it in my shop often before, and know it is his bag; (pieces of horn found at Mr. Morris's produced, and other pieces which the prosecutor brought from his own shop compared, and it appeared to a demonstration, they were only parted by the saw.)</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never sell the prisoner harts horns?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I once sold him half a hundred of tips, and he never came to work after, till he had spent the money, and I am not paid yet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago?</p>
               <p>Jackson. It may be about three months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not these part of them?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, I can swear they are not; they were quite of a different sort.</p>

I am a cutler, and live in St. John's-street; I bought these horns in the bag of the prisoner; Mr. Jackson came to my shop, and upon seeing the bag on my counter, asked whose bag it was; I said it was Garrett's; the horns were in it, there are two pounds and a half of them; I was to have given the prisoner half a crown for them, but having no silver I had not paid him for them; there are only two little tips among it, the rest are parts of bodies of horns.</p>

I returned home about six o'clock in the evening; my pocket-book, with above 80 l. in it, was in the pocket of my pantaloons. I had received this money at Coutts's, the bankers. The prisoner assisted me off with my pantaloons. Immediately after they were off, I told him to hand them to me, for I had left my pocket-book in them. He immediately replied,</p>
               <p>"There is no pocket-book here, Sir." I said,</p>
               <p>"I told you to hand me my pantaloons, I did not desire you to search for the pocket-book." He gave them to me, and I missed it. Next morning I had the notes stopped at the Bank; I afterwards saw a 5 l. note there with the prisoner's name on it - I think it was his writing. I afterwards got an officer, who searched, and found my pocket-book, with 65 l. in it, wrapped up in a parcel, in a small closet where the prisoner kept his clothes. The prisoner said it was not my pocket-book, for he had found it in the area - I said that was impossible, for he knew it was mine, as he had been in the habit of seeing it two or three times every day.</p>

I was sent for; I went up stairs, took up the prisoner's coat, and found this card of lace in his pocket; I asked how he came by it, and he mumbled something; he said, he took it; that he was sorry for it, and we might have it again; Mr. Bates then wished to have his trunk searched, and, at that moment, he asked Mr. Bates to step out on the landing with him; the door was open; he said, there were six pairs of stockings in his trunk; Mr. Bates claimed the property.</p>

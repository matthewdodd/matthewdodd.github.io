            ; the prisoner lived in my service a year and a quarter, in consequence of some suspicion of the prisoner, on the 26th of January, I went for Alderman, the constable, and took him into the dining-room, and rang for the prisoner to come up; I said, Rebecca, I have strong reasons for believing you have been robbing me and my partner; she said, what me, sir, and coloured very much; I had missed some property, in consequence of taking stock that morning; the constable searched her pockets in my presence, and found the key of her box, and some money; the officer then desired to open her box, she went up stairs with him, with some reluctance; the box was opened in her presence, and there were found in it two different remnants of calico, a yard each, and a remnant of dimity, two yards, and one remnant of cambric muslin, about six yards afterwards, in a closet, in her bed-room; there was a bag belong ing to her, in which there was another remnant of calico, about a yard, and another remnant of cambric muslin, about three or four yards; I asked her how she came by them, she said, she had some long before she came to me, that she bought them in Yorkshire, and elsewhere; I can speak to the cambric muslin, when we took stock, we missed a piece of that kind, twelve yards, it is a very particular piece, we never had but four pieces of that sort, it has our own private mark, they are in the constable's possession; in a housewife of the prisoner's, we found a key which fitted the lock of the box, in which we kept the keys of the warehouse; when we found the key of her box, she said, she had no other key; I told her, I was certain she had; she went down stairs, the officer and myself followed her into the kitchen, she found this housewife, and took out the key; that box which held the keys was taken up stairs every night in case of fire, and put in a closet; the officer then took her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>EDWARD ALDERMAN sworn. - I am a constable: On the 26th of January, I was sent for to Mr. Hartwell's, I searched the prisoner, and found a key which opened her box; I opened the box in her presence, and found a piece of muslin, and the other articles I have with me; she was asked by Mr. Beaman, who was present, if she had any other key, she said, she had no other key; in consequence of which, when we came into the kitchen, I said, it would give me less trouble, if she would produce the key that Mr. Hartwell said she had; she then opened a drawer, and took out a housewife, and took a key out of it, which opened Mr. Hartwell's box, Mr. Hartwell said, that is the key, I tried it, it opened the box very easily. (The key and the things mentioned in the indictment were produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hartwell.) As this is a common key, how came you to hunt after such a key? - A. In consequence of some information I had received,(looks at the things;) this is a part of the 9-8ths<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160052"></xptr>muslin we missed, on taking our stock; it has the No. 12 on it in a kind of buff-coloured thread, and No. 13 in a pencil mark, with our private mark, LIW, in my partner's hand-writing, it is a plain cambric muslin; the remnant of dimity was torn off a piece which I have in Court, I have no doubt of its being our property; we never sell any retail; we never cut any thing.</p>
               <p>Q.She could not have bought this of you? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BEAMAN sworn. - That is my handwriting on the muslin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. What I had in my box, I bought and paid honestly for; if there was any thing in my box not mine, I did not put it there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t18030216-55-verdict295" type="verdictDescription">

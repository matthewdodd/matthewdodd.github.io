               <p>I leave it entirely to your lordship, and the Almighty God; I am in very bad hands; I would wish to lay the case down, if you will give me leave to say a few words: to speak. I was in at the Queen's Head; and this woman had a box to carry down to Gravesend: a man applied; it was a Gravesend man: he asked me if I was a waterman? I said, yes; he brought the box down to me in a boat; I took the box in the boat; I only went to the house, to see if the woman was coming down; and before I got down again, the boat was gone.</p>
               <p>Court to Marsden. Had you any difficulty in finding the prisoner? - The runners took him that night.</p>

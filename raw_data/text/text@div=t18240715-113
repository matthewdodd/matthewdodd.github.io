            . I am a constable. On the 16th of July I saw the two prisoners in Newgate-street, near Warwick-lane: they were following several persons backwards and forwards - this conduct induced me to watch them for about twenty minutes; I then saw Mr. Godwin and another gentleman close together; I could hardly tell which of them the prisoners were following: they were close to them - I stopped down, and looked under a cart, and saw them turn down Queen's Head-passage, leading to Paternoster-row: I saw Mr. Godwin clap his hand upon his pocket - I called to him, and took him down the passage; there were no other persons near enough to pick his pocket but the prisoner, and the other gentleman: it was done momentarily, and I took them within about a minute, five or six yards down the passage - I found the handkerchief in Wilkinson's small clothes; Mr. Godwin immediately claimed it. Hesketh seized Parker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PARKER. Q. Was I in company with Wilkinson at the time of the felony - A. Yes; I am quite sure of it. I saw you open one or two gentlemen's pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WILKINSON. Q. Did you see me take the handkerchief - A. No: there was a cart which prevented me.</p>

            . I am a constable. I followed the prisoners from near St. Martin's-le-grand till they came to Newgate-street; I did not see Mr. Godwin till about a minute before he lost his handkerchief - I saw the hand of one of them go to his pocket, but I cannot say which: there were no other persons near them. I had been watching them in company with each other about ten minutes. Mr. Godwin put his hand to his pocket - we then pursued them down the court; I took Parker, and saw Herdsfield take the handkerchief from Wilkinson's trowsers.</p>

               <p>WILKINSON'S Defence. I saw the handkerchief lying on the ground; I did not know whose it was, or I should have given it to them. I turned down the court, as I had heard there was some painter's work to be got there.</p>
               <p>PARKER'S Defence. I was walking down Newgate-street, and got into conversation with this young man: we turned down the court, and the officers came and took us.</p>

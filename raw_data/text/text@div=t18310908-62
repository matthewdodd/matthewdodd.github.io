            . I am an officer. On the 4th of August I saw the prisoner on the bridge; it was the first day of oysters - the bridge was crowded with carts: on looking round I saw the prisoner lift up the prosecutor's coat tail; I caught hold of the gentleman, and asked if he had been robbed - he said No; I said," You had better feel," which he did, and missed his handkerchief; on turning round I saw it at the prisoner's feet - I do not think any body was near enough to take it but him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He never saw me lift the coat-tail up - I had been into the City to took for work; the officer came up, put his hand on my shoulder, and asked if he had lost any thing - he took the handkerchief off the ground; there were plenty of people passing.</p>

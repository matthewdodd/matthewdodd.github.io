                  </hi>. I live in Brown-buildings, Stanhope-street. I was at the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner at the bottom of the private stairs putting a plane under the stair-case—I was sent out for an officer—I could not find one all the way up Cheapside, and then I went to the station, but could not get one.</p>

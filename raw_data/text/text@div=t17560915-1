               <p>Hall. She sat there and wanted me to sleep; and I staid till I delivered her to the constable. I saw a watchman, and he would not take charge of her.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. About three in the morning as I was coming home, I heard a man say, d - n you, you bitch, give me my watch. I ordered a watchman to take them both to the watchhouse, namely, the prosecutor and prisoner. We searched her, and found the stock and stock-buckle; them he had not missed. Then after that the watchman found the watch in her hand, as he was pulling her hand out of her pocket. [The prosecutor described it, and told the maker's name; but could not tell the number.]</p>

            . Mr. Spensley charged me to aid and assist in taking the prosecutor and prisoner to the Round-house. Going along the prosecutor said, she had taken his watch. I took her hand out of her pocket, and she had the watch in it (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor, likewise the stock and buckle.)</p>

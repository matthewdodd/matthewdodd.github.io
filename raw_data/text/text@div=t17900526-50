               <p>I am a constable of Clerkenwell. On 16th of May, in the morning, about five o'clock, in New Prison-walk, Clerkenwell, I saw the prisoner with the property on his head: I having heard there was a fire, I asked him where he got it? he said he had it from a person in Red-lion-yard, Aldersgate-street; and was going to No. 12, Pear-tree-court, Clerkenwell; I told him I had suspicion, and laid hold of him; after I had taken him, he said he was employed to carry it from St. John's-street, as a porter: I secured him, and went to Alderman Skinners, and gave information; and about six o'clock, the prosecutrix came and claimed the property: the things were in two drawers on his head, with the name of Gilding on them.</p>

This property was kept in the garret, in my room; I saw it in the evening of the Saturday; it was in the drawers; the room door was open; the drawers were not locked; there was a fire: I saw the things at Lucy's house: the drawers are my master's property; there were some things gone out of the drawers; but what were left, was in the drawers: there were many people to help at the fire; I never saw them till the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. Were not any of these things taken out of the house at the time of the fire? - Not by people of the house, that I know of; I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I received these things of a man at the end of Sutton-street, in St. John's-street; and he desired me to carry them to No. 12, Pear-tree-court; but before I got there, I was stopped.</p>
               <p>Court to Woodley. Where is your master's house? - Between Charter-house-lane and Long-lane.</p>

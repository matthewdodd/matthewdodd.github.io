            , by something that he said, to come to him again; but all on a sudden Capt. Wilson came with his Sword drawn again, and they fell upon one another, and in a Minute's Time (the least that could be imagined) I heard the Deceased say, I have Night. I heard something said of Tomorrow, but I cannot tell what. - I believe the Wound was given in the Coffee-House, for he dropped immediately: Capt. Mr. Caugh had his Sword drawn, and, I suppose, endeavoured to part them: - He died at our House. - The first Sword I saw drawn in the House, was Capt. Mr. Caugh's, it was at the Time that he said, If you have a Mind for a little Diversion, I am your Man?</p>
               <p>Capt. Mr. Caugh. I came into the Tilt-Yard Coffee-House, about Four o'Clock in the Afternoon the 10th, Carr, and Innys, &amp;c. were there, and desired I would come up Stairs, which I did; some time afterwards, came in Mr. Wilson, who heard I was there, and sent up Word, if his Company would be acceptable, he would come up; I sent Word down, I should be glad of it; he came in, and Carr went away: We continued there from that Time, till about Ten o'Clock, the Deceased then insisted upon drinking some more, Wilson insisted that we should drink no more; but would go to the Play. We took Coach, and went, and when we came there the Play was over; we returned back again, to the Tilt-Yard Coffee-House, went into a small Room, within the Coffee-Room, and called for some Punch; we were told that Mr. Richardson was there, and enquired for Capt. Wilson, the Prisoner desired leave to introduce him; then Capt. Skerret, said, d - n him he is a Scrub; or Words to that Effect; He shall not come into my Company: Capt. Wilson said, he believed he mistook his Character, upon which they had some peevish Words. Wilson went out, and Skerret told me, I was as had as him (meaning Richardson) upon which, I told him, he seemed vastly quarrel some the whole Night, and No-body had given him any Reason; and that it was a Matter of Indifference to me, whether he came in or not, as I had never seen the Gentleman before; Skerret's Answer to me was, d - n your Blood, your are a Rascal; upon which, I laid my Hand to my Sword, and said, my Station in the Army, would not suffer me to bear such Language. - I cannot tell, whether I drew my Sword or no; and I believe, I said, if Mr. Skerret has a Mind to quarrel with any Body, I am his Man, for he has grossly affronted me: Upon which, the Woman of the House, and one Mr Walker, who was in the Coffee-Room, laid hold of me; I told them, they might let me go, for I promised them upon my Word and Honour, I would have no Words with Skerret that Night, we went into the Room again, shook Hands, and were Friends. - This Quarrel, which was the Occasion of his Death, was immediately afterwards; (he was going to quarrel with me again, but I would not) the Deceased turned about to Wilson, what he said to him, I cannot tell; I saw them both bounce up all on a sudden, and go into the Coffee-Room, who went out first, I cannot tell; Mr. Walker and I continued sitting by the Fire: I saw Mr. Richardson follow them, heard him call the Guard, I told Mr. Walker, should not follow them, for fear I should fall into the Quarrel myself. - I did not see what happened in the Street; when they returned, I saw Wilson glance by the Door of the little Room which I was in, and saw some Blood upon his Shirt, I started up, and went to the Door of the Room, and immediately saw Skerret break loose from two Soldiers of the Guard, who had hold of him in the Coffee Room; after Skerret had broke loose from the Soldiers, Wilson met him half Way, in the Centre of the Coffee-Room, and they began to attack one another afresh, and fell to pushing; I drew my Sword, and beat down their Passes, and told them, they were both under Arrest. - There were a good many Passes; I beat them down as fast as I could. - The Deceased had a Wound in his Breast, pointing a little towards the Right-Side; he said, he had got enough for this Night, dropped down, and died on the Spot. - From the first to the last of this Quarrel, it was not above a Quarter of an Hour.</p>

            (to Capt. Mr. Caugh) Did not the Prisoner draw his Sword first upon Capt. Skerret?</p>
               <p>Capt. Mr. Caugh. I am not certain who drew first.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the Wound the Deceased received in his Breast be given, if he had been in a Posture of Defence?</p>
               <p>Capt. Mr. Caugh. I do not know, - the Wound might be received when he was off his Guard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Gadsdon. Did not you see the Deceased seize upon me first?</p>
               <p>Gadsdon. Really I cannot say whether he did or not. - Skerret's Sword was draw g before Wilson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Skerret's Sword drawn at the Time that Richardson laid hold of Skerret the bid him be quiet?</p>
               <p>Gadsdon. The Sword was first drawn by Skerret, at the Time Capt. Mr. Caugh said, If you have a Mind for a little Diversion, I am your Man; that was at the Time Richardson had hold of him, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Capt. Richardson (confirmed the other Evidence, with Respect to the reconciling the first Difference). As we were sitting together in the little Room, I heard Capt. Skerret make use of the Word dare; and all on a sudden, he and Capt. Wilson jumped off their Seats, and rushed out of the little Room into the Coffee-Room. I went out after them, and saw Skerret in a rising Posture. I took hold of his Sword which was drawn in his Hand, and in endeavouring to get it from him, I run the Point into the Calf of my Leg, and desired the Servants to call the Guard. Skerret got from me, and rushed towards the Street-Door; Wilson was then at the Door, and said, stay, or helt. till I have drawn my Sword. I went into the Street, saw three Soldiers, and called to them to part them for fear of Murder. - Skerret's Sword was drawn at first, but Wilson's was not. I heard their Swords clash, but the Soldiers parted them. Wilson came in first, then Skerret came in, and the Soldiers had hold of him by the Arm; and the Soldiers struggled to get the Sword from him, but Skerret got from the Soldiers and advanced towards Wilson; Wilson was at the other End of the Coffee-Room with his Sword in his Hand; and then Wilson advanced towards him, and they made several Passes at each other. - I do not know whether the Wound was given in the Street or in the House.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mackenzie, Surgeon. I was called about one or two in the Morning, about the 20th of January, and when I came into the Coffee-Room, I saw Mr Skerret lying upon the Floor; he was dead before I I came. I found a Wound in his Breast which was mortal, and was desired by the Coroner the next Day to open the Body; there were four Wounds in the Trunk of the Body; one on the right Side, which penetrated into the right Lobe of the Lungs; there was another on the Breast-Bone, which went through the Sternon; there was another Wound towards the left Groin, but that did not penetrate, - the Wound went aflant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heath, Surgeon. I was sent for to view the Body. I endeavoured to introduce a Probe, which I could not do. I found a Wound upon the Breastbone; there was one passed between the fourth and fifth Rib on the right Side, penetrating into the right Lobe of the Lungs; and another a little obliquely into the Sternon, which I apprehend to be the mortal Wound. - I do apprehend he was in a fighting Posture when he received that Wound; he might receive it when he was recovering from a Lunge; - there are two Wounds which did not penetrate, and one upon the Leg.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep was the Wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Heath. It was through the Breast-Bone, a little obliquely into the left Ventricle of the Heart. - He was in a disadvantageous Posture when he received the Wound. - I do not say he was in a Posture of Defence. - The Wound was a little inclining to the Left. - There was a Wound on the left Side of the Navel. - I am not a Judge of Duelling, - but I apprehend that Wound might be received on a Recovery from a Lunge.</p>

            . I have the management of Mr. Spinks shop, 22, Gracechurch-street, he is a silversmith. The prisoner came to me on the 13th of February, he asked me if we bought silver, and what we gave per ounce; I told him from five shillings and sixpence to five shillings and ninepence was the usual price given, upon which he opened the plate. I examined the silver and said as there was foreign silver among it the utmost that I could give would be five shillings and sixpence per ounce; he said that was not sufficient, he expected five shillings and tenpence; I told him it was the most I could give, he asked me to weigh it for him that he might not be deceived in any other place he took it to; there were fifty one ounces four penny weights; he asked me what it would come to at that; I told him fourteen pounds one shilling and sixpence; he said he did not suppose he could do better with it, I should have it. I paid him the money and he went away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Which man are you speaking of - A. Atkins is the person that I bought it off. I gave him the full value of it, as he told me he was a country dealer I gave him more than others would have done.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know your way into Mrs. Baron's house - A. I do, if I am shewed the door.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CLERKE. I am a watchmaker. On Monday the 11th of February the prisoner Atkins came to my house and informed me he was going to purchase some foreign silver; a friend of his, a one legged lieutenant, was to introduce him to the person that had it to sell, it was to be sold at a public-house near Berkley-square; I cautioned him not to have any thing to do with it; I told him if the people had come honestly by it, they would go to a refiners, or to a silversmiths shop, where they could get more by it than he could afford. He borrowed my scales and weights, I lent them to him having known him about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. An hawker, or pedlar, during which time I have trusted him at several periods to the amount of forty or fifty pounds, he has been frequently in my shop, where valuable articles lay about, both of gold and silver; I had not the least doubt of his honesty. I also told him, after he had borrowed the scales, that he had better go to a silversmith's shop, and have it weighed, and valued, by which means he would not be wronged; he told me he could depend upon his friend the lieutenant. He returned the scales the next morning, I was not at home; I saw him in the afternoon, he told me he had made a purchase of the silver, and gave five shillings the ounce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did you know where Atkins lodged - A. He told me in London-street, Fitzroy-square. I was present at the time of his apprehension, he was apprehended in my shop, he then acknowledged every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know when he was apprehended whether he gave all the information of the person of whom he purchased the different articles - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information he gave was the witness Blake apprehended - A. Yes, and Kelly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You did not go to the public-house where he bought the plate - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of Kelly - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>STEPHEN LAVENDER. I am an officer. I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200019"></xptr>some conversation with Atkins, he said he was cautioned about purchasing this plate, and in consequence of this caution, he buried the plate before he sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he told you that he had sold it - A Yes, to the silversmith in Gracechurch-street, he said that he buried it in consequence of some caution he had of Blake.</p>
               <p>Q. to Perry. Did Atkins give you reference to Mr. Clerke - A. No; he was known at our shop I had known him a month or six weeks before. I knew from Atkins that he had dealt with Mr. Clerke, and there he was found.</p>

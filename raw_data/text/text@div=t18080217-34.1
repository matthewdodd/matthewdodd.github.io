               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before. - A. Never in my life; I asked him, as he was coming on, which way he was going, he said he was coming to town; I told him I was coming there too; we discoursed upon the road together in talking of America. I understood by his tongue he was an American; I told him that I had been to America, and I was sixteen months a prisoner there. We went as far as the Black Horse, I offered him a pint of beer; I then asked him where he lodged; he told me he had no lodging nor any thing to get a lodging with; I said, if you come along with me I shall give you something to eat and drink, and very likely a lodging; he went with me to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him something to eat and drink. A. I did; I gave him some mutton chops and bread, and sent for a pint of beer for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him a lodging. - A. I told him there was a bed if he chose to accept it; if he did not, there was a shilling for him to get a lodging for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you had never seen him before. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170023"></xptr>No.</p>
               <p>Q. You took a great partiality to him, never having seen him before - was this your own bed. - A. Yes; he went to bed in my own bed before I did; I locked and bolted the window and door afterwards; I laid down, I hung my watch up at the bed's head, I fell asleep; when I awoke in the morning I missed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not surprised at that. - A. I was surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very probable thing to have happened - did you miss nothing but the prisoner. - A. I then laid awhile; I listened to hear if my watch beat, it did not; I put my hand up to find if my watch was there; it was gone. I then got up and went into the yard, thinking he might have gone to the privy. I found he was not there; I searched my pockets, I missed a guinea, two two-pound notes, nine seven shilling pieces, nineteen shillings in silver, and two gold watch keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your property again. - A. My watch was found in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been long in this town. - A.Yes, I have been watchman to the London dock three years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to bring him to his oath where he me me: me first.</p>
               <p>Court. He says between Mile End and Bow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He is wrong in that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot say exactly the place, but it was between Mile End and Bow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know what time you met with me. - A. Between five and six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take me to. - A. To the Black Horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take me after that. - A. Up to my own house in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give me to eat after that.</p>
               <p>Court. He said mutton chops.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What had I to drink before I went to his own house. - A. A pint of beer, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you change a guinea, and I offered to pay half the reckoning for a quartern of rum. - A. You did not offer that, nor did I change a guinea; we had no rum.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor yourself. - A. No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner in liquor. - A. No, I did not take him to be in liquor.</p>

When he came out of doors he fell down in the street; we had not then above five or six yards to go. When he got up he gave me a shilling to get a pot of beer; he had got some mutton chops raw; I toasted one of them; he spilt the beer and broke six plates; he gave me five penny worth of halfpence to get another pot of beer; I never saw the man before in my life. I think the man must be a lunatic. I am an innocent man standing here.</p>

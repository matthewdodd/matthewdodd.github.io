I returned in about an Hour, and miss'd 4 d. On Sabbath-Day following I got up early in the Morning, and saw there was Six-pence Half-penny in the Till ; when Afternoon-Sermon was over there was Three-Pence gone. About six o'Clock (the same Day) I call'd my Son, and we went down Stairs, and we marked two Six-pences, and eighteen Pennyworth of Copper, which we put into the Till. On Monday Morning I got up at 5 o'Clock, and then we miss'd 1 s. and 2 d. of the marked Money. After this I went out, leaving the Prisoner alone in the Shop; and I sent a Person to buy several Things, for which I sent home mark'd Money. Out of this Money I miss'd 21 d. when I returned. Then I sent for Mr Makepeace the Constable, and having taken the Prisoner up into my Dining-Room, I tax'd him with having wrong'd me, and told him I had miss'd Money several Times. He deny'd all; but upon obliging him to pull out what Money he had in his Pocket, I found a Shilling and a Sixpence in Silver, and 11 Halfpence of the mark'd Money. He had more Money upon him, but it not being marked, I cannot swear to it. I then carried him before Sir

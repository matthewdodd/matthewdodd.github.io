             50). On the 30th of May I was in Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge, at the back of Mr. Wallis' premises - I heard a voice say "What shall we break the door open with?" I stood still, and saw the prisoner come over the pales with a can in his hand - he ran into a tile-shed - he dropped the can, and I fell over it - he had dropped one can when I saw him come over the pales.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. How high are the pales? A. I should think five or six feet - it was light enough at that place, but he ran down into a tile-shed, which was dark - he made his escape then, and was taken by another officer the next morning - I had known him before, and I knew his house - I was waiting round his house all night, to see if he came in or out, but he did not - I never had any quarrel with him - I remember the Saturday night previous to this - I was on duty the whole night, but I did not go into any beer-shop.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 14th of this month, between 4 and 6 o'clock, I received information and went into my front parlour on the ground floor—the window and blinds were open—I had been in the room about four o'clock, and they were not open then—I looked about the room and missed a coat almost new, a waistcoat, a shirt-front, a shirt, a handkerchief, a towel, and a gown-body—the coat, waistcoat, shirt-front, and handkerchief belong to my husband, and the rest to our lodger, Catherine Sibley.</p>

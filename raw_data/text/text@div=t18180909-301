               <p>SAMUEL GWILLIAMS. On the 1st of August, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, when I came home, I found the prisoner in the house. I missed my watch, which I had left safe. As I was taking him before a magistrate, he told me if I took up two boys I should get my watch again. My wife was at home - She is ill.</p>

            . I live at Haggerston. About three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner sitting on a bench with two other boys, opposite the prosecutor's house - I was sitting on the same bench myself, but farther on. I afterwards saw the prisoner run out of the prosecutor's house with a silver watch in his hand. I called out Stop thief! and told Mr. Davis, he stopped him. Before he was stopped, he had passed the two boys who had been with him - They said they would run round and meet him; he was within a yard of them. I kept sight of him all the while, but do not know what was done with the watch.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL GWILLIAMS re-examined. My watch was a silver one; it had a black ribbon, and was worth 30s.</p>

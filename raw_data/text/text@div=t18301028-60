            . I am an officer. On the 22nd of October I was in Berwick-street, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner with a bundle, he passed me, and had two other boys in his company - I saw him run from the other boys, and went and took him; I asked what he had; he said three pairs of shoes which he had brought from his master, Mr. Jones, in the New-cut, and he had been to Somer's-town with them - that they did not fit, and he was going to take them home again; I took him, and found the owner; this ticket was on them.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Rodgers, of Kensington. On the 16th of August, enquiry was made about the child, I remembered seeing the prisoner cross the road opposite our shop, she looked through the window as if she wanted to buy something, she had no child with her then - She threw up her veil - I observed her features, which were remarkable-she walked backwards and forwards for about five minutes at the window - I saw her talking to two little girls, one of whom had a child, after that she came to the window with the same child, moistened a bit of bread in her mouth, and fed it. I am positive she is the woman-in a quarter of an hour I saw the child's parents and told them.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness, I went in pursuit of the child, from information which I received; I got Ruthven's assistance, and found the prisoner, on Wednesday the 19th; the officer brought the prisoner and child to me; I took the child out of the prisoner's arms and knew it again directly; it was almost famished for want, and appeared not likely to live; my daughter knew it again immediately; while the cart was coming along, she called out, that the prisoner was the woman. I never saw the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RUTHVEN. I am an officer of Bow-street. I went to Alresford, to West District Common, about six miles from Alresford, and found the prisoner there; I had learnt her name, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well Eliza, how is the child,"(she had it with her), she said it was very well; I asked her how old it was, she said a month; I asked her if she suckled it, she said her milk was gone. I asked her how she came to take the child away from the girl at Kensington, she said she did not, it was her own. As we came along, she wanted to know what I knew about it, and said, if it is not mine, whose is it; I told her she had taken it from Kensington, she said, "yes I did; I have not hurt it, and hope its parents will not hurt me." I took her in a cart to the public-house; the father and mother knew it again; the little girl pointed the prisoner out at Alresford, and said she was the woman. The child was very bad.</p>

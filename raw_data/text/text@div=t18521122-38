                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Harris, a stationer, at 39, St. John-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen years, but had lost sight of him for very nearly two years—I knew him first by the name of Watson, and afterwards by the name of Allen—he has been a schoolmaster—on 4th Oct., about a quarter before 9 o'clock in the evening, he came to Mr. Harris's shop—I saw Tripcony, the shopman, serving him—I made out an invoice of the goods be ordered—they consisted of copy books, slates, and various spelling books, three of each kind, as if he was going to open a school—I asked him if he was going to open again; he said "Yes," and he wished me to bring him up some maps—I asked him where, and he said "To the old place"—I asked, where did he mean, Castle-street? he said, "Yes"—I knew him to have carried on business in Castle-street as a schoolmaster—I do not recollect the number, I think it was 36—I asked him if I should bring the parcel home; he aid, "Never mind"—he said he</p>

               <p>wished to give us a turn, as we had lost a good deal of money by him—I asked him what name; he said, "Oh, Allen"—I knew him by the name of Watson in Castle-street—I think the goods came to about If. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after I had made out the invoice, and whilst the goods were being packed, he asked me if I could change him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he had got his hand in his pocket at the time, <hi rend="italic">junking</hi> some money—I said to <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, one lad, who was serving him, "You have not change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, have you?"—he said, "No, I have not, Sir"—upon that I told the prisoner I would get him change—he said, "No, never mind; I have got money"—he had the note in his hand, and I fancy he put it in his pocket again—I supposed it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, but I did not take it out of his hand to look—just at that time Mr. Harris came in—the prisoner said, "How do you do, Mr. Harris? I am going to open school again, and I wish to lay out a little ready money; I know you have lost a little by me before, and I wish to lay out my ready money with you"—he said, "Have you got the difference of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note?" Mr. Harris said, "Yes, certainly"—the prisoner then gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—he handed it to Mr. Harris, and he gave him change—the prisoner had ordered some maps; we had not those maps in stock, and I said I would bring them to him on the Thursday or Friday—when the parcel of slates and books was made up, I said I would send them up next morning; he said, "Never mind, I must take them myself"—he said he was in a very great hurry, and he should want them very early in the morning—on receiving his change, he took the parcel, and went out—in three or four minutes after<lb></lb>wards, Mr. Harris thought he had made a mistake in the change, and sent Tripcony after him—he was absent about ten minutes, and then returned without the prisoner, but with the parcel which the prisoner had taken—I did not see the prisoner again until he was in custody—on the following day I went with Archer, the constable, to the house in Castle-street, where I knew the prisoner had carried on business—I did not find him there; he was not living there—I made inquiries, and could not find anything of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of 39, St. John-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen years—on 4th Oct., near 9 o'clock in the evening, I came in, and found him in my shop—after some conversation, he asked whether I had change of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I said, "Yes, certainly"—I went behind the counter, and he produced the note out of his pocket, and laid it on the counter—I asked him what change he wanted, and I appealed to my foreman, who is my half brother; he said, "You are to take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the note—he took the parcel, wished me good night, and went away—I put the note into my pocket—I had no other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note by me at that time—as soon as he was gone, fancying. I had given him a sovereign too much, I sent Tripcony after him—he returned in about ten or twelve minutes, with the parcel, but without the prisoner—in consequence of what I learned from him, I marked the note—this is what I wrote on it, "David Allen, Oct. 4, 1852"—I believe that is the prisoner's correct name—next morning I sent the note to the Bank, and it was returned to me stamped "Forged," as it is now—I then delivered the note to Archer, the constable, and gave him a description of the prisoner—I saw nothing more of the prisoner until 2nd Nov., at 7 in the evening, when I went to the Bagnigge Wells police station, and found him there—I there charged him with uttering the forged note; I said, "Mr. David Allen, you are caught at last"—he said that misfortunes had been showering upon him so thick, that he did not care what became of himself—next morning, previous to going before the Justice, the prisoner sent for me—I asked him</p>

               <p>what he wanted with me; he said, "Will you be satisfied if the amount of the note is made up to you, and Shepherd's bill, and not prosecute?"—I said, "What do you mean? have you got the money?" he said, "No, but I can give you good security"—I said, "That will not do; that is quite enough"—he said, "Will you hear what I have got to say? for I declare to God that when I <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> that note upon you I was almost starving"—nothing else passed—I then went before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Harris. I remember the evening of 4th Oct., when the prisoner came for some goods—in consequence of instructions from Mr. Harris I went out after him, and overtook him facing Nicholson's distillery, in St. John-street—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Mr. Allen, Mr. Harris thinks he has made a small mistake in your bill, will you be kind enough to step back with me"—he said, "Yes"—he then said, "Have you got the bill?"—I said, no, I believed he had got it in his pocket, or else it was in the parcel—he turned round to return with me—he asked me to carry the parcel, it was rather heavy—we had not got a dozen steps before he asked me that—I took it from him, and we went on as far as Compton-street; he then said to me, "Just wait here one minute while I go round the corner to ease myself"—I waited perhaps three or four minutes—he went round the corner—finding he did not return I went round the corner to seek after him, and found he had disappeared—I waited altogether perhaps ten minutes, and then went back with the parcel to my employer, and commu<lb></lb>nicated to him what had happened.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). On 4th Oct. I went to the shop of Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220040"></xptr>
               <p>Harris, with whom I had dealt seventeen years, for the purpose of purchasing some school stationery. I gave Mr. Harris a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note to pay for the things, which he put into his trowsers pocket. He went to the till to get change, which he opened, but before he began to count it out he took something out of his trowsers pocket, and handed it to the shopman, Tripcony (which I believe to be the note I gave him), who went out of the shop, but did not return during the remainder of my stay, which was five or six minutes. After I had left the shop, bearing somebody running behind me, I turned round, and observed Tripcony; he said, "Mr. Harris thinks he has made a mistake in your change; "I said, "Has he? I do not think he has." I turned back with him, intending to go to the shop; when we arrived at the corner of Compton-street, having occasion to leave for a minute or two to attend to nature's call, I requested Tripcony to hold the parcel; I found that the bill contained my change, and it was quite right; and then re<lb></lb>membering how I became possessed of the note, the thought momentarily struck me that it might be a stolen note, or something wrong about it, accordingly through fear I did not return, but proceeded homewards; as to its being forged, I had not the slightest idea of such a thing, as I was not aware there was such a thing in existence, and I having given change for it. How I came pos<lb></lb>sessed of the note was as follows: on Saturday, 2nd Oct., I went out for the purpose of purchasing some school fixtures, and took with me five sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and silver. I met a person who was formerly a lodger of mine; we went into a public house in the Borough, and bad some refresh<lb></lb>ment; we were nearly an hour and a half there, during which time I got into conversation with some men who were standing drinking at the bar; one of them asked me if I could oblige him with change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; he took from his breast pocket a pocket book, out of which he took seven or eight notes, and handed one to me, saying he should feel much obliged to me if I would; I replied, "Certainly," and gave him four sovereigns and two half sovereigns in change for it, which I should not have done had I been sober, but I was intoxicated. I partook of something to drink at his request; I wrapped the sovereign in the note, and asked Mrs. Wilson, my old lodger, for a pin; she gave me one, and I pinned it in my watch fob; we finished what we had, and left the house, Mrs. Wilson going her way, and I mine. Had I known the note was a forgery, is it likely I should have taken it to a person that had known me so long, and who, I might be sure, would recognize me, and recollect the transaction? I do not know that the note produced is the same I gave to Mr. Harris; if it is, it bears the marks of the pin holes, if it does not, it is not the same. Mr. Harris swore at the police court that he com<lb></lb>pared it with ten or fifteen others, and is it not likely it might have got changed?</p>

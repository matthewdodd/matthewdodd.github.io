                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 139) On the 6th of Feb. last I was stationed near Bartholomew-lane, by the London and Westminster Bank, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the three prisoners standing together, at the corner of Bartholomew-lane—Alexander beckoned me across—I did not go at first—he beckoned again—I ran towards them, and Kerp ran down Angle-court—I ran after him—he was stopped, without my losing sight of him—I brought him back to Wilbeam and Alexander, who met me some yards up the court—when I got up to them, Alexander told me he gave them both in charge—I asked him for what—he said, "Forgery on Fuller's Smith and Payne's and the Bank of England"—I proceeded on with them towards the station-house, and as we went along Alexander said to Kerp and Willbeam, "I have been looking for you the last two or three months, and have got you at last"—I kept them both in custody, and in proceeding on, Alexander said to Kerp, "Your father has gone to Ger<lb></lb>many with 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. belonging to the bankers, and they will rue it when they find it out"—at that time the three prisoners were with me—after that some words passed between Alexander and Wilbeam, which I did not under<lb></lb>stand, as it was broken English—Wilbeam then said to me that Alexander had got no change against him—Alexander instantly said, "No, I have got no charge against him," "that is the villain," pointing to Kerp—I then said to Wilbeam' "You had better come along with me"—he said he would—I then came through Coleman-street and Fore-street, and missed Wilbeam—I proceeded with the prisoner, Kerp and Alexander, to the station—the inspector there declined to take the charge—I then, at the request of Alexander, went with Kerp to Messrs. Fuller's, and there, after a conversa<lb></lb>tion, Mr. Fuller gave Kerp in charge—on the 31st of March I went into a coffee-shop, in Victoria-street Little Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, and saw Wilbeam—I asked if he knew Alexander—he said he did—I asked if he knew me—he said he did not—I was not in my uniform—I then asked if he did not recollect an occurrence which took place on the 6th of Feb., about twenty minutes to four o'clock—he said he did—I told him I was a police<lb></lb>officer he must come with me—in going along, I told j-him I did not wish him to say anything to criminate himself, I did not wish him to say anything that would be against him in Court, as he was talking to us—(an officer named Speak was with me)—he said he did not care, he would speak the truth—he then said that Alexander gave him the order to go to Fuller's to receive change for the check for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he changed it, and got four 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, which he gave to Alexander, and he was to have 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his trouble.</p>

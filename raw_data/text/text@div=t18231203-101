This flannel was tied to the door-post, and is worth 7 l. - it was safe half an hour before I missed it - I immediately ran round the corner, looked up Warwick-street, and saw Daly running with it, half way up the street; it was a very large roll; I ran and got before him, turned round to take him, and he threw it in my face. I called Stop thief! and a gentleman secured him. Sambourn came up with a stick, and kept striking the gentleman, and said, "Let him alone, let him alone." I did not see Reedy.</p>

On the 20th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, I was minding the shop, which is nearly opposite Mr. Hawkes's, and saw two men walking along the other side with a large roll of flannel - I suspected them, and went to Mr. Hawkes, who followed them. I could not leave the shop - they went up Warwick-street. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and caught Daly about ten yards from the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he sell it - A. I do not know, for I went into the shop, and left him with my husband; I found it in the shop afterwards. The officer came and searched the house next morning, and found it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man come in - A. Yes; but I went into the parlour. He spoke to my husband - I only went into the shop to throw some dirty water into the street. I was taken on Friday, but did not go to the office that day. I have not seen my husband since, nor heard of him.</p>
               <p>Q. They took you up for receiving it, I suppose - A. They said they took me for finding the property in the house. I cannot recollect whether either of the prisoners brought the flannel.</p>

            . I am constable of St. James's. On Thursday, the 20th of November, I received Daly and Sambourn in charge, with a roll of flannel; and about half-past eight that evening, Reedy came to the watch-house to enquire for the other prisoners, and called one of them Roberts. Having heard that there were two rolls of flannel taken, I secured him, and found 23 s. 6 d. on him. I asked him several questions - he sent me to different places in Mary-le-bone, where he said he had got the money, but I found it was false, and in the morning I told him it was very wrong to send me to so many places. I neither threatened nor promised him. He said Sambourn had given him a roll of flannel, and he took it to Crown-street, to a Jew's shop, and that was the money he received for it. I went to Phillips's shop - they refused to let me search without a warrant. I got one, and found a small piece of flannel (which had been cut off the roll) under the water-butt, quite wet, and the roll was up stairs. Phillips has absconded.</p>

Roberts was not there; and hearing some men were in the watch-house, I went there to ask for Roberts, and was detained.</p>

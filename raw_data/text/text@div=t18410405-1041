                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Wells-row, Islington. About eleven o'clock, on the evening of the 20th of February, I was in my shop—a person very much resembling the prisoner came in—I believe him to be the same—he asked for a pair of Wellington boots, and agreed to give 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a pair, and offered me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the one now pro<lb></lb>duced is the note, for I wrote on it the name and address he gave me, "Davis, 22, Holloway-place"—I wrote that from his mouth, as the direc<lb></lb>tion he gave, and added my initials, "H. H." to it at the same time—I went out to a neighbour to get change; and in consequence of what the neighbour said, I returned to my shop, and told the prisoner I could not get change for the note—I did not say why, and asked if he had a sove<lb></lb>reign in his pocket—he said he had not, but he had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he gave me—I told him, he had better give me the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and pay the remainder when the boots 'were sent home—he agreed to that, and did so—I returned him his note, and he left the shop—I went with the boots to the direction he gave—the people, I suppose, were all gone to bed—I rang three or four times, but nobody answered—I did not see him again.</p>

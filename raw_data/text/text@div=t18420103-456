                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Frederick Sundius, of Stoke Newington-road, in the parish of West Hackney. On Thursday, the 23rd of December, about two o'clock, I was sitting in my dining-room at work—I saw a boy in the front court—I got up to see who it was, and saw another boy (the prisoner) get out of the area—I asked what he did there—he said be had dropped his cap, and bad got down to pick it up—I knew very well he had no right to be so near the window, and asked what he wanted—be said, "Indeed, Ma'am, I have dropped my cap, and I wished to pick it up"—my servant boy came in at the gate at the time—the prisoner ran away, and I beckoned to my servant to follow him, which he did—the area is not very large—there is only one window in it—it is not railed in—it is within a court-yard, about ten yards from the road—I had seen the area window shut shortly before—it opens into the kitchen—I went into the front court, looked down the area, and found the window open about a quarter of a yard, and missed two tea-spoons—I saw the prisoner about twenty minutes after at the station, and one spoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the prosecutor. I was called by my mistress and followed the prisoner about half a mile—he ran, and tried to get away, but I saw him caught just past the printing-office leading on to Shackle well Downs—as he was running I saw him put his hand to his pocket, take out two spoons, and try to throw them over a wall—one went over and one fell back—I did not pick it up, and do not know what became of it—I continued following the prisoner, calling "Stop thief"—I did not see him taken—after he threw the spoons away I caught hold of him—he said he had done nothing, and I let him go—the policeman came up, I told him, and he pursued him—I afterwards went into the garden where I saw the prisoner throw the spoon, and found it there—I took it to the stat ion, and it was shown to my mistress.</p>

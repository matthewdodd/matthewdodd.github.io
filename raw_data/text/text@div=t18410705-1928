                  </hi>. I live in Monmouth-street, Shad well-market, in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, I keep the house. On the 25th of June, I left the house about a quarter or ten minutes before twelve o'clock—I heard of something, and went home—I found the front-door open, which I had left shut—I found the drawers, in my front-room up stairs, open, and the clothes which they contained taken away—I missed two jackets, a coat, and the other things stated in this indictment—I gave information to the police—I have since seen this handkerchief, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) which I know to be mine by a mark on it—I left the back-window open which looks into the yard—that was quite sufficient for a person to get in—the door of the room where these things were was shut—my house is inclosed at the back—the things I lost were worth about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose this lead - A. On Saturday the 7th of September. This man was at work with seven or eight more men. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18110918-143-deflabel762" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

About seven o'clock, or a little after, I paid the men and I was sitting in the house by myself; afterwards in about an hour a friend of mine came, I went out with him; I saw the prisoner come out from behind the watch-box where he had no business to be; he said master, I have lost my money; I said, have you, Robert, that is a bad job; the prisoner followed us to the wharf gate; I went on. In about five minutes I went back again, I had suspicion. When I had got in the wharf gate I saw this man coming on with this lead; I called

            , and we followed the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180055"></xptr>into the Edgware-road. He put the lead down about ten yards from Loyd's house, we passed him and stopped; he picked up the lead and took it into Loyd's house; I went and asked him what he had got there; he said nothing, and ran out of the house. Riley catched him, he then said that the man told him he would give him three half-pence a pound if he would bring any lead to him.</p>
               <p>MR. PEAKE. Q. What are you - A. I am, called wharfinger or foreman, I am appointed by Mr. Hill. The water work company are chartered, I have the Act of Parliament in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing about him or upon him while he was in the wharf - A No, but about twenty yards off; it turned out to be lead, and I saw him go into the house and put it down, and I missed a fig of lead, I know the shape and size of it; here is a man that will swear to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

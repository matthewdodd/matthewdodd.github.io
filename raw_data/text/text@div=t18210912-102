I had 3 l. in my breeches pocket, which I put under the pillow; I fell asleep, and awoke between six and seven o'clock next morning, and she was gone; I made enquiry in the house, and found her about two o'clock that day, she was taken into custody and pretended that she never saw me before. I had spent the evening with a few servants and was not drunk. I was not perfectly sober, nor was I tipsy. I left my friends about ten minutes past twelve o'clock - I had been to two or three public-houses.</p>

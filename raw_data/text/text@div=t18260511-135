The other four surrounded me, and struck at me with sticks, but I got him into a cook-shop - he directly laid hold of a knife, and I cut my hand in getting it from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He twisted my handkerchief tight round my neck, and I took hold of the knife to cut it. The handkerchief is mine - I had bought it - I stood at the corner of Gray's Inn-lane, and was folding it up to go round my neck.</p>
               <p>DANIEL REARDON re-examined. I called to the gentleman, and thought I should have been able to have got the prisoner up to him, but I was not.</p>

The bed was found again at No. 33, Great St. Ann's lane.</p>
               <p>- SMITH sworn. - I am the wife of Samuel Smith: On Thursday evening, the 21st of March, I was sitting with my husband in the front room; I had occasion to go into the yard to get a pail of water; I turned and saw the back window open; I knew the window was fastened down with a nail before; we very seldom had it up; I went into the room and saw the bed was gone; the street door was standing open; they must have come in that way; I had left the street door shut, but not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any person that night? - A. No; on my return into the room again, we looked to know what other things were gone: we missed the blanket, a pair of sheets, a cotton gown, and a black skirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the blanket and the sheets on the bed? - A. They were when the bed was turned up; we found the bedstead turned down; the skirt and gown were in a little box in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you heard nothing all the time of this transaction, and you were in the front room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any part of your property the next morning? - A. Yes; I left a pattern of the gown at a pawnbroker's, and I had not been home above half an hour before I received information from Mr. Clareson, the pawnbroker; I went to his shop, and there I saw the gown, and knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person at the pawnbroker's? - A. Yes, Sarah Archestone; she told me that it was another person that gave it to her to pledge and she would take me to the place; I went with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240018"></xptr>her and Hobbs, the officer, to

The officer put down the bedstead to see for the bed, and my bed was there in her room, upon her bed; I know it was my bed by two pieces that I put on myself, and which I can swear to by those pieces.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing said then about the bed? - A.She said it was a strange person that brought the bed; the blanket was there likewise, and the skirt; the blanket was on the bed, the skirt was at the side of the bed; she said that

               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner Baker, after Archestone had got the gown, she told you she had got it, together with a bed, from a man of the name of Brown; not that he was a stranger altogether to her, but that his place of residence she was a stranger to. Is your bed a heavy one? - A. It is rather heavy, a woman was seen with it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker's servant, in King-street, Westminster: In consequence of Mrs. Smith's information, and she leaving a pattern of a gown, about a quarter of an hour afterwards, when the prisoner Archestone came to our shop, with a gown to pledge for eighteen pence, I compared the pattern of the gown with it, and it matched exactly; I then sent to Mrs. Smith, and detained Archestone; she said she was sent with it by another person; she did not say who the person was then; Mrs. Smith came and owned the gown; Hobbs came in a little while afterwards; I kept the gown, and he took Archestone into custody.</p>
               <p>- HOBBS sworn. - I am an officer: Smith gave me information the evening before: between eleven and twelve o'clock the next morning, I received information that a woman was stopped with the gown, at Mrs. Barry's, in King-street; I ran down and Archestone was in the shop; I asked her how she came by that gown; she said that a person had given it to her to bring it there to pledge; I asked her who the person was; she said she would not tell me who the person was, but she could take me to the woman; I and Mrs. Smith went with her to No. 33, Great St. Ann's lane, Westminster, up two pair of stairs, in a back-room, and Baker was sitting in the room; she said to Baker, I am stopped with your gown that you sent me with, to which Baker made no answer; I asked Baker how she came by that gown; she said it was brought there last night by a man; that is all she said at that time; I began to search the room, and pulled down the bed; it was a turn-up bedstead, and I found the bed and blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more than one bed on the bedstead? - A. There were two beds on the bedstead, this lay uppermost; I found the skirt by the side of the bed on the floor; I asked her what became of the pair of sheets; she said she did not know any thing at all about the sheets; I asked her how she came by the bed; she said they were brought there by a man last night; I asked her what man it was; she said it was a stranger; I told her it was very unlikely that she would take a bed in of a stranger; she said she had seen him a few times, but not very often; he had called there sometimes to see her; I asked her where he lived; she said she did not know; she had heard him talk that he lived somewhere about the Bun-house, Chelsea. I took them both into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention his name to you then? - A. Not then, she did afterwards at the Office, before the Magistrate. (The property produced and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>

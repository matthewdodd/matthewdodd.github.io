On the 25th of April, these things were in my sitting-room, on the second floor - they had come from the wash about seven o'clock, and were lying on the sofa; the street door was kept open, but there is a heavy glass door which shuts itself, but was not kept locked - I was gone to the top of the house to call my servant, about half-past seven o'clock, and on coming down stairs, I saw the prisoner coming out of my sitting-room with a large bundle under his arm; I asked who he wanted, he said Mr. Norwich - there is "Norwich shawl warehouse" on the street door - I told him there was no such person, and that he had got my property: I laid hold of the bundle, and gave an alarm - he ran down stairs with the bundle, as I could not get it from him, having a child in one arm; he was stopped before he got out of the house, and I found the bundle contained these article.</p>
               <p>PRINCE HOARE. I am assistant at the shawl warehouse; I heard Mrs. English call for assistance - I walked to the warehouse door, and saw the prisoner running down stairs; he ran by me, and threw down the linen - I pursued him down the stairs, he fell down, and I laid hold of him; Davis was sent for - I saw the things in his possession, and he threw them down.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DAVIS. I am a constable. I was sent for, and took charge of the prisoner and bundle; he said he did not take them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had the property in my possession; a young man who I formerly lived with, as a porter, in Watling-street, told me they wanted a porter at the warehouse at the corner of St. Paul's church-yard; seeing "Shawl warehouse" on this door, I went up, but saw nobody; I heard an altercation on the stairs - a man threw some things at me, and ran down, the prosecutrix called out something - I ran down, and the witness caught hold of me.</p>

On Satur<lb></lb>day morning, the 28th of August, I received information of an offence about to be committed—in consequence of which I went to Mr. Drake's house in Camden-villas, about eight o'clock on Sunday night the 29th of August—I took three policemen there, left them in the house, and placed them in different parts—on the Sunday evening at a quarter past seven, I saw the prisoner in company with one Jones, within about 300 yards of Mr. Drake's house, and near to the Robin Hood beer-shop, there was the prisoner, Jones and Cole, all three together—at five minutes after nine I saw Jones and Johnson leave the same beer-shop together, they appeared to go towards Mr. Drake's house, but I lost them, as I wanted to avoid their seeing me—about half-past nine I went into Mr. Drake's house, and found the prisoner and Jones both in custody.</p>

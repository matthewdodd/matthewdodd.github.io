When I went there with the officer he denied knowing the boy, or having any property of mine, or any other persons in his possession. I found nothing but the kerseymere that I could swear to. It was under some things on the tester of a bed. I fetched Parton, who told Riley, in my presence, that he had sold him the kerseymere, for 1 s. 6 d., on the Saturday before; Riley denied it altogether, but gave no account of how he became possessed of it.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I went with the prosecutor to Riley's, and found these articles under a parcel of rubbish on the top of a bed - Riley was not at home, but he came in, and I read my warrant; he denied having the property, or knowing the boy. Mr. Maire told me to stop five minutes, and fetched Parton, who said,</p>
               <p>"That is what I sold him for 1 s. 6 d. on Saturday last."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you say to him? A. I only read my warrant, and said I was come to search his house - I did not say any thing more till Mr. Maire fetched the boy; Riley then denied knowing him, or having any kerseymere in his house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MAIRE. I know it by a pattern, which is marked on it, to cut out a pair of trowsers, but it would not do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know any thing of Riley? A. No. I saw the property found on the top of the tester.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>PARTON'S Defence. Two or three days before I was going to Mr. Bousfield's, with a pattern in my hand - I was standing by this man, and he asked me what I had got there; I said a pattern of cloth; he gave me some sweet meats, and asked me if I could bring him some. I took him this, and he gave me 1 s. 6 d. for it.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave Riley an excellent character.</p>

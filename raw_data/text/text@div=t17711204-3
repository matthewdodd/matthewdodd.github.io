I discharged another customer that I had in the shop immediately, and I told the prisoner my master would be down up a quarter of an hour. I went up stairs and watched her through a hole, and saw her lean over the counter and take the neckcloths out of the drawer, and put them into her apron. I acquainted my master of it; he got up and sent me for a constable. I saw the neckcloths again when they were taken from behind the door.</p>

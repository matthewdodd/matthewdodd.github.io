               <p>THOMAS GROVE. I am a watch-case maker. I was coming down Holborn-bill, and at the corner of Shoe-lane (there was a crowd), I saw the prisoner and two others in the act of picking pockets - I saw the prosecutor come up, with a bag in his hand, and the prisoner took the handkerchief from his right-hand pocket; I secured him, and took him to the watch-house - I saw him take it out of the prosecutor's pocket; he threw it down - a woman picked it up. and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing at the corner of Shoe-lane: there was a crowd round a man who was selling pamphlets - a gentleman lost his handkerchief, and a man charged me with it; I denied it, and he gave me in charge; he went after the gentleman, who said be could not swear to the handkerchief, as a woman had stopped him, and told him if he did not mind his handkerchief would fall out: at Guildhall he said most likely it had fallen out of his pocket.</p>

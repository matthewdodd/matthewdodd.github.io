                  </hi>. I live in West-street, Smithfield, and am an ironmonger. On 22nd Jan. I was with my horse and cart in Stingo-lane, about a quarter before five o'clock—I went into Mr. Lovegrove's, to deliver some goods—I was called out to move my cart, to make way for a load of gravel—I left my cloak on my horse, and returned to Mr. Lovegrove's—I stayed about three minutes, and then missed my cloak—it was a blue cloak with a velvet collar.</p>

I saw Mr. Brees bring his horse and cart out of Stingo-lane into Walmer-street—I saw something over the horse's back—I saw the prisoner stand on the edge of the kerb-stone—he looked over the horse's back, and took the article off the horse's back, put it under his arm, and ran down Walmer-place—when he turned the corner, he ran—when I saw him again, he was lighting his pipe—I had seen him previously, so as to be sure he is the per<lb></lb>son—I afterwards saw him at an apple-stall—I pointed him out to the officer.</p>

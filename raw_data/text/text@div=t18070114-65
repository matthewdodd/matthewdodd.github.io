On the 24th of December, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner came in under pretence of buying a waistcoat; I shewed him one, he did not like the pattern nor the price; he staid about ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing. - A. No, nor I did not suspect him, while he was in the shop; as I was returning from the other side of the shop, where I had been to get some other waistcoats to shew him, the prisoner was going out of the shop, and immediately after he went out I missed a piece of toilenet from the shop window. I went out to look after him; I saw him about a yard or two off, I went after him and stopped him, I opened his coat and found a piece of toilenet, I took him into the shop; I called John Hall from the inner room to come and detain him; while I went for an officer he got away; as I returned with the constable I met the prisoner, the constable then apprehended him. I am sure the toilenet is my master's property, I had it in my hands two minutes before he came into the shop.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to that gentleman's shop, I asked to purchase a waistcoat, he shewed me some, for which he asked me ten shillings; I offered seven shillings; with that he was very angry and we had some words together. The gentleman was alone, and because I would not give him his price he charged me with this; I never took any thing from him nor did he take any thing from my person.</p>

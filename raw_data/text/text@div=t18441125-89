                  </hi>. I am beadle of Trinity-square. On. Monday, the llth of Nov., I saw the two prisoners, about nine o'clock in the morning, looking in at several houses—I followed them through Barking Church-yard to Tower-street, and when they got to Foulkes's-buildings, I saw King go into the prosecutor's house—I kept my eye on Warren, who was in a pas<lb></lb>sage leading to Foulkes's-buildings—in a minute or two, they both came round the corner of the passage—Warren had this coat under his arm—I went and took King, and Warren threw the coat into the passage of a house in Tower-street—I took it up.</p>

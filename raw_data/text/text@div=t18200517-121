I put my hand into my pocket and kept hold of my watch. I observed Hutchins standing half in front of me, with his hand near my ribbon; I felt that he had hold of the seals ready to pull, and felt his hand tremble as he cut off the seals. I kept looking at them both in order to identify them - a young man was with them. All at once they moved away; I put my hand down, keeping my eye on them, and felt my seals gone - I followed and collared them both before they were out of my sight. I have not recovered my seals.</p>
               <p>JOHN CALLS. I am a coachman. I was in the court-yard, and saw the prosecutor move from one place to another - six or eight of these gentlemen followed him, and all collected round him. I was at the back of Hutchins, he pulled a sharp instrument out of his pocket, I saw him cut the seals off, they dropped into Grimsdale's hand, and another man went off with them directly - I should know him again. I secured Hutchins, and assisted in taking both to he watch-house.</p>

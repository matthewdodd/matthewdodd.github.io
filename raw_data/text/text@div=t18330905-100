            . I live at No. 8, Rose-lane. The prisoner lodged with me five or six days - he came about the 15th of March, a woman lodged with him as his wife, and a child; it was a furnished room, there was a tinder-box, flint, and steel in the room, among the furniture; the steel was very much like this, but one steel might be like another; there is no mark on it; I recollect the policeman coming to me on the 22nd of March with Williams; I showed them where the prisoner lodged; there was a tinder-box there then, but the flint and steel were not there; I had not been in their room while they were there; they left my house on the 22nd of March - they slept there on the night of the 21st of March both of them; I did not see the prisoner on the 21st of March, after dinner time, about noon; I never saw him any more till I saw him in custody; I saw a light in his room at two o'clock in the morning; I did not see him in the room; I saw the woman next morning - I saw the woman when I went to bed at ten o'clock at night - she was then at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050062"></xptr>work; I did not hear her go out; the prisoner was not in the house when I went to bed; they had no key of the outer door; it bolts inside, but has no lock; I did not bolt the door that night; I heard the woman bolt it after I went into my room to go to bed - I did not hear anybody go out in the night nor come in - I should have heard if I had been awake; I saw a light in their room about two o'clock in the morning; it shone into my room and I got out of bed; I heard no voices in their room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a steel and flint in the room - when did you last see the steel? A. I never saw it till after he was taken to Lambeth-street; I had not seen it in my room after I gave it to them; I saw it when they came to lodge with me on the 15th, in the evening - I gave it to them.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SCOULEN re-examined. The policeman gave me the bundle, it was cloth - I used it by the magistrate's leave - I had bought three yards of the cloth, and cut a coat of it; and when it was before the magistrate, the chalk marks which I had left on the cloth to cut it by, were on it- I saw them - I can swear it was in my shop on the night of the 21st; I have not the least doubt of it - the cloth was in a handkerchief, which belongs to my brother - I have not brought that here - I have got a shirt front, which was found in the prisoner's lodging, which is mine, but I cannot tell whether it was taken that night or not - here it is - I know it by the tape, which I sewed on it myself - I found it myself at the prisoner's lodging at Martin's - I thought it was Cockrene that measured the shoes, but I may be mistaken, as there were two or three there at the time - my mother was present - it was a new pair of shoes, which had never been worn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any mark on the cloth? A. Yes, a chalk line right across it; I had crossed it several times, it was three or four times across - the cross lines were made to cut the coat by, but the other line was made that I should not cut any further; to cut my coat according to my cloth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent - I left my supposed wife about half-past eight o'clock in the morning in pursuit of work, I went in the country, and heard she was taken for felony when I came to London.</p>

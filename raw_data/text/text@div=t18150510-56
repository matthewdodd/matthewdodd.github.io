The officer informed me that I had lost my handkerchief; I had used the handkerchief about ten minutes before I lost it. I did not see who took it. I am quite sure the handkerchief I saw in the officer's hands, was mine, my name is on it. The officer has kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARRETT. On the 2nd of May, I went down to Harlow Green Fair. I saw the prisoners at the bar, in company with two others, and watched them afterwards; the other two that escaped, stopped before Munroe, and the two prisoners went behind Munroe; Tachary put his hand into Munroe's pocket; the other covered him at the same time; he hid him as much as he could from me. Tachary unbuttoned his trowsers, and put the handkerchief inside his trowsers. I told Munroe he had had his pocket picked; I was alone by myself; I caught the two prisoners. On searching Walker, I found this handkerchief on Walker; I found the prosecutor's handkerchief on Tachary, and two others. Walker said, Tachary picked pockets, and gave him the things.</p>

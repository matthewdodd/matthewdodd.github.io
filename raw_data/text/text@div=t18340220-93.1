             (police-constable, N 214.) On the 31st of December I was on duty in Hackney-road - about half-past nine o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner in Union-street, with this Bible in a coarse apron - I followed him about fifty yards, and asked him where he was going with it - he said, to his father in Kingsland-road, and he had brought it from his sister, next door to the Ranters' chapel- I took him to the station, and found the last leaf of the index loose on his person - he was taken before the magistrate the next day - I had not then found the owner of the book, and he was discharged - this is the Bible.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty by Westminster-abbey; there was a sudden crush to get in. I observed several about whom I suspected, and saw the prisoner catch at a woman's shawl, twist it up round his arm, and shove it into his bosom. I immediately took him out of the mob with it. I could not tell who the woman was. I sent Webb to find her out - Wells claimed it.</p>

I had been dining in Baker-street—in the evening my niece came to go home with me—I left a little before eight o'clock—I crossed over from Baker-street up Crawford-street, near Bryanston-square—the first thing I noticed was the prisoner Russell looking me in the face—I had a purse containing a sovereign in my pocket—I had seen it safe a short time before—soon after Russell looked me in the face a gentleman came and made some communica<lb></lb>tion, in consequence of which I felt in my pocket, and missed my purse and sovereign.</p>

               <p>I was in Baker-street that night—I saw the prisoners together—I had frequently seen them before—I saw the prosecutrix with her friend—the prisoners were behind them—I was on the opposite side of the way—I came up to them first on the same side of the way, then I crossed, over-took them, and watched them from Baker-street—they went on the same side of the way that I first saw them till they got to Madame Tussaud's—Hughes then parted from them, went to the next turning, and waited till the ladies had passed him—the other two were following the ladies—they all three followed on till they got to Crawford-street—they then crossed Glouces<lb></lb>ter-place—I saw Hughes stoop down and lift up the prosecutrix's dress—the other prisoners were close behind him—I saw the prosecutrix's dress sticking up behind, and after a short time it dropped gently down—the prisoners then turned back, and turned the corner into Gloucester-place—I went after the prosecutrix, and spoke to her—I looked for a policeman—I met two together, and told them—I went with them to the New-road, and saw the prisoners coming along Circus-street leading to the New-road—they were secured—I saw Mr. Gaunt at the station—she pointed out one of the three prisoners—I thought she meant Aston.</p>

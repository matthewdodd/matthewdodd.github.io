               <p>Q. Is the room up stairs, or on the ground-floor? - A. Upon the ground-floor, it is a back-room; before I went out of the house, I double locked the door, and put the key in my breeches pocket; I was out about half an hour, or three quarters of an hour; when I returned, I found my room door broke open, the lock was forced, and some of the screws were loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other lodgers besides in the house? - A. There are some who lodge up stairs, but not in that part; there is a passage door in New Peter-street, that comes into this room only, that I rent, none of the other lodgers, nor even Mrs. Dunton, enter that door, but myself, the common door of the house opens into Great Peter-street; when I came into my room with my lighted candle, which I brought from the public-house, I found my bed, pillows, bolster, and blankets gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were in your room when you went out? - A. Yes; on the Tuesday following, I went before the Justice, and by his desire, the watchman or constable from the Public-office, returned all my thing except the pillows, the same evening; the pillows the constable has to produce here, which I can swear to.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you know either of the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes, both, for several years, by living in the same neighbourhood; I knew them when they were little; about a week before Christmas, on a Saturday, I was standing at my own door, No. 2, in Old Pye-street, I saw these two lads, along with some bed and bedding as I took it to be; the first time, I saw Dealy alone with the bedding, the next time, I saw them both with the bed, they came past my door, in the direction from where this house is.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from this? - A. About four or five hundred yards, it was then near seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Dealy go back, after you saw him carry the bedding? - A. Yes, in about five minutes; and they both returned the same way in about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time Dealy passed you, did you see where he carried what he had with him? - A. To one Mrs. Franklin's, who keeps an old iron and clothes shop, two doors off from me; I saw him come out again, and he had left behind him what he carried in.</p>
               <p>Q. When they both came by you a second time, did you see where they went to with the bed? - A. To the same house, Mrs. Franklin's; upon this, and knowing the two lads, I went down to Mr. Farder, the constable, and gave the information; he came to Mrs. Franklin's, and brought out the bedding and other things; I was present when they were brought out, I did not go in.</p>

               <p>Q. Is this Mrs. Dunton a married woman? - A. Yes, she has a great family.</p>

               <p>Percival. I saw one with W upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor.) This was in an unfurnished room; your own property, and not Mrs. Dunton's? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Jones's defence. When we went up to the office to have a hearing, that old gentleman that belongs to the property, was asked whether the door was open or locked, he said it was left open.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Percival.) Did he declare to you that the door was left open? - A. No; I will explain that business: when I enquired who had lost this property, after going into several shops, I went into Mrs. Dunton's; she said, the poor old man in her house had been robbed; there was a glass door between Mrs. Dunton's room and him, which was locked; and I went round and saw the old gentleman in the room making sad lamentation; he said, I went out and locked the door, I tried it, and put the key in my pocket, and the lock is loose; I examined it, and observed it was deficient in the screws.</p>
               <p>Dealy said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Percival.) Who apprehended the prisoners? - A. I did, about a month afterwards.</p>

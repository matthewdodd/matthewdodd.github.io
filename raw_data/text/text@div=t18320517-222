               <p>ROBERT JOHN WICKS. These boots belong to Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170106"></xptr>Kerenhappuch Armstrong - I was serving a customer, and saw the prisoner going from the shop, putting something under his coat - I looked over my board to see if he had taken a pair of boots which were there, but he had not; I pursued, but he got away; the officer afterwards brought him and these two boots, which I know are Mrs. Armstrong's - I am quite sure he is the man I saw going from the shop; I knew nothing of him before - I have the two fellow boots to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the shop? A. Yes, you were retreating from the shop - you came begging, and took them.</p>
               <p>JOHN NEWTON (Police-constable E 32). I was on duty near the King's-cross, and saw the prisoner come running towards me - I stopped him, and asked what he had got; he said a pair of boots, which he was going to take to St. Giles'; I found those two odd boots - I went to Islington, and found the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man I knew gave me them to mind for him.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of Bishopsgate; the prosecutrix came to me, and informed me that she had been robbed; she said the prisoner lived at Cole's coffee-house, Ball-alley, Cornhill, she was a servant there; I took her into custody; I went to the pawnbroker's, and he produced the Bible and the ring; he said he would have nothing to do with the prosecution; I produce the Bible and the ring. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I lodged along with Mrs. King a month the first time; I went away from her into place, and was there about a fortnight; I came away from that place, and went to Mrs. King's again; she said a great many times she would have this chest opened; I never saw the key but once; she had several people in the house besides me. After I was gone to the coffee-house in Cornhill, she had it broke open, and she came to me, and said I had robbed her of these things; she knows that she sent me with them herself to pledge.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) Did you ever send the woman to pawn these things? - A. Only a frock of my child's for one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever send her with any of this property? - A. I never did; I never missed them till I got a whitesmith to open my chest, and the first thing I missed was my ring.</p>

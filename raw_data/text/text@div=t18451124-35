On Saturday night, the 18th of Oct., in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Masters' s, a pawnbroker's shop, in Brewer-street, about half-past eight o'clock—I was in plain clothes—I found the prisoner Bodill in the shop—his back was towards me, and when I went into the shop, I said, by mistake, "Mr. Gamble"—he turned round, and said, "My name is not Gamble, it is Bodill"—I then saw it was Bodill—I knew him before—I asked him when he saw Gamble last—he said, "About an hour ago, at Croft's public-house, in Windmill-street, Haymarket"—I suppose he knew me—he said he had an appointment with him at the General Wolfe's Head, Clement's-lane, City, at nine o'clock—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody for stealing watches from Mr. French"—I</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my brother, John French, a watch and chronometer maker, 80, Cornhill; he occupies the basement and ground floor. Peter Pattison is the owner of the house, and some of his servants reside there—it is in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill—Gamble has been in my brother's employ nearly four years, and in my father's four more—our business is very extensive—the two watches found on Bodill are the property of cus<lb></lb>tomers of ours, in our care (looking at eight watches, Nos. 8128, 2163, 6803, 5837, 7574, 2751, 54295, and 4229)—these, Nos. 2163 and 4229 are job watches, brought by customers to be repaired, the others are my brother's—one of the job watches was brought by Mr. Gilmore, and the other by Barry—we have missed watches of this kind from the stock since these discoveries have taken place—No. 2183 is worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two of the watches are worth rather less than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the value of the whole is rather more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Gamble was dismissed from my brother's service on Thursday, 16th Oct.—after he was in custody, in consequence of a message sent to me I went to see him in Tothill<lb></lb>fields prison—I said nothing to induce him to say anything to me—I cautioned him, after the officer who was present cautioned him—I said, "Whatever you say, Gamble, will be used against you, therefore use your discretion"—he said he felt deeply sorry for having done what he had, and proceeded to make a statement to me, which I reduced to writing within three hours—I did not say it would be better or worse for him if he made a statement (<hi rend="italic">looking at his memorandum</hi>)—he said he had on various occasions given Henderson watches stolen from Mr. French, to pawn, and also to Bodill—that this had been going on for many months—that Henderson never gave either money or duplicates to him, nor did Bodill—that Bodill and Hender<lb></lb>son were both repeatedly pressed by him to give back the duplicates, as he intended to confess all to Mr. French, that Bodill having once got him into his power threatened him to discover him to Mr. French, in order to obtain more property from him—that in no instance had Gamble intercepted watches to be sent to customers, Mr. P----'s case excepted—he had never pawned or stolen new work himself, that is gold or silver cases—that it always was his intention to confess his guilt to Mr. French, and implore his mercy—that he did so now because he felt Mr. French's kindness had been returned by great ingratitude, and he saw no way of making reparation but to give every informa<lb></lb>tion by which Mr. French might recover his property—that he had no defence of his conduct to make, and imputed his disgrace principally to Bodill's per<lb></lb>suasion—that Bodill recommended him to establish a French hazard bank, in Panton-street, by way of getting money—that he consented to do so—that apartments were accordingly taken by Bodill and Eustace, that gambling was carried on, in which Gamble was generally a loser.</p>

I have been in the prosecutor's employ for about seventeen years—I have seen Bodill repeatedly in the shop—he came to see Gamble; and I have seen him outside the shop, at the corner of Finch-lane, waiting at the corner three or four times a day looking in at our side window—I never saw him in Gamble's company except in the shop.</p>

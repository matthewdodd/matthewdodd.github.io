               <p>Q. Then you can't say whether Carey ever came to buy goods at your house, or not? - A. Most certainly I can; I am not wholly confined to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110052"></xptr>books; the accompting-house is in the back of the warehouse, and no person can come in or out without my seeing them.</p>

               <p>I am a sawyer, I work with Mr. Wrightson, of Bethnal-green; I know the prisoner, and I know Randall, who was tried last sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Randall and Carey together? - A. Yes; on the Thursday that Mrs. Carey was taken up; Carey was at the George public-house, in Bethnal-green Road, and Mrs. Patrick came to me when I was at the Green-man, to desire me to go to Carey; I went to him, and he asked me to go to town; accordingly, I went to Mr. Randall's with Mr. Carey, and when we came to Mr. Randall's house, he was not at home; we turned back and came again; when we went a second time, he was not at home, we went up stairs and waited a-while till he came in; Mr. Carey and Mr. Randall went into a back room together, what they said I cannot tell; then we came from Randall's to Mr. Carey's house, No. 9, North's-place, Bethnalgreen, it was between ten and eleven at night, as near as I can guess; then Mr. Carey asked me to carry a bundle to Mrs. Patrick's, which I did; then I went back again to Carey's, and Mr. Randall took the next bundle, he carried it to the gateway, and I took it in; and then Mr. Randall went to Mr. Carey's, and I went back again; and Randall took the next bundle; and Mr. Randall, and Mr. Carey and I came away together to Mrs. Patrick's, that made the third bundle; and Mr. Carey had a small bundle, but what it was I don't know; and then, after that, Mr. Carey, and Mr. Randall, and I, came away; we parted facing the Salmon and Ball, and I wished them a good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all tell what those bundles contained? - A. No; they were large bundles, and were all carried to Mrs. Patrick's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with the same master then that you do now? - A. Yes, and have done ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all told where they came from, or what they were, or what they were to be done with? - A. No; when Carey asked me to carry them, I did not know any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you know much of Randall? - A. No; I only saw him once or twice; I saw him once when he fetched the bundles, and once after, with Carey, at a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Randall lodge? - A. At a tin-shop, in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who carried the first bundle to Mrs. Patrick's? - A. I did, and Randall carried the second and third.</p>

               <p>Q. None of these bundles were carried to Mrs. Patrick's by Carey? - A. No; there was a little bundle, but I don't know that he carried it to Mrs. Patrick's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell any body of this? - A. Not till Mr. Brounger and Mr. Wray came to take me up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were charged with stealing some of these goods? - A. No, I was not; when I was taken up, I was to bring proof where they came from.</p>
               <p>Q. You never charged Carey till after you were taken up yourself? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. By that means you have yourself escaped a prosecution? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not escaped prosecution by accusing him? -</p>
               <p>Court. Let the Jury and me draw the conclusion, you have got the fact from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were you detained in custody till the sessions to give an account of it? - A. No; I was detained till the next Monday, and my master came and bailed me to appear at the sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect at all that they were dishonestly come by? - A. Not at all.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not apprehend either of the prisoners? - A. I did not; not I did not go to their house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. How many bundles were under the bed? - A. Three; they are all here.</p>
               <p>Q. And a fourth? - A. Yes; a small parcel in a white piece of linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been in the same story, that you found three bundles under the bed? - A. What I found was under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said so; did you not say, upon the last trial, you found two bundles under the bed? - A. It might be so, but there were three.</p>
               <p>Q. It was taken down two. Now, are you to be believed, upon your oath, last trial, or to-day? - A. I speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find two bundles or three? - A. I can't pretend to say whether I did not; there is all the property that I did find.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not material; we shall see the things, and we shall hear whether they are the things stolen by Randall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. These were the same things you produced upon the trial of Randall? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Worship-street office, I apprehended Mr. Carey: I went to his house with a search-warrant, on Saturday the 27th of February, Bingham went with me, and Sapwell; I and Sapwell went to the back door, and Bingham to the front; we knocked a considerable time, and nobody answered; I opened the back door that opened into a back wash-house, and got in; and then there was another door, I unlocked that, and then I thought I heard somebody inside of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time was it? - A. Between seven and eight o'clock; I had forced the bottom bolt off the door very near, and Carey, the prisoner, then said, you have no occasion to knock any more, I will open the door; says he, I know what you want; I informed him I had a search-warrant, which I took out of my pocket and read to him; he said, very well, you may search; I opened a box, and found these things. (Producing a quantity of cloaths).</p>
               <p>Q. Had Carey himself any waistcoat on? - A. No, he was not drest; there was a waistcoat laid upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these goods produced upon the trial of Randall? - A. No; they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the goods that were found at Careys's, that were produced at Randall's trial? - A. I believe, Tipper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There were no goods produced upon Randall's trial that were found at Carey's.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of the city; I was sent for to apprehend Mrs. Carey, on the 25th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with any search-warrant to the house of Mr. Carey? - A. Yes; I went with Wray.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any thing that you found there? - A. Yes, three tickets, which I found in the drawers at Carey's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing there which you produced at Randall's trial? - A. Yes; these things in Wray's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing sworn to upon Randall's trial that you found at Carey's house? - A. Yes; three bundles of buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Any Russia duck? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Tipper.) Produce the bundle that the Russia duck is in, and let Mr. Brounger look at it.(Produces one of the bundles found at Mrs. Patrick's).</p>
               <p>Mr. Brounger. This Russia duck is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it what you prosecuted Randall for stealing? - A. It is; I know this perfectly well to be my property, it has my private mark upon it, and I can swear to this never having been sold to any person; there has never been an inch of it sold to any body. The other things I know by the mark, by the method of their being made, and, indeed, every thing relating to them. The reason Randall was taken up was from the woman prisoner at the bar being taken up, who disclosed the whole, and through her means it was that I recovered my property.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jackson. Upon your oath, will you venture to swear they are your property? - A. I certainly believe them to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. But can you swear they are your's, and that they have not been sold? - A. I can swear that some of them have not been sold; but our articles are so similar, that it is impossible to swear to some of them; I can swear to the Russia duck being mine; I can swear to the whole being my make.</p>

About the twelfth of March, on a Saturday, Cook and I were together at the Cock alehouse in Old-street, about nine at night; we went from there to Mr. Napper's. I got over the gate, and he stood on the outside. I got two pieces of callicoe, twenty yards each, about a yard wide, from out of a shed, about thirty or forty yards from his house. I came over the same place to Cook; then we went into White-horse court to one Bilson; he was to buy them of us. He went out and fetched Wright and another man; they came to us at the White Lion in Christopher's-alley; then it was about eleven at night. They asked to look at the cloth. They passed for weavers. They measured it. I asked two guineas for it; at last they gave me thirty shillings for it. I never saw them before in my life. I told them, I bought it on board a ship. Wright paid me the money.</p>

The evidence went there; it was Wright. Wright said, You know I did not buy them; I only paid part of the money; there was another man concerned; it was two pieces of callicoe, forty yards. There was one Booth by when the evidence was selling them. He said, they were stolen goods; and would have persuaded Wright not to buy them. The evidence said to Wright, You know you bought them, and Lancaster lent you part of the money. I was before Sir John when Cook was examined.

Lancaster said to Wright, Will you have part of it? Wright said, he had swapped goods away about three weeks before for shirt cloth, and did not want any. Then Lancaster said, Will you go with me and pass your judgement upon it? They both went out of the house. I did not go to the public house with them; I went to the Cock. As they came back I saw Lancaster had got the cloth tyed up in a handkerchief. He asked me if I would buy some of it; I looked at it, and said, it did not suit me.</p>

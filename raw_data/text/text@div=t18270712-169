I have been about twelve months in town; I came from Shropshire. On the 6th of June I was in Oxford-street, about five o'clock in the evening, and was accosted by a man, who said he had some cheap gloves to sell. I went with him to a house in <placeName id="t18270712-169-crimeloc936">Robert-street</placeName>

I agreed with that man for two dozen pairs of gloves, at 10d. per pair - I had not seen the pirsoner then. The man said I should have them in the evening. He then gave me a piece of linen and a shawl, to keep as security - I gave him a sovereign, and he left the room; and the prisoner then entered the room, pushed by me, and took the goods from me. I told him I had paid for them - I was standing at the table, with them in my hand. He said I should not have them till I had paid more money; I said I had paid a sovereign, and would have them - he swore I should not, till he had more money, and I left the house to get an officer - I could find none, but gave information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the value of the goods? A. I cannot tell; the cloth was as thick as my arm; I did not go back to the house that evening - I passed by, to know the name of it, but spoke to no one, nor did I go into it, I swear that. I never saw the man who sold me the gloves, in the prisoner's company. I went to the house next day, and inquired of the landlord for the prisoner; two dozens of gloves were sent to my house after the prisoner was examined. I did not go back and see the prisoner at the house; I walked up the street, to see for an officer, and as I returned I think I saw the prisoner near the door, but I could not find an officer, and could not wait, as some friends were coming to dinner; I did not speak to him; it must have been between seven and eight o'clock when I passed the house - I had dined then, and had a friend with me; I did not go in - I did not like the looks of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say the parcel was his, and the man had no right to leave it with you? A. No. I would not give 1l. for the things; I only took them as security; it was a cotton shawl.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You took them as a deposit, and did not purchase them? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on the 15th of June, in Holborn - I said"'Richard, I want you - there is information that you committed a felony in Robert-street, respecting some gloves;" he denied it - I said I must secure him - he said, "Well, what would you advise me to do?" I said I could advise him nothing, and as we went along he said, "Do you think if the swell gets his money he will be satisfied?" I said, "No, I think he means to prosecute." I left him with Furzman, while I went into the City - when I returned he said, "Now, Buckeridge, as a man, what would you advise me to do?" I said I could advise nothing, and took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a licenced-hawker, and went out with a man who carries goods for me; I met my brother and a friend; we went to the Rodney's Head, in Robert-street, and left my bundle with the landlord; I sent my man to get some steaks - we dined, and about half-past four o'clock the prosecutor and another person came and went into the parlour; a man named Bond then came in, took up my goods, and carried them into the parlour, to this gentleman. The other person came into the tap-room, and said he hoped I should not be offended, but he had left a piece of linen and a shawl with the gentleman; they had cost me above 4l. - I said he had no business with my goods. I went into the parlour - my goods were on the table; I went to pack them up - the prosecutor said, "These goods are to go with me, as I have paid a sovereign for some gloves," and pointed to the man who had spoken to him in the street; I said he was a stranger, and unless he paid for them I would not let them go; he went away, returned at half-past five o'clock, and inquired if the person who was to sell him the gloves had returned- they said he had not, but he would be there - he then asked if I would give him the sovereign which he had paid; I said I had had no sovereign, and would give nothing - he went away, returned about six o'clock, and said again,"Will you give me the sovereign?" I said No - he then said if the gloves were not sent that evening, he would next morning see further about it; I heard no more till I was taken in charge. I knew the man who sold the gloves had been arrested, and sent to the Marshalsea - he said nothing about the bundle when he came back. I never said, would the swell take his money.</p>

            . I am a soda-water maker, and live in Camden-town. I was at the Rodney's Head about an hour, when the prisoner came in; I was in his company two or three hours, from four o'clock till half-past six or seven- I am certain he was there till half-past six.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did he not leave the house during all that time? A. No - he had a pipe - I was in the same room with him; he was not away above two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you known him? A. Twelve or fourteen years. I was a publican when I first knew him - he lives somewhere in the City. I met him by accident - I did not see the prosecutor there. I know Bond, a broker; I believe I have seen the prisoner in his company, but not lately - it is two or three months since I have seen Bond; I cannot say where it was, or when; I have drank with the prisoner at that house. Bond very likely might be there, but I do not recollect it. I never knew the prisoner by any other name - I never heard him called Bond.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and am a printer. I went to this house with my brother; as we went into the room he took his bundle from the lad, and asked the landlord to take care of it; I saw the prosecutor there that evening; he asked if the young man had returned, who he paid a sovereign to, for some gloves; a young man there said he need not fear, as he would be sure to send them. A young man said he had taken the liberty to leave some of my brother's goods; my brother went in a passion, and said he had no business to leave them - he went into the parlour, and got them. We remained there till about seven o'clock, and went away together.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Who is your master? A. Mr. Walden; he had sent me to Duke-street with a message, but it may hurt him to mention who I was to go to; I went out about half-past twelve o'clock, and went to Duke-street - I do not like to mention the business I went about. The prosecutor asked if that fellow had returned, who he had paid the sovereign to; I went into the house between 3 and 4 o'clock - my master lives about a mile and a half from the public-house; my brother was in the parlour for eight or ten minutes; I do not know the man who took his goods - he was quite a stranger; I have heard his name was Bond; Mr. Phillips came to the house twice that evening - whether he gave his address I cannot say; my brother was angry at his goods being taken- he was with me all the evening; I might see Bond come in, but I do not know him. I went to a house in King-street, Westminster, with my brother, about half-past eight o'clock, and remained till half-past ten - he had a bundle and a blue bag.</p>
               <p>JOHN AVANT. Bond has been a broker, in the upholdstery line, and dealt in drapery.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. The goods were in my possession - I had my hand upon them.</p>

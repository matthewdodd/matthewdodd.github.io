                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. William Henry Carey, of Tyron's-place, Hackney. On Monday evening, 7th Oct., about half-past six o'clock, I met the prisoner about a yard from the carriage-house door, in the street—I met one man first, and then the prisoner, and another man—I passed close by the side of them, and had a good opportunity of observing them—they were walking very slowly—I went in-doors, and about half-past seven, I was putting my master's children to bed on the second-floor, and my atten<lb></lb>tion was attracted by the opening of our bed-room window, which is the adjoining room—it is in front of the house, and the window looks into the street, over the stable—I did not think anything further of it till I left the room at a quarter to eight, when I found the window and door wide open, and a chair placed against the door—I shut the window and door, and went down to my mistress's room on the first-floor—the door of that room was shut—I did not know whether it was fastened, and I listened—I heard a rust<lb></lb>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185010210061"></xptr>
               <p>of paper, and concluded it was my mistress, and did not attempt to open the door—as I left the room I was met by one of the young ladies, who requested me to get something from the room; I said some one was there—she said, "Mamma is not there," and we rushed down-stairs, got the cook, and she burst the room open, and I saw the prisoner there with a lighted candle in the room—I had a full opportunity of seeing him—I have no doubt he is the man—I never saw him before—we then rushed down-stairs and alarmed my mistress—I did not return for three-quarters of an hour, and then found a crow-bar and several matches on the bed, and some in the room—on examining the premises, I should say the entry had been effected over the stable, and at the attic window—the prisoner was about three yards from the stable when I met him at a quarter-past six—I gave a description of the prisoner to Clark the policeman—on the following Friday morning, I went with my master into Pearson-steet, and saw the prisoner there, and recognised him—Clark was walking behind, in case I should give information as to the man I saw—if I saw the man, I was to give a signal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a knitting-needle manufacturer, and know the house kept by Chester. On Monday, 7th Oct., I was there before the prisoner came in—I am sure it was the 7th, not the 10th—the prisoner came about four o'clock—I remained till nigh twelve—I went up to a <hi rend="italic">sing-song</hi> up-stairs—the prisoner left about half-past eight—the singing had then begun—he did not go up to it—I left the parlour about a quarter to nine—I saw the prisoner have tea about six—I first heard he had been taken, last Monday week—I was applied to appear at the police-court, and did so—I had not been acquainted with the prisoner—I had seen him there once or twice before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had yon ever spoken to him at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to make any acquaintance; I have said, "Good morning," or "Good afternoon"—I never drank with him before—we did not have anything particular together that day—he had four or five pints of the best ale, and I drank such a thing as two glasses of it—I was there when he came in—Fipos came in with him—he did not remain above a minute, just looked into the door, or so—he did not have anything to drink that I saw—he could have taken it without my seeing him at the bar, but I do not expect that he could in the parlour—he did not sit down, to my knowledge—I was there on the Wednesday—I cannot answer whether I saw Fipos there that day—I can't answer about Wednesday—I am there every evening after I have done work—I cannot exactly say what time I went on the Wednesday—it was three o'clock that I went on the Monday—I noticed the time then, because I was not at work that day—on the Wednesday I remained there till ten—I went that day in the evening; it was dark, but what time I cannot say—I work it 7, King-street, for myself, at making ivory and bone knitting-needles—I sell them to the Berlin-wool shops—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me <hi rend="italic">barring</hi> seeing him once or twice there—I did not see him there on the</p>

               <p>Wednesday—there were several people there—on the Monday there was no one else besides Mr. Fipos and Mr. Chester—persons might have come in at the door without my seeing them, but they did not sit down and have ale—Mr. Chester was not there all the time; he went out to serve his customers—when he was not serving them, he was sitting with us, and conversing with the prisoner part of the time—the prisoner did not leave the parlour at all above five minutes at the outside, when he went to take tea; and while he was there I went out and got a pint of porter—I had three pints, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for each pint as I had it—a great number of persons were up-stairs in the evening—I know the prisoner went at half-past eight, because I went to the bar a short time after, and saw the clock, and went up-stairs, and Mr. Cheater told me he must go up and get the room ready—I saw the clock after the prisoner was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 101, Ayre-street, and am a weaver's loom broker. On Monday, 7th Oct., I went to Mr. Chester, about a quarter to five, to get change for a shilling, and saw the prisoner there—I went in several times that evening up to seven o'clock, and aaw him there every time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Croos-examined. Q.</hi> How long did you remain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three minutes; perhaps two minutes—I did not sit down—I think I had some drink the second time I went in—I might have sat down there, but I cannot exactly say, because I did not expect to be summoned up on such an occasion—I swear I did not remain there from five to seven, talking to the prisoner—I think I spoke to him—I only knew him by seeing him in and out of the place—I did not know his name—I saw Buckmaster there, I think he was sitting down, and the landlord was there—I dare say there were four or five more, but I do not know who they were except those persons—I will not swear there were not four or five there the second time—I go there daily, and sometimes have a drop of ale—I do not know Tyron's-place, Hackney—I heard of this robbery on the Thursday.</p>

                  </hi>. I work with my sister, and live at 70, Pearson-street, where the prisoner lives. I remember the night of Monday, 7th Oct.—I got home that night as the clock was striking nine—the prisoner let me in—he had a dark green coat on, which he has now, and a dark handkerchief—I do not know Tyron's-place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is your sister living with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She lived at the same house; she is not his wife—my sister was at home on this even<lb></lb>ing, she is not here—besides us and the prisoner there is an old lady lives up-stairs, and Mrs. Sheene the landlady; she is not here—I and my sister live in the back-parlour, and the prisoner in the front—on this night I had been on a visit to 24, Feller-street, which is five minutes' walk from our house, and left there at five minutes to nine—I know I was there about an hour, because I looked at the clock when I went and when I came away—when I went it was five minutes to eight, and I was not to be any longer than an hour.</p>

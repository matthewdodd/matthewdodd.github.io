            . I am a broker, and live in Gloucester-street, Commercial-road. On the 16th of November, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner brought the floor-cloth - a woman came with him, who brought the carpet. The woman asked me to buy them - she wanted 2 l. for them; I offered her 28 s. for them both. They consulted together, and said I should have them. The prisoner said he was hired as a porter to bring them.</p>

            . I was present when the man and woman brought the things to my master's. The woman wanted 2 l. for them. They went outside the door. She asked the prisoner if he was agreeable to take it? He said, No. They came in again, and she asked if he would take 28 s.? He said Yes, he was agreeable. They went out. On the Thursday following the prisoner came and asked my master to buy a stove, and he detained him. I am certain the woman consulted him about taking the money. I was in the shop at the time, and my master was in the back room.</p>

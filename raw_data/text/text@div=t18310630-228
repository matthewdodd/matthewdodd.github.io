               <p>JANE JEFFS. I am ten years old, and live with my parents. When the prosecutor went out, a man came, knocked at the door, and asked for Mr. Hanshaw's-coat - the prisoner is the man; I did not give it to him - he walked in, and took it himself; it was a white coat - he pointed, and asked me to pull a box from under the bed; I pulled it out, and it was locked - he tried it; it was a heavy trunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him before? A. No - he was not long there; it was a wet day - he had a great coat on, and fustian trousers; I took particular notice of him - I have always said he was the man; I saw him again in about two months, at the Thames Police - I am sure he is the man.</p>

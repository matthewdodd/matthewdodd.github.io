On Tuesday night, the 3rd of August, I was on duty in Gracechurch-street, in com<lb></lb>pany with another officer named Hart, at a quarter-past three o'clock in the morning—in consequence of observing a man lurking about, I and Hart went up a court at the back of the prosecutor's premises—we there found these two bags, which I now produce—I opened both of them—one contained spoons and forks and other things, and the other, watches—we then looked about, and perceived the prisoner concealed in a truck, about a yard and a half from the bags, or not quite so much—Hart took hold of him—I asked him how long he had been there—he said about an hour and a half, or two hours—he said he had been asleep—I asked if he knew any thing of the bags—he asked "What bags?" and then said he knew nothing about them—I asked if he had got any thing in his pockets—he said, "No, "I was welcome to feel—I put my hand into the pocket of a great-coat which he had on, and found a great many spoons, knives, and forks—we took him to the station—as we were taking him to the Compter he said, if I had stopped five minutes longer, he should have been a man in the world—on our way to the station we met Perrin, but I heard nothing pass between them.</p>

On Monday evening, the 2nd of August, I lotted out this property for sale next day—I went to bed about a quarter to ten o'clock—this property was safe then—I was the last person up—my wife and family also sleep in the house—the doors and windows, and every thing, was secure, both up stairs and down—the window Hart speaks of was shut down and fast when I went to bed—there is an upper and a lower sale-room, and there is a communication between them by means of a circular office—this window being opened would give access to the second-floor sale-room, and any one could easily descend through that hole from the upper sale-room to the lower by means of a rope—I was roused up by the officers about twenty minutes before four o'clock—I went into the lower sale-room, and found all the property stated gone from it— every thing was gone except three or four articles—I had seen it all safe the night before when I went to bed—among other things was a great-coat, which I had ticketed for sale next day—next morning I went to Giltspur-street Compter, and there saw the prisoner, in the presence of Gooch, the turnkey—I put my hand into his pocket, and pulled out some watches, a gold brooch, a diamond ring, and other things—Gooch afterwards put his hand into his other pocket, and then he said, "You have not got them all," and he gave us three or four watches and chains out of his waistcoat pocket—I gave Gooch what I found—(<hi rend="italic">Gooch here produced the articles</hi>)—these are all my master's property—here is my own hand-writing on the tickets—this gold watch I took from the prisoner's person—I know it by the make and the chain, and it has my own numbering on it on a piece of paper, "Lot 305"—I placed that ticket on the watch on the Saturday or the Monday before the robbery, and it was safe with the other property in the lower sale-room when I went to bed that night—the whole of the pro<lb></lb>perty was in the lower sale-room—here are a great many other things which I took from the prisoner, with tickets on them made by me—I have looked at all the other property, and have no doubt it is all my master's—some of the watches I know by the maker's name and number, as well as by my tickets—the value of all the property is between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found no doors open in the morning, nor any windows, except the one I have mentioned.</p>

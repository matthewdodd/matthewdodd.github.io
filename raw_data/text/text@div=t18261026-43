On the 23d of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the shop, near the door - there were a great many customers; she asked for ribbons, and I showed her a drawer - she asked to see more, and I showed her another drawer; she bought three yards, at 6d, and before she left the shop I missed some from that drawer; I said nothing. She went two or three yards from the door; I went after her, and said I thought she had some ribbons; she said she had nothing but a piece of pork in her apron - I brought her back, took hold of her apron, three lengths of ribbon fell down, and two more dropped from her - they are worth 45s.</p>

On Saturday morning about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner and four other men together; they had all bundles under their arms: I said. lads, where did you get these bundles? one of them said, d - n you, what is that to you; I said, they might have made me a better answer, and I did not believe they came honestly by them; I pursued them; there were two gentlemen coming, I called out that they were thieves, and desired them to stop them, but they did not stop them: as soon as they had passed the gentlemen they began, running; I ran after, them; they ran up Lambeth-street; I saw some men coming, and cried, stop thief; upon that the prisoner made a stop, and I took hold of him; the other two; ran up a little alley that goes into Rupert-Square, and got off. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and found these things upon him; (producing them.)</p>

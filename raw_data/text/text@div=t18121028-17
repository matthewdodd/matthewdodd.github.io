On the 24th of October, the prisoner, and I think another woman, came into the shop; she asked to see some ribbons. I served her. She bought some ribbon; she paid for them. I gave her change; and I thought she was gone. I had done with her, and had gone to other customers. A young woman gave some information. I accused her of the ribbon; I requested her to walk up stairs; I sent for an officer to have her searched; my wife went up stairs first, I sent the prisoner in the middle, and as I was going up stairs, she dropped a piece of ribbon from between her gown and petticoat. I saw it fall, and picked it up, it was eighteen yards of ribbon. I said to her, you wicked woman, I am convinced you are a shop-lifter. She then begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the colour of the ribbon that fell from her on the stairs - A. An olive. The white ribbon was not found upon her. A window on the staircase was open, a young man found the white ribbon in the yard; and after I had given charge of her at the watch-house, it was shewed to her, she denied it, and owned to the olive; the young man that found it is not here. I know the ribbon to be mine.</p>

               <p>I was constable of the night; this woman was brought to the watch-house by the prosecutor and watchman, and she pulled out and gave me the watch, and said he gave her the watch to hold till he gave her two shillings, when they went back to a house where they had been before to have some gin; (Produced.) In the other pocket was the handkerchief, which the prosecutor claimed, and did not know he lost it till he saw it.</p>

               <p>I was going down the Hay-market a little after twelve o'clock, and the prosecutor asked me if I would go home with him, and we went and had some gin at two different places; he then asked me what he should give me; I told him two shillings: he pulled two six-pences out of his waistcoat pocket, and I told him I would not accept of that: he said he had no more silver about him, and asked me if I would trust to his honour; I told him I would not; he said he had gold about him, and said he would leave his watch with me, and would go back to the house where we had the first liquor, and get change, and give me the two shillings; I went along with him, and afterwards he asked me for his watch, and because I would not give it him without the two shillings, after some words, he gave the watchman charge.</p>

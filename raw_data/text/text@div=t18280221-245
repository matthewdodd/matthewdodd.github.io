On the 4th of February I went into the shop to snuff the candle, and found the prisoner under the counter; he rose up, and I caught hold of his collar: I found the till drawn half way out, and the bowl in which the silver had been in the till, laying by his side on the ground; I had seen it safe when he came in at half-past seven - he asked for a pint of small beer - I said I would rather not serve him; he asked again, and then I said I would draw it for him if he would go out again directly - he put me down a sixpence, and then I saw the money was all safe in my till - there was six shillings and three sixpences; he then had a pennyworth of bread, and four pennyworth of meat, which came to the whole of his sixpence - he was at this time sitting on a form in the shop.</p>

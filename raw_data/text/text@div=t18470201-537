                  </hi>, Jun. I am a dyer, and live in Duke-street, Manchester-square. I saw these articles safe about seven o'clock on Friday evening, 22nd Jan., at No. 12, King-street, Holborn—New Turnstile is at the bottom of the street—it is about 200 or 250 yards off—these articles are worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are my own private property.</p>

I live at No. 12, King-street, Holborn. these articles are my son's—I missed them about half-past eight o'clock in the morning—I went to the station—I had locked the premises up at eleven o'clock at night—tge porter opened the door in the morning to sweep the shop—he did not leave till ten minutes past eight—the property was then safe—it was recovered in about ten minutes after it was lost.</p>

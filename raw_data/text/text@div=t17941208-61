               <p>Q. Do you know whether at any time you had given any orders for any indigo to be brought to your house on the 8th of November? - I know I had not</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house? - About two hundred yards distant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any indigo at that time in the warehouse? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners on that day, the 8th of November? - I was sent for by Mr. Stoyles to come to the warehouse, I then saw Walker by the warehouse door in the passage leading from the warehouse into the street; Gifford was gone before I came. Mr. Stoyles told me that he had detected Walker and Gifford in stealing a seron of indigo.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a packet of indigo? - Yes, I asked him in what manner? he said there was a man with it on his shoulder; that one of them was guiding it out of the warehouse while the other was looking out to see if any body was coming, and that he came there by accident, and that on his asking what the man had got on his shoulder, Walker desired the man to put it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came there by accident? - Mr. Stoyles, he was not coming to the warehouse, but he was coming that way. He said that when he accused Walker of it, Walker made no other answer than said, lork, Mr. Stoyles, how can you say so? on that I asked Mr. Walker if he knew nothing of the indigo, and what business he had in the warehouse at all? after some hesitation he said he came to look for a pocket book which be said he had lost, I then said I thought it was not proper for these men to have the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was the packet of indigo laying there which you have been talking of? - The packet lay at the door wrapped up in a mat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the door was then open or shut? - The door was then open.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the door secured with two keys? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys are there of that warehouse? - The Bull porters ought to keep one key, besides which there is a padlock belonging to the Custom-house officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that Custom-house officer? - Walker, he has always had the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the Bull porters or the warehousemen, if any thing is lost, have been answerable for it? - Yes, they would have had to pay for the indigo.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This seron of indigo was within-side of the warehouse, was not it? - It was when I see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Walker is a person whose business led him there of course? - He had no business there without he is desired to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. It is under the king's lock? - It is under the joint lock of the king and warehousemen.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Walker? - He is a Custom-house officer, a locker employed under the warehouse keeper, Mr. Chandler.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080202"></xptr>Q. What time in the morning was this? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Were the other people in the warehouse? - I believe they were up stairs, but not in that warehouse; in the same stack of warehouses, but not in that warehouse.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the indigo was covered with matting? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was possible to be covered with the matting without being removed from the place in which it was situated? - No, certainly it could not.</p>

               <p>Q. Where are your warehouses situated? - In different parts of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this that is the object of enquiry? - In Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - I do perfectly, they are officers of the customs.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what is deposited in your warehouses, and how you secure them? - There are a variety of goods, both under the excise and customs, and in that case the usual officers attend; when any thing of this kind is either taken in or delivered out, the officer of the excise or customs, which ever the case may require.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 8th of November had there been any order to take in any goods or deliver any out? - Not to the best of my knowledge, there was none from myself, and I have made enquiry of my partners.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had must not either you or your partners attended? - That is the regular course.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you observed on that day? - On the 8th of November, passing by on the opposite side of the way, I discovered Mr. Gifford, supposing as I naturally did, that there was nothing that could call his attention there, I crossed over the way and rushed into the warehouse, where I met a man with a seron of, indigo. I met him in the passage between the two doors; between the warehouse and the street door in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this passage under cover or is it an open passage? - Under cover. The man could not pass so readily as he would, and his load was abutting against the brick wall, and Mr. Gifford was conducting it in order to make it pass more easily. Mr. Walker on my entrance desired the man to throw it down; he said, throw it down, throw it down, two or three times he repeated it. The man did not immediately throw it down, but there were some chests of bark in the same warehouse, very near, about four feet high; he immediately put the seron of indigo on the chests of bark. When I got into the warehouse, I naturally felt about, I could not immediately see what the property was, during which time the porter and Mr. Gifford absconded; they got out of the warehouse as soon as they could. I groped about and felt what it was (it was rather dark where it was) and I soon felt what it was, and I desired Mr. Walker not to depart, and I shut the door on him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first see him, you say in the passage, you see him then, but when he returned and put it on the chests in the warehouse you could not see? - No, I could not rightly. I then sent to Mr. Cole, the only proprietor known, and he did not come down immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys are there to your warehouse? - I have one key as the warehouseman, and Mr. Walker has the other as locker.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Gifford any connection at all with that business? - Not that I know of, that led to the discovery.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you use to keep these keys? - In our compting house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080203"></xptr>Q. Where is that? - I suppose it is about two hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you can recollect the last moment you saw it there? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. When had the warehouse been opened before? - Not the warehouse, but the stair foot door had been opened that morning before to deliver other goods.</p>

               <p>Q. Had this warehouse been at all opened that morning? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the keys of the doors of the passage? - We have.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else a key to the outer door? - No, nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you two keys; a key to the outer door and one to the warehouse door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this seron of indigo in the same state as when you saw it before in the warehouse? - No, it had a mat all round it.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was in the warehouse it had nothing on it but the common skin it has on, but when you see it on the man's shoulder it was disguised by a mat or packet? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you did not know what it was at first, but afterwards you discovered? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you right they had this in the passage of the warehouse? - Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. I don't know whether you have had the good fortune to take the third man? - No, I have not, I thought they would have produced him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were it either of your men that was at work up stairs? - Yes, Wainwright.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you have partners? - I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any other person that has a claim on you in respect of your situation as Bull porters? - No, nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact though nobody has a right except yourselves to open this passage door that you have described to my learned friend, yet I believe goods have been delivered by persons who have not a right to open the door? - Then it was without our knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it in point of fact? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard it? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You say when you was in the street you first observed that somebody was in the warehouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was at that time on the opposite side of the street? - I was. There was a little hatch that we look over, and I looked over the door and saw Gifford in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a porter that had this indigo on his shoulder, but he brushed off? - Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in Walker told him to throw it down two or three times? - Yes, and at last he did and ran away.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean to say that you was on the opposite side of the way when you discovered Gifford? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Gifford when you saw him? - He was in the passage of the warehouse within the inner gate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told my learned friend just now that nobody could get into this warehouse, but in case of some order received, and your permission of the key? - It does not ought to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us just now that you have three partners, and they are not here; all that you can say to the jury is, that you gave no such orders? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. The passage door we understand was open, and had been opened the morning before? - It had.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course other people were at work in the warehouse before? - People were at work at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080204"></xptr>Q. I believe this was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning? - I believe rather later than that.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of people were at work? - Another gang were at work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know a man of the name of Gallini? - It is Mr. Glenny I believe. I will correct you if I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any goods being delivered to him without your permission, or without your knowledge? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. He never applied to you? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You have been asked whether men were not at work in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the same warehouse? - No; in the warehouse above stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You was likewise asked whether merchants had goods delivered without your knowledge? Was it possible that they could get into the warehouse without having your key and the Custom house key, to get into your warehouse? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was not this day a pay day? - I heard some thing of the kind afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Walker. My counsel is in possession of every thing of facts, and I leave every thing to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gifford. I wish to leave it to my counsel.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the warehouses of the prosecutor at any time after Mr. Walker was in custody? - On the 13th of November I went into the warehouses, and I found a pocket book belonging to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. What did you say you was? - I have a place under government.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you are a custom house officer? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had the key after Mr. Walker? - No, I am assistant to the locker-up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any thing of the pocket book before? - I went in to deliver some chests of bark; I had heard from him that he had lost a pocket book there.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you looked, and there you found it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did it belong to, to Gifford, or Walker, or both? - To Walker.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to look for a pocket book? - I heard before the Lord Mayor that Mr. Stoyles said, that Walker was there under the pretence of looking for a pocket book.</p>
               <p>Court. Whereabouts was this-pocket book? - About half a yard in on the left hand, in the inner warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it on a shelf where other books were kept, or was it in any other place? - As near as I can recollect it lay by the side of a chest of bark; there were no other books there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a pocket book in which he had his private concerns, or a Custom house book? - His private concerns, I fancy; I never opened it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am at present in the India house, a warehouseman.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you before that? - I was clerk to a ship broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know of having goods delivered to you without applying to the bull porters? - I have delivered goods without, from the warehouse in Chequer-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply then to the bull porters? - No, by no means. The ship brokers sent me there.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did you deliver? - Nankeen and other goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080205"></xptr>Court. What warehouses are these, are they in the care of the bull porters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of the present bull porters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you at the time? - There were three others employed by the same ship brokers; there were two of the ship brokers, and me, and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Walker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was a locker? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. How long have you known Walker? - About a twelve month, not quite so much.</p>

               <p>Q. During that time, what has been his character for honesty? - Undeniable.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Gifford? - Nearly as long; and his character is equally as good.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. What employment have you in the India house? - Lotting up goods for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. When you lived with the ship brokers you used to go and deliver things out without the knowledge of the bull porters. Now I would wish to know whether they were only on one lock? - They had three locks, and the bull porters delivered the keys to me.</p>
               <p>Q. But without that you could not get in, without you break open the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You applied to them as for the owner of the goods? - The man who kept the bull porters authorised me to deliver the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when they delivered the goods to you, did not you apply on behalf of the person that purchased the goods? - I applied on behalf of the brokers; but I made no application to the bull porters.</p>
               <p>Q. Just now you said that the bull porters delivered the keys to you? - The bull porters man has; they are all called bull porters, from the warehousemen to the labourers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this very often? - I have once or twice had the keys delivered into my hands, to get into this warehouse, by these lockers.</p>
               <p>Q. In this warehouse, were there goods of different persons, or only theirs? - Only theirs; the only things in the warehouse was their goods.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean then to swear the goods belonged to the ship owners? - Yes, or to the brokers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My learned friend talks about your getting into this warehouse; you could not get into this warehouse without the key? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you must have the key from the bull porters themselves, or persons who they have under them? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore when you wanted to get in, you got the keys of the bull porter, or of the bull porters servants? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do the bull porters servants come there? - About eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I believe you are the chief locker to this place? - I am the warehouse keeper on the part of the customs.</p>
               <p>Q. Walker was under you? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are there, if a person comes for any order of goods, if you or your servants are there, you deliver them? - If the duties are paid. The duties of this indigo has been paid some months back, and ought to have been out of my charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080206"></xptr>Court. Who are the sort of persons you deliver them to? - When the duties are paid, they are out of my charge, the land waiter gives an order which exonerates me; in consequence of that, I 
give an order to the locker, there was a free warrant passed for the goods in question, ever since the 
13th of November 1793; a warrant 
signifying that the duties were paid.</p>


               <p>Q. If any person comes at the time you are there, claiming the goods with any order or commission about them, you of course would not oppose their taking them? - If the duties are paid, and his majesty's customs are paid, I have no authority to stop them, if a person comes as from the party that paid the duties, I should deliver them out, and conceive myself justified in so doing, I would not otherwise if the duties were not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you to deliver them, or the lockers to deliver them? - The lockers deliver them according to the order he receives from me; for I am his superior officer.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say there had been an order made out for the delivery of the whole of this indigo? - There was an order.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, Walker, was your locker at that time? - He certainly was the locker, but this order was in May 1794.</p>
               <p>Q. Who makes out that order for the delivery? - The order for the delivery is from the landing waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make out the order for the delivery? - There is an order for delivering in May, 1794, the goods ought to have been considered as out of charge ever since November 1793. The landing waiter is the officer that lands the goods, and they are considered under his charge till they come under mine, when they come under mine, the goods are examined in the warehouse with my surveyor and the East India officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When do they first come to you? - Immediately after the landing, they are sent up to our warehouses, the goods then examined, and after examination, the duties are paid, either by the broker or agent; after that they remain under my custody, and when the duties are paid, it is the landing waiter who has the warrant, and gives possession, and who sends me an order for the delivery of such and such goods, describing them.</p>
               <p>Q. When is the intervention of this warrant? - The warrant is made out to the landing waiter, and from that warrant he sends me an order, under his own hand, to deliver so and so, he does not say to whom, or to what.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had there been an order to deliver the whole of this indigo, of which this was one seron? - Yes, this one remaining under that order.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore Walker must know that there was one seron to be delivered? - Yes, and that the duties were paid.(The court examines the order.)</p>
               <p>Court. Now I look at the order, it is, deliver the above-mentioned goods to Mr, Cole. As an officer of the customs, you ought to be cautious how you swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give that order to? - I think it was to Mr. Cole's confidential clerk, Mr. King, and in that case, we say, to such a person or bearer. Here is another order that says only, deliver such and such goods without saying to whom</p>
               <p>Q. I see on this order, it is addressed to the locker of 154, is Walker the locker there? - Yes, the only locker there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whoever is at the warehouse may be imposed upon, and may deliver to a wrong person? - Undoubtedly he may.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Walker? - Ever since October 1793; ever since he has been appointed.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has be borne? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080207"></xptr>An undeniable and unblemished character, I never suspected him, or I would never have appointed him, to such a situation as I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Perhaps, as Walker was under you, you can tell me whether all the goods were not delivered by virtue of that order? - I do not believe all were delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. I see that both these orders are signed by Walker as delivered, of course, these goods must be delivered. I ask you when they sign their goods delivered, whether it does not mean the delivery of all the goods that are charged to be delivered? - It certainly does. I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand from you, that when they are signed, you would understand by the signing of them, that these specific goods have been delivered? - Undoubtedly, without they put down part delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. But these are both wrote delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is an order comes to you, or the locker attending, to deliver so many goods specified - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it necessarily follow, that you are to deliver them all at one time? - No, it does not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if they are not all delivered at one time, then that warrant is a warrant to deliver all that do remain after that time.</p>
               <p>Court. As to these warrants they are signed delivered? - We must sign that these goods have been delivered at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Here are the orders of the specific goods Walker has signed, these goods to be delivered. Don't you understand them as delivered, when he has signed them delivered? - I should understand them as such.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Do you happen to know whether there was any indigo left in this warehouse after May, from the beginning of November? - I believe there has, only part taken at that time, the merchants take them away as they please after the duties are paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not speak positively what quantity of indigo was there? - I will not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know of any order of goods that was to be delivered on the 8th of November? - No, no order of mine that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there have been of any body else? - That I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there be of any body that has a right to be obeyed, if they had given such an order? - I don't know. A landing waiter might have sent such an order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever hear of a land waiter sending an order? - But many times the orders are sent, not to me, but to the locker, and I don't know of them till the locker brings them to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Mr. Cole sent to you to complain? - He sent to me, and I attended him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you account for this transaction the same way as you do now? - I could not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. We know you could not, but I want to know whether you did? - I did not. I am not situated at the warehouse, my office is situated at some distance from the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps then, every part of the business may be transacted without your knowing it? - No, with respect to receiving in, or delivering out, they render me an account.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no notice of this before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was it you looked back to these warrants, these orders, when you heard a man, whose cha<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080208"></xptr>racter you have given, and who was in your own employ, charged with this offence? - I have the papers in my drawers. I looked for them the same day. or the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in your drawer, find these papers that you have produced? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could not have been acting under that order now? - No, he had delivered that ever since May. I am the warehouse-keeper, and therefore all orders and directions the locker returns to me as vouchers of my authority, I had this order, but the warrant was not in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you deliver by virtue of the order. Pray is this door secured by different locks? - It is by the crown and the merchants.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you who call yourself acting for the crown, have got to the warehouse, without the key entrusted to the merchant? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for that key, that day? - No, I do not, the locker receives the keys at eight o'clock in the morning, and afterwards they are in their possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The order had been made out as far back as May last? - I presume so.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he had a right to deliver out this parcel of indigo? - Undoubtedly, on the part of the crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he have the key? - The workmen belonging to the Bull porters have the key in the warehouse, they are in possession of the keys, all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if you was going there on business, you would not have gone back to the counting house to ask for the keys, if their servants were there? - If their servants are there they have the keys, they are in a bunch.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you now; the free warrant that you stated to me, that was as long ago as May, the goods in that warrant might have been delivered as free from customs, but when there is a free warrant; still I see that is delivered at different times, as appears by this order; I sec by these two papers, these two papers that have been delivered, have come into your hands, because they are signed by them as delivered. Now I ask you this, that if in the month of November any more of these goods had been delivered, if in the ordinary course of business he had delivered such goods, would not the order have come back to you, if there had been a delivery? - There would have been no order for the delivery of the remaning things.</p>

               <p>Q. You have stated the free warrant released the goods from the customs, but we all know that they are not taken away at one time, for these warrants prove that as the owners want them, they apply to you, and you give them this order. In the month of May he returned you this order, as goods delivered, these specific goods, in these two orders do not take in the whole of the goods that are in the warehouse? - I don't know, they may take in the whole, because there are sundry other things, bark and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you this as a fact, whether on the state of this order, you will swear there was no indigo to be delivered? - No, I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if there had been any to deliver, and he had forgot, would he have returned the order to you, in the common course of business, signed by him as delivered by him? - Undoubtedly he would.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Walker called five witnesses, and Gifford thirteen, who gave them most excellent characters.</p>

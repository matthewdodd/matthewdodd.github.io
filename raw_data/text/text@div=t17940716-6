               <p>Q. Are you the sole proprietor of the house? - Yes; I have got a lodger there, but I pay the rent myself.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 26th of June, the night the house was broke open, who was the last person up? - I was, I went to bed about half past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your door secured? - Bolted with three bolts; that I did myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The outer door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was you called up? - About half past two o'clock. There were then two bolts quite broke off, and one bolt hung only by one nail; my till was taken out of the place where it was, it was not locked as some tills are; it contained silver, halfpence, and farthings, I suppose, to the amount of twenty shillings in all, but there was only about four shillings worth taken out of the till of copper, and put on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the till itself? - It was taken from under the counter, and put by the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the money was not on the counter when you went to bed? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In the first place, I believe, you have a partner in your business? - No, I have not; I am a cheesemonger.</p>
               <p>Q. How many does your family consist of? - I have two sisters and myself; they went to bed before me.</p>
               <p>Q. The till you have been talking of was in the shop? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The till, you say was not locked? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever money was in the till was not removed out of the house at all; but there was four shillings on the counter? - Yes; and, I believe, there was a handful laid on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gold in the till? - No, there was nothing but halfpence and farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you counted your money the over night? - I had not; we very seldom count farthings and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You had several examinations before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The magistrate at one time was going to discharge the prisoners, was not he? - I don't know that.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you perceive afterwards? - I had another person with me; we stopped there for some time, and then went down to Mr. Biddle's first floor, there I could make a better observation of them; we then saw the same two men making an attempt to open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perceive that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they attempting to open the door? - By some kind of instrument, wrenching both the side and the top of the door; then after trying, about half past two o'clock they wrenched open the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any moon light? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When they had wrenched open the door, what did they do then? - Immediately me and the man that was looking at them went down stairs in order to take them; after they had wrenched open the door we see them go in.</p>

We immediately went out of Mr. Biddle's door, and me and my brother went and alarmed the watchman, and brought the watchman to Mr. Frankcom's door, and I beat with the stick against the window shutters, and I found the handle of the door turn in my had, and the person inside got the door open about two or three inches; I then thought it necessary that I should lay hold of it with both hands, I did so, and then I found that there was no more pulling for a long time, and I called to Mr. Frankcom, and he looked out of window, and then we went in after we thought the house was sufficiently alarmed; I did not go in, the watchman went in, and

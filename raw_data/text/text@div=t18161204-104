I had never seen her before, and refused to give her the bundle; she took it from me; I ran after her, and cried out, stop thief! but she got away. About a fortnight afterwards I saw her in Moorgate; I gave the alarm, and she was stopped; she had some of the fringe on her bonnet; I am sure she is the person. She took it from me against my will. I should have known her if she had not got the fringe on her bonnet.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 13, Lascelles-court, St. Giles', near Salutation-court—there is one house which divides the two courts from each other—the prisoner lived at No. 2, Salutation-court, and Pedley, the deceased, at No. 1—the court is not a thoroughfare—I was in that court a little before eleven o'clock, on Saturday night, the 6th of June I saw the prisoner there, and the woman he lives with—she goes by the name of "Ann Benson"—they were in Pedley's room—Benson was quarrelling with the prisoner—Pedley was trying to part them—I was looking into the win<lb></lb>dow, and could see them—the room is on the ground-floor—Benson had a poker in her hand, and Pedley was trying to part them—he was advis<lb></lb>ing them to go out of the house—the prisoner apparently wanted to hit Ben<lb></lb>son, and she had the poker up to defend herself—Pedley was quarrelling with Potter—I could not hear what words passed—he was not touching him—I did not perceive them strike each other—there were persons col<lb></lb>lected together, looking in at the window—I should think the words be<lb></lb>tween Pedley and Potter continued five or ten minutes—the deceased got Potter and the woman out of the house—they went out themselves—he used no violence—Potter then came into the court and fought with a young man named Carr—they did not strip—Potter did not appear sober—he got Carr into his own passage, and Ann Benson too, and shut the door—Carr hallooed out," For God's sake, somebody open the door!" I shoved the door in myself—I did not see the prisoner, as it was dark—Carr went out of the Court, and I went after him—I returned into the court between five</p>

               <p>and ten minutes after—the people then said, the prisoner had a knife in his hand—I did not see the knife—I saw the prisoner there—I do not know whether he heard what the people said—they told me to keep away from him, and I did—I saw Mrs. Cormack come; she said she would get a policeman; she had just turned the end of the court, when I saw the prisoner make a thrust at the deceased—he had to move to make the thrust at him—the blow struck him on the right side of the lower part of the belly—when Mrs. Cormack said she would get a policeman, the de<lb></lb>ceased exclaimed, "Mrs. Cormack! Mrs. Cormack! come back, I am stabbed, I have got it here;" and I saw his guts in his hand—he was sup<lb></lb>ported into his own room, and put into a chair, and a doctor was sent for—I remained there till he was taken away to the hospital—I do not know positively how long it was before he was taken to the hospital—it was about a quarter of an hour that he sat in the chair—the surgeon did not come till after he was gone to the hospital.</p>

John Pedley, the deceased, was a collector of rents for my husband—my house is about five minutes' walk from Salu<lb></lb>tation-court—in consequence of hearing a disturbance there, I went there—it was twenty minutes after eleven when I left home—I went to Pedley's house—there was nobody but Pedley there—I went to the window, and looked out into the court, and saw Potter come out of his own door with a knife in his hand—I did not see any one in the court when I went—Pedley went out at the door, and when I saw Potter with a knife in his hand I told him that I saw him with a knife, and told him to come in—he did not come in; he said the prisoner would not hurt him—I went to go past Pedley and Potter to fetch a policeman—I did not see the prisoner violent or making a noise, he only came out with the knife—I told Pedley I would go and fetch a policeman, in consequence of hearing Potter say he would stab the first person who came near him—after I said I would go and fetch a policeman, he made a blow, but whether it was at Pedley or me I don't know—he turned round, about three steps, to make the blow—I had a basket in my hand, and the knife glanced down the side of the basket</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183506150088"></xptr>
               <p>and scratched my hand a little; I have the mark of it now—I had the basket down in my hand, and I held it out when I saw the blow coming—the de<lb></lb>ceased was close to me, almost as near as he could stand—Potter drew back his hand immediately, and struck a second blow at Pedley; but where he hit him I could not see—I went to get a policeman—the deceased said, "For God's sake come back, I am stabbed, I shall faint!"—I did not go back—I went on for a policeman, and found one at the end of Drury-lane—I might be five minutes out of the court.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the Middlesex hospital, and was so on the 6th of June—I was not present when the deceased was brought in—I saw him about a quarter of an hour after—a very few minutes after twelve o'clock—I saw a wound on the right side of the belly, and a portion of the bowels protruding—the wound was inflict with a cutting instrument; such a knife as this would produce the wound, if used with great force—I believe the wound in the abdomen was the cause of his death—he died on Monday morning, at about half-past three o'clock.</p>

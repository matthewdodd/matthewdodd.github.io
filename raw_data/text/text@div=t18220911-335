She thrust me against the wall, put her hand into my breeches pocket, and took out two half-crowns and four shillings. I saw three shillings and a half-crown in her hand; I felt and missed it all - she ran off - I followed, and found her talking to Evans - he was with her at first - she had left him to come to me. He was a hundred yards off. I found them in Crown-court, about twenty yards off; I asked her for my money; she gave me one half-crown and three shillings back, and said she had given the rest away. Evans heard her say it. I met a watchman, who took them to the watch-house, and found half a crown and one shilling on Evans. I know the shilling by a mark on it.</p>
               <p>DIX MOORE. I am a constable. The prosecutors charged the prisoners with robbing him, and said Evans was in Anderson's company. He knew the shilling found on Evans.

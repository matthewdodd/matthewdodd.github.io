On Thursday night, the 9th Nov., I was at the Perseverance public-house, in Great James-street, about twelve o'clock at night, and met Biggs there—he said he had a case on to-night, that he was going to get into a house, and would I go and do it—I said I did not mind—he said he had two more coming along with him, and he had to meet them at the Hope public-house in Steven-street at twelve o'clock—we went, and outside the Hope met Cordwell and Barrett, about twelve o'clock—Biggs asked them if they were going down there now to do this house—they said they did not mind, they would go—we all four went down, and looked in at the front of the prosecutor's house—there was a light there—we went away down Marylebone-lane, and talked to two or three girls down there—when we returned the light was out—Biggs, who lives in the, same mews, went in doors and got a screw-driver—Barrett and Cordwell then lifted Biggs on to the top of the back wall—I saw him walk a little distance, and then go out of sight—Barrett, Cordwell, and I remained outside in the mews—in about half an hour Biggs opened the back door, and came out into the mews from the back yard—Cordwell and Barrett went in with him—I re<lb></lb>mained outside to watch—I saw Biggs on the skylight breaking the glass, and then saw him drop down right out of my sight, and his hat came rolling down the skylight—in about half an hour they all three came out—Barrett had on a waistcoat and a comforter round his neck—Biggs had an umbrella and a silk handkerchief, with boots and other articles tied up in it—Cordwell had nothing—we then all went towards Oxford-street again—Barrett and Cordwell said to me and Biggs, "You two had better take these things and sell them, for we are too well known to the police, they will stop us," and we were to take and share the money up at the Hope—Barrett gave me a waistcoat, a comforter, and another small waistcoat inside that—Biggs and I went and took a walk down Oxford-street till about half-past four o'clock—we then went to a house in the New-road, kept by one Ferryman—we knocked at the shutters, and Ferryman came out—I saw Vitteridge there in bed—Biggs said to Ferryman, in her hearing, that he had stolen these clothes, and</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant D</hi> 4.) On Friday morning, the 10th of Nov., about a quarter past ten o'clock, I met Biggs, Vitteridge, and Ross in company, coming out of the Bee Hive, in Crawford-street, drunk—Biggs asked me to have something to drink, and took hold of me round the waist—Vitteridge ran away from him, and ran down Spring-street—Biggs showed me some silver in his hands, and said, "You shall have something to drink"—I said, "I will drink another time with you"—he said, "Perhaps you will not have another chance, I have plenty of money, and it is all b—<hi rend="italic">square</hi> money"—Vitteridge then came back, and they proceeded up Crawford-street till they came to Montague-mews, where Biggs's father resides, and there I left them.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 11th of Nov., I apprehended Barrett, about seven o'clock, in Steven-street—I told him to come to the station along with me—he said he had been doing nothing since he came out of prison last, and said, "Is it for any thing done last night?"—I said no, it was for the night before, at the Montague Anns—he said that I knew as much about it as he did, for he had been in bed every night since he came out of prison, except one night, and then he went to the Marylebone theatre.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Vitteridge's Defence.</hi> I get my living by washing and charing. About half-past six o'clock, on the morning of the 10th of Nov., Biggs and Ross came to my place; at least they came into the passage, and knocked at the next room door; the person living in the back parlour was out, and I opened the door to say so; they said, "We want a little washing done, can you do it for us?" I said, "Not before the afternoon;" they said that would do; they came in, and laid on the table a bundle, wrapped in this handkerchief. Ross took out a pair of boots, took a little pen-knife out of his pocket, and tried to cut the tops off; it did not cut well, and he said, "Will you lend me a stronger knife?" which I did, and he cut the tops off; they said, "We will make you a present of these; and as it is unlucky to keep a knife, you may have it." I threw it on the bed; they opened the bundle, and looked at the table-cloth. Ross said, "Biggs, I will lay you a shilling, that when this is washed it will pawn for half-a-crown." Biggs replied, "I will lay you what you like, that it won't pawn for more than 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but will you have it cleaned." I said, "I will this afternoon;" they took the boots, and said, "Will you bind them?" I said I had no tape; Ross gave me a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I went out, and bought some; and if you examine the boots, you will find that one is not finished now; the young man I was living with came in; I thought he looked angry at them, and said, "I cannot finish them now, I will this afternoon." Ross gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for binding them, and they went out; after breakfast, my young man said, "Mary, you must go for my brush." I went out, and met Biggs and Ross again. I went and got the brush, and met Ferryman at the door of the Adam and Eve, with a whitewash pail in his hand. I gave him the brush, and he went away. Biggs and Ross were there, and treated me to some gin; we went towards Crawford-street, and they treated me again: they went to another public-house, and got quarrel<lb></lb>ling, and I went away; when I got home I felt very ill, from the effects of the liquor, and laid down and fell asleep. Ferryman came home at twelve o'clock, and found me in bed, where I remained till the policeman came and said stolen property was there. I told them to go to the box, and said, "If it is stolen, I know nothing of it." I struck Ross, and said, "You thief, if it is stolen, you have brought us into it." It is the first thing I was ever charged with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cordwell's Defence.</hi> What Ross states against me is quite false; I had not seen him for nearly three weeks before. I was at home at my mother's at half-past eleven o'clock, and slept in the same room with my father and mother the whole evening, from half-past eleven till seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Biggs's Defence.</hi> On the night the robbery was committed I met Ross; he asked me to go with him; I said I should not, I was going home; he went over the wall, and brought the things out; I saw him come out with the things on his back; these two young men were nowhere near; there was no one but him and me down the mews.</p>

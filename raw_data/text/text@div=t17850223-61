               <p>Where had you been that evening? - To an acquaintance in London, I went about seven.</p>
               <p>What did you drink? - A little porter, I was in three or four different companies.</p>
               <p>Did you drink in them all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her to go with you, or did she ask you to go with her? - That I cannot resolve you.</p>
               <p>Where did you go with her? - In the course of evening I went home to her lodgings as high as I can recollect between eleven and twelve; I first met her about six, I went into a house in Portpool Lane, I did not stay with her three minutes, I gave her a glass at the bar, but I drank nothing; I then went to a friend's on Air-street-hill, and left her there; I never saw her before then, I came home with her to her lodgings between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Where are her lodgings? - They are upon <placeName id="t17850223-61-crimeloc272">Saffron-hill</placeName>

               <p>Did you make any enquiry whose house it was? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other people in the house? - No, the door was open, and we went up one pair of stairs, we went to bed together; between one and two I awoke, and missed the property that is in the indictment; I saw my watch before I went to bed, and wound it up, I have seen the watch and garters since; it is a very particular watch, it has a hare and hounds upon the face of it; I know the chain, I have had it two years, the seal was a blue seal, I bought on London-bridge, it cost me threepence, I do not know the impression of it, the key was quite a common key; I know the garters, I always put them in my pocket of a night; I put my watch into my fob, there was no other woman in the room with me; at two o'clock I missed my things, and the girl was gone, I got the watchman and searched for the things about the bed; I was going to enquire for her the next morning, and I met her in Fleet-market, and charged her with the robbery, she said I rob you! you fool, what do you mean by that? I took her to the public house, and sent for a constable, and while I sent for the constable, she produced my watch out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Had you then told her it would be better for her? - I had, she said she had none of it; the constable said to the girl, let me look at your legs, and she took off one of my garters, which I will swear to.</p>

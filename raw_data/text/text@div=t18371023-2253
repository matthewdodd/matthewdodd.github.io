                  </hi>. I live in Frazer's-buildings, Paddington-street On the evening of the 19th of September I was in Farringdon-street, and saw the prisoners near a wagon, in company with another—Freeman jumped up on the wheel of the wagon—took three casks of mustard out, and went through the market with them on his shoulder, and the other two followed him—I followed them into Shoe-lane—Freeman took them down there off his shoulder, and then gave them to the man not in custody—I followed them; and, near Chancery-lane, that man delivered them to Page—they got on towards a court in Holborn, and Page and the other went down the court, leaving Freeman at the end—I gave notice to a policeman, and pointed Freeman out to him—I afterwards went into the court with the officer, and found the three tubs of mustard in the corner of the court—the prisoners all made their escape—I am certain the two prisoners are two of the three persons I saw.</p>

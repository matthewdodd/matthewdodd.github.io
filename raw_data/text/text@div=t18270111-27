On the 3d of January, the prisoner took our second floor, front room, furnished, at 5s. a week - this property was let with the room. She said she had come from Brentford to receive a legacy. I went out about ten o'clock in the morning of the 6th of January - I returned about eleven, and found her in custody; I missed these articles - I never gave her leave to take them. I found this note in my table-drawer (note read).</p>
               <p>MADAM, - I am sorry to say I have had a letter, and must go to Bath before I can get any money. I have no money left, and am forced to pawn your sheets and blankets to get money to go down - I did not like to ask you for money, or I would have done it before you went out. I will send you the tickets, and money to redeem them, and also my rent, on Saturday; and most heartily wish you health and happiness.

And so your Servant, Sir, says he, I understand that you lay Felony to my Charge.

             thus depos'd. I was in a Coffee-house at Charing Cross, and hearing a Cry of stop Thief, I stept out and saw the Prisoner running and several pursuing; I follow'd and saw a Man trip up his Heels in Spring Garden; - When he was taken, he said it was only a Fit of Jealousie, and told us that his name was Mosely, alias this, and alias that, and alias t'other but I have forgot what.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hoddard thus depos'd. The Prisoner pawn'd 6 Pair of Silk Stockings to me for 45 s. and the next Day the Prosecutors Maid came and desired me to stop such Goods, if they were offer'd, I bade her tell her Master that I had taken in such Goods already. He came and own'd them.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he bought the Stockings of the Prosecutors Wife, who trusted him for the Money. Mrs. Dumeny was then call'd in and depos'd, that she never sold him any Stockings at all, and that he never had any from her upon any Account.</p>
               <p>Then the Prisoner called his Witnesses.</p>

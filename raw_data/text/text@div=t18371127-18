                  </hi>. I am a constable. On the 31st of October, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 1, Bennet-court, Great George-street, Bethnal Green, with Duke and Hall—we found the street-door fast—I took a small crow-bar, forced it open, and ran up stain—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I accompanied Reynolds—I was not in a situation to see him burst the door open, but I followed him up stairs, and observed the prisoner on a chair, and Reynolds holding her—there was a very strong fire in the grate, and on the top of the fire this saucepan-lid, and in it was this mould quite hot—I took it off—it had the impressions downwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I accompanied Reynolds and Duke to the house—I was immediately behind Reynolds—the street door was shut, and as soon as he put the crow bar to the top, it went open—I cannot say whether it was locked—it might have been unlocked—there was no handle outside that I saw—I followed Duke up stairs—as soon as the prisoner was seated, I searched the place—in a cupboard by the side of the fire-place I found a paper bag containing a quantity of plaster of Paris; and on the hob a pipkin with three pieces of white metal in it, hard, and a tobacco-pipe—under the grate I found three pieces of broken mould, which appeared to have been used, and on the mantel-piece this small file, with white metal in the teeth of it—I asked the prisoner who the things belonged to—she said they were hers—she said the goods in the house were hers—I said "Whose things are these?" meaning the bed and furniture—she said they were hers—I asked who was her landlord—she said Mr. Sherman—she did not exactly know where he lived—I said "Do you owe him any rent?"—she said, "No, I paid all my rent yesterday"—I said "Have you no rent book?"—she said,? Yes, it is in the box," and there I found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of Coin to the Mint, and am in the habit of examining materials for coining. I have seen a great many moulds—this is a plaster of Paris mould intended for casting counterfeit half-crowns—it is impressed with the figure and apparent resemblance of the obverse side of half-a-crown; and the other half has the impression of the reverse side—it is usual to keep the mould hot while casting—the bag has plaster of Paris in it—the metal in the pipkin is white metal, which appears like Britannia metal—one piece appears to have been made in a mould, but not in this mould—the others are in the shape of a mould, but have no impression—whatever was on it has been scraped off—a pipkin is usually used to melt the metal, and tobacco-pipes are used to lade the metal out into the mould—the file has white metal in the teeth of it—it is used to take off the rough edge of the coin.</p>

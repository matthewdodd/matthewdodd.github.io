                  </hi> I am in the service of William Hammond, of Russell-square. About half-past two o'clock in the afternoon of 18th May, I put seventeen forks, two gravy spoons, six dessert spoons, four ladles, one butter<lb></lb>knife and other articles, into the pantry—about twenty minutes afterwards the area bell rang—Owen was there; he offered two combs for sale—I said I did not want any, and he shut the area door—the plate was then sale—there is a door from the area into the pantry—the window was then open from six to eight inches from the bottom—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I went into the pantry and missed the plate—the window was then wide open—somebody had lifted it higher, and the flower pots, which before were ranged in front of the window, were put all on one side—I alarmed the butter ran into Guildford-street, and at the corner of Greville-street saw Owen in Cramp's custody, who had these four forks (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I came back I found these combs on the dresser.</p>

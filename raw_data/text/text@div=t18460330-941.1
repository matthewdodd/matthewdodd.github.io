                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Dukeson, a carman, in Dun<lb></lb>ning's-alley, Bishopsgate-street. On a Thursday afternoon, about the 5th of March, the prisoner came to our place about one o'clock, to hire a truck to go to the Eastern Counties Railway to fetch two boxes to go to Sun-street—I let him have the truck—he was to bring it back within the hour—he did not bring it back—I saw it at the police-court the following day.</p>

I buy and sell trucks and carts—on a Thursday after<lb></lb>noon, about the 5th of March, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and asked me to go with him to look at a truck in Steward-street—I went and he showed it me—I saw that same truck at the station in the presence of Mrs. Dukeson, and she identified it—I agreed to buy it of the prisoner for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he asked me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I asked him if it was his own—he said yes—he brought it down to my house—it was at my door till the policeman got it—I had not paid for it.</p>

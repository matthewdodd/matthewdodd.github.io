In the beginning of November I had been robbed twice, and on the 22d I ordered my man to take up the currant-trees, which stood in a regular form, to sort, and divide the large and small. He took them out of the ground, and was sorting them on the 22d and 23d. On Sunday, the 23d, Smith, the officer, came - I told him, and asked him to look at the remainder of the trees, that if he saw any like them he might know them-some had been taken away the night before. I lost five or six hundred in all. We went to Mr. Mills's, public-house, in the Hampstead-road - I told him not to tell me which he had bought, and I would point out my trees myself. The first I saw in his garden was mine. I pointed out twelve which I knew. He said he bought them of the prisoner. I found twelve more in the next garden, which I knew. I went into four gardens, and found twelve in each - I pointed them out myself. The other gardens belong to Barnes, Showler, and Baldwin.</p>

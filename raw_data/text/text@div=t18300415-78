            . I am servant to Mr. Pope. On the 24th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was near this house, and saw the prisoners - I came up the road and watched them; I saw them get in at the window of the house - I went and told Mrs. Pope; she came to the house - I fetched Morgan; I then heard a lumbering in the house, as if they had let something down on the floor - there was nobody in the house but them; they were there nearly an hour and a quarter.</p>

Ellis fetched me; I went to the house with Letty Edwards; we heard something fall, and went in; Ellis waited outside - we found nobody in the house, but Ellis talked about firing guns up the chimney, and then the prisoners were brought down the drawing-room stairs - they had come out of the chimney; their backs were all over smut and soot - one of them said he had come out of the chimney for fear he should be shot; they did not say what business they had in the house - I had never seen them before; the grate had been moved from its place and laid down, and the slabs also.</p>

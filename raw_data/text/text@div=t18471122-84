                  </hi> I live in the Strand. On Sunday evening, the 10th of Oct., I got out of an omnibus in Gracechurch-street, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—I had a gold watch in my waistcoat-pocket, fastened with a gold chain round my neck—I had seen my watch a few minutes before—when I got out, Curtis came up to me at the corner of Lombard-street—I forget the observation she made, but I went along Lom<lb></lb>bard-street, and she followed me to the corner of Nicholas-lane, which was twenty or thirty yards—she was with me a few minutes—she then ran away and immediately Hancock appeared—he said, "Halloo" in a sort of alarm—I said to him, "I thought you were a policeman"—he said, "No"—he left me and I discovered that my watch was gone, but not the chain—I gave a description of the prisoners to the police—I next saw Hancock in custody at the station—he had been apprehended from the information I gave—he is the man—Curtis I recognized in Newgate—the swivel of my watch chain was very loose—the watch could be detached from it by a snatch.</p>

I knew the two prisoners—I heard of this robbery, and about two nights afterwards I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners in company together in a public-house in Cannon-street—they came out and walked by the White Bear, and there the woman separated from the man—she walked up King William-street with a gentleman whom the ac<lb></lb>costed there—they just passed the end of Nicholas-lane, and the man followed them, and he turned up Nicholas-lane—I went up Abchurch-lane and saw the woman and gentleman standing talking, and the man was just by in a door-way—the women then left the gentleman and I told him he was in bad company—I have seen the prisoners in company in the street since then.</p>

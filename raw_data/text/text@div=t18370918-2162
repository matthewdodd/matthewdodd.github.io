I am a prisoner in the Fleet Prison—I have a private room there of my own, and a key of my own—the place where I live is called the "Fair"—I have the sole occupation of the room—last Sunday, about eleven o'clock, I left my room to go to chapel—I locked the door, and put the key into my pocket—I always do so—I came out of the room with another person, and locked it—I returned about a quarter past twelve o'clock, and when I came to my room I found the door about three inches open—it alarmed me very much, and I said, "Who the devil is here?"—no answer was given, but in a minute some <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> came out of the room against me—it was the prisoner Davis—he said, "What business have you in</p>

               <p>Major came out of the room with the bundle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I made an ex periment yesterday in the prison, with two different people to see whether I could see a person in the place—that was not for the purpose of seeing whether I could identify them from my room—I went to show them how it was, that my room, being situated in a very dark place, a person coming from the light (and Board's room is next door to the entrance) towards me, directly he passes me, comes into the light again, as he is two doors from the steps—I do not know whether the persons doubted I could see him, but the question was put to me by a friend of the prisoners, and I made the experiment to show that I could see him—the bundle he had with him was of a lightish colour—the direction he took would take him out the prison—I heard Bailey tell him he could not go out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What have you been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A gentleman—I am in no business—I have had a charge made against me, but not for felony—at least I am not aware whether it constitutes a felony—I have been in gaol, but I am not aware whether it was on a charge of felony—it was for giving a person a cheque—I was at Gloucester at the time, and was put into Gloucester gaol—that was last September—I was kept there tell the sessions in October, and then immediately acquitted—I have not been in gaol on any other occasion—I have been in the Fleet since January—I have been twice in prison, now and at Gloucester.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, yesterday, after you made the experiment, did you not state that you could not distinguish a person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—nor words to that effect—not to any one—Dr. Atto went down with me—I never said I could not distinguish a person in that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had any quarrel with the prisoners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I never entertained a doubt of Major being the person who passed me with the bundle—it was Rowbottom who spoke to me about whether I could see the party, but Mr. Shepherd, one of the turnkeys, went with me yesterday down to my room, and Mr. Atto as well—(Rowbottom did not go down to my room)—I only went to satisfy them—the experiment did not at all weaken my belief that Major was the person—Mr. Shepherd appeared to be of a different opinion to me—Mr. Atto agreed with me that I could see him—on my oath I did see the man, and knew him again when he was brought out of Fell's room—the light was not on his face, it was behind him, but as soon as he passed me the light came on his face as he turned—I saw him with his face first of all towards Board's door, closing it—the light was then sideways—then he turned round and came straight past me—seeing a stranger at that time of day, I was rather surprised, and it drew my attention—I was opening my door as he turned round again—the light coming from the east threw a very strong light through my door on the prisoner's face—he passed very near to me.</p>

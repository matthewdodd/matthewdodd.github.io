I am servant to Henry Ildon Tilby, draper, in New Bridge-street, Vauxhall, he has another establishment at Camberwell—my attention was first drawn to these twenty yards of ribbon on the 29th of September—I cannot say exactly when I last saw it in the shop—within about three days it was safe in my master's shop—I saw the prisoners Lewis and Berry in the shop—I cannot recollect what they came for—they did not purchase any thing—they came in for something I had not got—I was afterwards shown this ribbon, and know it to be my employer's.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at Stepney Fair on the 16th of April; as soon as I entered the Fair, I saw the prisoner and two other well known characters very busy, they made several attempts, but without success, and at last they fixed on the prosecutor; one placed himself on his right hand, another on the left, and the prisoner in the centre behind; as soon as they so placed themselves, they made a terrible push, and I directly saw the prisoner put a handkerchief into his bosom. I instantly seized him, and informed the gentleman he had been robbed.</p>

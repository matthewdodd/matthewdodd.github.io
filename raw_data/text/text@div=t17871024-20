               <p>Court to prosecutrix. Whereabouts did you leave these things? - I left my gown and petticoat, folded up on the head of the bed, my cloth shoes were under my bed; I cannot say where I left the other shoes.</p>
               <p>When did you see this money last before it was stolen? - I saw it on Friday, and had it in my hand about eleven or twelve, and on Saturday it was stolen. (The prosecrtrix deposes to the handkerchief,) the cap I can swear to and the gown, it was never on my back, the mantua-maker is here that made it.</p>

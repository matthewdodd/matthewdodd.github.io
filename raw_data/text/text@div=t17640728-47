               <p>Shoesmith. I was; she asked me to go along with her; we went to a lodging house by <placeName id="t17640728-47-crimeloc249">Diot-street</placeName>

I never had a wink of sleep all night; we got both up; I kept her in hold all the time: she found six guineas, and put three into a woman's ha nds that lay just by us. The six guineas the constable has; she would not give it me; the constable took it out of her hand: I don't know what is become of the other woman.</p>

            . I am constable. I was sent for by the man that keeps the house where they lodged; they were in a cellar, and the door was locked without side: he had heard the man call, and say he had lost nine guineas: when I came, he opened the door; I went down; the prosecutor said, he had lost nine guineas; there were the prisoner and another woman; he charged the prisoner; I searched, and found six guineas in her hand; I asked her where the rest was; she said she saw no more: I carried her to St. Giles's Round-house; this was between three and four o'clock. I did not search the other woman, because the man said she had not been nigh him. After the prisoner was in the Round-house, I saw the other woman come to her with a pot of beer; then I kept her there: she swore she never saw the money: I let her go; and took the prisoner before Justice Welch: there she said the other woman had the three guineas: then I went to see for her, and found she was gone off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I happened to come to that house; the man asked me to drink: he got up, and asked me to go along with him to the door; I did, he asked me to go home to bed with him; and said he lived just by: he carried me down into a cellar; I did not know he had a farthing in the world; he said, come, let me look at my money; he pulled out six guineas, and put them in my hand; which I gave him again: he said he had lost three; there was another woman in the same bed; she never was out of it; she did not get up when we did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you deliver her the money?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not. She got it, and I could not get it again: I offered her a guinea, if she would give it me, and she would not.</p>

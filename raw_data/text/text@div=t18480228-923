                  </hi> I am a cow-keeper, at South-place, Clapham. On 26th Feb., between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was in Whitecross-street—I stopped by a passage—the prisoner came up, and put her hand into my pocket, and took out a purse, containing six sovereigns—a man rushed against her, and they both ran up the court—I followed them, and saw the tail of the man's coat going into a water-closet—it was quite dark—I asked who was there—no one answered—I went in, took hold of the man and the prisoner, and pulled them into the street—the prisoner said, "Kill the man, knock the b—r down"—I called a policeman, who took them both—I went back to the place where I took them—the policeman picked up my purse there—this is it—there was no money found—I heard no chinking there.</p>

On Friday week, about six o'clock in the morning, I was in the Cat, and saw Pettit in a private box, treating three women—he was drinking gin—I am positive of that—the prisoner was in front of the bar—after she was taken up I heard the three women talking—they had some money, and said they had left the skin behind them, up the court—they had been out, and come back—I do not think I should know the woman who said that—I had just come in from the country—I was very tired, and had no residence—I went in there</p>

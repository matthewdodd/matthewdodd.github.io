            . The prisoner was sent for to put a square of glass into the window; the handkerchiefs were there when he came; it is six weeks ago. After he had done this work, the handkerchiefs were missing; we desired him to stop till he was searched, and two silk handkerchiefs were found upon him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I searched the prisoner, and found these two handkerchiefs upon him.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to by the paper with-inside, which the witness, Shaw, put in himself.)</p>
               <p>It has no writing upon it.</p>
               <p>How do you know it is the paper? - It is a sheet of our shop paper; I put it in myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. How far may the prisoner live from your master? - About thirty yards; he never was employed before; he had not been long in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>I believe it was some time after the pane of glass was broke, before this man came? - The pane was broke; we sent for him immediately, and he came soon after.</p>
               <p>Was not he in liquor? - I did not perceive it.</p>
               <p>How long was he mending this window; did not you observe he mended it very bunglingly? - I did not observe it; he was not long time about it.</p>
               <p>Who first told him to stop at your master's till he was searched, you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Who, then? - Another young man that was in shop.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No. I took the goods out of the bottom of the window, that they might not be in his way.</p>
               <p>The <rs id="t17890114-65-deflabel338" type="occupation">glazier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17890114-65-defend648 t17890114-65-deflabel338"></join>s always carry with them some dirty cloths to mend the windows? - A brush is most properly used. The glazier that glazed for us before used a brush.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to observe where those cloths were? - No.</p>
               <p>These handkerchiefs lay folded up in a square? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A handkerchief that a man dropped out of his pocket might cover this bundle? - It is about six inches square.</p>
               <p>You was present when he was searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he make any difficulty in stopping? - No.</p>
               <p>Where had he left the diamond that he cuts the glass with? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he left a diamond on the window? - It never was seen there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140093"></xptr>He was, I believe, desired to walk up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who walked up stairs with him? - My master.</p>
               <p>I believe your master afterwards left him alone in the room? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Who went for the constable? - He ordered one of the young men to go for the officer. I was in the shop; I did not pay attention; I did not see my master in the shop before the constable came; he might be there.</p>
               <p>Did not this man, in your hearing, say he did not know he had any thing of that sort about him? - He said in the shop, that he did not know he had them. I did not perceive him any worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you attend at all to that circumstance? - He went about his business as well as another man.</p>
               <p>Was not there, at the same time in his pocket, a very dirty cloth, with which he wiped the windows? - I did not see any dirty cloths; there were his gloves, his pocket-handkerchief, and some other things.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you, on your oath, swear that was the property of your master? - I can, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to the constable. Did the prisoner make any difficulty to your searching him? - He said he had doubled them up once more than they were before. There were no dirty cloths in his pocket, nor his gloves; there was his key, that he shewed us. His handkerchief was not in that pocket. I did not see the diamond.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner alone in the dining-room when he came up? - No. There were two women in the room, the nurse, and the mistress, she was not able to get out of the room.</p>
               <p>- INGATE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a collar and harness-maker in the same yard where the prisoner had the front shop; that is pretty near the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Do you know the day he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he in your company that day? - Yes. We had two pints of purl; he would have prevailed upon me to have continued drinking, and to smoak a pipe; but I told him I could not stay; I left him in the publick-house. I know nothing of the man, only one fortnight.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven other witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>

On the 20th of June I lost my watch, between eleven and twelve at night. I was the worse for liquor. I had my watch safe at eleven o'clock.

As soon as I went into her room she asked me to give her something to drink. I gave her a three-shilling piece. After she went out I had my watch, and before she returned I fell asleep. The first thing when I awoke I missed my watch. The prisoner was in the room. I charged her with taking my watch; she denied it. The watchman was going by. I called the watchman in. The watchman saw the prisoner pull the watch out of her pocket. He took it from her in my presence.</p>

On Friday about three in the morning, we were alarmed by Mr. Sparrow, a neighbour; he told us my house had been broke open; I got up, and my niece and I went down together; there are four doors; one door goes into the lane, one into the yard, one to the passage, and the dwelling-house door; the door that goes into the lane, whoever got in had got over the wall, for there were marks on the top of the wall, where they got over out of the lane into the yard; the other two doors were bolted on the inside to the best of my recollection; I believe they were all bolted that night, because I always used to bolt them; I did not go to bed till after one o'clock; I sat up on some business.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you imagine the bolts were pushed back?</p>
               <p>Barrett. The door in the passage and dwelling-house, door are so old and wore, I believe they might on the outside casily push back the bolts with a knife; when I came down stairs it was break of day, a little lightish; I missed a bottle of anniseed with a bottle of gin; I filled these two bottles the night before. We went down to the watch-house, and the first thing I observed was a bundle wrapped in a handkerchief; I said that I know to be Waters's handkerchief; I saw it upon him the day before; my niece and I got to the watch-house; the watchmen had taken up all the three prisoner in the lane; I knew Waters very well, because his mother chaired for us, and he used often to be backwards and forwards.</p>

            . I went down and found the door broke open. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I attempted to lock the door at night that went into the lane, but it went hard; I could not lock it myself, my uncle did it; he bolted both the doors at that time, which was between eleven and twelve o'clock. I went down to the watch-house with my uncle, and saw the handkerchief lie there; I took it to be Waters's.</p>
               <p>Q. from Waters. What do you remember it by?</p>
               <p>Slancy. He was in the yard whilst I was hanging up some things to dry; he had the handkerchief round his neck, and I observed this hole in it (pointing it out) I found two or three coloured aprons in it, tied up, which are mine. As my uncle and I were going down to the watch-house, we found a bottle of gin in the lane marked with M.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor I do not remember that I put the cork marked M into the gin bottle; I thought I put a cork marked W into the anniseed bottle.</p>

            . I took the prisoners up about three in the morning, in Red Lion-court; as soon as they saw me they turned into Red Lion-court, they went pretty quietly with me to the watch-house; I observed at the time I took them up, that Waters had a bottle in each pocket, but I did not then search him to see what the bottles contained; after I got them into the cage, I examined one of the bottles; it was anniseed water; it had a cork in it marked N. When I took Waters, he had no bundle, but I found a piece of cloth in Hopkins's pocket.</p>
               <p>Slancy. That is part of a slip of cloth I cut in two the night before; that piece was taken away, the other part was left. (They were compared and tallied exactly).</p>
               <p>Edwards. Before I searched the prisoners I went to see what mischief was done, and found many things dropped about the lane, particularly that check handkerchief with three aprons in it; I brought it into the watch-house; they were all scattered about except this bundle; that I found at the entrance of Little Red Lion-court,</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these things dropped in those places where you saw the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Edwards. They were dropped in that court, and between there and the watch-house. I found two or three bricks pulled off the wall, which goes out of Mr. Barrett's yard into the lane; I found the apron at the entrance of Red Lion-court, and the bundle at the end of it, I first saw them in Charter-house-lane; they turned into Red Lion-court.</p>

               <p>Susanna Hills. On the 13th of September I went out, and did not come home till between 5 and 6 the next morning; I went into my room, I found my door broke open, and my watch and money missing; the two prisoners lodged in a room above mine: I went up, thinking they might have heard the people at my door; I knocked several times, no body answered: I knocked harder, and the door came open; I went in, and there lay my watch in Walker's besom, they were both in bed together; I said I have found the thief; he called me b - ch, and said if I did not go out of the room he would kick me out; I went out, and left the watch with him; then I went to Mr. Brebrock, for him to come and take the prisoner; he came and took him, and when he was searched, the watch dropped down just by his foot; there was 15 s. found in his pocket; then we went and took the woman; her sister was close by; she said she has the money in her mouth; then the prisoner stopped down; her sister then said she has it in her hand, they opened her hand, and there was a guinea.</p>

I lodge in the same house; I heard the prosecutrix say to Walker, please to deliver me my watch and money, and I will not hurt you; he said, how came you by the watch; she said, that is no matter to you; he said, if you do not go out of the room, I will kick you out; I saw a guinea found in Triggs's hand, when they searched her.</p>

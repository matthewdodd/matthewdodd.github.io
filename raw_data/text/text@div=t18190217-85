               <p>THOMAS CHESHIRE. On the 12th of February, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was at Warren's, - he said the geese were stolen. I received information, and saw the prisoner about fifty yards off; he ran away, and we followed him through three fields; we took him in the third field, and found three geese in the first field, where he ran from - they were in a great coat, which had a live hen in the pocket; they were on the spot, where he started from - he had concealed himself in a ditch. I found a direction in his pocket-book, with a packing-needle - there were two others walking about the house.</p>

            . I lodge at Warren's; the waggoner said somebody was stealing the geese, and that a man ran by him in the yard, and dropped one; I ran down, told Warren, went into the yard, and picked up a goose. I pursued after the prisoner; he was close to the farm; two other men were by the farm, they enquired for a waggon to take them to town - the prisoner was behind them. I asked him who he was? he immediately ran off, and we followed him through three fields; three of the geese were found just where he started from - they were dead.</p>

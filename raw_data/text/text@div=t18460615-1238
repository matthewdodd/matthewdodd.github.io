               <p>a little before ten—John Oddy was there when I first went in—I knew them both before—I have drank with Oddy several times—he is a shoe<lb></lb>maker or something in the leather line—the prisoner wanted to drink out of a pot of beer which stood on the counter, belonging to Oddy and his com<lb></lb>panions—he went to take it up—Oddy said he should not have it, and told him to go and work for it—he called him a <hi rend="italic">spunging beggar</hi>, and said he should have no beer from him—the prisoner appealed to a wooden-legged man, another shoemaker, to know whether he was a <hi rend="italic">spunging beggar</hi>—the man said, "I don't know, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, I never saw you spend much"—there was then a laugh and kind of ridicule—they stood talking and wrangling like together, the prisoner, Oddy and five or six more, in a cluster round the bar—I did not take particular notice what it was about—I did not hear any abusive language—it was <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> and wrangling mixed together—a few minutes after the first attempt the prisoner tried to take the pot up again—Oddy then took it up and held it at arm's-length with one hand, and kept the prisoner at a distance with the other, that he should not get bold of it—it was not done violently—I did not see him move out of the position he stood in—there were no blows—the prisoner stood a minute or two, then muttered something, gave his foot a bit of a stamp, then turned and went out—he came back again in I suppose ten minutes or a quarter of ar hour, as near as I can tell—he pushed the door open with his arm and looked in—the wooden-legged man who stood there went towards the door to him and said, "Do you want me, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>?"—the prisoner said something, I did not bear what, and nodded his head towards Oddy—Oddy then went towards him, and as he went a man standing at the side of the door said to Oddy, "Mind, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, what you are about, he has got a stick or a poker behind him"—the prisoner eould hear that—Oddy went on, and said, "I will stick him," meaning that be would take the stick from him—he then went out at the door—the people inside ran out at the other door—I followed Oddy out at the same door as he went out at—I do not think anybody else went out at that door—Oddy went towards the prisoner—in going out at the door the prisoner backtd away from the door till he got within a foot or two of the corner of the street, five or six yards from the door—when Oddy got to the prisoner he put his left hand on the prisoner's shoulder and the other behind him to feel what he had got under the tail of his coat, saying, "Give it us Joe," or something, "like a man"—I heard the words, "Like a man"—it was said quite in a calm manner—the prisoner then punched him, as I thought, two or three times in the stomach—I conld not say how many times—Oddy drew himself in and said he had a severe blow, he was stabbed—the prisoner was tripped up by a man, and as he went back a knife went out of his hand down a grating behind him—I could not see that it was a knife at the time, but I heard something fall—I put my arm down the area and got a knife up, which I gave to the policeman.</p>

I had 3 s. 2 s. in the corner of my shawl, which was round my neck - I was untying it to pay him, and Heady hit me over the hand with a stick, and tried to knock the money out of my hand, but could not; then Draper came and snatched it out of my hand, and tore the end of my shawl off - he ran down the street; they both ran away together with the money, and were apprehended that night. I never saw them before, but am sure they are the boys. My money was a half-crown, six penny pieces, and four halfpence.</p>

            . I am a headborough, I took the prisoners into custody, about a quarter of an hour after the robbery; the girl came crying to me, pointed them out, and said they were the boys. I took Heady, Draper ran into a house. I took him, and he said to another sweep in the house, "Give me the money, and I will give it to the girl." He gave him a half-crown, six penny pieces, and four halfpence. I took them out of his hand.</p>

I was at work at a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290120"></xptr> neighbour's house when the things were taken away; between one and two I went home. My room door was loc ked when I left it, and when I found it. I found the prisoner in the room when I unlocked the door. I found the property with him folded up in the great coat. I left the property in the box, and when I came in it was laying on the floor. The prisoner was in by the property. It is a one pair of stairs room. The window was shut when I left it, and so I found it. I never saw the prisoner before: he had no business in my room: I cannot tell how he got in; I stopped him; he was searched. I had but one key to the door. The prisoner was taken by a man that was coming along Rosemary-lane, and he vowed and protested he would do for us all if he got through the hobble.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I was a sailor.</p>
               <p>Have you any friends? - None in London.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The felony depends upon whether you believe that this man got into the room for the purpose of stealing the things; that he took these things out of the box, and put them into the great coat for the purpose of carrying them off.</p>

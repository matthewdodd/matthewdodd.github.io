                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Upper Park-place, Dor<lb></lb>set-square. On Thursday evening, the 10th of January, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner walking by the side of me opposite Trinity church, in the New-road—I was coming from Tottenham-court-road—I had my handkerchief up to my face—he asked if I had the tooth<lb></lb>ache—I said, "No, Sir"—he then asked me if I had far to go—I said, "No, Sir"—he said would I take his arm—I said no, and spoke very cross—he took me by the arm, and took me through the Park gate, Park-square East, and behaved excessively ill, pulling my clothes about in a very improper way, and I felt his hand in my pocket—I am sure of that—I had four half-crowns, seven shillings, and sixpence there loose—when I could speak I charged him with taking my money out of my pocket—he swore a very bitter oath—a policeman directly after came up—I said, "Thank God, here is a policeman," and gave him in charge—before I saw</p>

               <p>the policeman, I was so agitated that I could hardly speak, and did not see a person to call out to—I was very unwell and nervous—I do not be<lb></lb>lieve he wanted any thing but to get my money—he had dragged me into the Park, and began pulling me about—I begged him to let me go—I did not see any body in the Park—I saw nobody to complain to till I saw the po<lb></lb>liceman—I am certain he got my money—he wanted to go away when I charged him with the robbery, but the policeman came up—he was getting away as the policeman came up—I dare say he had got my money ten or twenty yards before the policeman came up; and as soon as I saw the policeman I called out—I saw two females in the Park, but they were a great way off—I had counted my money, and had it in my pocket between Trinity church and Tottenham-court-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in the park on the night in question—I passed through Chester-gate about eight o'clock, and came towards Park-square East, on the Colosseum side—I there saw two per<lb></lb>sons standing under the park palings apparently hustling together—I watched them for about five minutes, and then heard a female voice cry out, "Let me go—let me go"—I crossed over at the time, and she said, "Thank God, here is a policeman"—I said, "What is the matter?"—she immediately replied, "I charge this man with having robbed me"—I said, "Of what?"—she said, "Of a quantity of silver"—I said, "What silver have you lost?"—she said, "Some half-crowns"—I turned to him and said, "You are charged with stealing half-crowns from this lady"—he said, "I have no such thing"—I said, "You must come to the station-house"—he slunk away about ten yards—I followed him and took him to the station-house, and there found five half-crowns, sixpence in silver, 11/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

I worked hard for my living; say he, I am authorized so to do by a gentleman; says I, what gentleman? says he, that man; pointing to that gentleman, Mr. Lewis; sir, says I did you give charge of me for robbing any body? it is a false accusation; they immediately took me up to Guildhall before a magistrate and found nothing at all about me; they immediately searched the young man that was with me, and they found three or four handkerchiefs about him, and they committed me immediately, without giving me an opportunity of saying a word.</p>

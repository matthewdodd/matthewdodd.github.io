                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Alexander Mathews, a plumber and glazier, in Dover-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On the 24th of August I went to bed about ten o'clock—I was the last person up—I got up about five o'clock next morning—I am sure it was be<lb></lb>fore six o'clock-as I was getting up I found the prisoner in my room—she got up out of a chair, and looked over my bed-(I had heard a great noise in the kitchen about twelve o'clock in the night, but I thought it must be the mice, and went to sleep again)—I asked the prisoner what she wanted—she said "My name is only Patty," and went up stairs to go out—she had no business in the house at all—I gave an alarm, and found a small pane of glass broken in the kitchen window—she must have got down the area, broken the glass, unbolted the front kitchen door, and got in—the door was bolted when I went to bed at night—I missed two gowns of my own, which had been in the front kitchen overnight—she had taken them off a nail, and put them into the area—I also missed two caps belonging to Mrs. Matthews, which were lying on my bed overnight—these are them-(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the prisoner had lived servant in the house, but was dis<lb></lb>charged, I understand, about six months before I went there—I have been there six weeks—she had no business in the house—I found my gowns in the area, and my bonnet on her head.</p>

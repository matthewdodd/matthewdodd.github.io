               <p>ANN TAYLOR. I am turned eleven years of age. I live with Mrs. Smithers. I took the linen from Mr. Constable, and tied the sovereign in a handkerchief - I put the bag in a basket, and a cloth over it. I went on to the Bull public-house, at Somer's-town, where I saw the prisoner, whom I had seen before; she said, "Will you go on an errand for me?" I said, "I will run home with these things, and then go." She said, "Can't you come now? it is only just here." I said, "I am afraid to leave the things;" she said, "You had better go now." I put the things down at the corner of Smith-street, and went to a tailor's shop to get some work and five shillings for her. I left my brother with them - and when I was going, he cried, "Nancy! Nancy! the woman is running away with the things." I went back, and cried - "Stop Thief!" - a gentleman went and brought her back.</p>

            . I live in Brook-street, St. Pancras. On the morning of the 15th of October, I heard the little girl cry - "She has got my things." I saw the prisoner run with the basket, and followed her into a court. I found her in a privy with the basket, which I took up and gave to the constable.</p>

               <p>The servant-maid was the last up; she is not here; I always fastened the shop-window myself, and locked the two doors; there are two doors into the shop: the next morning, about five, we were alarmed by the neighbours that the shop was broke open; I got up, and went into the shop, and found the tiles and ceiling of the shop broken, and the leads both, and somebody had got in between the rafters; the shop adjoins to the house, but there is no room over it; there was room enough for a man to come through; I looked round the shop, and found two drawers open, one the till, and another; and I missed a number of different articles, and some silk articles which lay in the window. There was nothing done till about a quarter after seven in the morning, when Mr. Black came up to desire me to come down to the Feathers, that there was a suspicious man there; when I came there, we went up into the room where the prisoner and his wife were, and the first thing we discovered, in searching the room, was a Cheshire cheese under the bed; the next thing that I could swear to, was a snuff-box that lay on a chair in the prisoner's room; after that, the prisoner was searched; there was a piece of money found in his pocket; the prisoner said it was a crown piece when he took it out, but it was my medal.</p>
               <p>In which pocket? - I believe the right-hand breeches-pocket; I do not recollect any thing else being found: his wife was then searched, and all the rest of the articles, except a watch, were found upon her.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say for himself? - He said he had not been out; he said nothing more; we found the watch, on coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260085"></xptr> back, which was in the cage where the prisoner was confined, before we took him to Bow-street; I saw it found.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else in the cage when he was there? - Nobody else, nor before, that I know of. I know nothing further.</p>

               <p>About six o'clock, on the 1st of April, I heard this shop had been broke open, and my suspicion fell on the prisoner, because I was sent for the Thursday before about him; I got assistance to help me; I sent for Mr. Fuller, to enquire what he had lost, before I took him; I went up in the room, and took him; he lodged at the Feathers.</p>
               <p>How long had he lodged there? - Not a fortnight; he had lodged at the Red Lion about six or eight weeks before he came there; I had seen him before; I do not know his business. The first thing that was found, was a snuff-box on the chair; I went to search him; he said he had a crown piece; I took it out, and Mr. Fuller said he would swear to it; I felt in his other pocket, and I believe there were some seals there, but I do not particularly recollect them; it was a japan'd snuff-box; after I had searched him, I told his wife I should search her; she said, it is of no use to keep it any longer; so she pulled out these things out of her pocket, and the buckles and pap-spoon, and tea-spoon, and this case and some of the seals, and some loose silver, which was tied up in this glove, I found in a box in the room; he said he had not been out that morning; I said I knew he had, his breeches were all over mortar; the watch I could not find about him then, though I believe I was flurried, and did not feel on the right side; when I came back, I found they were afterwards in the cage.</p>

               <p>Had any body else been in the cage between that time? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it that you looked in the cage? - As soon as we came back from Bow-street; it might be about three, it was in the afternoon of the same day; here is a leather purse I found in a box with Mr. Fuller's name upon it in his own hand writing, that was in the box in the room with the loose silver.</p>

               <p>I live at Brentford, at the Feathers; the prisoner lodged at my house about eight days; I remember the night this robbery was committed, the prisoner went out about a quarter after four in the morning, as nigh as I can guess; I never saw him till about seven, then he came in.</p>
               <p>Did you observe him bring any thing with him about that time? - He had something in a white cloth he carried in his hand, but what I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did he use to go out so early? - I never saw him go out so early before.</p>
               <p>What employment had he at your house? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he work at any thing? - I cannot really say he did, he was there so short a time.</p>
               <p>It was pretty near day-light, when you let him out in the morning? - Yes, it was break of day.</p>
               <p>(The snuff-box deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It lay in the till; I saw it forty or fifty times a day.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me look at it, it is an old box, a good deal worn.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260086"></xptr>Then from the marks and appearance of it do you know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of its being your's? - Not the least in the world; these rings were taken out of the same drawer; the two gold rings lay in a box, where there was some silver and halfpence, the diamond ring was in a box wrapped up in a paper; I have no doubt of the box and the rings.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Fuller deposes to them.)</p>
               <p>This purse is mine; I do not know the watch, this was a watch pledged on the Friday; there was a watch the night before in the drawer, and it was gone in the morning; I can swear to the silver medal.</p>
               <p>What is it a medal of? - Something of a battle; that lay in the same drawer where the two gold rings lay.</p>
               <p>What was the device on the medal you lost? - There was some man on horseback.</p>
               <p>And what woman, do you know? - I do not know, Diana, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Court. No, it is Anna, not Diana; how long have you had it? - Ever since I can remember.</p>
               <p>Have you never taken notice what the medal was? - No.</p>
               <p>How can you swear to it? - By seeing it constantly.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fuller. I cannot say I know the medal; I have seen it a number of years in that same drawer; I know this little toothpick case; I do not know the handkerchiefs, otherwise than seeing them lay in the window; I know the ear-rings and buckles; I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>What may the value of these things be that are found at a low valuation? - About five guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I am as innocent of the robbery, as a young child.</p>
               <p>How did these things come into your possession? - A man brought them, and delivered them to me in the street; I asked him, whether I should come to any harm by them? he said, no; he delivered them to me; I cannot have my witnesses here till to-morrow, or Monday; or else I have witnesses where I was at the time the robbery was done; I went out to work at a gentleman's house, after a job of work; I am a day labouring man.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Name all the articles that are there? - A pair of silver buckles, four tea-spoons, one pap-spoon, a diamond ring, two plain gold rings, a pair of garnet ear-rings, and a silver watch, three silver seals, and a silver tooth-pick case, a quantity of old silver, and a silver medal.</p>

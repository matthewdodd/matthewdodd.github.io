His back being towards the light, it is impossible for me to speak to his face; but by his shape and apparel I have no doubt of the prisoner being the identical person; I saw him go on the left hand side of my warehouse, and immediately came back again, there were some packs, intercepted my sight, that I did not see him for a very short space of time; he went out immediately, I went round my desk and came into my warehouse; and got my eye upon him again; the distance of time that I lost sight of him, was so short that it is impossible he could have any accomplice to give my piece to, I saw a piece under his arm when he went out; and he had it when I saw him in the street; I went and took hold on him within 30 or 40 yards of my warehouse door; whether I seiz'd him first, or the next evidence, I can't say; we took the goods from him. ( Produc'd in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value ?</p>
               <p>Tooke. It is worth 5 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody has it been since ?</p>
               <p>Tooke. It has been in my custody ever since; and I immediately set a mark upon it; the prisoner was secur'd, and committed from the time he went out of my shop, to the time we took him, which I apprehend was not above two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Tooke. It was near four in the afternoon.</p>

            . On Thursday the 9th of Nov. about 3 or 4 in the afternoon, I was looking out at my dining room window, I saw the prisoner lurking about, backwards and forwards several times, near the prosecutor's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where abouts do you live?</p>
               <p>Matthewson. I live about thirty or forty yards from his warehouse ; at last I saw the prisoner go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Matthewson. I am; and he came out again without any thing; in about the space of a minute he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060028"></xptr> went in again and brought out a piece of white stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Look on that parcel (produced), was it like that by the quantity and colour?</p>
               <p>Matthewson. It was; I ran down the street and collared him, and in the interim Mr. Tooke ran from his warehouse door to the prisoner, there might be about 2 or 3 feet distance between us and not above; I don't remember which of us took the piece from him, but we carried him back to Mr. Tooke's warehouse. Mr. Tooke sent for a constable and charged him with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Matthewson. He said a gentleman gave him three halfpence to go and take a piece of stuff that lay down there.</p>

               <p>I was coming along on my lord mayor's day a little in liquor, and a gentleman, very well dressed, told me, if I'd take that bundle which he had under his arm and carry it to the end of the street, he'd give me three pence to buy me some beer. Some of these gentlemen came and laid hold on my collar. The man was quite a stranger to me, he was just before me; he went away and they took me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Matthewson. Did you see any body before the prisoner when you took hold on him ?</p>
               <p>Matthewson. I saw no body near him at that time.</p>

My wife said, perhaps you have put it somewhere else; and said, I dare say the prisoner was honest; so it passed on, till hearing of a little misdemeanor she had done, I went and charged her with taking my money; she said, she never had seen it; at last she owned she had bought a gown in Holborn with some of the silver: it cost nine shillings: I got a constable, and gave him charge of her; the constable told her, if she would not tell what she had done with the dollar, she must go to Newgate: then she said she would tell what she had done with it; and said, that she had pawned it to

            . I am wife to the prosecutor: the prisoner was cleaning our house the 22d of May. I put the key in the closet door, and said, if she found any things in the closet, to put them in their places again: I thought she was a very honest woman: she having found two or three things in cleaning some time before, and delivered them to me: after my husband told me he missed the money, I looked in the closet; there was no money there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person in the dining-room at that time?</p>
               <p>S. Foss. There was nobody in the house but my husband and she and I.</p>
               <p>Adam Cane. I am a victualler in the Fleet-market: about six or seven weeks ago, the prisoner came to my spouse with the prosecutor: she said, Mrs. Cane, let me have that dollar which you have for the four shillings: my spouse produced it: the prisoner said, that is the dollar which was in the purse.</p>

               <p>I went to clean the rooms once, and found a Queen Elizabeth 27 s. piece, which I delivered to them, and another time I found a purse of silver buttons, which I delivered also, and a paper of thread. I found this purse with the money in the yard, out at a door which opens into the churchyard.</p>

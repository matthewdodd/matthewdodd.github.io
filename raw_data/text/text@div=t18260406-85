On the 31st of March, about ten o'clock at night, my next door neighbour informed me I was robbed; I went to my bed-room on the first floor, and found it locked as I had left it, but missed this property - they were safe between seven and eight o'clock; I found the window open - there were foot marks on the window ledge - the thieves had gone out that way; the prisoner lodged with me four or five months ago - he was brought to my house in custody, with the property, that night.</p>

            . I am night-beadle. About half-past ten o'clock on this evening, I was going down Essex-street, which leads to Rose-street, and met the prisoner with another young man, running down the middle of the street - no alarm was made; I kept them in sight for thirty or forty yards - when they had passed about twelve yards I heard a rattle sprung; I then pursued and secured the prisoner- he immediately shifted a parcel out of his coat and threw it from him; Mr. Holley claimed it - I had not seen him with the bedding.</p>
               <p>MRS. HOLLEY. This parcel was in my bed-room with the bedding.</p>

On the night in question I left work about half-past nine o'clock, and, after having a pint of beer, was returning home - when I got half way down Essex-street two men ran by me - I turned round to look at them, and saw them throw something down; I turned to pick it up when the officer struck me - he picked it up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060047"></xptr>and took me into custody; I positively declare my innocence.</p>

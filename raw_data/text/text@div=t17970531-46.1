             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. On the 27th of April, I was returning to town in a chaise, with Mrs. Watkins, and Mrs. Spencer.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Watkins, I believe, parted from you? - A. At the corner of a street, in Oxford-road, Mrs. Watkins left us, and got into a Hackney-coach to go to her own house.</p>
               <p>Q. After she was gone, did you observe any thing particular about your carriage? - A. Not till we got into <placeName id="t17970531-46-crimeloc268">Hanover-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How did it happen, that Mrs. Watkins's portmanteau was behind your chaise? - A. In consequence of its being very dirty, the trunk was very wet, and rather than incommode her with it, we were to take it to our house, and she was to send for it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. Between eight and nine in the evening, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you could not see what was doing behind the chaise? - A. Yes; I mean to swear that I saw the trunk in the man's arms, it was fastened by myself, in Yorkshire, with leather and cords both.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or not, in consequence of your having travelled a considerable length of way, you are able to say whether the trunk was fast when you came into town? - A. No; but at Barnet I saw it fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to undertake to swear, that when you arrived in town, the trunk was fastened or loose? - A. At Barnet, I saw it fast.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see it behind the chaise in London, when you looked back? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Was that the same trunk that you saw fastened at Barnet? - A. It was; the straps were cut asunder, I saw them this morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was dark at that time? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And do you think they must not have observed you watching them? - A. They might, if they had not had another object in view.</p>
               <p>Q. If you suspected them, why did you not stop them before the trunk was stole? - A. I had no right to stop them before.</p>

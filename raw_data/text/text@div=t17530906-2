            . I was writing a letter at a table in the prosecutor's house, the prisoner at the bar came and look'd over me, then she sat down in a chair, and I kept writing; she took up a bundle of things that lay on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I never saw her before to my knowledge, I ask'd her whether the things belong'd to her, or Mr. Redman. She said they belong'd to her, and went out with them; but soon after finding they belong'd to Mr. Redman, I went out to enquire for her, and found where she liv'd; she was coming out of her house with the things in a bundle as before in her apron. I took her back to the prosecutor's house, and she had the things in her apron all the time. The prosecutor own'd the things, and she was taken before the justice and committed.</p>

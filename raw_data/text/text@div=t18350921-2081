                  </hi>. On Friday the 4th of September, I was at Barnet<lb></lb>fait—I took a gelding there with several other horses, and at half-past six o'clock in the evening I placed them in a field near Barnet, which I hired during the fair—there is a gate to the field, which I locked, and left them secure—I missed a brown gelding next morning—the gate was taken off the hinges, and the gelding taken away—I pursued, and found it on the forest at Walthamstow, with the hair plucked out of its tail, and the mark the letter T on the off-shoulder, cut out, as well as it could—but it was visible—I took possession of it.</p>

               <p>lives at Walthamstow, and sometimes elsewhere—he has no particular place—I believe the pony was in Layton parish—that is the adjoining parish to Walthmstow—It was between one and two o'clock in the day that I saw him—I did not speak to him—I went across to the horse, and looked at it about twenty minutes afterwards, when he was gone away from it, and saw the letter T cut on the off-shoulder—It was disfigured, but I could still make out that it was a T—I saw the horse again on Sunday, between four and five o'clock—Austen had got it in his possession then—It was the same horse as I saw the prisoner have, with his arm round its neck—I took the prisoner into custody on Sunday the 6th—Austen gave him in charge—I found him at Shedricks beer-shop, on the forest, right opposite where the pony was—Austen sent for me, and when I came up, I found the prisoner with him, at the beer-shop—when I went in, the prisoner asked me if I saw him on the Saturday with the pony, I said, "Yes, I saw you with your arms round its neck, leading it to the water; and after that you turned it off again"—he said, "No, I did not, nobody saw me with the pony, I never touched it.

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at Walthamstow. On Saturday the 5th of September, I saw the prisoner on the road which leads from Chingford to Walthamstow, riding a horse—he got off and walked a little way, and led it—then got up and rode again—It was between six and seven in the morning—he was coming towards Walthamstow—It was a small dark brown horse—I did not see it again till the Monday morning following, when it was at the Crooked Billet—the man was taking it to the Magistrate—It was after the prisoner was taken up—Austen was there—It was the same horse aas I had seen the prisoner leading and riding.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Pray, was it quite light? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite light—I saw the horse very plain—he was riding at first—he got off, and led the horse on the near side of a hay-cart, going towards London—I stopped, and noticed him after he passed me, and he got up again and rode—I noticed him, and also the horse—I swear it was the identical horse that I saw on the Monday.</p>

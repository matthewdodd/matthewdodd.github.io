               <p>JOHN ROLLS. I am in the employ of Benjamin Hodges and Sons, who are distillers. On the death of my wife I gave up house-keeping, and took a house, <placeName id="t18180909-253-crimeloc1395">No. 6, Lisson-street, Lisson-grove</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18180909-253-crimeloc1395" type="placeName" value="No. 6, Lisson-street, Lisson-grove"></interp>

The prisoner came into possession of it at the latter end of last year, and lived in it-my property remained there, locked up in two rooms; I had the keys. I had agreed to pay him 4s. per week for the rooms. I lived at Westminster. In consequence of information, I applied at Marlborough-street office on the 13th of August, got an officer, and went and found the house empty, no person was there, nor any furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find your two rooms - A. The door of the outer room was opened, and the articles stated in the indictment gone - They were all safe on the 14th of June, when I saw the prisoner, and paid him the rent; I have never found any of it. About the 17th of August the prisoner was apprehended. My property was worth above 50l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Between the 14th of June and the 13th of August, you do not know how the property might have gone away - A. No; I belive he let part of the house out.</p>

            . I am a milkman. Between five and six o'clock in the morning, from the 15th of July to the 21st, I met the prisoner on different mornings going down the New-road, one morning he had a green fender and a set of fire irons; another morning I met him with a bed tied up in a blanket; at another time with a basket. He came in a direction from Lisson-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What part of the New-road did you meet him in - A. Between Gloucester-place and John-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was he - A. I believe he was a broker. I knew he once lived in Lisson-street, but had left the house, which made me suspect him.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live opposite to No. 6, Lisson-street. The prisoner removed his own furniture before Midsummer day. On the 10th of August, about nine o'clock at night, my wife called me, I saw the prisoner come out of the house with a large bundle under his arm; I went to him, and said, "You d-d rascal, you have been robbing the house, I will charge the watch with you." He immediately ran away as fast as he could. I called the watch, but he escaped. The prisoner knew me very well.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of August. He said he would go quietly, if I would let him walk without holding him. When I took him he said he knew it was about some furniture; he afterwards said, "This can be made up, let us go to a public-house and have some beer." I refused.</p>

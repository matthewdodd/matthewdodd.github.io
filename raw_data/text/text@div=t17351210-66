            . This Wilchin of Fish was cut away from our Stowage. November 14. where I have fifty or sixty pounds worth of Lamperns.</p>
               <p>- Creech. As I was going to my Craft at Hammersmith, I met the Prisoner and another who is not taken, and they thought proper to take this Wilchin of Lamperns, and I was in my Skiff at the same time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I take them, or he that run away?</p>
               <p>Creech. You row'd in the Boat, while he flung the grapplings over board, and haul'd the Wilchin to him. Then we row'd to Justice Barker's Rails. We went a shore and they were drest at night and I eat one Meal of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were concern'd?</p>
               <p>Creech. Concern'd? yes, or else what did I go there for? I could not be concern'd if I was not there, tho' I never laid finger upon them, till they were brought on Shore. <rs id="t17351210-66-verdict282" type="verdictDescription">

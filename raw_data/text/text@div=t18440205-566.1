                  </hi>. I live at No. 33, South Audley-street, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square—the prisoner was my errand boy. On the 17th Jan. I missed a gold watcb, a spoon, and fork—I was out in the morning, and on returning I received information, saw the prisoner, and asked if he had stolen the watch—(I made him no threat or promise)—he said, "No"—I went out leaving him with the uncle of our female servant—I afterwards came back, saw him again, and he told me he had stolen the articles—I had not left him in the uncle's custody—the watch was kept on the mantel-piece in my bed-room, and the spoon and fork in the kitchen—Ihave not found the property—the prisoner told us that when he, went out of my house on the 16th, he met a man who took the watch from him as he was looking at it, and told him to follow him, that he went to a Jew in Monmouth-street, and sold it for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but the Jew would not buy the fork and spoon, as they were not silver, and the man took them away from him and ran away.</p>

               <p>evening, but had not wound it up for a week before—I first spoke to the female servant, after missing the watch—I did not accuse her of having committed the robbery—I asked her if she did it, at the same time I asked the prisoner—I told the prisoner's father that I believed it was not his son that had stolen the things, but the servant—it was not in consequence of what the servant's uncle told me, that I again went and accused the prisoner—he came and said I had accused his niece wrongly, that it was the boy that did it—I cannot recollect the exact expression I used to him—I think I said if he had robbed me of anything else it was better for him to tell me so at once—it was not after that that he told me he had taken the watch—the servant's uncle and the prisoner both told me he had stolen the watch—he came to me with the servant's uncle, and told me so himself—the uncle came first, and the prisoner afterwards—the prisoner did not hear what the servant's uncle said to me—I spoke to him first—I asked if he had robbed me, and he said yes—I did not tell him I would give him in charge if he did not tell me about it—I did not ask him if he had robbed me—I told him it was wrong to rob me, and he said he was very sorry for it, and so on—neither the servant or here uncle are here—the prisoner was in my employ a little more than three weeks.</p>

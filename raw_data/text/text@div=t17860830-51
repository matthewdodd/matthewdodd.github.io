               <p>I am the prosecutor's daughter; on Tuesday about nine in the morning, the two prisoners came into the shop; they did not come in together; Crowley asked for a pair of shoes; he tried them on, and went out of the shop; he came in again, and asked me to let him look at them again; they both went out of the shop together; Crowley said, he would have that pair of shoes he had tried on first; then he told me to fit the <rs id="t17860830-51-deflabel276" type="occupation">boy</rs>

W. by Mr. Scott; I saw the shoes that day.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 25th of July, I saw the two prisoners run across the way, from the Church to Union-court, and at the end of the court, Crowley turned his head; they got into a timber merchant's yard, which is no thoroughfare; there I saw Crowley take the shoes from under his left side, and give them to the other prisoner; the little one said, he had just bought them of a Jew; says Crowley, he will go with you and shew you the man, he is over the way now; accordingly the great one followed me, and the little one began to look under the apple-stalls; I said, you do not think the Jew is gone to bed; and while I was talking the little one ran up Shoe-lane, and the prisoner Crowley ran down Holborn, and I ran after the boy up Shoe-lane.</p>

               <p>I was going home to breakfast, and I met this lad, and two or three more, talking to a Jew; I stood and looked on while they bargained for a pair of shoes, and the boy reached them to me, and asked me if they were worth the money; then the constable came up, and the boy told him he bought them of a Jew.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Welch. I had been at work; I bought the shoes of a Jew for four shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Crowley called four witnesses to his character.</p>

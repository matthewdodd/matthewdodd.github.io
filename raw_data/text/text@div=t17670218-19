            . I took the evidence Carney in Cheapside; I saw him and another pick a gentleman's pocket there; the next day I asked him, if there was any more of the gang, as we were going to Guildhall; he told me he was concerned with the prisoner, in stealing a frail of raisins from off the key; then we went and took the prisoner as he had directed us, at his lodgings on Salt-petrebank; he told us, he was either there, or gaming on Tower-hill; Carney also described a bag that he said the prisoner had with him, to put the raisins in; we went afterwards, and found the bag marked as he described, with a little hole or two in it.</p>

            . I am constable for the King on the keys; the boy Carney mentioned the prisoner before Mr. Alderman Nash; the Alderman ordered me to go to his lodgings, and search for him; we went, and took him at his lodgings; we also found this bag by the side of his bed; (produced, with small holes in it.) The evidence told us of these holes before we went to see for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>Jebb. He said he knew nothing of the matter.</p>

               <p>Jebb. No.</p>

            . I shall be 14 years of age the 17th of next March; I have known the prisoner about two months; I got acquainted with him at Salt-petre-bank, at a lodging-house where he and I lay. I have a mother alive; she lives in Buckle-street. I worked in Petticoat-lane; when I left my place, I did not go to my mother, but got into bad company with a parcel of boys, and went a thieving. The prisoner asked us to go out at night; that night we went out about twelve; it was one o'clock when we got the raisins; this was about a fortnight ago, on a Tuesday night; we found the watchman asleep on the keys under a ladder; the prisoner went, and looked and saw him, and the other boy went, and took a basket of raisins from a parcel under a shed; he carried it up to the archway, and then put it in the bag, and put it on his head, and carried it along; we went the city way, and round Leadenhall-street, because we would not meet the watchmen; we took them to the house where he lodged; in the morning he got up, and took some in his apron, and asked a person to buy them, who said, he would not give above three farthings a pound for them; then we went into Petticoat-lane; there he bid me go into an alehouse; he came to us, and said, he got five farthings a pound for them, and that they came to 3 s. 3 d. and he gave me 13 d.</p>

            . I am about twelve years old; I saw the prisoner and this boy, (meaning Carney) come into the house one Tuesday night; they went out between twelve and one that night; I was asleep when they came in, in bed; they awaked me; I saw they had some plums in a bag; the prisoner pulled his shoes off, and lay down till towards morning; they went out to sell them in the morning; I do not know where they sold them; the prisoner gave me a handful out of the bag; they cut the top of the basket off, and put them in the bag, and carried them out in that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing about it; that boy ( meaning Carney) used to come there almost every night, and they would talk who had got the most handkerchiefs by picking of pockets.</p>

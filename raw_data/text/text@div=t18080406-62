               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the person of the prisoner. - A. Yes; on the 29th of March, between seven o'clock and the half hour after, I saw him at the hind part of a cart in Bull and Mouth street, he was in the act of getting out; I am sure of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take any thing from the cart. - A. I did not; I went in about my business; I passed him and went on about two hundred yards, when he passed me with the truss on his shoulder, just at the end of St. Ann's lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he was the same man that you had seen in the cart. - A. I was quite sure he was the same man by his dress, he had a brown coat on; when he passed me some person called out Joe do not run; there is no person calling to you; that gave me suspicion; he went on a little further, he put the truss down at a door, I passed him and looked at him; I turned back almost immediately, I run back to the Bull and Mouth to enquire if he had stole the truss; I found the carman enquiring after it; I told the carman if he would follow me I would shew him where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name. - 
               <persName id="t18080406-62-person595">A. Thomas Hartman</persName>
            . The carman followed me into St. Ann's lane, where he found the truss moved from where I left it, about five or six yards across the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner. - A. He was gone; I saw no more of him till he was brought back by the patrol in about eight or ten minutes; I set a person to watch the prisoner, which he did; this man is a stranger to me, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that when you saw the prisoner in the custody of the patrol he was the same man that you saw in possession of this truss. - A. At that time I was quite sure, I had taken notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say in his hearing that he was the man that was in the cart. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at the hall that he saw me in the cart, but he could not see my face, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Witness. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 29th of March had you any quantity of tea in their cart. - A. I had this truss and another; and a small chest; they were going to the Red Lion inn, Aldersgate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you walking by the side of the cart. - A. No, I had drawed up my cart close to the side of the Bull and Mouth gate.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it. - A. Between seven o'clock and the half hour; I went down the yard to deliver a small parcel; I left nobody with the cart; I was gone down the yard about ten minutes to deliver a small parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that when you went down the Bull and Mouth yard every thing was safe in the cart. - A. Yes, I covered them safe with a sail cloth in the front of the cart; on my return I found the tailboard of my cart down and I missed the truss of tea; I made every enquiry immediately. Oily came and informed me where the truss was gone; I found the truss again in St. Ann's lane by Oily's directions; I took it home; I did not see the prisoner till he was brought back to the cart; he was in custody of the patrol.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer; - on the 29th of March, as I was coming up Foster lane I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw the prisoner running in a direction toward me, he turned as if he was going into Wood street, then he altered his course on seeing me come towards him; I followed him and took him in Little Love lane; I asked him what made him run, he said he did not run; he did run, because I run pretty sharp after him; I asked him whole coat it was he had under his arm, he said his own, he put it on; immediately a person came up and told me he had stole a parcel out of a cart in Bull and Mouth street; the prisoner denied it. I asked him to go along with me, then I should see whether he was guilty or not; he refused going with me and struck me. I catched hold of him by the collar and told him I should use him very rough if he served me so any more; I brought him back to the Bull and Mouth, they said they knew him. Oily charged him with being the man that robbed the cart.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - the crime that is alledged against me I am totally ignorant of, and I have no doubt but the discernment of this honourable court and jury will acquit me of this charge; I never saw the witness Oily before I was brought to Bull and Mouth street; the witness Oily admitted that he saw a man in the cart before the magistrate, but he could not identify me to be the person. On the evening laid in the indictment I was coming along Wood street, there were several people quickened their paces; a man before me turned round and seized hold of me and gave me in charge immediately; I did not know why that man stopped me, I have never seen him since, and when I was brought into Bull and Mouth street I was astonished at what they charged me with. I am a watch gilder by trade; - there were many turnings in the street - and if such a thing as conviction should take place it would be dangerous for a man to walk in the street; - is it possible that I can be convicted, as the man who first stopped me never appeared against me; therefore I make no doubt of a verdict of acquittal, as he never appeared against me before the justice where I was examined.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

He then made up the box, in the bag, in the same way as when he received it, and then he forwarded it by the Bristol mail to London and the bills and notes he gave to Mrs Hinchesman the night or the day after the robbery. I am not certain which, he had advised Mrs. Hinchesman to negotiate some of the bills before the robbery could be known at Bristol; it could not be known there till the return of the mail, She did circulate several, it was then known at Bristol, and she had absconded she was afraid of being taken into custody, he said, she went to Bath.</p>

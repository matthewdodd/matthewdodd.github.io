                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Wood, No. 65, Upper Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. I recollect going to bed on the night of Thursday, 2nd June, about a quarter before 11 o'clock—I secured the house, I fastened the doors and windows in the usual way—I came down in the morning, at a quarter past 6 o'clock; I found the house very confused, the dining room door was open—the back parlour, and the door of the drawing room was open—they were all closed when I went to bed—I examined the kitchen, the window was closed, and the shutters were to, and a box put before them—the shutters had been closed the night before, and a wooden bar put against them—in the morning the bar was found in the dust place outside—there was no bolt on the window, the window could have been opened from outside, and the bar was gone—I am quite certain I put it up</p>

               <p>the night before—I went back to see that I had done to—I found that in the parlour six pictures had been cut from the stretchers, and were gone—the sideboard had been burst open, and the contents taken out—I had seen the pictures safe the night before—these are them.</p>

On the morning of 3rd June, I came down stairs about a quarter past 6 o'clock (I had gone to bed about a quarter before 10 o'clock the night before)—I found the dining room in the greatest possible confusion—the pictures which had been against the walls bad had the stretchers taken out of the frames, and the pictures cut out in the most careful manner—the pictures were my own productions, and were of the greatest value—I value them at 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—one of them was in a heavy frame, and the ornaments must have been removed from the mantelpiece before taking it down—it would have taken at least two men to do it—these are the pictures (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had looked at them the day before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live in Foley-street. I know Mr. Wood's house in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square—I passed it on 2nd June, at 11 o'clock at night, I saw three men standing at the door—there are three steps—there was one man on each step—I. passed close to the steps—I had a flowerpot in my hand, and I stopped to change it from one hand to the other—I believe the prisoner Gillings to be one of the men—I had an opportunity of seeing his face from the gas lamp, which was four or five yards from the spot—he had a bushy moustache then, and looked very different to what he does now; still I feel justified in saying he is the man—he was at first looking down the area—after he looked down there he looked towards me, his eye met mine.</p>

               <p>in the door, and opened it—when Benge came up I told him I came from Mr. Minton, a metal dealer over the water, to purchase some paintings—Benge was then present; he went into the room with us—I do not believe he knew where we got the key—when I went in I found these six paintings rolled up on a box in the room—I looked at them, and asked Benge who they belonged to—he said, "To my nephew and me"—I said, "What do you want for them?"—he said, "I don't know, my nephew is out; would you call again?"—I said, "Do you live in this house?"—he said, "I do I live in the kitchen; I have lived there some time"—I then put the bolt on the door, and told him we were officers of police, and these paintings were the produce of a burglary, and I should take him in custody on suspicion of being concerned in the burglary—he said, "Oh, indeed! I am only a lodger in the house, I know nothing at all about them"—I made a search, and found three silver watches in a box in the room, and four duplicates, three of which relate to watches and a chain.</p>

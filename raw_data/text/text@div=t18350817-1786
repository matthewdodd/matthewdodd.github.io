                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Kneller Smart, of Princes-street, Leicester-square. On the 18th of July, the prisoner came to the shop—he is a stranger—he broughta piece of silver rod, and wanted to know if we bought old silver—Mr. Smart told him he did—he placed the the rod on the counter—Mr. Smart then asked him where he got it—he said he had been to work at an empty house in the Strand, and he and a bricklayer found it in the privy, and they divided it between them—we asked him where the bricklayer was with the other piece, and togo and fetch it—he said he could not purchase it, but should detain it, and asked him his name and address—he wrote on a paper, "John Williams, No.6 Tower-street, St. Giles's"—I asked him who was the master of the job—he said, a master-builder, named Armstrong, who lived at Pimlico—I afterwards made inquiry, and found his name and address were false—I afterwards went to Lsle-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields with the officer, and saw the prisoner's wife—he told me it was his lodging—I there found a sextant.</p>

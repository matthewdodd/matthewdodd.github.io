                  </hi>. I Jive in Calthorpe-street, and am a me<lb></lb>dical student. I went to Woolwich to see the Review on the 5th of july—I perceived something at my pocket—I turned, and the prisoner was im<lb></lb>mediately behind me—I accused him of having stolen my handkerchief—I saw him put his hands under his coat, as if hiding something—he said he had nothing of mine—he went off—I followed him, and found my handker<lb></lb>chief under his coat, at his back—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—there is my mark on it, and one corner is torn off—I gave him into custody.</p>

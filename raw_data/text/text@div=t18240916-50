On the 16th of August, about three o'clock, I stood opposite my door, and saw the prisoner come out of my parlour, and run through the shop - I had not seen him go in. I followed him, hallooing out,</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" I was convinced that he had taken something, and pursued him for half a mile; he was brought back by a mob: I had lost sight of him several times - he called Stop thief! himself frequently. I returned to the shop, and missed a watch off a nail over the parlour fire-place - I had seen it safe at twelve o'clock, and I think at two. When he was brought back I said he was the man; I put my hands round him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Give me my watch, and go about your business" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got it now," or</p>
               <p>"I have not got it," and pulled a waistcoat from behind his coat, and said,</p>
               <p>"There is a waistcoat I have taken, it is not worth above 1 s.;" it had laid on a bale of old clothes, on the left side of the shop. I think I have seen him at my shop once before, selling a pair of stockings; but am certain he is the man who ran out of the shop. I have not found the watch. I had been from the shop a very few minutes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The constable who brought me to Newgate said,</p>
               <p>"The lady means to try you for your life - you have got into bad hands, for she is an old offender, and will do all she can against you." I was passing her shop, and seeing some phials in the window I went in to buy one. I picked up this waistcoat; rapped on the counter, and called out</p>
               <p>"Shop!" but no one answered. I came out, and she said,</p>
               <p>"There is a man come out of my shop; Stop thief!" I said I had stolen nothing - she followed me, and gathered a crowd. I met a friend, who said,</p>
               <p>"What row is this;" I said I did not know, but would go back, as the waistcoat might be owned.</p>
               <p>MRS. PALMER. I value the watch at 40 s.; I had had it six or seven years.</p>

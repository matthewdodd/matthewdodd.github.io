                  </hi>. I am clerk to my father, a solicitor, in Lime-street. On Thursday evening, 10th Jan., between nine and ten o'clock, I was in Whitechapel—I was perfectly sober, I had only had a little claret—I felt some one at my left side—from a glance I had, I think it was a woman—I felt a handkerchief, or rag, come over my face, and have no idea of anything from that time till I found myself in a room on a horrible bed, naked, except my stockings, and only covered over with a dirty rag—I was greatly confused, and in great pain all over me—there was no candle—I missed my boots, hat, a cashmere shawl, gloves, handkerchief, silver watch, hair-guard, a tooth-pick, a gold ring, two shillings, and some coppers—I had had them all the night before, the ring had been in my waistcoat pocket with my tooth-pick—my waistcoat was not gone—the room-door was fastened out<lb></lb>side—it was just day-break when I came to my senses, but when I got out it was light—I had no idea where I was—as soon as I came to my senses, I hallooed out, and went towards the door—I found a small key on the floor—I heard footsteps outside, pushed the key under the door, and it was opened by a pot-boy—I found I was in the back-room, first-floor—I partly went down<lb></lb>stairs, and then went up<lb></lb>stairs to a back-room, and found a man and woman there—I sent an envelope by the man to my father's office, and they came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> for me—these are the trowsers I had on—they are muddy up to the knees, as if I had been dragged along the mud—they were not so before—this hat and boots are mine—my memory was very much affected at the police-court—I am better now, but am confused, and cannot recollect very well—I had been very ill with the jaundice, this was only the fourth day I had been out—I had suffered no loss of intellect before this—the house where I found myself is about two hundred yards from where my recollection serves me last—there is a street between—Osborne-street turns out of Whitechapel, and Thrall-street out of that—I had not spoken to any females, and have not the slightest knowledge of the prisoners—I had been ill for a month.</p>

On 11th Jan., between ten and eleven in the morning, I went to 8, Thrall-street, to collect pots, and heard the back-room door, first-floor, rattle—there was; padlock on it—I saw a key outside, opened it, and found Mr. Jewitt—he made a complaint to me—he looked very bad—I told a policeman.</p>

In September last we had a variety of Exchequer bills - it was his duty to carry them to the Exchequer office, for the purpose of exchanging them and receiving the interest - we usually receive notice from the Exchequer to collect the bills advertised to be paid off - Mr. Christmas was then directed to select them, and make out a list of them from the different accounts of Exchequer bills, and take that account, with the bills, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150009"></xptr>the Exchequer office - they were delivered to him in September last for this purpose - he left our employ on the 18th of June last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I presume a number of these Exchequer bills are deposited at your house merely as security? A. Some are ours, and some are merely for safe custody - many of them belong to our customers - by referring to the entries we can tell which are ours; he has been in our house several years - I had no suspicion of him - I sent for him after he left us, and he came two or three times; he came on the very day he was taken.</p>
               <p>HUGH RICHARD HOARE. I am the last witness' nephew, and am engaged in the house, but am not a partner. In September last I looked out the Exchequer bills of September, 1823, and delivered them to the prisoner - it was his business to take an account of them, and carry them to the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took no account of them? A. No, I only handed all the bills of September 1823, out to him to get exchanged for others.</p>

            . I am employed in the audit office. Somerset-house, and produce a list of Exchequer bills delivered into the Exchequer bill office, and sent to our office - they are Exchequer bills of 1823, held by Messrs. Hoares - the amount of two lists which I have is 475,400 l. - they are numbered - the lists specify the numbers - the lists are sent to our office annually - we examine them and compare the old bills with them.</p>
               <p>HENRY MERRICK HOARE, ESQ. The words "new bills and interest," at the bottom of this list is in the handwriting of the prisoner, and here is written at the back of it, in his hand-writing, "Received, 22d of September. 1824, of the paymaster of Exchequer bills, the principal and interest of the Exchequer bills within specified;" then follows a list of the new bills, the number and amount of each, and the words "Received the within bills;" and a demand for the new bills is in the prisoner's writing - the whole of the list of the old bills, with the receipts, are in his writing - all the writing except the numbers of the new bills, are in his hand-writing - the receipt for the new bills is his writing.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to HOMER SNELGAR. Q. Did you compare the old bills with the numbers? A. I believe they have not been examined yet - we have the old bills sent with the list; I believe they have not been examined yet - the account was only delivered the beginning of this year - me amount of principal is 475,400 l., and interest 14262 l.; here is a list at the back, of the number, and amounts of the new bills, issued for them, not giving the particular numbers but how many of each amount.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is the receipt for the principal and interest of the old bills? A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What is the memorandum at the bottom of the paper, stating the amount, &amp;c. of the new bills? A. It means that the party applied for new bills, but we have nothing to do with that; here is a memorandum at back denoting that the holder received new bills of the same amount for old ones.</p>

            . Q. Did you compare the Exchequer bills delivered with any account? A. No; I received the bills from the accountant, with a label on them, to deliver to Messrs. Hoares; I delivered them to the prisoner - he examined them and made no objection to them: here is a book containing an account of the persons to whom the new bills are issued, with their numbers - the prisoner is the person who received Messrs. Hoares' bills on the 22d of September - we always deliver bills of the same amount as we receive.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose I had three 1000 l. old Exchequer bills, if I wished six of 500 l. for them, could I have them? A. No, we must issue the same amounts or pay in money - no money was paid on this occasion except the interest - I paid him a draft for the interest, on the Bank, and have it here; it amounts to 14,262 l.; here is an endorsement at the back of it "For Hoares and Co.

            . I am a clerk in the public drawing office at the Bank of England. On the 22d of September, 1824, I paid the prisoner an Exchequer draft of 14,262 l., and another draft of 35 l. 6 s. 8 d. I find that amount at the back of this cheque - it was on account of Messrs. Hoares; I gave him an order for the amount on Everingham, who pays him in Bank notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You gave him an order? A. Yes, two orders; one for Bank notes and the other for money; the order is paid by the pay clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. What does the name Christian, on the back of this mean? A. I have written the name Christian for Christmas, but I knew him very well; I read the name on the draft as Christian.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did you see him write his name on the draft? A. No, but I saw him come from the desk with it. I never knew but two instances in which the person receiving the money did not write his name on the cheque for the sake of reference if necessary; bankers' clerks do it as a matter of course, and if a stranger comes we ask him to do it. I cannot be certain that the prisoner is the person to whom I paid it, but I should pay it to nobody who did not answer to the name.</p>

            . I am pay clerk at the Bank of England. On the 22d of September, 1824, a note ticket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150010"></xptr>drawn by Whiting, was presented by the bearer Christmas - I cannot swear that the prisoner is the person; I paid the ticket, and when delivering it I ask the person's name, and if he had not answered to the name of Christmas I should not have paid it. I read the name as Christmas: I always knew the prisoner by that name. I paid him fourteen notes of 100 l. each. I took a memorandum of it from our books made by a clerk under my direction at the time. When the ticket is presented I give it to my companion, who enters it and passes it to me - I call over to him the notes which I pay - he enters them in the book and I check them - he calls them over to me as a double check; the notes are paid in regular numbers - if I say fourteen of 1000 l. he says, perhaps, 64 to 76, 1000 l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are the notes entered one by one? A. No, my Lord, the books are printed to correspond with the numbers - we pay them in following numbers; if a mistake was made we should discover it in the next entry - in this case Numbers 6483 to 6496, dated the 1st of September, 1824, were paid.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Without reference to your memorandum can you, from memory, state what notes were paid? A. No. The regular course of cashing this cheque for a banker would be to give him fourteen of 1000 l., one of 200 l., and three of 30 l., unless it was desired in a different manner.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you recollect the prisoner himself coming for this money? A. No, but I have every reason to believe so. I should not pay it to any person unless I thought they came from Messrs. Hoares: I have known him some years, and knew his name.</p>

            . I am cashier to Messrs. Hoares. I have the book containing an account of the Exchequer bills of the 22d September, 1824; it is the book in which they are entered before they are entered in the Exchequer bill ledger: here is an account of the new bills brought back for the old ones - the account of the old bills is in the prisoner's writing; the entry is "Exchequer bills, dated 20th of September, 1823, paid off 20th of September, 1824;" the total amount entered by him is 474,400 l. Here is the dividend book, in which the bills paid off are entered - the new bills are entered into the Exchequer bill ledger; they are distributed into a variety of accounts in the other book.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you an account in the prisoner's hand-writing, in which he gives credit for the total amount of principal and interest received for these bills? A. Yes, here is an account in his writing of the old bills, and each person is debited for the new bills on the other side; the amount of debits for new bills is 474,400 l.; the amount he credits for principal and interest is 488,632 l.; the difference, 14,232 l. is the interest. He has entered 1000 l. short in bills and 30 l. short in interest. Here is Miss Wood's Exchequer bill account; there was in her account an old Exchequer bill of 1000 l. No. 10,588; it is marked in the prisoner's hand-writing as having been paid off to the 20th of September, 1824, and her account is not credited for any new bill in the room of it - the interest on that bill is exactly 30 l.; if it had been paid off she would have had credit for 1030 l., principal and interest; it was the prisoner's business to give her credit for that amount - she is not credited for principal or interest.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it customary when a draft on the Bank is received from the paymaster of the Exchequer, to carry that draft for payment on the same day? A. Certainly not - he ought to have brought this draft to the banking-house, and another clerk would have to take it to the Bank the next day. There are two clerks named Ryder and Lee; one of whom would have to receive it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are all the pages in that book in the prisoner's writing? A. Yes. - The entry of the old bill on Miss Wood's account is dated the 22d of September, 1823. If it had been delivered to her there would be written against it, delivered on such a day, but he has written against it, "paid off on the 20th of September, 1824;" he should have entered a new bill on the credit side. If she had received the bill she must have given an order for the delivery of it; if it had been paid off in money the cash would have been carried to her general account, which is not here. I never quarrelled with the prisoner. I never write for newspapers.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, is it your writing? A. Yes; I do know that I wrote any more of that sort - I might have written two, but will swear I did not write three. I sent one to the Times newspaper - I sent them no other communication, and know of none being sent; that was sent to a newspaper-office. I sent a notice to the Herald also, and I went to the Times office; I had some conversation with the publisher, but cannot say whether I left one there - I called no where else. I thought it so black against him that the public ought to know it.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent this notice to the papers, "Mr. Christmas, for robbing Messrs. Hoares, will be publicly examined at Bow-street, this evening?" A. Yes, that is it. I was not directed by any of our firm to do so; I expect no advancement by his fall. I said nothing at the Times-office but that he would be examined that night. I never furnished materials for any of the articles which appeared there.</p>
               <p>Q. The interest entered in the book tallies with the principal sum entered? A. Yes. The entry is made on the 22d of September, the day on which they were paid off - the interest is added to the principal, to make the two sums tally - there is 1000 l. principal, and 30 l. interest omitted; but here is a list in his hand-writing, in which he enters both those sums. This particular bill is entered there; here is a list of Exchequer bills, which should tally with the other, but it does not. The first amounts to 475,400 l.; it is a rough copy, made out from the bill-book. In the other list the bill, No. 10,588, is omitted.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Where does that list come from? A. From the banking-house; the casting up makes the amount 474,400 l, and interest 14,232 l.; but it is cast wrong - 1000 l. principal and 30 l. interest; although there is but two items to cast up: if the bill had been paid off the money would be entered; this bill is not entered to her account any where.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. On your solemn oath are not the figures 474,700 in another person's writing? A. They are very like his figures.</p>
               <p>Q. They are one of the two sums which would make the 475,400 l.? A. Yes. I can swear to all the rest of the figures.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Here is 474,700 l. - have you any doubt of the figure 7 being in his writing? A. I cannot swear to that particular line being his, but to all the rest - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150011"></xptr>casting up is in his writing, and that is where the inaccuracy lies. Both the totals of principal and interest are his writing.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the banking-house. I have examined the Exchequer bills with the prisoner's list. I have examined all the books, and find all the bills correspond, except ten of 100 l.; they make 474,400 l., but it should be 475,400 l. to tally with the old bills. The 1000 l. bills tally; the deficiency is in ten of 100 l.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not tell the number of each bill? A. Not as to the actual number, but I compare the number of bills belonging to different people with the new bills, and find ten of 100 l. short. I have compared to see if the new bills tally with the old ones; the entries in the accounts are the prisoner's writing: the new bills are certainly every one entered in his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me the names of any person in whose account the deficiency will appear? A. I can mention them if obliged, but had rather not.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, point out the accounts, and do not read the names? A. Here is one, it is Miss Wood's - 1000 l. is deficient. I will state others without mentioning names; here is an account, in which the old bills were, four of 1000 l., three of 500 l., five of 200 l., and sixteen of 100 l.; in return for them there should be the same number and amount - instead of which I find five of 1000 l.; three of 500 l., five of 200 l., but only six of 100 l.; there is the same sum in total: this is in his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. There is a deficiency of 1000 l. in Miss Wood's account? A. Yes, and the actual deficiency is in ten bills of 100 l.</p>

            . I am a stock-broker. On the 22d of June I received from the prisoner, and sold for him three Exchequer bills of 100 l., dated the 20th of September, 1824. On the 25th of June I sold three 100 l., of the same date, and on the 14th of July four more of the same amount and date.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you money transactions with him to a considerable amount? A. Yes, many thousands; he acted as agent for people - he did not state for whom he sold those bills.</p>
               <p>MR. MELMOTH re-examined. Q. Will you refer to the clearing book - are there any entries of the prisoner's, of notes paid in on the 22d of September, 1824? A. I find an entry amounting to 13065 l. 6 s. 8 d.; it is paid in two notes of 30 l. each among others.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. My Lord, we will give up the charge of embezzling the 30 l.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being called upon for his Defence, entered into a long detail, desiring the Jury to banish from their minds any prejudice which they might have received from the statements in the public press - stated that his character was unimpeachable, and that he was high in the confidence of his employers after he left them, and contended that had he been guilty of the charge he should not have left, as while he continued in their employ detection would have been impossible; but entered into no explanation of the facts deposed to.</p>
               <p>MR. HOARE re-examined. I am certain it is not our practice for any draft of the Exchequer Bill office to be presented at the Bank on the day it is dated.</p>

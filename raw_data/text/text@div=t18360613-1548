                  </hi>. On the 15th of June, I was going by a stage-coach from the Bull Inn, Aldgate—when I got to the Bull a coach drew out of the yard—I was looking at it to see if it was the coach I was going by, and while so doing, somebody snatched my watch and ran away with is—I set up a cry of "Stop thief." and he was secured directly—this is the watch—the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I was working for Mr. Alderman Johnson. I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running—I followed him down Black-horse-yard, into Petticoat-lane—when I got up with him he was in the hands of Charles Ross—the prosecutor camp up to him and said, "Give me my watch, give me my watch"—he took the watch out of his pocket and gave it to the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Stinton, as silk-mercers and drapers generally, carrying on a large business in Vere-street, Oxford-street—the prisoner Ann Simons was in our service for two years and a half, and was employed in the cloak-room, among other things to cut out goods for the purpose of having them made up—to the time when these discoveries were made, I was not aware that she had a father alive—I never had any conversation with her about her father; but I always understood, from the whole of our establishment, that she had no father; not from herself. On 19th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220167"></xptr>
               <p>Oct. last, in consequence of discoveries I made, I gave her into custody—we have at various times missed large quantities of silks, lace, hosiery, gloves, shawls, ribbons, and other things—from circumstances that transpired, on 22nd Oct. I went down to Gumley, near Market Harborough, in Leicester-shire, to the house of the prisoner Benjamin Simons—he keeps the Har<lb></lb>borough Arms there—I arrived there about ten or half-past ten o'clock at night—I told him that they my name was Marshall, and I wished to speak to him pri<lb></lb>vately—he said he did not know the name of Marshall—I said it appeared to me a very extraordinary thing that he did not know the name of Marshall; that his daughter had been living with us for three years; that she had been in the country, for her holiday, last Christmas, and that I had been told that her holiday was spent at his house—he appeared to be very excited, and said it was a hard thing that he should be accountable for what his daughter had been doing in London, 100 miles away—I had not then told him what his daughter had done—I told him that he appeared to be a most unnatural parent, that he seemed to care so little about it—I then told him that his daughter had been robbing us to a large amount, and that I was in search of a hair trunk, that his daughter Ellen had brought down there, and left in the back bedroom—he declared most posi<lb></lb>tively that he had not seen such a trunk—I told him it was useless to deny it, as his daughter Ellen had given me the information, and told me where I should find it—I told him at all that had passed between me and Ellen, and asked if he had any communication from London—he said he had not—I described the sort of trunk I meant, and said without he gave it up I should apply for a search-warrant—he said I might search without one—I then inquired of him and some other persons who were in the house at the time, for the address of the Magistrate—I did not get it, and went across the road to a cottage, and knocked the people up to inquire where the Magistrate lived—I got his address, and went to him—I had no constable with me at that time—I went into the back bedroom before I left the house, but saw nothing there—I went into two bedroom, but did not find the trunk nor anything that I could recognize as mine—there was a stout gentleman there, named Buzzard, who, when I was making inquiries about the trunk, called Simons on one side, took him by the collar, and said, "Ben, Mr. Marshall appears to have a very straightforward story, if you know any-thing about the truck described, or any of Mr. Marshall's property, or if you know where it is, I entreat you as a friend to give him up the property, and give him any information you can"—he can stated he knew nothing about the hair truck or any of our property—on going to the Magistrate he gave me a search-warrant, and sent his servant with me to call the constable up—I then returned with the constable to Simon's house and searched it—that was about half-past twelve at night—he was sitting drinking and smok<lb></lb>ing the whole of the time—we searched the whole of the house, the drawers, and all the outhouse—Benjamin Simons kept saying that he had no pro<lb></lb>perty of ours, and knew nothing about it, and was <hi rend="italic">jeering</hi> me very much the whole of the time—he said he would go with me to London and help me to search, if I would pay the expenses up to London—there was a derision in what he said, and in his manner as well—it was said in an <hi rend="italic">offhanded</hi> sort of way—we found several things in some chests of drawers in each bed-room, which I could identify as having been ours—the greater part of them had been worn, and were of great value when new—they were not the things I was in search of—there were several small shawls, a silk dress, a lace bonnet</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220168"></xptr>
               <p>and various articles of females' wearing-apparel, some new linen for pillow-cases, which I recognized, and a piece of new material for a dress—I and the officer brought them down into the kitchen where the prisoner was sitting, and I told the constable to take him as my prisoner, that I had sufficient to trans<lb></lb>port him—I was very angry—he seemed very frightened and agitated—the constable at first did not take him, he said he would have another pipe of tobacco first, and sat down—he was a special constable—I then told the men who had driven me over from Leicester to take the harness of the horse, for I was determined to stop there till the morning—Simons then said, "I suppose you do not want to do anything to me if I give you up the hair trunk"—I told him it was the trunk that I wanted—he said he wished to speak to me outside the door, alone—I told him that anything he had to say must be in the presence of the constable—we all three went outside into the yard, and he refused to say anything—we then returned into the house, and he said, if I would allow the constable to go with him he would give him up the truck, to which I consented—I remained in the house, and he and the constable went out together—they returned in about ten minutes with the hair trunk—I saw it in the yard—this now produced is it—I then inquired of Simons if that was all he had got of our property—he said it was—I asked if he had the key of it—he said he had not—I asked if he was certain it had not been opened—he said he was positive it had not been opened since it had been brought down by Ellen—he did not say when that was—he then called me on one side again, and asked if I would write to the Magistrate to say that my firm belief was that he knew nothing about the hair trunk that I had found in his house—I said that I felt bound to write to the Magistrate after his kindness to me in giving me the search-warrant at the late hour, and to tell him what had transpired—I ordered my chaise, the trunk was put in, and I took it to Lei<lb></lb>cester—I there examined it, and in consequence of what I saw, and did not see, in it, I set out for Gumley again in less than ten minutes, taking the same two men with me—Gumley is fifteen miles from Leicester—I went to the house of the Rev. Mr. Abthorpe, the Magistrate, and Simons came to me there—I told him that he had not given me up all my property, that I was certain that he had a large quantity more concealed—he said he had another large chest, and if he gave it up he supposed the Magistrate would not do anything to him—the Magistrate said he could not hear of anything of the kind, and sent for the constable and gave him in charge, with the goods contained in the hair truck—we then proceeded to Simon's house, and on the road he said it was a very large chest and very heavy, and that he would be bound I should be satisfied with the contents, if I would let him escape—I told him that I had no power to do so, that the constable had him in charge and the property—we then went to his house; the Magistrate followed us, and told Jesson the con<lb></lb>stable not to let Simons escape, or any of the property be taken away—when we got to the house Simons spoke to the constable, and told him where he would find the chest—I did not hear what he said—he called the constable aside—the constable went and got the assistance of another man, a horse-dealer I believe, and in about ten minutes they returned with a large oak chest—Simons was not with them—his wife gave me the key—I am not positive whether it was in his presence or not—the chest was placed in the parlour, and I unlocked it in the presence of Simons and the constable—a piece of silk handkerchief laid on the top, which Simons laid hold of and wished me to give him—I said I should do nothing of the sort—he was perfectly sober—it was about eleven o'clock in the morning—(<hi rend="italic">the oak chest was here produced</hi>

                  </hi> I am the daughter of the male prisoner, and the sister of the female. In July last I was living at Madame Devy's, in Grosvenor-street—in the middle of July last I received this hair trunk from Evans—in consequence of a communication that he made to me from my sister, I took the trunk to my father's house at Gumley—I did not receive the key with it—I cannot say whether my father was at home when I arrived—I did not see him directly I got into the house—I saw him during the time I was there—the trunk was deposited at his house—I could not say which room I left it in, because it was removed into two rooms during the time I was at home—when I first went, it was taken into my bed-room—I staid at home a month—I do not think it was in my bed-room when I came away—I took off the cord myself, at my own instiga<lb></lb>tion; I do not know why, I did not want it—the box was locked—I did not open it—I saw the oak-chest there—it was standing in the bed-room in which I slept part of the time—my mother was not well, and I slept with her during that time—the chest was in her room—my father and mother gene<lb></lb>rally slept together—about three months ago, after my return from Gumley,</p>

               <p>my sister Ann handed me a key, at Mr. Hickman's—I believe it was the k✗ of the oak-chest—I was to keep it—she gave it me to take care of—she gave me not reason why—I had seen the oak-chest at my father's, and I knew that my sister had possession of it—it was in my father's bed-room—when she gave me the key, she said, "You will take this key, and take care of it for me"—I knew what key it was—she gave me no reason why I was to take care of it—she said it was the key of her box at home—she did not tall me what was in the box—I kept the key for about two months, until I knew my sister was in custody—that was on Tuesday evening, the 19th—I sent for my brother Nicholas, I think, on the Thursday evening, about seven of eight, and delivered the key to him—no one had told me to do so—I told him to take it to my father's, and also to tell him how ill my sister Elizabeth was; that I did not suppose she would live the night through—I also told him to say my sister was in custody—I did not say what for—to the best of my recollection this is the key (<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

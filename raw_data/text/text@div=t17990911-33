             sworn. I live in the house with Mr. Gunnell, as part of his family; there was one servant at home with me; I had been up stairs about one o'clock in the day, on coming down, I heard some glass shake on the side-board, in the front parlour; I then went to examine the parlour and saw a man looking over the rails; there were blinds to the window, and they were open; I went into the parlour and saw a man standing in the parlour; I had never seen him before, but I am sure I should know him again; the prisoner Hill, is the man; I asked him what he wanted there; he said, is the gentleman of the house at home; I asked him what he wanted with the gentleman; I do not recollect that he made me any answer; I turned round to look at the side-board and missed some spoons; I had put the spoons there myself in the morning; two table spoons, and two salt spoons, and the servant had put one tea spoon, which I saw there; the sash was opened, and the man at the rails called to the man in the room, and told him to knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sash open before, do you know? - A. I rather think it was; I then let him pass me, and I let him out at the street-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not offer any violence to you? - A. No; there was a butcher just by the window; I desired him to stop the man; he was brought back again in about a quarter of an hour; two men were brought back, but I only knew one of them, that was the man that was in the parlour, Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - A. Not in my presence; I saw all the spoons at the Magistrates about a week after</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Hill.) Q. This man was a perfect stranger to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have been in the parlour; about a minute perhaps? - A. I should think it must be more.</p>
               <p>Q. And from this momentary observation will you venture to swear that he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>

            , sworn. - I am a butcher; as I sat in my own counting-house, I saw a man get in at Mr. Gunnell's window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the window before? - A. No; I live facing the end of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of railing was there before the window? - A. A wooden railing; plain at the top, without any spikes; after the man was gone in at the window, I immediately saw Champness cross the street; I have known him many years before; he leaned with his arm upon the rails, while the other got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know enough of the room, to say, whether a person standing at the window could see into the room? - A. Yes; all over the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Champness or the other man, before he got in at the window? - A. I saw Champness (it might be eight or ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before, I believe) with the other man, for there had been an alarm before; in consequence of that, knowing Champness, I looked out, and saw Hill get in at the window, and Champness standing against a wall opposite, belonging to Doctor Swaby; I then ordered my man to go and assist, that my neighbours might not be robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not know any thing of Hill before this day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And how long might you have seen him on that day? - A. I never saw him in my life, to my knowledge; I did not see his face then.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Harrison; I was desired by my master to knock at Mr. Gunnel's door, to prevent their being robbed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110073"></xptr>but I did not like to do it, because there were two of them; I went down College-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of either of them before? - A. I had seen Hill before, I did not know Champness; he was then standing at the rails; that is the man (pointing to him); Hill came out at the door just as I got to the house, he was in a snuff coloured coat, that is the man; Champness moved from the rails when Hill came out.</p>
               <p>Q. How near together did they walk down the street? - A.Within a few yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they speak to each other? - A. That I cannot say; I followed them; Mr. Wilkinson took hold of Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body take hold of Champness? - A. Yes, Mr. Wilkinson, and let Hill go in consequence of a blow he received from Champness; I took hold of Hill, and held him till I got some assistance, and brought him back to Mr. Gunnell's house; in running after Hill, I left them taking care of Champness; as I was going after Hill, I saw him throw some property away; I was within a few yards of him in Bennet's-yard, going out of Tuston-street; he chucked it over some palings; I did not see what it was that he threw away; I went back to look after the property, and could not find it; in about half an hour, or less, Mrs. Sherry brought some property to Queen-square; I cannot say what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have told my Lord, that you saw Hill throw away something? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always told the same story? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from the prosecutor's house? - A. About a quarter of a mile, or not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not lose fight of him? - A. Yes, just where he turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell the officer, that you did not see him throw any thing away? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. She was not out of your fight at all before she brought in? - A. No, she was not; she gave it to me, and I gave it to her again; I looked to the top of the yard, and heard a man cry out, help; I thought it was but a joke; I went up the yard, and met Finch, coming down; he had left the prisoner, Hill, at the top of the yard, with the constable, and asked my wife for the spoon, and gave it to Finch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken such notice of the spoon as to say, that the spoon your wife gave you, was the same you had given her? - A. I dare say it was, but I took no particular notice of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Finch gave you these spoons? - A. I am positive of it; I took Hill to Mr. Gunnell's and from there to Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Finch). Did you give the last witness the spoons? - A.

               <p>Hill's defence. I was coming through College-street, and saw a number of people, and enquired what was the matter; they told me, there had been a house robbed; when I heard that, I went away about my business, and they followed me, and took me and Champness to Queen-square office.</p>

               <p>JAMES ARDEN. I am fourteen years old, and live in Great Ogle-street, Fitzroy-square, with my father, who is a brewer. On the 7th of July I was coming along the <placeName id="t18260914-44-crimeloc258">New-cut, near the tunnel</placeName>

I refused, but said, I would shew him what it was o'clock, if he stood two or three yards off - but he said, "No, we can't see if we stand so far;" and after a little time, I was pulling my watch out - I had got it quite out of my fob, and held it tight, but he got hold of the chain, and wrenched it from me; I said, "No larks," and he handed it to Tonks, who was about a yard off, and I saw no more of it; Mann was talking to them - they were altogether, not half a yard from each other - the three went away; Tonks remained behind, and said, "If you come under the bridge I will try and find your watch for you." I had said nothing to him - I was crying, but said nothing about my watch - I said, I would not go; some boys came round, at last two bakers came, and Tonks was detained; the other three were then out of sight; when Sanderwick gave him the watch, I thought I saw him put it into the flap of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. How long were you with them? A. About five minutes; Mann and Sanderwick were apprehended in about a fortnight - I was certain of them; I think they had been in the water, for Mann was putting his stockings on, and sitting about half a yard from the other two; he had every thing but his shoes and stockings on, and by the time they got the watch, I suppose he was ready to receive it; he went away as soon as he was dressed - he was in the water when I first went up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mann go away alone? A. He went with the stranger - I do not know whether he saw the watch taken - he was sitting down - I did not see him in the water; the watch was my father's - I had worn it twelve months; the seal, chain, and key, were mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner TONKS. Q. Where did I stand? A. By the side of the Cut, talking to the two prisoners; I am certain I saw the watch in your hand; if you were on the bridge, it must have been before you came up.</p>

            . I am eleven years old, and know Arden. On the 7th of July, I saw the prisoners and another, by the Cut; Sanderwick stopped Arden, and pulled his cap off; he cried for it, and Sanderwick said, if he would let him look what o'clock it was, he would give it him - he pulled it out - Sanderwick snatched it out of his hand, and gave it to Tonks, who put it into the flap of his breeches - then gave it to another boy, not in custody, and he gave it to Mann - I saw it in Mann's hands; Mann said, "Good bye, I shall see you to night;" and ran down the grove with it: Sanderwick, and the one not in custody, went away after Mann - Tonks remained, and was taken. I knew them all before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. Sitting at the top of the bridge, about five yards from them, seeing the boys bathe; Arden saw me - Mann was on the top of the bridge at first, putting his stockings on; Arden had as good an opportunity as me, of seeing what became of the watch - he was two or three yards off - I do not know whether he saw it; I ran into the grove, and saw Mann put it into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is an act made long since for the protection of labouring people especially, who are necessitated to leave their dwellings in the day time, and it makes it capital for any person to break into a dwelling house in the day time, no person being therein, and to steal therein to the value of five shillings; but as this act of Parliament was made a century ago, that which a century ago was of the value of five shillings, should rather be considered in a case like this, and in favour of life, than what we value at five shillings now: and if you are of that opinion, you may find this prisoner guilty of stealing to the value of 4 s. 10 d. which will acquit him of the capital part of the indictment.</p>

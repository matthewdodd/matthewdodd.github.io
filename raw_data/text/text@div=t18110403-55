               <p>Q. Was she one of the three women that stopped you in Fleet-street - A. I cannot positively say, I believe the watchman can. There were three of them.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my box is against the large china manufactory in Fleet-street, my beat leads into Bride-lane. I went down Bride-lane calling the hour of one, and returning back I saw Mr. Dodd, and I saw three ladies, whom I knew perfectly well, Smith, Powell, and another; Mr. Dodd appeared to me to be wanting to pass along, two of them had got him up against the shutter, I ordered them to disperse.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the two that had got him up against the shutter - A. Powell, and the one that is not here. This was about two doors from Bride-lane. Smith was standing just at the corner of Bride-lane, against the post, and as this gentleman extricated himself from the other two she laid hold of him as he passed along; he appeared to me to wish to extricate him to pass; she is a lusty woman, and he a slight man; she was too powerful for him, she pushed him down Bride-lane, and was followed by Powell; when he got five or six paces down Bride-lane he called out watch, I have lost my watch. I kept following them down, I expected to be given charge of them; he pursued them untill he got to the corner of a passage that leads into Bridge-street, there he secured her, and I took her in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other woman with her - A. Powell was the only person that passed down Bride-lane, she passed them and kept running along, never stopped, but went into Bridge-street; she was taken into custody by a watchman, upon hearing the cry of stop her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch ever found - A. No, not as I know off; the watchman that took her in custody took her down to the watchhouse, he knew nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Powell before - A. I knew her person very well, and I knew Smith perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not know the prosecutor before, did you - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. This was one o'clock in the morning - A. I dare say it was half past one at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes you have seen young men in the street freshish at that hour - A. I have, too many of them, it did not appear to me that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe that the watch has never been found - A. I do believe that the prosecutor, nor any person here knows any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Your watch had a chain and seals to it - A. Yes. I never found them again.</p>

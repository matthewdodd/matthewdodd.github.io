On the 28th of February, when my husband got up in the morning at six o'clock, he found the wash-house door open; he called me- I went down, and found the door open, and this linen taken from the tub. I take in washing; I had locked the door at half-past twelve o'clock at night, when I went to bed. I went to Worship-street, where, I was informed, the linen was at Mr. Smith's, Kingsland-road; I went there, and saw Jones - the prisoners were then in custody.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I met Swaine, in Union-street, on Thursday morning, the 28th of February, when I was coming off watch; he saw me and crossed the road; I let him go on, and saw a pail on his shoulder, with something white over it. I turned back, and asked him what he had got there; he said what was that to me; I said, I insisted upon his telling me - he said it was wet linen, which he was going to carry to his aunt's, to dry; I said, what number was it; he said it was in some court; he could not tell the name, but he would show me - I then took him to the officers.</p>

I went there, and found Burgins, in his room, putting on his clothes; I asked him where a lad they call Snoozer was, he said he had not seen him for some time; I looked, and found this shirt in a blue apron, under the bed.

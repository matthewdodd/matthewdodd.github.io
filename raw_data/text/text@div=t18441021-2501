               <p>the prisoner came and asked me if I could supply him with steel pens and metal spoons—he said he had got a customer for them—I told him I had such articles I could supply him with—he said he had not got the money in his pocket, but if I would send somebody with him, or go myself, I could have the money directly—he selected seventy-seven gross of steel pens and metal spoons, nine gross of pen-holders, and some pencil-leads, worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told my lad to take them, and bring the money or the goods back again—they went out together from the warehouse, and the prisoner said he would not be long, he would be back perhaps in ten minutes—when he went out from the shop he said, "It is not a great way, it is only ten minutes' walk"—I expected the lad back in half an hour—he did not come back for five or six hours, and then he came back without any money or pens, but he brought back one parcel, which contained the spoons—I did not see the prisoner afterwards till he was in custody—I recognised him as the same man—I cannot recollect that I had ever known him before—he had only been in my place at the time he bought the goods—he did not tell me the place where he was going to take the pens, nor his own name—he said my father-in-law knew him well, and that he lived in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields—I asked him, "What name can I mention to my father-in-law, if I see him?"—he said, "De Cauder"—he said he expected to sell the goods to a captain that wanted to be off directly—I gave my boy directions not to let the prisoner have the goods without the money—I whispered that low, not to let the prisoner hear it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the prosecutor. On the day in question I was directed by my master to go with the prisoner, and to bring either the goods back or the money—there were two parcels—the prisoner was present when I was told to take the goods—I heard the prisoner say he expected to sell the goods to a captain of a ship, and if my master would send a perspn, or go himself, directly he got to the captain he should have the money, and it was not above ten minutes' walk—my master said to the prisoner that I should go with him, and receive the money—I went with the prisoner, and he took me as far as the Thames-tunnel, to Mr. Walker's, a ship-cable maker, and asked them to allow me to stop there whilst he went to Frost and Sheedey's—he then said to me, "You had better go in and wait till I come back"—I went in, and the prisoner went away, and took with him one of the parcels, containing the pens—I asked the young man who he was—he said he knew nothing of him, but he came there to sell lamp<lb></lb>cottons and steel pens—I did not wait at Walker's above five minutes—I then went to Frost and Sheedey's, but did not see the prisoner there—the prisoner had the parcel with the steel pens in it almost all the way—directly I got out of my master's door, he said, "The two parcels will be too heavy for you," and he took the one with the pens—I did not see him again till he was taken into custody at his own residence, in North-street, Commercial-road—I waited at Frost and Sheedey's till past four o'clock, and I gave information in Wapping—I afterwards went to the prisoner's house with the policeman, and when the policeman knocked at the door I saw the prisoner's wife, but the prisoner was within hearing—I saw him in the kitchen, through the grated window, at supper—the policeman spoke to the prisoner's wife at the door, and I should think the prisoner heard what she said—she said, "What do you want of him?" and shut the door in the policeman's face—I do not know that she said whether the prisoner was at home—a candle was fetched, and the prisoner came out of the passage of the next house, and was running away—we fol<lb></lb>lowed him—he went into the house of a baker in Back Church-lane, and there he was taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose these parcels were heavy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were—I was glad to let the prisoner have one of them—my master made out the bill—I do not know that he put down the name—I only saw the bill lying on the counter—I saw the prisoner take it up—my master told me that I was to bring back the money, and of course he told the prisoner so—it is not likely that he should let the goods go without the money—it was by my master's direc<lb></lb>tion that I went to the prisoner's house on the day he was taken.</p>

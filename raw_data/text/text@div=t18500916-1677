                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, L</hi> 21). On 20th Aug., sergeant Wright made a communication to me, and I went into a public-house and saw four men—he pointed out two who he said had committed a robbery; the prisoner was one—I took hold of him on one side, and Wright on the other, and two policemen took charge of the other man—Wright said, "I want you on sus<lb></lb>picion of a highway robbery"—on the sill of the door the prisoner said, "I will not go further unless you tell me what it is"—Wright said, "I want you on suspicion of a robbery"—he said, "I will see you b—g—d before I will go with you; you shall not take me"—he immediately threw Wright down in the kennel—I fell with him—he was very violent, and kicked me several times—I remained on the ground about a minute and a half—he threw me down repeatedly on the road to the station—when we got opposite the stage-door of the Victoria Theatre, he struck me on the back of my head with a life-preserver—I recovered myself, and received another blow on the forehead from him, and fell senseless—I know nothing more—I found myself in a doctor's shop—the skin was broken—I am labouring under the effect of it now—I am not able to do duty now.</p>

On 15th Aug., I received information that Alfred Greenland had been knocked down and robbed—I made inquiry, and apprehended Davis, who was convicted yesterday (<hi rend="italic">see last case),</hi> and the prisoner, on a charge of being concerned in it—my inquiry fixed suspicion upon him—on 20th Aug., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went in private clothes to the Olive Branch, Waterloo-road, with sergeant Jones, and two police<lb></lb>men in uniform—we found the prisoner there—I told him I wanted him on sus<lb></lb>picion of being concerned in a robbery, and he must go with me to the station—Jones then laid hold of one hand, and I of the other—after we got out, he said, "Oh, it is you, Mr. Wright, is it?" (I had seen him before)—he said he would see me b—before he would go to the station, and began to be very violent—I was sent on my back in the gutter, and the other two on the top of me—I received several kicks from the prisoner, and he struck me several times—I got up, and saw him strike Sergeant Jones with a life-preserver twice, the last time was over the eye—he ran away, brandishing the life-preserver—I saw blood running down Jones's face—I ran after the prisoner—he knocked me down senseless with the life-preserver, and got away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Sewell, a surgeon, of 59, Lower Marsh, Lambeth.

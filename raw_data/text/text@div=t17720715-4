I was alarmed in the morning on the 3d of July, and the prisoner was stopt in the yard with the things mentioned in the indictment upon her; they are my uncle's property. My business is to assist the graziers with their cattle; I got up early and saw the prisoner following a boy out of the fields; she said she came there to help an acquaintance to move off some things; then I saw these goods lying inside the gate against the wall; she said they were her acquaintance's; I said if they were, they should not be removed till day light; I ordered them to be carried into the house; I turned about something else, and did not lock the door: when I thought of it, I sent somebody to lock the door, and they met the prisoner taking off the things. (The goods produced, and deposed to by Odell, to be the property of the prosecutor.)</p>

            . I live next door but one to the prosecutor's house. I heard a noise in the yard, and I saw the prisoner come over the wall, which adjoins to my house, and divides a skittle ground from Mr. Oldstock's; there are some pales which are easily got over; she had a quart saucepan in her hand; when she was coming over, I said, where are you going? she said, never matter you, they are my own. About ten minutes after that, there was an alarm that she had stole some things; I got up and found it was the same woman that I saw coming over the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Carmen in the employment of Mr. Thomas Hawley, and live in Gibbon's-rents, Tooley-street. On the 6th of May I had a wagon laden with twelve barrels of sugar—I had received it at the East India Docks, and was going up Ratcliff-cross—a man met me and told me about my mate being in trouble, (I was aware that a fellow-servant of mine was coming up the Commercial-road with a cart)—I was indiscreet enough to leave my wagon, and go to the King's arms—I did not find my fellow-servant there—I came back, and my wagon was gone—I met the prisoner in an empty van near where u had left my wagon—I asked him if he had seen the wagon—he said he thought he had, up the Commercial-road—I went, and found the wagon in a street—eight barrels only were left in it out of the twelve—I afterwards noticed the prisoner, in the same van I had seen him in before, driving in a direction from the wagon—he had four barrels of sugar in the van—I called out to him, he began to roll the barrels out of van into the street, jumped</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bluegate-fields, Ratcliff-highway. I saw the prisoner driving a wagon with two grey horses, that day, up White Horse-lane, Stepney, about six o'clock—the horses stopped where I worked—there were twelve barrels of sugar in the wagon—I am sure the prisoner was the person—another man came up and kicked the horses—they had not got a whip—they took the check-rein off the horses, and hit them with that.</p>

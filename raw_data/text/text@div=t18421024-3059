                  </hi>. I am servant to Caroline Banks, of No. 2, Stafford<lb></lb>shire-place, Old Kent-road, in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford. On the 27th of September, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went up stairs, leaving the plate basket in the kitchen cupboard, and the kitchen window down, but not fastened—I came down in about twenty minutes—the kitchen window was then wide open, and the plate basket gone—it con<lb></lb>tained the articles stated—I saw the property again in the course of the day at Union Hall.</p>

On the 27th of September, between nine and ten o'clock, Mr. Beaver called my attention to the two prisoners—Moulden had a basket with him—I could not see what was in it—they went over a field, towards London—I followed, and when I got into the Kent-road I was before them—I walked towards London, and looked out for a policeman—they followed me a short distance—when they came to the canal-bridge they met two more boys, who joined them—I continued walking till I got to the Green Man—I there saw a constable, and told him what I had observed, and saw him take the two prisoners and one of the others into custody.</p>

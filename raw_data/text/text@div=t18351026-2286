                  </hi>. I am a constable of St. James's, Clerkenwell. On the 19th of September I went to New-street, New-cut, Lambeth<lb></lb>Duke, Hall, and Ashton were with me—I arrived a little before four o'clock in the afternoon, and observed a female knocking at the door of No. 1—the door was opened by Carman—I rushed into the passage and was collared by Carman, who screamed out violently—Duke followed me in immediately—I released myself from Carman and went up staris, and in going up I had occasion to pass by the back parlour door—I observed the prisoner Jenkins called Thomas Field in the back parlour in his shirt sleeves, and at the top of the staris was Sophia Jenkins, who had nothing on but her shift—she said, "My God, what is the matter?"—she went into the bacje room first floor, on to a bed which was lying on the floor, and wrapped a blanket round her—I went into the front room, first floor, and seeing no one there, I ran down stairs, hearing a noise in the back yard—I met Ashton as I was com<lb></lb>ing down the stairs, and we both ran into the yard together—I found Car<lb></lb>man in the yard then, and nobody else—I saw two crown pieces lying on the stones in the yard, and two in the water-tub—I requested Ashton to pick them up, which he did, and in a small drain, near the water-butt, having a little clear water in it, I observed through the water a crown-pieco—I put my arm down the drain and took it up—this is it—I then went into the back parlour, and found Hall and Duke and the two male prisoners, (Field and the boy Jenkins)—on a chair in the room, I found a small file containing white metal in the teeth, also a paper band with a small portion of plaster of Paris on it—Duke in my presence proceeded to search the room, and while he was doing so, the boy F.T. Jenkins was very violent, screaming out "Murder!" dreadfully—Field was standing in one cor<lb></lb>ner of the room with his hancuffs on him—while Duke was searching the female prisoner, Sophia Jenkins put her hand in through the window, which was open, and seized hold of something which Duke had laid down on the chair—Duke laid hold of her hand and endeavoured to get it from her, but did not succeed—at that moment Field sprang from the corner at which he was standing, and seized at Duke with the handcuffs on—that prevented Duke from getting hold of what Sophia Jenkins had—I laid hold of Field by his hand and pulled him back, and afterwards took away Field and the boy Jenkins in a coach which I had waiting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-segeant. I went on the 19th of September, in company with Duke, Hall, and Reynolds, to No.1, New Cut, Lambeth—I arrived there about a quarter to four o'clock—I saw the door of the house opened—Reynolds went in first—Duke and I pushed in together and Reynolds was in the passage with Carman—I pushed by him, and saw a man, with his coat off, endevouring to get over the wall in the yard—that was Field—I heard something like money falling—there was nobody else in the yard—Duke and I prevented his getting over the wall I—afterwards looked about the yard, and found two crown-pieces lying on the pavement in the yard, and these two crown-pieces were in the water-butt, close to where Field was endeavouring to get over the wall—I saw Reynolds take a crown-piece out of the drain—I afterwards looked over the wall, being certain there was more money, I got over the wall, and found this bag with coin it it, and some coins spread about the yard—I collected them all into the bag—there were 49 shillings, 10 hals-crowns and 2 crown-pieces, one of them unfinished—as I was taking the money up, I heard a great noise next door, and was desired to come and I ran round the adjoining house into No. 1, to assist the officers—I went into the back parlour, and Field was given into my custody—Hall and I took him in a coach—Hall brought the boy Jenkins to the coach, and we took them both to Clerkenwell station-house—a man named Cooper went into the passage of No.1 with us—he staid there for a short time—when we were in the coach with Field the boy was crying and Field said, "Be a good boy and be quiet"—I said, "Is he your boy?"—he said "I shall answer no questions"—I said he need not without h e liked—about a minute after<lb></lb>wards, without saying amy more, he said, "No, it is not my boy' I dare say you know that, from where you got your information"—I observed Field's left hand was very black in the coach as if he had been working at the fire, and he kept rubbing it on his trowsers—I said "You are taking a great deal of pains to get that stuff off your hands"—he said "What stuff? I don't know what you mean."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Field's Defence.</hi> In the first place—at Hatton-garden, nothing was sworn about my being seen in the room below stairs till I was brought there by the officers—I was taken handcuffed from the yard to the room—I had called at the house twenty minutes before to visit Sophia Jenkins, and stopped there, as she was ill—I formerly lived with her—I slept there once or twice a week then—I had left her, and came down stairs to go to the business of my master, who is unable to attend here—I was taken; and othere witnesses I might have had here, may not come, understanding the Mint cases would not be tried till Friday morn<lb></lb>ing—my landlord would have been here, had he due notice of the case—I will next observe, that, while in the water-closet, the prisoner Jenkins (who will acknowledge I was there, and merely came to visit her)—She heard there was something amiss, and called to me to let me escape—I have sur<lb></lb>fered from something of this sort before—I declare I was never in eighter of the lower rooms—the landlord of the house was summoned to give evidence at the office; and when called on, he said he was the rent-gatherer, and that only Smith and his wife had taken the house—they said, "Look round, and see if you can see Smith"—he looked round, and said, "I do not see him"—the Magistrate asked him to look at the prisoner, if that was him—he said, "No, I decidedly not; it was a bigger man than him"—he said, "Don't you think it possible that might be him?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I beg your pardon, your Worship, I hope you don't want the man to swear to me"—the Magistrate said, "Silence, Sir; pur your hat on; don't interrupt the witness;" and I put my hat on, but he could not identify me—I declare my innocence of having been in eighter of the lower rooms, or having possession of the coin.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 43, New York-street, Bethnal-green. The prisoner field lived in my house for 12 or 15 months, as near as I can recollect—I do not know who he worked for—I remember this Saturday, the 19th of September—he did not come home to dinner that day—I have known him longer than the time he lodged with me—he bore an honest character.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did the prisoner first come to lodge at your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 12 or 15 months since, but I am not certain to a day, as he always paid me every Saturday—I do not know how he got his live<lb></lb>lihood, only as a mechanic—he came in a mechanic's dress—I had heard he worked somewhere near whitechapel, but where, I never knew—I don't know any of his friends.</p>

               <p>Whitechapel; but I don't wish to bring the young man's name in the way who employed me, as it might injure him—he is an upholsterer—I had gone over to Webber-row on business for him, and visited Jenkins, she being ill at the time—I laid down there, which may account for my being in my shirt sleeves—I staid about a quarter of an hour with her, and went down to the privy—a messenger had arrived from a house where Mr. Powell knows an apprehension had taken place, about an hour before, and the policemen had to go to Rosoman-street with the prisoners they took, and then came over the water to the New Cut, during which time there were popportunities for parties to convey intelligence to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, who could have made their escape, and left the articles as they were found.</p>

I did not know the prisoner till the 12th of October, when I met him in the Commercial-road, as I was going to Stanley-street - as I returned, I saw him again; he showed me a watchchain, and asked me to buy it - I said I had no money. and asked him to let me see it; he showed me the seals and ring: I went along towards the Docks, and went on board for about half an hour - I then came ashore, and he was by the Dock-gate; he walked with me half-way up the road, and kept asking me to buy it - I said I would not, unless he went into a goldsmith's shop, that I might know the value; he refused, and said I should get him into trouble; I said if he would go to my captain, I would buy it - he would not: he then said it was worth 20l.; I said I would not buy it; he then asked if I would buy a a watch; I said, "Where is it?" he said, "Come round the corner," and then said, "Have you any money?" I pulled out a sovereign, and said, "Here is my money, where is your watch?" he snatched the sovereign from me, threw the chain at me, and ran off - I followed him, but two women who were there stopped me; I got from them, and White stopped the prisoner without my losing sight of him - he then said, "Here is your sovereign; say no more about it" - White would not let me do so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time was it? A. About two o'clock- I gave him the sovereign about four; I saw no watch - I had money, although I said I had none - I said nothing about my mate - I did not tell him to wait for me - the chain and seals are only gilt - I did not ask a gentleman if they were gold - he would follow me - I could not get rid of him.</p>

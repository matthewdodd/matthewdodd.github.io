               <p>MRS. HERBRETCHER. I am wife to the last witness. The prisoner lived with me, we expected her to stay longer with us; but she left. There was no quarrel. She went away on the Saturday to see her friends, and we expected her to return on the Monday, but she never came; and that raised our suspicion. In consequence we searched, and found missing, a silk gown, value four pounds, a cotton gown, value ten shillings, two pair of stockings, value four shillings, three neckcloths, value two shillings, a dimity pocket, value one shilling, and one cotton apron, value one shilling and sixpence. I saw part of these things, on the Sunday before the prisoner came. The next time I saw the prisoner was accidently, last Sunday in Brick-lane. When we went to her lodgings, we did not find her, when we met her, we charged her with stealing the property, she told us, it was deposited at two pawnbrokers; and gave us their names, and places of abode. She told us the duplicates were destroyed. We found the silk gown, the dimity pocket, and one or two other things.</p>

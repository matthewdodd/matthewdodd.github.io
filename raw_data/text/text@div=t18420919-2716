                  </hi>. I am assistant to Thomas Buckland, a linen-draper, in High-street, Shoreditch. About five o'clock in the evening of the 19th of September, I saw Kelly and Curtin standing opposite our shop door, looking towards the rolls of flannel, which were placed in a rack by the door—I went to the door, and they passed on—about half-past seven I</p>

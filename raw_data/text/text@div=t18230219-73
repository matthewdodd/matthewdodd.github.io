            . I am a constable. I was at the pit door. There was a cry, and I stopped the prisoner; the prosecutor charged him stealing his watch, and gave charge of him. As I took him across Great Russell-street, he slipped from me, and ran under the coaches, down different streets, to the Olympic theatre, where he was taken. I lost sight of him for three minutes, but have no doubt of him. On the Thursday afterwards, the watch was brought to me by a person belonging to the theatre.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Bexley-heath. I went to the Crown and Masons' Arms, at Woolwich, on the 7th of March—I went into the tap-room between three and four o'clock—I remained there till between seven and eight o'clock, but was not drinking all the time—I had a leather purse with me, with a half-crown and three shillings in it, and some papers—I had taken it out to take a shilling out of it, about five o'clock, and I left 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—the two prisoners came in while I was there—they sat at the other end of the room, and then stood before the fire, and after that Williams came and sat by the side of me—I cannot say at what time that was—there was no clock in the room—I had a quartern of gin and peppermint—I put my hand to feel for my purse, and could not find it—I think it was then between five and six o'clock—that was about an hour after I had put the purse into my pocket—Charlotte Wheeler had been sitting by me—I was quite sober—the purse has not been found, but the constable found some money.</p>

            's family; we were out of town, and these spoons of mine mentioned in the indictment, were left in a chest of drawers, they were all in a paper rolled up together; the shoes mentioned were in one of the drawers, I cannot say whether it was the same drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go out of town?</p>
               <p>Decima Davis. I went out in May and returned in October. I left the drawers locked when I went out, and found them so when I came home. Upon missing a petticoat, in searching about I missed several other things, and amongst them the spoons, a pair of shoes, and a gauze handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose drawers were the spoons in?</p>
               <p>Decima Davis. They were in Sir James's drawers, but I had the use of them. The spoons produced in court and deposed to.</p>

            's house: The spoons mentioned were missing; and the prisoner had not been strictly honest; we suspected her, so she was the first we searched; I took out of her pocket the spoons here produced, and then went and searched her box, and found a pair of satin shoes and a gauze handkerchief, the property of the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I took the spoons out of the drawer to look at them out of curiosity; but hearing people in the next room, surprized me, and I was obliged to put them in my pocket; as to the shoes and handkerchief I know nothing about them.</p>

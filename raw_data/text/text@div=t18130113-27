I missed a cask of butter. From information I ran up Miles's-lane, and I overtook the prisoner with the cask of butter on his shoulder. He threw the cask off his shoulder, and ran off. Messrs. Reynolds and Coventry's man followed him and caught him. I picked the butter up.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Reynolds and Coventry, cheesemongers, Thames-street. I overtook the prisoner at the top of Miles's-lane. He had a firkin of butter on his shoulder, in a bag. I asked him, what he had got on his shoulder. I took him back to my master's house, and gave him in charge of the constable.</p>
               <p>- HAWKINS. I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner. This is the tub the butter was in; there was fifty-six pounds.</p>
               <p>Grigg. That is the firkin; it was in my charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg for mercy. I am very sorry for what I have done. I never will be guilty of any thing of the kind any more so long as I live. Distress brought me to this bad way of life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Edward Lindsey, who lives at No. 14, Mornington-crescent, Hampstead-road—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Pancras. On Saturday evening, the 4th of June, at a quarter before six o'clock, there was a ring at the door—I opened it, and the prisoner appeared—he said he came for a bonnet to be cleaned—I asked him inside, went up, and asked my mistress—she said he had made a mistake—I went down again, and the prisoner was on the mat, where I had left him—I said he had made a mistake—he said he was sorry he had given me the trouble—I opened the door, and he went off—the plate-basket was about four yards from where he stood—there were a dozen forks in it, and the sugar-tongs, when I left it—when he was gone I looked at it again—nine forks and the tongs were gone—they were worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—no one could have taken them but him—I have not seen them since.</p>

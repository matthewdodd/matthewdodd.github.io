               <p>Whether you was not distinctly asked before the lord mayor, whether you would venture to swear, whether this might not have been in his pocket when he went up stairs the second time? - I say it could not be in his pocket.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you was before the lord mayor? - Near about a week. He was a steady man, had not been drinking; we had three pots of beer among four.</p>

            , Constable. I was going my Rounds with my Watchman about one o'Clock, and going down Vandelow's-Alley , it is on Ludgate hill , one Part comes to Fleet ditch. I saw the Prisoner lie upon the Ground, so drunk that she could not stand: Being informed she had dropped some Money, I asked her if it was her's; she owned that she had dropped thirty Guineas, and two half Guineas , and some small Matters beside: She said it was her Money, and made a De of it. Says I, it is necessary, as you keep a orderly House , to go before a Magistrate, to know how you came by this Money. I had her Alderman Arnold, - it was Michaelmas Day She was in several Stories, so he committed to the Compter: By his Direction I advertised it and the next Day

                  </hi>. I am a seaman. I was out of employ on Tuesday morning, the 4th of November—I went into the White Swan public-house, Ratcliffe-highway, to look for a person, about nine o'clock in the morning—I was quite sober—I had drank a little over-night, but had been to bed; and I was rather sick in the morning—I had a smock-frock in my bosom, which the prisoner took—I never saw her before—I asked her if she knew a person who had robbed me the night before—she took me out to find her—I was leaning my head over the fire-place—she snatched the smock-frock out of my bosom, and ran away with it—I lost her; but found her again in a public-house, and asked her for the frock—she said she had pawned it, and would not give me the ticket—I got a policeman, and gave charge of her—I had taken no liberties with her.</p>

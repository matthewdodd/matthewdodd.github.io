                  </hi>. I am wharf-clerk to Mr. Conrad Nohlgemuth, a coal<lb></lb>merchant at Crow's-nest Wharf, Lower East Smithfield—he had a barge called the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, at Hereford-stairs, on the 16th of Feb.—the coals in it were his property—there were about three tons in one room of the barge, and some Holy well coals in another room—I have examined the coals produced by the officers, and believe them to be my master's—I missed about half a ton from the barge.</p>

At half-past six in the morning, on the 16th of Feb, I was on duty, and saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners alongside the barge <hi rend="italic">William</hi>; one of them was in the barge, but I could not see which, and the other was in the boat—I made towards them, as soon as they saw me, the one in the barge jumped into the boat, and they rowed away—I followed, and got into their boat, and asked where they got the coals that were in their boat—there were about 224lbs. of coals there—they said they got them from a barge alongside the tier—but they had no business to take them from there—I went alongside the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, and in No. 2 room I found a basket and shovel—that was the room which the coals they had seemed to have come from—I compared the coals in their boat with those in the barge—they appeared to correspond in every respect, as near as I could judge—supposing them to have been taken from the plugs of a barge, as they said they had, they must have been wet, and they were quite dry, like those in the barge.</p>

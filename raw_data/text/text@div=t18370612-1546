On Friday, the 17th of February, I left home at four o'clock in the afternoon, leaving my lodgers in the house, but nobody in my own apartments—I occupy the two parlours and let out the rest—I locked them both up when I went out—the street door is always shut—it was on the latch, and cannot be opened outside without a latch-key—I re<lb></lb>turned about ten o'clock, and went to bed without noticing any thing—about twelve o'clock next morning I had occasion to go to my drawers in the back room, and missed two boxes—(one of which had jewellery in it,) and my watch which laid by the side of it—the other box contained an eye-glass, a certificate of my marriage, and memorandums—I had seen the boxes not five minutes before I went out the day before, when I took two rings out of one—I also lost a silver tea-spoon off the mantel-piece in the same room, which I had seen about twelve o'clock the day before—I had not been out of the house between twelve and four o'clock—I might have been down</p>

               <p>robbery was committed, in the same house as Mrs. Baker—on a Satur<lb></lb>day afternoon, to the best of my recollection, between four and five monthe ago, I saw the prisoner and Brockley together—I was in my own room, and Mrs. Baker called me out—I went into her room, and she took the basket off her sister's arm—she opened it, and there was a lot of little jewellery in it—and a watch which Mrs. Brockley wore round her neck with a chain—in the box was an eye-glass, a tobacco stopper, and a silver teaspoon—the watch was on her neck when she came in—I did not see it taken outof the basket—there were some brooches, but I cannot say how many, and a pair of cornelian ear-rings in the little box—I went into my own apart<lb></lb>ment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mrs. Baker, and live with her—she gets her living by washing and needle-work, or anything she can get to do—I work at book-folding. On Tuesday, (the 21st of February, I believe,) I received a chain from my aunt—I was at home on the Saturday morning when she came with the prisoner, but I did not see the basket, as I went away—I was not at home all day—I was out from nine o'clock in the morning till half past seven o'clock in the evening—I kept the chain some time, but one morning I missed it, and my mother told me she had pawned it—I have since seen it at Bow-street, when I was examined—the snap and locket attached to it are mine—I put it on the chain, and it was on when I saw it last—I did not take it off—I took the snap off which was on the chain when it was given to me, as it was broken, and I put on one of my own—I gave the one I took off to Soper, the officer, on the 27th, when he asked me for it—I do not remember seeing my mother with any ear-rings. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE CURTIS</hi>. I am shopman to Mr. How, a pawnbroker. I have a pair of ear-rings which were pawned on the 22nd of February at our shop, with a pin, by Brockley or her sister, in the name of Baker—they were re<lb></lb>deemed on the 27th of March, and the ear-rings pledged alone the same day, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have a chain and locket which were pawned on the 30th of March, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—here are the duplicates.</p>

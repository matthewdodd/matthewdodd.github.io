On Tuesday morning, 8th Sept., I was aroused about ten minutes past four o'clock, my wife got up first—I followed her towards the back-yard—she opened the yard door, and I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners in the yard—they wanted to rush in at the door, but my wife put her hand on them, and said, "What do you want here?"—from the back of my yard to the back of Mr. Chance's is six or seven yards—my wife screamed, and I went out and collared them—Adams said, "For God's sake let me come through; we have not come here to rob you, nor do you any injury; we only knocked a man down, and we want to evade the police"—I said, "If that is all you have done you need not be so much alarmed; but perhaps you have killed the man, and therefore I shall detain you till I ascertain the truth of it"—I took them into the passage, and told my wife to go for a constable—Wilson begged to be let go.</p>

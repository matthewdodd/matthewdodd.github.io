               <p>I lodge in Mr. Day's house, on the 26th of December last I went to work about one in the afternoon, I left my room door unlocked, Mr. and Mrs. Day and the prisoner were at home, he lodged in the same house, I left nobody in my room, but the door was unlocked, I came home at seven o'clock, I did not miss any till I went up stairs, which was at ten o'clock, the prisoner was not at home, then I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, when I went up stairs I found the cords of my box cut open, it was not locked only corded, I saw them in the box that morning.</p>
               <p>How came you to cord the box? - To keep it fast.</p>
               <p>What had you opened it for? - To take out a pair of stockings, I saw all the things safe then, I suspected the prisoner by his not returning any more to his lodgings, I searched after him, and found him on the 5th of May, I took him myself, I found some of the things on him when he was taken, one neckcloth and a knife, and a duplicate where he had pawned a pair of stockings and a neckcloth.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself when he was taken up, and these things were found upon him? - I took him in Holborn, he said he did not know me, I told him he had robbed me, with that he struck at me and ran off, I followed him and took hold of him again.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you took him the second time? - He struck at me again and walked along, and would not be taken by me, I walked along with him, he went into a public house and I called for a pint of beer, he ran out again, then he threw me down in the street, I got up and ran after him, the mob gathered, and I told them he had robbed me, I took him to Justice Hyde's, when we were almost there, he said he would go down to Hammersmith, he went into the necessary, and we found he had thrown a bag down there.</p>
               <p>How came you to look for the bag? - The Justice asked me if ever he had been out of my sight when I took him, I said never, but when he was in the necessary.</p>
               <p>What was in the bag? - A bible with my brother's name in it, that was the bible which I lost, I never found any of the other things, he never told where they were, nor made any confession; I went with the duplicate and found the neckcloth and stockings at one Mr. Davison's in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Court. The neckcloth that you found upon him was that yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark on it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it in court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In whose possession has it been ever since? - In the constable's.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular in the penknife? - Yes, there was a bit broke out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040077"></xptr> of the handle, I have no doubt but it was mine.</p>

               <p>Court. When the prosecutor went out, you and Mrs. Day, and the prisoner were at home? - Yes, the major part of the afternoon he spent in my company, about six or seven he left me, he had been at work for his master, as he had for a fortnight before, and he found himself ill; his master came in and asked him to go and begin a pair of breeches to be done against Friday, for a Jew wanted them; he said, he was not very well, but he would rise early in the morning, the master sat down and drank three pints of beer, and I advised him to take something warm and comfortable, and go to bed; he said, something troubles my mind, and I am not easy, he went out, I sent the lad after him, I sent him to search the privy, he said, he was not there, I went out myself, and no man was to be found.</p>

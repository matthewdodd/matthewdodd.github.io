            . Dennis gave me these to dispose of, and I did not know but they were his, and thought he would give me a Penny for my Trouble: About twelve Months ago, when my Husband was a Prisoner there, we hindered the Goal from being broke twice, and were offered five Pounds to help them to break the Goal; and I sent a Letter to Mr Akerman, to give him Notice of it.</p>
               <p>Mr Akerman being called, said, that about a Twelve-month ago, when her Husband was a Prisoner there, she did give him some Information, from her Husband, of such a Design, and believes that the Goal was prevented from being broke by that Means; and being asked how Dennis behaved, he said, he could not say that he behaved amiss.

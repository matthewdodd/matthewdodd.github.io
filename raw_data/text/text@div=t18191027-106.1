I returned to the chambers on the 23d of September, and the woman told me my nephew had been there. I was very sorry to hear it, knowing him to be a bad character; I suspected he had robbed the premises. The prisoner is my nephew. Next day on examining, I missed several books. I went immediately and found him at his mother's, I charged him with stealing them, he could not deny it. He said he had taken them, and took me to the pawnbroker's where he had pledged them. I found four books there.</p>

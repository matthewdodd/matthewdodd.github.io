A question would arise whether, under this section, the disclosure here provided for might be given in evidence under the general issue; he (Sir F. The signer) entertained a strong opinion that it might, and in fact that it must be given in evidence in that way only. He was informed that that course was not objected to on the other sick, but for better security he desired to put a special plea on the record, which should contain a statement of the disclosure made by the defendants under an examina<lb></lb>tion before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of divinity, and a Canon of Rochester Cathedral—I have had an account for some years past with the house of Snow, Paul, and Strahan—my account with that house began in Dec., 1830—at that time, I think, the firm was Snow, Paul, and Panl—afterwards, I think, it was Strahan, Paul, Paul, and Bates, and subsequently, when the late Sir John Paul died, it became, as it latterly was, Strahan, Paul, and Bates—I think the late Sir John Dean Paul died in 1853—I am not quite sure, but it was about that time certainly—from that time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220086"></xptr>
               <p>down to the bankruptcy the firm continued to be Strahan, Paul, and Bates—I was in the habit, from time to time, of employing my bankers to make investments for me—I think it was in the year 1850 that I first directed them to make an investment in the Danish 5 per cent bonds—this is my pass book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find myself debited here, on 4th Feb., 1850, with a sum of 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the purchase of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Danish 5 per cents—my practice was to give instructions for the purchase, and I think in almost all cases I received from them bought notes—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bought note referring to the purchase I have spoken of—on 16th April, 1850, I find this item in the pass book, "For 1,000 Danish 5 per cents. at 953/4, 958<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bought note that was trans<lb></lb>mitted to me with reference to the last mentioned purchase—in April, 1851, I gave them a further order to purchase similar stock for me (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is the order contained in this letter—it is dated 9th April, 1851—the postscript says, "I shall be obliged if you will purchase for me 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Danish 5 per cent bonds. J. Griffith."—that I sent to the house by the post, addressed to Messrs. Strahan, Paul, and Co.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bought note that was transmitted to me, showing the execution of that order; it is dated 10th April, 1851, the day after my letter to them—on 16th April, 1851, there is the following item in my pass book, "For 2,000 Danish bonds, at 1013/4, 2037<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the date of the bought note is the 10th—it states at the bottom of it, "Bought for the 16th instant"—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>) is a note referring to the same transaction; it is dated 16th April—there is a memorandum on it, "Bought on the 10th instant"—it is the same transaction—in that case I conclude they sent me two bought notes, one on the 10th, when the purchase was made, and one on the 16th, when it was completed; and on the 16th I am debited with the amount expressed on both these notes—those three purchases made on the whole 5,000 Danish 5 per cents.</p>

Danish stock—since the last date I have had conversation with him, and also in the presence of Mr. Straban, with regard to these particular bonds—in the first instance, with regard to the general conversation I have had with Mr. Bates, he has told me that they were quite secure in their custody, and they would take charge of them and keep them in safe custody—I am now speaking of all the bonds—but with regard to these Danish bonds, I had a special conver<lb></lb>sation, I think in the month of April, 1855, with Mr. Bates and Mr. Strahan—I can state the very date (<hi rend="italic">referring to a paper</hi>), it was on 28th April—I happened to go in on other business, and was speaking to Mr. Strahan and Mr. Bates respecting some dividends on certain shares that I possessed in a gas company, and in the course of that conversation I made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220087"></xptr>
               <p>an observation to them, that they had received my dividends upon these 5,000 Danish bonds, but that they had not received the dividends upon the gas shares which were at that time due—I spoke from what I had seen in my pass book—I had received my pass book a day or two before, and I saw that the Danish bonds were inserted, but the gas shares were not, and my object in calling upon them was to induce them to obtain the dividends upon the gas shares—the reply of Mr. Bates was, "Yes, we have, I think, received this very morning the dividends upon the gas shares, but they are not yet brought to your account, but I will go out and ascertain the fact"—this happened in an inner room, and he went out into the bank and came back saying, yes, they had been received on that very morning—I do not think anything more was said on that occasion about the Danish 5 per cents.—I know that this was on 28th April—Mr. Bates and Mr. Strahan were both present at that conversation—the dividends upon the Danish 5 per cents, have been regularly passed to my account in the pass book—the last entry is on 16th March, 1855.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the time they were first bought, up to 16th March, 1855, the dividends upon the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Danish bonds, were regularly carried to your account in the pass book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

Danish 5 per cents, 121<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

Danish 5 per cents, 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," that is the difference of income tax—that is the last item—the dividends were regularly carried to my account from the first period, down to March, 1855—I do not know that the variance in the amount arose from the difference of income tax, but I con<lb></lb>clude it was so—I took it for granted, I said nothing on the subject—I never at any time gave to the defendants or either of them any authority direct or indirect, to negotiate, pledge, transfer, or sell these securities, or in any manner to convert them to their own use or benefit—I never gave them any plea or pretext, under which they might consider themselves entitled so to act.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it that they were to do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To keep them in safe custody, and to receive the dividends and bring them to my account—what I mean is, that I never overdrew my account—I never asked them for any accommodation, or anything of that description—I never gave them any plea, upon which they could possibly dispose of these securities.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you be good enough to tell us what passed between Mr. Strahan</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220088"></xptr>
               <p>and yourself, upon that occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> May I be permitted to refer to a memorandum which I made at the time, to refresh my memory?—I made it either that evening, or the day following—(<hi rend="italic">The witness was permitted to refer to the memorandum</hi>)—perhaps I may premise that a friend of Mr. Strahan's had called upon me before he came, two friends of his indeed had called at separate times, one of them I saw—Mr. Strahan's first observe<lb></lb>tion was to this effect, that he was surprised to hear that I could obtain no information at the bank respecting my securities, for he and his partners were there constantly to give whatever information might be required—this, I believe, was in reference to the conversation which I had had with his friend—he then stated that they were engaged day and night in making up their accounts, and that if I proceeded with the legal measures I had commenced, it would be very detrimental to the creditors at large, and particularly to myself, for the securities had been so disposed of that there was no possible chance of my recovering anything of them; whereas if I abstained from those proceedings there would be a good prospect of my having them replaced or redeemed (I forget which word he used, replaced, I think it was) as both be and Sir John Paul had great expectations of receiving money hereafter, by which those securities of mine might be restored to me, and indeed, he added, they had prepared notes of hand for me, in case I should have called at the bank—he then proceeded to say that my securities had been taken by Sir John Paul himself to the City, and placed in the hands of either Over<lb></lb>end and Co. or Burland and Co., he could not tell me which, but he said that Sir John Paul was not alone to blame, that he himself was equally to blame and equally responsible for the transaction, inasmuch as it was done with his full knowledge and consent; "Indeed," said he, "I gave them to him," and immediately added, "I assure you it was the first dishonest act of my life, I never before defrauded any man of sixpence"—I asked him when this happened—he said about 6' weeks ago—he then said that the securities so disposed of amounted in value to nearly 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was speaking in that conversation of the great body of securities, not in reference merely to this 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but of the body of my securities, and in making that observation I suppose he adverted to the whole misappropriations of the bank, not merely to the whole of mine, but to others as well as mine, to the amount of nearly 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"but," he said, "yours was by far the largest amount belonging to any one individual"—I asked him, in reference to the disposal of my securities, whether some of them had not been disposed of to Messrs. Peppercorn—they are brokers that transact business generally in the purchase of these securities—he answered that he believed some of them might have been disposed of through their means—I also asked him whether my special securities, speaking generally of them, were kept in my box—I had a box there, of which they had a key and I had a key—it had only one lock—he said, no, they were not; they were kept with other securities of a similar nature, but in a parcel tied up by themselves, with my name attached to it—I think he said they were kept in a strong room—he then urged upon me the impolicy of my proceeding, and stated that many others who were similarly circumstanced with myself had been very kind to them, and begged that I would abandon the proceedings—he said that he knew the warrants were issued—this was on the very day that Mr. Bates was in custody, I think that Sir John Paul had escaped from the officers, and that the warrants were out for the apprehension of Mr. Strahan—it was on the day following the issuing of the warrants, on the Wednesday—my reply to him was this that I was not actuated by any vindictive feeling towards them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220089"></xptr>
               <p>but that I felt I had a public duty to perform; it was a duty I owed to society to proceed, and that I could not conscientiously pass over so grave an offence without continuing the proceedings—I also told him that I had placed the matter in the hands of my solicitor—I declined to stop and referred to my soli<lb></lb>citors, Messrs. Fearon, of Great George-street—his reply was, "If I go to him, he will arrest me at once"—that was the whole of the conversation—upon my declining, he said, "Very well, then, it must be so," and he took his leave.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an official assignee of the Court of Bankruptcy. I was the official assignee of the bankruptcy of the defendants—in June last an application was made to me by Messrs. Fearon and Clabon, the solicitors of Dr. Griffith, with reference to some securities of his that had been lodged with the defendants—it was made verbally, and I think there was a note also—in consequence of that application, I went to the banking house in the Strand—I there saw Mr. Strahan, and I think Mr. Bates—I think it was on the 16th—it was after the bankruptcy—the bankruptcy was on 11th June, and it was in that same week—I asked Mr. Strahan what had become of Dr. Griffith's securities—he said they were sold or pawned—my impression is that he at first merely said they would not be forthcoming; but having seen my own note, which I made immediately, I find it is, "they were either pawned or deposited," and therefore I have no doubt those were the words he used, sold or pawned—I have not the memoran<lb></lb>dum now in my possession—Mr. Strahan used the words" sold or pawned—I do not mean that he used one or other of those words, but both—he was not prepared to say whether they were sold or pawned—he said they would not be forthcoming, and that they were sold or pawned—I am not certain whether it was on that day, but I had asked if there was not a general security book, and I got no answer—I asked that question in the course of that week, either then or on a prior day—Mr. Strahan and Mr. Bates were present when I asked about the security book—no answer was made; they looked at each other, and there was no book forth<lb></lb>coming</p>

Fearon and Clabon, Dr. Griffith's solicitors, that Dr. Griffith was exceedingly anxious to learn whether or not they were safe, and I read these from this list—among other things that I read from this list there was 5,000, 5 per cent Danish bonds—Mr. Bates replied, that he could not say anything about them, or he could not say anything about them in particular; that if there were any securities, they would be in the hands of the official assignee.</p>

Danish 5 <hi rend="italic">per cents, of Dr. Griffith, bought by them, date not specified, were deposited with Overend and Co. on</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1855—<hi rend="italic">the separate statement of Sir John Dean Paul was read as follows</hi>: "25th June, 1855.

That of Mr. Bates was as follows</hi>: "The account now filed in Court contains a true account of all the securities of the customers of our firm, at any time pledged or converted by any of the partners thereof, and the particulars can be found in the banking books, namely a green stock book and ledger.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am attorney for two of the defendants, Mr. Strahan and Sir John Paul—I was first consulted by them on 22nd June—it was by my advice that this statement was prepared, acting also under the advice of counsel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you and the counsel agreed to do, what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We agreed that, inasmuch as the defendants were declared bankrupts, they should surrender under that bankruptcy, and make a statement of every transaction they had had with reference to every security.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> For what purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For the general purpose of assisting the cre<lb></lb>ditors, and for the special purpose of making a disclosure under the statute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BYLES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What took place in Court when this was done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bankrupts appeared in Court, a statement of the various securities which are now upon the file was produced to the Commissioner, and the bankrupts requested to hand it in as their statement, with reference to the securities which they had received from customers, and the manner of their disposal, not with reference to this prosecution solely, but as a general state<lb></lb>ment; upon which Mr. Commissioner Evans stated, that as no creditor had asked for them, the bankrupts were at liberty to hand them in to the official assignee if they thought fit—the statement was then handed in, with a depo<lb></lb>sition, which appears upon it—that is what has just been read—to the best of my recollection, the Commissioner signed that deposition—after that the solicitor for the fiat, Mr. Lawrence, took the depositions and the accounts out of the hand of the official assignee, and called upon each bankrupt to make a separate statement—after that voluntary deposition, if it may be so termed, Mr. Lawrence took the depositions and the accounts out of the hand of the official assignee, and then examined each bankrupt separately as to the truth of the statement contained in that account, and I think, to the best of my recollection, it was put in these words, "Is this account of all the securities that you have converted, (using not the exact terms of the Act) all the account you wish to render with reference to the disposal of these shares?"or something to that effect—I think the words are down in the depositions, because I wrote them down immediately, and the Commissioner signed it—each made a separate deposition—each answered "Yes."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the question was merely in the terms of the answer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they are mostly taken so in bankruptcy—the solicitor for the assignees asked these questions, and I reduced them into writing—after they had been so reduced into writing, they were signed by the several bankrupts, they then declared to the truth of them, and the Commissioner signed his name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You save said that this had been arranged before hand, I think when you got to the Court the first thing that was done was, Mr. Parry applied to the Commissioner on behalf of Mr. Bates, to be permitted to make a statement disclosing certain trans<lb></lb>actions which had taken place with reference to the securities deposited with the bankrupts by various persons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was an application generally on the part of the whole, it was to that purport, to be allowed to be examined.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220098"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did Mr. Parry apply for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To examine, or put in the examinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Parry apply, on behalf of the bankrupts, to be allowed to examine them with reference to these securities, and the disposition of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With reference to the statement of the securities, which he then held in his hand—the Commissioner at first said, "I refuse your application; if any creditor applies for the bankrupts to be examined, he can do so, but upon the bankrupts' own application I refuse it"—upon that, Mr. Parry said, "Then I formally tender this as the decla<lb></lb>ration of the bankrupts, and your Honour may accept it or not"—he said those words, with a great many others—he added, that under the statute they were entitled to give it in as their statement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Therefore, they claimed to be entitled to do this under the statute, and get themselves off by their own statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under the Bankruptcy Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did his Honour, on that, say, "Let them put in what they like, if they sign it"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As soon as the paper was signed, did not Mr. Parry apply to Mr. Lawrence, and ask him if he wished to put any questions to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not within my hearing or knowledge—I will not swear that did not take place, but I solemnly swear not within my hearing or knowledge, or to my belief—I will not say whether he did or did not say to Mr. Lawrence, "Do you wish to ask the bankrupts any questions?"and I will state why; I was engaged at the moment in writing down the depositions, the first one which accompanied the first petition and the account, and the Court was so crowded, and there was so much noise going on, that I really cannot under<lb></lb>take to say whether he did or not—I had not had any previous communica<lb></lb>tion with Mr. Lawrence, none whatever, except applying to him to know whether he would bring the bankrupts up, so that they might be examined at that meeting—Mr. Lawrence declined in any way to interfere or assist me, and I was obliged to apply to another Commissioner, not the one adjudi<lb></lb>cating upon the fiat, and undertake to pay the expense of bringing them up—I then communicated to Mr. Lawrence that a warrant had been granted for bringing up the bankrupts, and that was all that took place with refer<lb></lb>ence to it—the defendants were then detained in the House of Detention—I had to get a warrant to the Governor to bring them up, in order that they might surrender on the first public meeting, to make such disclosure as I thought might be beneficial in the event of a certificate meeting—at that time they were all in custody on criminal warrants upon this very matter—I believe the first joint examination before the Magistrate was on that same day; no, not the morning of the 25th; on the morning of the 22nd, which was Friday—upon that same day I applied to the Commissioner, about four o'clock in the afternoon, for a warrant to bring them up to be examined upon the Monday—it was not only for the purpose of making the disclosure—it was for that purpose amongst others—it was for the pur<lb></lb>pose of making a disclosure with reference to all the securities they had converted, and to be present at any meeting, to answer any questions which any creditor might put to them upon any subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BYLES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I need hardly ask you whether there was any understanding between yourself and Mr. Lawrence of any sort or kind what<lb></lb>ever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the most remote—I never had any conversation with him upon the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose neither Dr. Griffith nor his attorney were there,</p>

               <p>or desired to interfere? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Dr. Griffith's attorney was there—he did attempt to interfere.</p>

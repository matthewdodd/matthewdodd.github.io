               <p>Q. On the 28th of June did you lose any pigeons and ducks - A. On the 29th in the morning, a little after two, I was called by the watchman; when I came down I found the shop shutters were down, and the sash window was thrown up. On searching about there were five baskets taken out, they were in a little enclosed place next to the front of the street, they had a pair of pigeons each, all the five were gone. On coming into the shop again I discovered a basket too large to go out of the window, that basket was cut and the three ducks that were alive in the basket taken away. I came in at eleven at night, and found the shop shut up in the usual way. I did not examine the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the sash was down or not - A. I should rather suppose that it was not, on account of the heat of the weather. I did not see that any force had been used. The pin was found the same morning in the middle of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that the window shutters were up - A. Yes, I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. If they were not pinned it is possible that the shutters might be pulled out - A. They were rather loose; I might myself, by moving the shutters, take one out; I know I could. I saw the pigeons afterwards; the ducks were killed, part of the pigeons were alive.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were recovered - A. I think five, they were alive; they were here last sessions. I have sold them. I knew them and the ducks to be my own; I saw them on the 29th, between five and six. I valued the ducks at two shillings each, and the pigeons fifteen pence each.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The two persons that you took with the things you prosecuted last sessions - A. I did.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the ducks and pigeons - A. I did; the other two prisoners had put them into a hole in the field, there were three together, the prisoner was one of them. I had watched them above half an hour, sometimes one was carrying the bundle, and sometime the other. I saw them carry the bundle between the three, before they went to the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever carry it - A. Yes, it was in his possession when I first saw the bundle, and one of the pigeons was in his hand. When I came up close to him at the time, the pigeon was in his hand, the bundle was in the hole. I went up to him at the hole, and passed him, I asked him what he was going to do with it, he said he was going to toss it; Norton catched it out of the prisoner's hand, and put it into his pocket, and said, we will not toss it now; the prisoner said, what use is it bringing the pigeon here without tossing it. I looked at the bundle in the hole, and the moment I saw it, I catched hold of Norton and Walmsley, the prisoner ran off immediately. One of the prisoners that I had got hold of twisted himself from my left hand, and got away. Gates the watchman secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the prisoner after that - A. I did not see him until he was in custody at Bow-street. I think about a fortnight ago from this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever known the prisoner before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this - A. About four o'clock, on the 29th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sufficient opportunity of viewing the prisoner's person, so as to be able to speak with certainty at the distance of two months - A. I had. He was the first man that I looked at. I took some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180039"></xptr>pigeons from the other prisoners, and the watchman searched Norton's pocket, and found others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the ducks in the hole - A. Yes, and pigeons, they were shewn to Mr. Castang; he described the ducks before the handkerchief was opened. The pigeons were all alive, there were only five.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on the morning of the 29th - A. I did, I saw him about a quarter after after four, there were two more with him, Norton and Walmsley, I saw them in the fields at the back of Gower-street, I perceived one of them with a bundle, I was about one hundred and fifty, or two hundred yards from them. They were coming from the New-road along to St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they coming in a direction as if coming from Mr. Castang's house - A. Yes, by coming round the fields to prevent them coming along the streets, as little as they could help, they continued in my sight about a quarter of an hour, they stopped by themselves just before they got to Keppel-street; I was then one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards from them; they stopped there; I pulled off my coat, and put it into the watch-box; I went one way, and the constable the other before. Before I came up the constable had collared one; Crane made a catch at the bundle; Walmsley twisted out of the Constable's hand, and came past me; he was nearest me; I was pursuing him. Crane said, here you b - r, come and catch me if you can. I pursued Walmsley and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Crane before - A. I had seen him about Somerstown and Pancras a great many times. His father keeps a green grocer's shop just below the Britannia in Campden Town, he lived with his father.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of August, I received information of the prosecutor that he was robbed of his watch, he took me to the house and shewed me the girl, she said she knew nothing of the watch. I searched the room and her, I found nothing. I went out into the street, a girl called to me and told me that the woman had got the watch. I took the girl up stairs, I said is this the woman that you say has the man's watch, she said yes, then she confessed that she had the watch, she told me if I would go to Mr. Mordant's I should get it. I went to Mr. Mordant's he keeps houses there, he told me to keep in the parlour, however, I followed him into the room, he took something out of the desk gave it to the prisoner, she said I have got it. I went back to the prosecutor where I had left him, she took down an old chair and turned the key out of the chair, she said here is the key.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man and woman came to me, I was sitting at my own door, the woman said can you accommodate me with a bed. I told them I had no objection, I let them into the room, the woman came and said my man has no money he has given me the watch, she gave me the watch. I was to keep it till 9 o'clock the next morning, he did not come till past 2 o'clock, he wanted his watch and not to pay me for the room. I would not give him the watch without he paid me for the trouble, he went for a constable, when I saw the constable I gave him the watch, he discharged me and gave me some liquor, he went away and likewise the constable. I saw no more of them till 6 o'clock at night, then they came and took me away, I have been in custody ever since.</p>

            . I am a constable: I was on duty at the Old Bailey session; a person came to me from the Baptist's-head, and desired me to take charge of a person that had robbed a man of his money; I found the prisoner Glynn, and charged her with it; she denied it, but acknowledged she was in the company of the prosecutor, and drank part of a pint of purl and a quartern of gin at the Baptist's-head; we went into Fleet-lane, and the prosecutor pointed to a house and said this is the house I was robbed in; the people at the next house said they were gone away, that there was a disturbance in the night by a man calling out watch! in consequene of this I took her before a magistrate, and she was committed to Wood-street Compter, the other prisoner the prosecutor himself took in the Old Bailey.</p>

               <p>It is as false as God is true; it is because this woman would not lie with him; he gave me two-pence halfpenny for a quartern of gin; I said the best was threepence: she said she would not go to bed without some supper, and he gave me seven-pence to get some; when I came back they were disputing: I asked what was the matter; she said he wanted to go to bed all night and trust to his honour till morning, and he would pawn his watch to satisfy her, and if she would not he said he would call the watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Bride's. I had seen the two prisoners together about one o'clock- I saw the prosecutor about half-past one o'clock, at the corner of Black Horse-court; he was alone - I saw Foster come up and take hold of his arm; Holland was close by, and they all three walked down Farringdon-street before me - before they got to Harp-alley, the prosecutor separated himself from them; Foster then got hold of his arm again, and they went down the street as far as the New Market - Foster and the prosecutor then crossed, and Holland followed them; I followed them eight or ten yards up Brazier's-buildings - I there lost sight of them; in ten or fifteen minutes, I saw Foster come running out of Wheatsheaf-yard - she ran over to me, and said, "Watchman, did you see my old man, how he was running after me just now?" - I said,"No" - she said, "I suppose you have not been here long?" - she went on to Stonecutter-street, and the prosecutor came over from Wheatsheaf-yard, and caught her by the arm - (there is a way from Brazier's-buildings to Wheatsheaf-yard; at the upper part it is a very secret place, with nothing but stabling and a slaughter-house in it) - the prosecutor said, as well as I could understand him, that Foster had robbed him of 5 guineas; I said you must go with me to the watch-house - I turned my head, and saw Holland running; I called to Bolton Run after her.</p>

            . I am a constable. About half-past one o'clock, Prince brought in the prosecutor and Foster, and in a few minutes Bolton brought in Holland; Foster said she had nothing, and she was willing to be searched - we found in Holland's bosom, 4 sovereigns, 1 half-sovereign, 2 half-crowns, 5 shillings, 6 sixpences, 1 half-franc, and a bad sixpence - the prosecutor had described the money as well as he could before it was found - we found on Holland another shilling wrapped in paper which she said was her's</p>

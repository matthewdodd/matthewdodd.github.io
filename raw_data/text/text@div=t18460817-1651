                  </hi>. I live in Whitmore-street, Hoxton. On the 20th or 21st of May, the prisoner came to my house in company with a young lad—he said he had come from the brewhouse where I dealt, to look at my house—I said I had some thoughts of letting it—he said he was fatigued, he must come in and sit down, and have a glass or two of ale, for he had walked, having no money, as he had left his purse on the table at home—I showed him over the house—he said he liked it wonderfully—I told him the price was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it was just what my brewer told him it would be—he gave me a draft for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Jones and Loyd, and I was to come down in the afternoon and settle when he was to come into the house—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay his carriage back—there was one shilling and three sixpences—I should not have given it him if he had not given me the check—this is the check-in fifteen minutes after he was gone away I saw through the whole case.</p>

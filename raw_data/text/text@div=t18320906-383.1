            's Defence. I have endeavoured to elicit from the prosecutor, the fact of a serious quarrel between us, in consequence of his accusing me of having intentionally lost my child - in consequence of this, I availed myself of the information I had of his having bailed Pollock in the name of King, and justifying in the name of Wilson, and informed Mrs. Pollock of it, and she refused to pay him 10s. for having been bail; I believe she wrote to say, if he attempted to make the claim, she would see into it - he received the letter on the Monday, and made this charge; I admit selling the things, but distinctly at his request; his wife as he calls her, not supplying him with funds to procure liquor; if I had stolen them, I should not have sold them so near his house.</p>

Going out to bar up my windows, as I stood to make water, came the prisoner and another man, I found my handkerchief was gone. I walk'd up before them; there was a soldier; I told him I had had my pocket pick'd, by two men coming along. I took hold of the prisoner's collar: I took him into a tin-shop, in Fleet-street; there he pull'd my handkerchief out of his pocket, and ask'd if it was mine. I said it was; he said, he had just pick'd it up. I took him to the Plough ale-house; there he said, before the constable, he'd down on his knees and ask my pardon if that would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it go?</p>
               <p>Chidley. No, They only bresh'd my cloaths, and I felt and miss'd it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man?</p>
               <p>Chidley. He ran away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Waters. I had charge of the prisoner; the prosecutor gave me the handkerchief there (producing it).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief which I lost at that time.</p>
               <p>Waters. The prisoner said he did not take it; but said he would go down on his knees, and ask the prosecutor's pardon if that would do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going up the alley when he was making water, and saw the handkerchief lying against the wall. I pick'd it up; he came and ask'd me if I had his handkerchief. I produc'd it and said, I pick'd it up. I had no body along with me.</p>

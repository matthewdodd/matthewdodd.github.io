            . I was Mr Ithill's Apprentice, and was packing up Goods in the Shop, at the time these 2 Hats were stole. Mrs Cross sat near the Window from whence they were taken; and while I was busy, she cryed out, - a Man has taken a Hat, and has run away with it! I ran to the Door, but saw no body near; She made a Motion with her hand, to shew me which way he went, so I looked towards Angel-Street, and saw a Boy, (the Prisoner Dennet) putting something under his apron. I pursued him 4 or 5 Doors up Angel-Street and seized him. I asked him what he had got under his Apron, and he told me he had nothing; but upon my turning up his Apron, there were these two Hats. I am sure they are Mr Ithill's, for here are the Marks which I put upon them; and I am positive Dennet is the Boy I took them from; for I took the Goods from him, and brought him back to our Shop, and as I passed by the Barber's Shop at next Door, the Barber called me in, and told me he believed he had got the Boy's Confederate; so I took both the Man and the Boy into our Shop, and charged a Constable with them. We asked them if they knew one another, and they said no, they did not; and denied that they knew any thing of the matter, only the Boy said, he picked them up under the Shop-Window. Upon this we carried them before the Lord-Mayor, and being obliged to wait a little while for a Hearing, we went to the Fleece Alehouse , and there the Prisoner Cane desired us to speak favourably of him before my Lord-Mayor, and then he would go to Sea directly, and would never be seen again here. The Barber asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030003"></xptr> twice if his name was not Perkins ? He told him, it was not. Yes it is, says the Barber, and you * was tryed last Sessions for stealing wet Linnen. He was asked again what his name was, and he said it was Thomas Cane.</p>

            . I am a Peruke-maker, and live next Door to Mr Ithill. I saw the 2 Prisoners, the Man and the Boy, talking together about 2 Minutes at my Window, and very soon after this the Man (Cane) chopp'd into my Shop, and seemed to be very much surpriz'd, which gave me a suspicion that he was a Thief. I had seen Mr Ithill's Man run past my Window, and seeing him come back again with the Boy, I asked him to come into my Shop, for I believed I had got the Boy's Companion. I did not see any thing of the Robbery, only the Man came into my Shop in a Flurry, and pull'd off his Wig, and desired me to comb it, tho' it looked as if it had been just comb'd, and having seen him talk to the Boy but a little before at my Window, it made me suspect they were Confederates.</p>

The Woman (Mrs Cross) said she knew me by my blue Coat; I told her, that was very hard, - because many others wear blue Coats; but then she looked in my Face, and said, she would swear I was the Man who took them, tho' I am a <rs id="t17400903-1-deflabel6" type="occupation">Chair-maker</rs>

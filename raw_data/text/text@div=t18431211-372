On the 5th of Dec., about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in a parlour adjoining the shop, and saw a man in the act of taking down a piece of meat off a hook about the middle of the shop, just opposite me—I cannot swear what meat it was—it was a long piece—we missed a breast of mutton after<lb></lb>wards, and when I saw the hook vacant, I remembered that there had been a breast of mutton there—I have known the prisoner by sight for six or seven years—it did not strike me at the time that it was him, or any one in par<lb></lb>ticular—I</p>

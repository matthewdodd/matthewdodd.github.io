            . I am an officer. I was informed of some circumstances, and was watching opposite the door of Mr. Robinson, a tallow-chandler, in Drury-lane, for about three hours, on the 27th of May, and about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner go into the shop with a large bundle in a handkerchief - I went into the shop in a short time, and saw the prisoner putting some pieces of this spermaceti into the scale, from a bag which was laying on the handkerchief - I asked what he had got- he said some kitchen-stuff, which he brought from where he lived; I asked if he was servant there - he said Yes; I asked where it was, and he said, after some hesitation, at No. 4, Russell-square; I set off to go there, and when I got to the top of Drury-lane I turned my head, and saw him struggling with Smith - he got away; I pursued him, and he was stopped by a watchman. I made inquiries, and found where he worked.</p>

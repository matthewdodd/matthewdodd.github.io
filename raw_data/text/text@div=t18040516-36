               <p>Q. When did you last see the building with the lead on? - A. On Friday, the 4th of May; and on the Monday following I went down by the order of Mr. Taddy, to see what was taken away, and the flap of one wing was cut, and some part torn away, and on the other wing the lead of that hip was very near gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the lead again that you supposed might be taken off these premises? - A. Going down the road the next morning by the side of the Globe, I was called by some bricklayers; they said there was some of the lead found; I went into the Globe, and there I saw the two prisoners at the bar in custody, and the lead lying on the table.</p>

Yes; I saw the two prisoners come along; they stopped right over where I was; one of them said to the other, this is the place; I was about five or six yards distance from them. They pulled down part of the bank, and took out one piece of lead, and tied it up in a piece of dirty cloth; the other replied, will you have my apron to put the other in; I cannot say which it was; he took the apron, and I saw him take another piece, and put it in that apron, and tied it up; I went immediately, and informed

This man came to the house where I lodged on Monday night, to take a night's lodging there, at No. 11, Kingsland-road, and the next morning I got up to go to work, and I met him coming out of his room; I asked him what o'clock it was, and he told me; I worked at Leadenhall-market, in the leather market; I said it was far too late to go to work, I have lost a day's work; he said, if you want a job, I will give you a job, I will give you half-a-crown, and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160029"></xptr>victuals and drink, to take some goods that belong to me, about two miles distance; I asked him what it was; he said, when you come there, you will know what it is; he took me to a field, and he went into the ditch on one side of this field; I asked him if this was the place, and he said it was; with that he went into the ditch, and uncovered some stuff, and we took these two pieces of lead out of the bank; I lent him my apron, and he wrapped it up; he took one piece, and I took the other, till we got into a foot-path; then we met about half a dozen men that stopped us, and asked him where he was going; he told them it was his property, and they insisted upon knowing how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Rann's defence. Upon the 7th of May I went down to Blackwall to see an acquaintance of mine: on returning home, I was going past Bethnal-green, and this lead lay on one side, bare as it is now; I thought I had as much right to it as any other person, so I covered it up and went to Kingsland-road, where I lodged, and I employed him in the morning to take it away, about seven o'clock, and we were detected; I found the lead, and hired this man to assist me in taking it away.</p>

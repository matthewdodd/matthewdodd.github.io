On Thursday, the 17th of June, I was in my shop about twenty minutes past nine o'clock, and while there heard a very violent knocking at my window—I thought at first it was against the wood, but after the knocking was re<lb></lb>peated three times the glass gave in, and I heard it smash—I saw a per<lb></lb>son's hand through the glass, where there were rows of watches hanging—I went towards the door, saw Mr. Coyfe, my neighbour, and begged him to mind my shop while I ran after the person—my son ran out first, and</p>

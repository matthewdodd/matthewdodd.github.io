            . I am a carpenter. On Monday the 17th of February, about ten minutes before seven o'clock in the morning, I was going to do some work at Mrs. Brown's house, No. 5, Devonshire-street. I put the key in the door, and found it unlocked, there was something behind it, I could not open it. I found two men behind the door with loads on their backs. I took hold of a man who dropped his load and knocked me down, and gave me a black eye. My fellow workman struck one of them a violent blow over his arm with his axe - They both ran away. The man pursued and brought the prisoner back. I believe the prisoner to be one of the men. He left his hat and knot in the house. When the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, he sent to the house for his hat. He had the copper on his head and some lead.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I opened the door and found the prisoner, and another man, behind the door; the prisoner had the lead on his head. I struck one of them. They both rushed out. I pursued the prisoner and took him. I am sure the prisoner is the man. He asked me to let him go, and he tried to knock me down.</p>

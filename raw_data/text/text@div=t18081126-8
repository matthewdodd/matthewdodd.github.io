            . On Sunday morning the 2nd of October at six o'clock I was in the Minories, accompanied with Forrester and another; I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the Minories, he was going down, I was coming up, he had got a bag with him, it appeared full; this is the bag, the three bottles were in it; he had the bag across his shoulder, walking on; I crossed over the way, and before I got up to him he stopped himself almost; I asked him what he had, he said he had got some castor oil, he was going home, and he had bought it of a man a month ago; I asked him if he knew the man, he said he did not; I asked him where he brought it from, he could give no answer to that; I took him to the watchhouse and found the contents of it; the bag contained three bottles of castor oil, four cakes of bees' wax, three pieces of camphire, one paper of valerian; one bottle of quicksilver I saw my partner find in his pocket at the watchhouse; about six pounds he dropped out where he worked. We sent to Mr. Hardle.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going down the Minories when you saw him, he told you he was going home - where did he live - A. At No. 22, St. Thomas Apostle; he was going from home. The property has been in my care ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you such articles resembling every one of these in your shop - A. We had the whole of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, is there any thing particular in that valerian - A. Nothing further than it appears mouldy from dampness, not a good article; we had valerian exactly like that; these three bottles of castor oil I have no doubt but they are ours, and the bag we have some like it; the castor oil has been decanted.</p>
               <p>Q. After it is decanted you cement the cork - A. We do, with wax, rosin, and oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got some of the remainder of these bottles here - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you compared the cement of the one with the other, does it correspond - A. I have not the least doubt but they are part of the same quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the Compter to see the prisoner - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise at all - A. He would not say any thing in the presence of the officer; he desired the officer to walk out; he went of one side. He then said he hoped I would not be severe, or something to that effect, and that it was the first time; he observed there were no marks on them; I told him if he would attone for his crime by a confession of his accomplice, I would be lenient; he replied he would.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then we must not hear what he said after that.</p>
               <p>- LEE. I am an apprentice to the prosecutors.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner lodged - A. No. 22, Little St. Thomas Apostle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the officer to search his lodgings - A. Yes; one of his boxes smelled strongly of camphire.</p>

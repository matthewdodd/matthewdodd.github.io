I saw nobody near him - he was stopped before I lost sight of him, about a hundred and fifty yards off. I saw Harris at Worship-street next morning. My chain was picked up immediately after about a yard and a half from Strange.</p>

I ran to the corner, and saw the prisoner Strange running as hard as he could. I stopped him - he threw the chain and seals into the gutter. Robinson came up immediately.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was standing at the corner of Chiswell-street, Finsbury-square, and met the two prisoners about nine o'clock, in company with three more; they went into the square, and stopped near the rails, and were in conversation together. I watched them at the corner of the City-road, up and down the pavement to and fro; they looked at several people who were passing, and presently Robinson came by; there was a strong gas light; several of them looked at him, and noticed his seals. I kept behind them, going towards Castle-street, and then Strange stepped a little forward, the rest being behind; Harris was only a few yards behind him; Strange got under the gas light at the corner of Castle-street. Mr. Robinson came up, the word Click was given by one of them. Strange instantly snatched at the chain, and went down Castle-street; I followed, and so did his companions for a few yards; there was a cry about twenty yards down the street of,</p>
               <p>"D - n his eyes, knock him down;" I drew my staff out, and one of them was going to hit Mr. Robinson on the neck behind, but I knocked the person down; I do not know who he was. I came up with Strange at the moment Green stopped him - the rest immediately turned away. I knew Harris before by sight, and can swear positively to him. He was taken directly after in Providence-row; I saw him in custody an hour and a half after I took Strange to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HARRIS. Q. Did you not bring a boy to the watch-house, and hold a light to him, and ask if I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110105"></xptr>the man - A. A boy said one man was taken and put in Shoreditch watch-house; I went and found Harris there, and immediately said he was one - I never expressed a doubt about him. I thought at first that he might be the man I knocked down, but on looking at him I saw he was not.</p>

               <p>"Have you got the swag?" he shewed me the chain and seals; he spoke positively to him.</p>

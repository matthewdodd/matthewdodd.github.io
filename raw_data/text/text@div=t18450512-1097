                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Pugh, a grocer, in Sidney-place. About noon, on the 21st of April, I wae crossing Tower<lb></lb>hill, and felt my pocket move—I put my hand into it immediately, and my money was gone—I turned, and saw Jones close to me, and Hennell rather behind him, at his shoulder—there was no one near that, could have taken my money but Jones—it was safe about five minutes before—I had just come from the railway station—I had one sovereign, two shillongs, one groat and two pence, loose in my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of Trinity-square. I was on Tower hill on the 21st of April—I saw Mrs. Pugh, and some other female, walk from the corner of the Minories—I saw Jones go to Mrs. Pugh, and put his hand into her pocket—whether he took anything then I do not know, as something came between us—I followed them thirty or forty yards further—Jones put his hand into her pocket again, and passed his hand round to Hennell, who was close to him—I saw Hennell take some<lb></lb>thing, and put it into his pocket—I followed them further, and saw Jones put his hand into her pocket a third time—I then seized both the pri<lb></lb>soners, while Jones had his hand in her pocket—Hennell ran away from me first—I made a slip—Jones got away, and they both ran down Thames-street—I followed them—they did not get out of my sight—they might have thrown anything away in a crowd without my seeing it.</p>

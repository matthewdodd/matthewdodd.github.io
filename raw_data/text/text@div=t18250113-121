            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. I was in company with Bee, in Golden-lane, St. Luke's, between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I saw a man at the end of Playhouse-yard. I said to Bee,</p>
               <p>"Something is going forward, let us look out." In two or three minutes I saw the two prisoners come across Golden-lane; Wortley had this parcel under his arm, they were in company together; we ran after them - they went into a house in Playhouse-yard, and we went in - Wortley laid the parcel on a table - the house is kept by one Benjamin. I took hold of Wortley, and asked what he had got there? Benjamin, jun. was there then, and he and his mother laid hold of me, and begged me to let him go; I did not, but took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Is Playhouse-yard a thoroughfare? A. Yes; they came from Golden-lane end, not from Whitecross-street. Wortley had the parcel.

We followed them into a Jew's house, of the name of Benjamin - I bolted the door, and secured them and the parcel; we handcuffed the prisoners, and took them to the watch-house. Mrs. Benjamin and young Benjamin offered us money to let them go - they offered first two sovereigns, and then one more.</p>

               <p>WORTLEY'S Defence. I live in Whitecross-street. I got off my shop-board at six o'clock, and went into Playhouse-yard to get a piece of cloth. I went into Benjamin's shop, and the other prisoner came in after me. In about a minute the constables came in, and asked what we had got there? They took the parcel, which I had never seen before, and said we had brought it in.</p>
               <p>BENNETT'S Defence. I left home just after six o'clock to get a hat. I came down Golden-lane, and went into the first shop I came to; when I had been there about a minute the constable came in and said</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" I said</p>
               <p>"I have got nothing." He looked round and took this parcel off the table, and said we had brought it there.</p>

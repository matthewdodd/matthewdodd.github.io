                  </hi>. I am foreman to George Cook, who is in partnership with his son and Mr. Williams, in Princes-street, Hanover-square. About four o'clock on the 2nd of April I was in the back part of the shop, and heard a hustling at the door—I ran up to the door and found it open—I ran into the passage and saw the prisoner go down the steps with this coat and another over his arm—it had been on a chair in front of the shop—the property is worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Cook and his son live in the house—it is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I was in the middle of the street, coming towards the shop, I saw a man run out of the street-door across the square, and when I got to the street-door the man was three parts across the square; I turned round and saw the clothes lying inside the door; I went in, took hold of them, and took them into the shop. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was going down the steps with them.</p>

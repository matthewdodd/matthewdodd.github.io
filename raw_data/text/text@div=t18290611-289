               <p>SUSANNAH PERRY. I live at No. 7, Camden-court, Grub-street, Chiswell-street. I had known the prisoner for about a fortnight before she went into this service; she brought me a pair of sheets and a bolster one evening, some months before she was taken up - she said she was tired, that the bailiffs had come into her mistress' house, and she had got a bed out and pawned it - she had a pair of sheets and a bolster in her apron; she asked me to go and pawn them on her mistress account - I pawned them in my own name, at Mr. Upsall's, in Barbican; Christopher Deer advanced me 8s. - I gave the 8s. to her.</p>

I made up part of them - some of them were kept in a cupboard and some in a box, they are both kept locked; I never sent the prisoner to take the sheets out; I always do that myself. <rs id="t18290611-289-verdict1522" type="verdictDescription">

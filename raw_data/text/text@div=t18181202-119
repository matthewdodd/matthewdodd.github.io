Two or there months before I had him taken up, I spoke to him particularly about a book of prints, which cost me 8 l., I told him I had been robbed; he said somebody must have come in at the door, and taken it out, or that some of the customers must have stolen it, as a gentleman had examined them a short time before, other books were taken afterwards. I then had new locks put on my shop door - the prisoner slept at his sister's. I told him I suspected the maid-servant, and set him to watch. I locked the shop, and fastened every thing up myself at night, and every morning before, I came down, I gave him the key to open it. I lost those things after I made this regulation. The prisoner represented to me that he thought the shop had been opened by a false key in the night, and property taken. He took me to the back shelves, and shewed me the books in a deranged state, and said he left them in perfect order the night before - this continued till he was apprehended. About the 12th of August I told him that I suspected him, and I was convinced that nobody but one who was well acquainted with my property could have done it, and he was the thief, for it could be nobody else. He strongly denied it, but afterwards burst into tears, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have been tempted to rob you, but never did." He named two persons, who he said had threatened his life if he did not rob me, that they came to the private door, and would not go away until he gave them property, that he did give them property, and they sold it - he received only 8 s. as his part of the booty, and said he was compelled to do it from fear, there being above forty in the gang, that he had fought with them to prevent their forcing him to rob me, but his honest disposition had so triumphed over their temptations, as they wanted him to part with my money, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you discover these books - A. About three weeks after he was taken, I went to Mr. Shirly's, by accident, and found them there - I am certain they are mine - they have my private mark on them.</p>

She said she would have none of the books there, and then my brother burnt them - there were six books, she asked him to burn them - an alarm was made in the court by the fire; the people asked what was blazing in the room.

            . I was on duty near the Yorkshire Stingo; I heard the rattle and sprang across the road - I caught the prisoner running from the prosecutor, and about eight yards in front of him; the prosecutor accused him of robbing him of his purse, but did not say what the contents of it were - he said, "I think he has flung it away," and pointed about eight yards from the place; I went there, looked, and picked up this purse - the prisoner said, "What do you catch hold of me for? I have done nothing;" I said, "What did you run for?" this is the purse.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg to state that I had been to look at some goods at Mr. Flint's, being a broker and appraiser - on my return down the New-road I met a female and stood talking with her; I heard a cry of Stop him! but before that the female had told me she was the wife of a soldier, and seeing a soldier running I thought she was his wife - I ran down Chapel-street, and the Policeman crossed and took me into custody, but he never saw the soldier till he took me down Lisson-street; the soldier said, "Is that him?" - Yes, said the Policeman; the soldier was groping about and said,"Here is a purse he robbed me of" - I believe it never was out of his possession; I did not know where the Stingo was, and have not been near it - I was taken to the watch-house; the soldier was reeling about - I said,"That soldier is quite drunk, he can't charge me with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150116"></xptr>robbing him;" he said he had only had a little drop - before the Magistrate he said I had been at the Stingo and had taken him home; I should not have had a witness on my behalf had not the Magistrate issued a warrant.</p>
               <p>COURT to HAINSWORTH. Q. Did you see any other person running? A. No, only the soldier and the prisoner; the soldier could not run as well as I could, but he dropped his cap in Lisson-street.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If a person ran up Lisson-street, could you see him? A. Yes, it is a very open street, nearly as wide as Oxford-street; I was in Lisson-street, and in Chapel-street I caught him.</p>

            . I am a coachman in the employ of Mr. Waterhouse - I superintend his business at the Yorkshire Stingo, and drive occasionally. I was in the parlour, smoking a pipe with two or three coachmen, when the corporal came in with two soldiers of another regiment; it was near eleven o'clock at night - the parlour door was pushed open, and they came in and had two pots of ale; they had something at the bar, but I do not know what - I heard them say so; the corporal was very much intoxicated, and one of the other soldiers was drunk - the other was sober; the corporal had his purse out throwing about the table - the landlord advised him to put it into his pocket; he threw it about and wanted change for a 10l. note - the landlord said he had better not have change; I took up his cap which was on the table, and put it on - one of the soldiers said that was a fine of half a gallon of ale; I said I would stand a quartern of gin - the corporal then said he had lost a handkerchief; the landlord said, "How can that be when you have it in your hand?" - the prisoner was not there at all; the landlord advised the corporal not to have any more - there was a stranger there, taller than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see that he could hardly walk? A.

            . I keep the Yorkshire Stingo tap. I was shutting the door when the prosecutor came - he was tipsy, but he asked for pen, ink and paper: I thought it was some communication he had to make - I got a pen and ink, but he could not write at all; I said, "You had better let me write it;" he then said, "We will have a drop of rum a piece" - I gave the others a drop of rum, and then they wanted to go away, but the prosecutor took hold of them, and pushed them into the parlour, and there they had some ale; I saw the last witness put on the soldier's cap - he was to be fined half a gallon of ale, but he paid a quartern of gin; each of the soldiers took some of that, except the drunken one with the shoe on his arm, he did not drink any - the prisoner was not in the room that evening; there was a stranger there, who followed directly after the prosecutor - he was taller than the prisoner, but not so stout; I heard the prosecutor charge the last witness with stealing his handkerchief - I put my back against the door to prevent any body going out; I looked round, and said, "How can that be, when you have it in your right hand?" he then had to pay a quartern of gin for it; and he had his purse in his hand throwing it about - I said, "Put it into your pocket;" he then wanted change for a 10l. note, and I would not let him have it - he was very drunk; he could not stand still: I went to the Magistrate the day afterwards - that was the first I knew of this; the stranger went out just after the soldiers were gone - he paid me for his gin and water; I told the Magistrate I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The stranger had seen the bulky purse as well as you? A. Yes: the prosecutor was very drunk; he had very near knocked a person down - he might make a stumbling run; from the careless manner in which he acted in my parlour I do not think he knew what he was about: the last I saw of his purse was in his hand - he pulled it out of one of his pockets at the bar, but I cannot say what pocket; the bar is narrow: I and the soldiers persuaded him to put it away, but he knocked the soldiers about; I believe they were glad to get away: I had never seen the stranger before; there were four persons besides the soldiers.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and was in the Yorkshire Stingo on the night in question; I saw the prosecutor and two other soldiers, but I suppose by their dress they were not of the same regiment: a friend and I were sitting smoking; the door burst open, and they all came in - nothing but the table prevented them all going down; the corporal was drunk - he sat down on the table, and took off his cap; Davey put it on, and one of the soldiers said, "It is a rule among us soldiers, that that is a fine of half a gallon of ale;" he said, "I can't stand half a gallon of ale, I will give a quartern of gin;" he gave the cap back, and then the corporal said he had lost his handkerchief out of it; the landlord said, "You have it in your hand;" the other soldier then said he should fine him a quartern of gin for accusing him of it: the prosecutor had his purse in his hand, got a fork, and opened it, and wanted change for a 10l. note, which the landlord would not give him; there was a person came in, and called for a glass of gin and water, who sat at the next table to them - he drank part of it, went out, and did not return; I did not see the prisoner in the house at all- there was but one person besides the soldiers, who were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The corporal was very drunk? A. I considered him so - if I were so drunk I should expect to be taken off my box - I drive the Paddington omnibus; I had not driven the prosecutor - we began drinking the strangers' gin and water directly after; the house was ordered to be shut up, about a quarter of an hour or ten minutes after we drank it, and we went out immediately: I did not hear any alarm of Stop thief! I did not hear of this till the next day.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Where was this man running? A. In Lisson-street; the man who was talking to the woman was on the right-hand side - he left the woman and ran; the soldier was shuffling, I could not call it a run - the man who was with the woman ran; he ran from the soldier - I could not give any reason for that; I do not know who the man with the woman was - I heard the soldier say Stop him! and I could have stopped the man who ran past me, but I thought it was a drunken frolic, and I went home; the man who ran past me was a tall man I should say - the soldier was pursuing him, then he crossed the road, and pursued the other; I did not see any Policeman.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and live at Paddington. On Thursday last I saw the prosecutor, as I was standing against the door of the Stingo, smoking a pipe; he accused me of being one of the prisoner's accomplices in the theft - I was at the Yorkshire Stingo on the night in question; I am well known there - it was between seven and eight o'clock last Thursday evening when the prosecutor came to me with the Policeman; the prosecutor appeared to me as drunk as any person could be, and so was the Policeman - they were not fit to walk; the Policeman had a sealing-wax pipe in his mouth, and I said it was fine times for a Policeman to have a sealingwax pipe - I said if he was not quiet I would give charge of him to another officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What coach do you drive? A. I was driving a coach, but am out of work - I now wash coaches for a gentleman who has an omnibus; it is six or seven months since I drove a coach - I was in service seven years ago, but my master is in France; I did drive for a Mr. Trivett six or seven months ago - I used to drive odd journies: coachmen would not get so drunk as the prosecutor and the Policeman were - I was at the Stingo that very night; the prosecutor was very drunk - I did not help him home: it is the worst thing in the world to help people home who are in liquor - he could not run; he could shuffle along.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Since I have been convicted has it not been clearly understood who the persons were who committed the robbery? A. No, not by me, I certainly never had an idea that you were not the person, and never said any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have been unjustly convicted in one instance and am sacrificed in another - he has been with the people every day. Witness. I merely waited expecting the cause to be called.</p>

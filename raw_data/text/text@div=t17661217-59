            . I am servant to Mr. Wade; the prisoner was at our shop after my master was gone out; he asked me if I would drink part of a pint of purl, and sent me for it, and bid me bring change for 1 s. and gave me one; he was at the door when I went out, and when I returned, while we were drinking the purl, I thought I saw something under his coat; I looked and saw a book there; I let him go out of the shop, and then ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he bought any thing?</p>
               <p>Palmer. No, he had not; I carried him to my master, and took the book out of his pocket; (produced in court, the titles answered to the indictment, deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Chalcroft-terrace, New-cut. On Satur<lb></lb>day, the 21st of last month, I met the female prisoner at the Half-way House, in Webber-street, Southwark—I treated her with something to drink—I went with her to several public-houses, and then to a house in New-street, Lock's-fields—I gave her half-a-crown and a shilling, and went to bed with her—I put my watch into my fob, and put my trowsers under my pillow—I had a sovereign besides in the fob—I was in bed about three-quarters of an hour—I observed her hand under the pillow, where I had put my clothes—I took it down two or three times—after I had been some time with her, she wanted to go down, but said she would be back directly—she went down, and another woman came up, who desired me to leave, and on going out, I missed my watch and sovereign—I went back to the house with an officer, but the prisoner was gone.</p>

I was on duty in Westminster-bridge-road, about a quarter-past two o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of April, and saw Shambrook in company with three prostitutes, at the foot of the bridge—about a quarter-past three o'clock, in consequence of what I heard, I went to No. 15, Duck-lane, Westminster, and in the front room up stairs I found the two prisoners, and four other women—the two prisoners and two other women were on the bed—I said to my brother constable, "That is Dwyer"—I took her off the bed, but found nothing on her—my brother constable was searching Shambrook—he was very violent, and said he would not be searched—we brought him out, and felt something in his fob—he said it was his own property—we asked him to produce it—he would not—I was searching a girl, I left her, and came and took hold of his collar and left wrist, and my brother officer took the watch from his fob.</p>

A little after four o'clock, on Sunday morning, the 22nd of April, I saw the two prisoners, with four or five others, quarrelling in Duck-lane—about half-past five o'clock, I went with Cockrill, and apprehended them in the house, up stairs—Shambrook was violent—I asked him what he had got in his fob—he said, "Nothing but my property"—he became very violent—Cockrill came and took his hand,</p>

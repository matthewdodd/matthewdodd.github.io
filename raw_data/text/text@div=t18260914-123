            . I am an officer. About a quarter before one o'clock, on Friday morning, the 21st of July, I was passing Cable-street, and saw Green at the corner of North East-passage, and Read came down, putting on her gown - she crossed over to Green, and I heard her say"I have got it;" she was not dressed, but Green was - they went down North East-passage, and I went up Cable-street; when I saw the prosecutor standing at a door in his shirt - he said he had been robbed of his pocket-book and eleven sovereigns by two women, and should know them again - I went down the passage and took Read - I brought her back, and went up and searched the house - I found the watch and seals close to the window on a nail in the shutters; I put them into my pocket, and took Read to the watch-house; she said she should send for her child; I knew where her child was kept, and I went there to see for Green; I heard a man, whom she lives with, say"Is that you, Bet;" I took hold of Green, her apron was wrapped round her arm; I told her I wanted her for stealing eleven sovereigns; I found one sovereign in her hand, one penny in her pocket, and nine sovereigns, and this shilling, in the corner of her apron; the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

               <p>READ'S Defence. He said "Can you get me any thing to drink;" I said it was too late; but I went to the door to see, and the officer said he would dash my brains out if I did not deliver him twelve sovereigns and a pocket-book; I had been at the public-house, and the man drew me into his company, and persuaded me to go home.</p>
               <p>COURT to CARTER. Q. What part of her dress had Read off? - A. Her shoes and her gown; I found her shoes in the room where the prosecutor's watch was; Green told me to be as easy as I could; and if I could not do without her, to say I found it in the entry.</p>
               <p>COURT to RALPH TAITE. Q. Do you believe Green to be the girl called Bessy, who was in the room? - A. Yes; the other girl was talking to her; there was no other person in the room; Green left the room first, and Read in a moment after; I found the jacket on the floor; there was 20s. in silver in my jacket pocket, which they had not time to take.</p>

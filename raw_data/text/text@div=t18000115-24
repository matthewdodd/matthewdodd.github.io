               <p>Q. As you found a deficiency in point of weight in the box, at the time the rings were before him, did you perceive him take any thing? - A. I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150025"></xptr>not; I used my utmost endeavour to detect him, and kept my eyes fixed upon him the whole time, and could not perceive that he took one; the constable and two young men immediately came in; the constable was told to search that man, meaning the prisoner; he searched his waistcoat pockets, but I did not think he had searched them sufficiently, for I suspected that if the prisoner had taken the rings, they must have been in his waistcoat pocket, for he was certainly shifting his hands in and out of his waistcoat pocket; he searched his waistcoat pocket a second time, for I was not yet satisfied; and the constable observed that he drew his right hand out of his waistcoat pocket clenched; the prisoner then seemed inclined to make some resistance, upon which I rung our back shop-bell for assistance; several men then came in, and at last the prisoner's hand was opened, I then saw the rings turned out of his hand on the whited-brown paper, which I placed to receive them; there were twenty-four of them, all gold rings; the constable has them; they were sealed up in my presence with my seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time? - A. He said a great deal, but I cannot recollect what.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the rings afterwards weighed and counted? - A. They were, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the two rings that he had bought? - A. They were wrapped up in a piece of paper, either on the shew-glass or on the counter, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the weight of the rings taken from him, together with those that were sold, and those which remained, constitute the original weight before he came to the shop? - A.Exactly, in weight and number; there were one hundred and eighty-four rings left in the box, the two that he had bought, and twenty-four that were taken from him, made up two hundred and ten; I examined two of the rings that were taken from him, I found upon them the marks which I had put upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of those twenty-four rings? - A. Six pounds: then he was secured and taken to the Compter; the next day I examined the other twenty-two rings, and they all had my mark.</p>

On Thursday, the 23d day of April, I had been out, and when I came home I was informed that the prisoner at the bar, my <rs id="t17950520-54-deflabel318" type="occupation">weekly servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950520-54-defend655 t17950520-54-deflabel318"></join>, had about an hour before pawned a pair of shoes. He had lived with me about two years and a quarter. The pawnbroker brought the shoes up.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him in charge of a constable? - Yes, and I said to Mr. Terry, we will go to your lodgings. The officer went with me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the same afternoon? - Yes, directly. In looking about the room, in a little closet, I found a pair of men's half boots; I said, Mr. Terry, did you take them for your wear? - he endeavoured to make some apology, that I had some time before promised him a pair of shoes. In looking again into the same closet, I found another pair of half boots that laced; the prisoner's wife opened the drawers, to shew us what we pleased to look at; among the rest was a pair of womens shoes, in the indictment, which the prisoner's wife said, she brought with her cut of the country some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the prisoner? - Yes; in examining these shoes, I saw the customer's name that they were made for, of the name of Turnbull, and I know the shoes likewise. In some other part of the room, I believe the officer opened a little bag, which contained some upper leathers of mine, some of them marked. The constable has had the property ever since. He first said, that some of the leather was his, but when I came to look at them he confessed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Before any conversation took place on this business, had you held out any hopes to him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you threatened him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it should be better for him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him he should not be taken in custody? - He was already in custody. The first thing that passed was, his telling me that I had promissed him a pair of shoes; and when I looked over the leather, when I came to some part of the skin that was marked, he said, I am very sorry; and his wife said, she was sorry to say that I had not one honest servant about me, for they all robbed me; he said he had not robbed me more than the rest. He acknowledged he had took all the articles. I said to him, if there is one article that is not mine, be cautious what you say, and don't let me take it; he acknowledged they were all mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200160"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. Have you any journeymen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that your journeymen don't work for you out of hours at home, and bring the goods back again the next morning? - No, it is not the practice of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. If this man without your knowledge worked out of doors, you did not know it? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a person of the name of Greenwood lived with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Does he live with you now? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here to day? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he ceased to live with you? - Since this affair my mind was not easy, on account of the prisoner charging him with robbing me likewise. I went to his apartment to satisfy myself, and I see nothing in his apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that information you certainly did turn Greenaway away? - I did. I found that they were both going to quit my service, and set up in the trade for themselves.</p>

He came into the box and asked half a crown on them, and I gave him two shillings, and I wrote a ticket for them; and about two o'clock in the afternoon, my master sent me with two pair of shoes to Mr. Murray's shop, and when I came in there I see the prisoner at the bar, and I came home and acquainted my master of it, and my master went with me to Mr. Murray's shop, and sent me for a constable, and I fetched a constable, and then my master sent me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the pair of shoes that he pawned? - The constable has got them. I delivered them to my master, and there I left them.</p>

Mr. Murray was not then at home, I sent my boy for a constable, and took the man into custody, and the prisoner at the bar owned and confessed that he took the shoes from Mr. Murray's shop. Mr. Murray came home and I shewed him the shoes, and he said they were his property. I accompanied the constable to a house in old Bedlam, and we went into a room there, where his wife was making of shoes, and Mr. Murray found several things of his own on the premises; he found some shoes, boots, and leather.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner give any account, how he came by these things, that Mr. Murray found? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You said the prisoner confessed; before the prisoner confessed was any thing said to induce him to confess? - It came voluntarily from himself. I asked him myself where did he take these pair of shoes from, and he pointed me to the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him? - I did not. I told him I would send for a constable to take him to the counter, because I supposed he had stole this pair of shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he know it? - Yes, he did.</p>

When I had him in custody in Mr. Murray's shop, Mr. Murray came in, and Mr. Purse informed him that he had had a pair of shoes pawned at his house, and he suspected they were stolen. I asked the prisoner whether he lived in the house? he said he did Mr. Murray says, I am over-run with thieves, I have found one out. Mr. Murray and Mr. Purse consulted together, and asked him if he was willing for us to go and search his lodgings? he said, yes, by all means. Accordingly, we went and searched his lodgings, and we found the contents of this bag all but one pair of shoes. (The property produced.) He first of all said, they were his own property; but Mr. Murray seeing his own private mark on them, he could not deny but that they were his master's.</p>

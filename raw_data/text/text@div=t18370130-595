                  </hi>. I am a Bow-street officer. On the 14th of January I went to a house at the corner of Queen-street, and King-street, Seven Dials, about two o'clock in the afternoon, with Ballard, Fletcher, and Shackell—I went to the street door, found it open, and proceeded up stairs—on the landing of the first floor I stood a little and heard some persons talking—I fixed myself ready to burst the door open—but hearing somebody move, I stood quiet without touching the door—and all at once the key was turned, and the female prisoner opened the door—I had not been on the landing place half-a minute before this happened—I rushed by her and saw the two male prisoners—Robert was sitting on the right-side of the fire, and the other on the left—the fire-place faced me as I went in—there was a fire in the grate—I saw Robert with something in his hand before I got up to him—I seized it in his hand, and it turned out to be a mould—he tried to crush it by pressing his hands together, but I got tight hold—my brother officers came in, and a scuffle ensued between him and me—I wrenched the</p>

               <p>greatest part of it out of his hand, and some of the bits fell to the ground—I held the parts I got from his hand some time, and on looking at it, there was the mould and a shilling in it—at the time I laid hold of it the mould was warm—I produce it, it has been joined together since—the shilling is in it—there was a Piece of cloth in his hand with the mould in it—I found this good tabling on the mantel-piece, and a counterfeit sixpence on the left-hob—I found a mould for a sixpence on the side John sat—it was lying there open—John was looking towards the fire when I went in—in the scuffle this sixpenny mould with a sixpence in it got knocked into the fire—I found on the table a bag with a quantity of plaster of Paris in it—that was not two yards from the fire, close to the prisoners, and two metal-spoons were on the table—one having some white stuff, apparently plaster of Paris, in it—I also found a knife on the table with plaster of Paris sticking to it, and some more pieces of the mould for the lion side of a shilling—I picked then up Dear the fire-place in separate parts—they have been put together since—I also found a bit of broken glass with plaster sticking to it, and I picked up some small bits of white metal among the ashes under the grate.</p>

                  </hi>. I accompanied the other witnesses to the prisoners lodging. I followed them in, and saw Keys scuffling with Robert Staple<lb></lb>ton and Ballard with John—at the same moment Caney tried to make her escape by trying to push by Fletcher, but he caught hold of her and pushed her into the room—I went to Keys' assistance, and caught hold of Robert Stapleton's wrist, and took him to another part of the room—I was going to handcuff him, and he threw from his left hind three sixpences, into a tub of water—I took them up and searched him, and in his left trowsers pocket found another counterfeit sixpence—I knew him before, and asked him how he came there—he said he was asked to corns to see if he could make some—the other two prisoners were at the other end of the room at the time—I do not know whether they could hear this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to his Majesty's mint, and have been in the habit of examining coin for many years. Here is part of a plaster of Paris mould produced by Keys—it appears to hare been used for the purpose of casting counterfeit shillings—it bean the impression of the reverse side of a shilling perfect, and from the discolour<lb></lb>ation of the plaster I believe it has been used—here is another piece of a plaster of Paris mould which is broken, but it bears the impression of the greater part of the obverse side of a shilling—these two pieces, when put together would form a whole mould for casting a shilling—here is a counterfeit shilling produced by the same witness, and which he described as being in the mould, and warm when he found it—it is Britannia metal—it appears to have been cast in this mould—I have applied it—here is a good shilling produced by Keys, which I believe has been used to make the mould produced, as it corresponds with it in all respects</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300107"></xptr>
               <p>—here is a counterfeit sixpence produced by the witness, made in the same way as the shilling—there is no mould corresponding with that—this is the half of a mould for casting sixpences, but it does not appear to Have been used—it has the good coin now in it, with the obverse side of a six-pence—these two spoons are Britannia metal, and correspond with the metal of the counterfeit money—one of the spoons has plaster of Paris in it, which has been in a liquid state—here is a portion of a broken knife which is necessary to make the channel for the metal to run through—shackell has produced four sixpences, all of which are counterfeit, but not cast in any mould produced—here is another part of a mould for sixpences, having part of the reverse side of a sixpence on it, making the impression of both sides—this iron spoon has metal in it which has been in a state of fusion—the file has white metal in the teeth of it—here is some powder of plaster of Paris, of which the moulds are formed.</p>

On the morning in question I visited my brother, who occupied the apartment—the landlord came up while I was there, and asked permission to remove some articles from a cupboard which was very curiously concealed from our view—he took out some carriage lisps, and left us—my brother then ascended to explore the contents of the cupboard, and immediately produced the articles which have been found; and we out of curiosity attempted to make a shilling with them, which filled, and we were apprehended in the act—we made no more resistance than was natural to people conscious of their innocence—I have since un<lb></lb>derstood the house is a receptacle for thieves, and these things might have been left there—a young man named Grady was recently taken from there for stealing a handkerchief—when the landlord came for the lamps he rased two others, and I thought suspected us of stealing them, and he has resorted to this savage proceeding for revenge.</p>

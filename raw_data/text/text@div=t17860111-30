               <p>By whom were you jostled? - By that prisoner.</p>

               <p>Did you see any other? - I saw him give the watch to another man, and I collared him directly, and took him into a shop and charged a constable with him, he denied it, but I saw it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Scott one of Prisoner's Counsel. What time of the evening was it? - Between four and five.</p>

               <p>Was not it dusk? - There were lights in the pastry-cook's shop, but it was light enough to see the watch in the man's hand.</p>

               <p>This was near a pastry-cook's shop? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did not you stop to look into the pastry-cook's shop? - I did not stop there.</p>

               <p>Then you was passing through a crowd that had stopped? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What was the first impediment that you found? - Two or three jostled me, and I put my hand to my pocket to save my watch but I could not, nothing was found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>You saw somebody part with it? - I saw him part with it, I never lost him.</p>

               <p>Are you sworn? - Yes.</p>

               <p>To interpret? - Yes, as far as my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Swear her to all such questions as shall be asked of him.</p>

               <p>What sign have you to put these questions to him, what is the nature of an oath, by what sign would you ask him that question? - We look up to heaven and shew him that he is to answer seriously.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow objected to this witness being examined, but his objection was overruled by the Court.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you interpret the oath to him, you have sworn well and truly to interpret to

               <p>You cannot interpret farther than you know.</p>

               <p>Court. I remember a deaf and dumb man being sworn in the Common Pleas to suffer a fine? - I have interpreted the oath to him and he understands it.</p>

               <p>Ask him if he knows any thing of the offence which is charged against him; what he saw the prisoner do? - He shews me that he saw the prisoner get the watch behind him.</p>

               <p>Ask him if he knows how the prisoner came by the watch? - He shewed me he did not see it taken out of the pocket, only given behind.</p>

               <p>Ask him if he knows the person that lost the watch? - He shewed me he never saw him before.</p>

               <p>But did he know him now? - Yes, he points to him.</p>

               <p>Ask him how near he stood to Williamson when he saw the watch in the prisoner's hand? - I understand him he was near, but I cannot answer how near, he shews me by the length of a yard but I cannot pretend to say to the space.</p>

               <p>Ask him if he knows any more of the matter? - No more than the taking him to the constable.</p>

               <p>I had hold of my brother's arm looking past the pastry-cook's shop, the corner of Cornhill, and this gentleman came up, there were fifty or sixty people round me, up came this gentleman and told me I had his watch, I said it was false, I never saw him before he took me into the pastry-cook's, he charged a constable, he searched me and my brother, and found nothing upon us.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Rasten. Ask your brother how far off he was when he saw him give the watch to another? - He shews me a very little way, but I cannot take upon me to say how near.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner called three witnesses to his character.</p>

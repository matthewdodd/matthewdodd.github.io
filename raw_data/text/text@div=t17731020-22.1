            . I am master cooper and storekeeper at the Victualling Office: I have often suspected hoops were missing; all the iron hoops there are marked with the maker's name and the broad arrow. Thomas has been a workman there six years; these hoops, which were the stores of the cooperage in which Thomas was employed, were open to him to take hoops, in order to hoop the casks. On the 21st of December I was before Justice Sherwood; some hoops were produced with marks belonging to the Victualling Office; there were two new ones that had never been used.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Leverett: I worked with him in June to September, down to the 20th; I know Thomas also. Leverett is a smith in East Smithfield; he makes grates: I have known Thomas twice or thrice in a week bring hoops in his pocket; he brought these hoops (describing them) in false leather pockets inside his coat; the hoops had the king's broad arrow upon them. On the 2d of August particularly, he brought four; they were tied up in order to make them portable. On the 3d o f September he brought two; all these hoops had the broad arrow upon them. On the 3d or 4th of September Leverett told me that if I could get any thing above twelve shillings per hundred for the hoops brought by Thomas, I should have all above that for myself, and said he had two or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200019"></xptr> three hundred weight of the same kind to dispose of; Leverett cut one of these hoops Thomas brought in my presence, and beat out the broad arrow upon the anvil; then he gave to me a piece of that hoop as a sample of the iron he had to dispose of, and ordered me to go and dispose of it. I have seen Thomas bring iron to Leverett innumerable times. Instead of carrying this piece of iron I had for a sample to dispose of to any person, I went and made a discovery to the Lords of the Admiralty. When Leverett beat out the broad arrow, he said if that was seen upon them, the persons would not purchase it. Leverett gave three-pence halfpenny for each hoop, which weighed about three or four pound, and each hoop was in truth worth seven pence. I know Leverett gave that sum to Thomas, for I have seen him pay the money for the hoops,</p>

            . I know Thomas; I worked for Leverett; on the 2d or 3d of August, I saw the prisoner Thomas bring some iron about nine o'clock in the evening; he brought seven hoops, they were hoops belonging to butts, and they were new hoops, and the broad R was upon them; Leverett paid Thomas two-pence or three-pence each hoop; after that I worked up myself some of these hoops in grates for the use of my master; he brought some a second time to my master; them my master bought, and gave much about the same price; he came a third time, and that third time was the time when I was a-bed; he came about ten or eleven at night; I was a-bed in the same room where he came in; there was a candle in the room at the time; he came in and Leverett was there, and a woman who lives with him; before the candle was put out, I saw him throw one or two hoops out of his pocket, and then the candle was blown out, I believe by the woman, as to this last time before I got up, after the candle was blown out; we all went over the way to the Shovel; I got up and went after them there; before I got out of my bed I spoke to Thomas at the time Leverett was within hearing, to go into a back room of the same shop; the rooms are very small; while I was a-bed I myself spoke to Thomas; I asked him where he had the hoops; Thomas said from the Victualling Office; upon that Leverett said, poo poo, come over and have some boose; then I got up and followed them to the Shovel; when we were there, Thomas said he should have them for the price of seven shillings per hundred; they both offered me to have some at seven shillings per hundred; the same price Leverett had given Thomas.</p>

               <p>Young. Yes; and was gone when I took these hoops upon him; I had seen him there twice that morning, at nine and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>- Child. I bought some hoops of Leverett with the broad arrow upon them; I took them for a debt Leverett owed me; he sent me home to my house a parcel of hoops with the broad arrow upon them.</p>

As to the other charge of the iron spoken of by Hayward, and the other witnesses, I am innocent of that. As to Hayward he is a bad man, and has an anger against me; either of these witnesses would have said nothing at all, or spoke in my favour, if I had given them a guinea a piece.</p>

On the 20th of July, in the morning, about seven o'clock, I went to the warehouse; I found the door locked as usual; when I got in I found the writing desk chipped and cut as with a chissel or knife, and I missed twenty-five or twenty-six shillings that were left there the night before. I was amazed at first how any body could get into the warehouse, but recollected there was a hole in the floor where hay had used to be put down into a hay wrick for a horse: the buildings had been formerly in the possession of the prisoner's master; I had seen him the day before about the place, and suspected from his knowing the house it must be him that had got in; Snell and I met with him next morning; we laid hold of him, and charged him with the robbery, and he owned he took a side of bacon, two hams, the money out of the drawer of the desk and a great coat; he said he gave the bacon and hams to one

            . I am servant to Mr. Fox; I was at the warehouse with the last witness; he said he suspected the prisoner; I was at the taking the prisoner next morning on Black-Friars-bridge; he and another person were together in one of the arches; we took them to a publick house; there the prisoner confessed he took the side of bacon and the two hams, and carried them to a public house in Wych-street; I found thirty-six pounds and a half of bacon at one White's at a publick house in Wych-street; the constable found one of the hams at the One Bell in the Strand. I found the other ham and twelve pounds and a half of bacon in one Hopwood's yard at Hampstead; the prisoner confessed he gave both to Leicester, and I went to see after them by the direction of my master. Leicester is indicted for receiving them in Middlesex; (the hams produced); there is no particular mark by which I know them to be my master's.</p>

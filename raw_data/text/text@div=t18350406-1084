                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper, and live at Forert-gate, Wanstead, Essex—I had a little black mare, on the forest—I saw her there on the Monday previous to Saturday, the 21st of March, when I missed her, about seven o'clock in the morning—I had had her four or five months—I turned her out near my own home; but the last time I saw her, she was lying near Wanstead—on Saturday morning, the 21st, the patrol produced her to me—I had not missed her—I knew Livennore by sight, but not by name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Bow-street patrol. I saw Livermorne leading this mare, near the New Church at Stratford, about six o'clock, on the morning of the 21st of March—he was leading her towards London, by a halter, but no saddle—I asked where he brought it from—he said, from Mr. Carter's, a farmer at Epping, and he was going to take it to Perkins, of Tooting, for Carter—I asked if he had any note or direction to Mr. Per<lb></lb>kins—he said, "No"—I asked which way he came from Epping—he said he came through the Bald-stag-gate—I asked if he had any turnpike-ticket—he said he had lost it—I knew he had not come that way, which excited my suspicions—I told him I suspected he had stolen the mare—he said, "Well, I cannot deceive you, I have"—he then said he had been dawn into it by another man, and described his dress to me and my partner, (Johnson,) who pursued Wheeler, from Livermore's description, and brought him back in about a quarter of an hour—I showed the mare to the prose<lb></lb>cutor that morning, and he owned it.</p>

               <p>sevidence is correct—when Livermore described the other man, I went in pur<lb></lb>suit towards London, and overtook Wheeler, at Bow, about two miles further on—when I got up to him, I asked him where he had come from—he said, "From the other side of Brentwood"—I said, "What way did you come?"—he said, "Through Romford"—I asked if he saw a man leading a horse on the road—he said yes, he did, and the man asked him the road to Lon-don, and he told him to turn round the corner—I asked him how the man was dressed—he said he had got a frock on—I had met a waggon, and asked him if he, had seen that waggon on the road—he said yes, he had, and he knew the waggon by the boy who was with it—I said, "It is clear to me you have not come through Romford, for that waggon came over Woodford Bridge"—I took him back to Livermore, and said to Livermore, "Is this the man?"—he said, "Yes, it is"—Wheeler said, "Well, you might have seen me before"—the same mare was afterwards shown to the prosecutor.</p>

On Saturday, the 21st of March, I was up about ten minutes before five o'clock in the morning—I am a green-grocer, and keep mares on the forest—I was looking after my mares on the forest about five o'clock in the morning, and met two men with a black mare or horse, I could not tell which—the man in a fustian dress was leading her, and the one in a blue dress was walking by his side—the blue dressed one walked away towards a cottage—I suspected they had stolen the mare—I turned round, and they joined again—the man in a blue dress opened the gate, and let the other through—the prisoners are the two men.</p>

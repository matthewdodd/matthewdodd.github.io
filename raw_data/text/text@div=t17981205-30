               <p>Q. Where did you receive the copper from? - A. From Mr. Saville's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, he was employed by Mr. Mesteares; he was at work outside the ship, but had nothing to do with the copper at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him do any thing whatever particularly? - A. I missed him three or four times a day from his work, between two and three in the afternoon; I went round the ship to look for him; I saw a labourer,

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This copper was in Mr. Mesteares's yard? - A. It was on board the ship, under the care of the mate, and the people belonging to the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. The mate's name is Taylor? - A. Yes; it belonged to the captain and owners of the ship.</p>

               <p>JOHN DUNNAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a carpenter on board the ship Two Friends, I was employed by the captain, Mr. Macneal; I saw the prisoner go over the side on the Friday afternoon, the 23d of November, with a piece of copper under his jacket, I watched him, but before I could give the mate notice of it, the foreman, Mr. Hickes, called him away from the shed that I saw him go into.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you been acquainted with the prisoner before? - A. No, I came on board on the 22d, and this was on the 23d.</p>

            . On the 23d of November, in consequence of a suspicion of the prisoner, I saw him in the carpenter's shed, I observed that, he had nothing about him; I then went into the shed, and found a piece of copper concealed behind an empty barrel in one corner; I brought the copper out, and walked round the ship with it till I saw the prisoner; I presented it to him, and told him he had stole it out of the ship; he called me ad-d rascal, abused me very much, and struck me several times; I immediately went to the Police-office, and took out a warrant to apprehend him; the steward of the ship took it to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You found the copper in the shed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner, when you taxed him with it, abused and beat you? - A. I dare say he would have battered my face.</p>
               <p>Q. And perhaps have taken your life? - A. I do not know but he might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Hickes.) Q. How large is the shed? - A. About eight feet square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him near that part of the shed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Other persons might have access to that shed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And might have put the copper there? - A. I saw him in the shed.</p>

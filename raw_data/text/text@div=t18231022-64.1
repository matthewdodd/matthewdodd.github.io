            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 4th of September, the witnesses informed me of this. I enquired for the prisoner, but could not find him at his house till the 22d - I have known him five years. I found him at his mother's, put him in the watch-house, and asked what he had done with the coat; he said he knew nothing of it. I brought the witnesses to him; they said he was the man. Lumsden said,</p>
               <p>"How came you to steal my coat?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Because I was in distress; I do not know who has got it; I sold it to a Jew in the street, for 5 s."</p>

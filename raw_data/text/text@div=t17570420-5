They charged the prisoner with taking them. He swore he'd send him and another of my servants to gaol for taking his character away, I took the prisoner up, and charged him with stealing the shoes. He at first denied taking them. Then he told me he would let me have them if I would let him go; I promised him I'd be favourable. Then he went and took them from a place where he had hid them, so I went to give him a mug of ale for his honesty, and he took an opportunity, while I was stooping, to shove me on my face and get out at the door; I went after him, and took him.</p>

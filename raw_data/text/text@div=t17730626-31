               <p>Q. What did they charge you with?</p>
               <p>Frances. They said it was charge for charge; one of my pockets was found in the watch-house; the other I have never seen since. The key I lost was the key of a tea chest; that was found in the watch-house.

               <p>Frances.

They run down the work-house passage; she got up, put her hat on, and walked down the street, and looked down the place where they run down but did not go after them, but went safely down the street; then they came out and looked at her; the evidence then ran after her; she turned short about and looked him in the face, and said she would follow him till tomorrow morning to have him taken, for he had robbed her; he turned back, and another man, I suppose the man that is absent, came out and took her in his arms, and pushed her into the passage; they came under my window before that, and one said what was that that dropped; Duncumb pulled it out of his bosom and said it was only 6 d.</p>

            . I am keeper of the watch-house in the liberty of Hatton Garden; when the prisoners were brought there; I asked who gave charge of them, and Low shewed me the prosecutrix; she said she had been robbed; I found the pocket and key in the watch-house, about nine or ten o'clock the night following; (they are produced). The prosecutrix would not tell where she lived otherwise she would not have gone to Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Job Low. I live on Saffron-hill: between three and four o'clock my wife told me she heard a cry of murder; I got up, went to the window, and saw the prisoners and two more going away from Mrs. Frances; I put on my clothes, went down and pursued them. Mrs. Frances was in a dreadful condition; they had robbed her of all she had: I took Topham and Duncan; Smith got away.</p>

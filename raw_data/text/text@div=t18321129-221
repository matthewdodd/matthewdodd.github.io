            . I was coming up Great St. Andrew-street on the 17th of November; I saw the prisoner and another man opposite Biggs' shop, looking in at the window; I watched them, and saw the prisoner go in - he came out in a minute, and joined the other; he had nothing then - the other then went in, came out, and went in a second time - I saw him give a box of segars to the prisoner - I ran and spoke to a Policeman - we run in pursuit of them; the prisoner turned up a gateway, and I took him with the box in his possession - it had thirty-seven segars in it; I should have had the other man taken afterwards, but could not identify his face.</p>

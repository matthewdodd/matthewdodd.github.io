On the 31st of December the prisoner came and had a bed at my house, he came down next morning between ten and eleven o'clock, and as he passed the bar he asked if he could have a bed at night again? I said Yes. In all, who was in the bar, said he had robbed him of a pair of sheets sometime ago. I immediately sent up to see if mine were safe. I found the sheets on his bed, but missed a pair off a bed in the next room; he ran out, we pursued him down West-street, and secured him on Little Saffron-hill, brought him back, and took the sheets from his person.</p>

            . I am a publican. I was at Lloyd's on the morning of the 1st of January, we were talking in the bar, the prisoner came down, and asked if he could sleep there that night, Lloyd said he could. When he was gone I said I believed he was the young man who had robbed me of a pair of sheets. Lloyd sent the servant up, she said she missed the sheets from the next room. I followed and took him on Little Saffron-hill, unbuttoned his clothes, took the sheets from round his body, and found a towel in his hat.</p>

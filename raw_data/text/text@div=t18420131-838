                  </hi>. In December, 1828, I was a constable of St. Mary's, Lambeth—I was at Kingston Assizes that month, and saw the prisoner there—I was present at his trial—another man, named John Wigg, was tried with him—I was in court when sentence of death was ordered to be recorded—I had known him before, and am quite sure he is the man who was then convicted, and sentenced—he was tried before Mr. Baron Vaughan, or Mr. Justice Burrows, I do not know which—they were both there at the time.</p>

               <p>whatever there is—I know there was formerly an Act of Parliament where there was a reward—I do not know whether there is now—I did not come into office till the rewards were put an end to—I was sworn in in 1817, and left in 1831 or 1832, on account of the new police being established—when I applied for my warrant to be renewed, they told me I was not wanted—I was not a constable of Union-hall, only as an extra-constable to assist the others—I was never on the establishment—I do not know that there was any other reason for my leaving—I had no fault found with me—I was never accused of anything—I gave evidence against a few men for the Mint—my conduct with respect to coin was never investigated to my knowledge—no fault was ever found with me to my face—I did not say when the prisoner was shown to me, that he was so much altered I should not have known him, nor any thing to that effect—that I swear—I am quite positive of him—I have not been inquiring about what money will be coming to me—I swear that—I have not been to the Secretary of State's office to inquire about any reward—I went there about a week or a fortnight ago—there was no quarrel between me and any other person about the way in which we were to get the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the County jail, at Horsemonger-lane. I remember the prisoner being brought to the jail, in 1828, with John Wigg—I cannot exactly say the date—I remember the Assizes being held at Kingston—it was before the Assizes that he was brought—I saw him go down to the Assizes, and I saw him after the Assizes—I took him on board the <hi rend="italic">Dolphin</hi> bulk, at Chatham, with other convicts—I was one of the guards—the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you cease to be an officer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When the new police came in force, that was the reason—I sent my warrant in—I was a parish-constable—I used not to be employed by the Mint—I used to go there occasionally—there was no investigation about my conduct—I was in business as a tobacconist, but have retired these two years—I have lived in the same house thirty years.</p>

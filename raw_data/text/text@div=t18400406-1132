                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Prescott. I have a son named John Matthew Carter, by a former husband—I was confined in bed in the month of February—I missed several articles, among them a squirrel tippet, which is worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a velvet waistcoat belonging to, my husband, which is worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was in a good state when it was lost—I charged my son with stealing the property—he denied it at the time; he afterwards proposed to go with his aunt somewhere—I got a policeman from the station-house, on the 2nd of March, and went to rose-lane, spi<lb></lb>talfields, with the policeman and Carter—I saw Mrs. Sheen there—I can hardly say if the prisoner is the person—she was not in widow's-weeds when I saw her—it was a person who represented himself as Mrs. Sheen—the person I saw before the Magistrate was the same I saw in Rose-lane—the policeman said he had come for same things she had got belonging to me, and named a waistcoat that the boy had brought—she said she did not know, but if we would come to-morrow morning she would see—the officer said he must have it now—he accompanied her up stairs, and when he came down he produced this waistcoat—I told the prisoner that Carter said he had sold it to her—(Carter was in the shop at the time)—she then denied all knowledge of it—Carter told her he had sold it to her—she denied it all throughout—I remained with the boy in the, shop—from a quarter to half an hour elapsed before they came down stairs—the officer asked me if I knew the waistcoat—the officer told her the boy had brought it to her, and sold it for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said he had left it there for food to the amount of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the boy said she had given him food—while the prisoner was up stairs a young woman in the shop gave me information—when the prisoner came down I told her she had a fur tippet, and she said I might come up with her and see—the officer said he thought he saw the tippet up there—I went up, and found it in a chest—the prisoner said, if that was mine, I could have it—I told her I knew it by a mark inside, for as it was coming from the country it got stained—I asked Carter, in her presence, whether he had sold it to her—he said he had for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said he had not told it to her, she had supplied him with articles of food; but he was at the same time in a place of employment, where he was found food.</p>

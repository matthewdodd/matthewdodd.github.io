               <p>On the 12th of August last, I lost a watch about three in the morning, I was coming home very fast from Islington, I was sober, and the prisoner ran after me in <placeName id="t17830910-62-crimeloc358">Fleet-street near Temple Bar</placeName>

               <p>Court. Did you ever get your watch again? - No.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person? - Yes, I charged the watch with her, and never let her go.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the woman searched at the time? - Yes, I believe she was.</p>
               <p>The written Defence of the Prisoner read.</p>
               <p>My Lord,</p>
               <p>Your Lordship's humanity being well known to persons under unhappy circumstances like mine, tried at this awful bar for life, and impoverished through a confinement of upwards of a month, loaded with grief and anxiety of mind, and destitute of friends to procure me the assistance of Council; emboldens me to rely on you, not only as a Judge, but an Advocate for unhappy prisoners; and as I never before was at a criminal bar, and being unfortunate, and not capable of either reading or writing, without disguise, I trouble you with my case.</p>
               <p>An unfortunate woman, to my shame, I must confess myself; the prosecutor I certainly picked up in the street, he was exceedingly in liquor, and no other woman was in company with me; we conversed together for some time, when at last he laid hold of both my hands, and said, I had robbed him of his watch; I told him, I had not, he never quitted me, I was charged with the watch and taken to the watch-house, which I was instantly, and by three men indecently examined, and searched; stript naked; but no watch was found on me.</p>
               <p>This, my Lord, is the true case, for I know nothing of the watch, nor had it; my defence I most humbly submit to your Lordship and to the judgment of the Jury, before whom I now stand, and if the evidence of the prosecution is so sufficiently strong as to pronounce me guilty; overwhelmed as I am at present, and much more so, if that awful sentence is given, having an aged father whose grief is unsupportable, I humbly pray that your Lordship will look on me as an object of mercy, and that I may live in future in the paths of piety.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Whenever the party robbed is privy to the robbery, and either sees or feels the thing taken from him, it ceases in respect to that party to be a private taking; therefore you will acquit her of taking privately.</p>

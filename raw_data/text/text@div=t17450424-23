             . The prisoner came into my shop the day before yesterday, and asked for a bit of cambrick, I shewed her some, and while I turned my back to take down some more, she stole these two remnants, and was going away with them beneath her apron. They were tied up, and lay upon the opposite counter. My servant told me she had something under her apron. I took the parcel out of her apron, whether it was fastened to a hook, or what, I can't tell: but there was something stopped it from coming out easily .</p>

             . The prisoner came into the shop about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for some cambrick. My mistress shewed her some; she said, she would go higher, and while my mistress turned round, she took something off the counter, and threw a shilling down. I saw her put something under her apron, and was going away; I told her she had something there that did not belong to her; she said, she had nothing; she went out at the door, and I called out stop thief, and this young man brought her back. I shook her apron, and saw the cloth in it, and my mistress took it out.</p>
               <p>A young lad, upon the cry of stop thief, brought her back, and saw the cloth taken from her.</p>

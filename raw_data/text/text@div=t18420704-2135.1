                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Greenwich. About a quarter past eleven o'clock am the morning of the 4th of July I was in town, and met an old pensioner—I got from him four sovereigns and a half-sovereign—I put them into a little pocket-book, which is marked with my husband's name, "George Hill," and put the pocket-book into a little basket—I saw the prisoner and another man watching another" pensioner, who was with the one I received the money from—I felt rather alarmed—I particularly noticed the prisoner—I took the basket and money, and went into Mrs. Mussett's—I set my basket on a chair at the back of her shop—I am sure the prisoner was watching me—I had not been in a minute before he came in, threw a handkerchief over my basket, and ran out with it—Mrs. Mussett ran out—I followed, and saw him drop my basket between the barracks, after he got into the Tower.</p>

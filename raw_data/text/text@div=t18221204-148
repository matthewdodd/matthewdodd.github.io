On the 5th of December, about a quarter past seven o'clock, in the morning, this meat was in my shop; it weighed ten pounds. I found it afterwards in the officer's possession, and knew it. It was two hands of pork and a leg of beef.</p>

            . On the night of the 5th of December, about eight o'clock, I met the prisoner in Golden-lane, with something in his apron; he said it was ham; I found it was two hands of pork, and a piece of beef. He said the boys who were with him gave it him. He told the magistrate that the boys went into the shop, telling him they were going to take the beef; that they brought it out and gave it him to sell, and he was to have fourpence for his trouble. It was claimed by Janes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met three boys on Saffron-hill, they said they were going into the shop to buy a bit of beef, and if I would carry it to Playhouse-yard they would give me fourpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Gregory-street, Pimlico. On Friday evening, the 15th of Oct., I left my work, in the King's-road—I locked my box containing my tools, and left it there—I had a saw in it—next morning, at six o'clock, I went to the place—the box was still there, but the lid had been forced open—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther the saw was there then or not, for I had no occasion to use it—on the Monday morning I wanted it, and found it was gone—I questioned the men about it—I went to Preddy's beer-house on the Wednesday after, and saw it in his possession—this now produced is it—it has my name on it—in consequence of what I heard, I gave the prisoner into custody next rooming—I told him what it was for—he said he knew nothing about it—he was at work on the same premises.</p>

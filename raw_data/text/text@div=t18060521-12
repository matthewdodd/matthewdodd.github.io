               <p>Q. How much. - A. He did not say how much, he took it out of my shop, under the idea of taking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210009"></xptr>it to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when he went out of the shop. - A. I cannot say particularly, he generally went out between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce the entry made by himself on his return. - A. There is an entry there of his own writing (witness producing a book); Clift, six and a half yards of velvet, twelve shillings a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. That would be three pound eighteen shillings. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the manner in which he accounted to you for part of the velvet he had taken out that morning. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposing this to be true, you sent in your account to Messrs. Clift and Cockhill. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. You gave him leave to take them away in consequence of that false pretence. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Has the prisoner at the bar called on you with articles of sale. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of receiving orders for Mr. Harrison, whatever order I received from Miss Clift, or any other person's order, I entered down in my book; during the time I was at Mr. Thresher's, Mr. Harrison came after me, he wished to get me away, he knew I had a good connection, and during the time I was in his house he never went round to one customer, I have even given him the money in public company, he has been the person that has introduced me into company, (for singing) which has been my ruin.</p>

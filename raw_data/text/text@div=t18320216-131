               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you given the Court an account of all that passed? A. No, I have as far as the questions were asked me - I went at eight o'clock that morning, according to appointment, to Mr. Hall's; Hall and Cooper were there - I was searched, and they found nothing on me; they gave me five good sixpences, and directed me to go to the prisoner's residence, where I had appointed to meet him - he was in bed: I knocked at the window, and he let me in; I stopped till he dressed - we went on to the Black Dog, and he told me to go in and wait till he came to me; he came and brought the ten bad shillings; he had before asked me what I wanted, and I said half a score, as usual - I should have told this had I been asked; he had appointed me to go to his house, and if he was in bed his hat was to be in the chair; I could look over the curtain into his room - I had made that appointment at the Feathers, in Castle-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160053"></xptr>street; I was in the Police, but was discharged about three months ago - this is the first transaction of the kind I have been engaged in, but I had made purchases of the prisoner three times before; I was introduced to him by a person whom I only know by the name of Jack - I was turned out of the Police because my serjeant did not please me, and I used language to him, which I ought not to have done; I have since been employed by different persons, and was at work at a wine-vaults till half-past eight o'clock last night - I was sixteen months in the Police, and before that I drove an omnibus from Turnham-green.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Hatton-garden. In consequence of information I received, I applied to Daniel to assist me in taking the prisoner; the first transaction was on the 10th of January; when I receive information I inform the Mint - on the 18th Daniel came to my house at eight o'clock in the morning; I satisfied myself he had no money - I then gave him five marked sixpences, and 6d. in copper - he walked before us to Church-street, he went into Turville-street, and up a court; I then saw him and the prisoner coming back - they went as far as the Black Dog; Daniel went in there, and the prisoner went on - I went into a shop opposite, and in ten minutes I saw the prisoner come back, go into the Black Dog, and almost immediately come out with Daniel - I saw him give something to Daniel; I then crossed, and took the prisoner - Cooper was in another house; I saw the prisoner put his hand to his mouth - I pushed him into the house, and asked what he had in his mounth; I put my hand to the back of his head, and said I would have it out- he put up his hand, and I put up mine; the five sixpences which I had marked and given to Daniel, came out of his mouth: Cooper took this paper parcel from Daniel's hand - it contains ten bad shillings; we then all went to the office - the prisoner said, "I suppose this is a plant upon me, and I must make up my mind to be lagged, but I ought to have been down to that cove."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it by accident you went to the Black Dog? A. No, Daniel told me he was to go there: I saw a parcel given to Daniel; I should think I was about ten yards off; it was given quite openly; the prisoner took the money in his hand, and looked at it; then gave the parcel to Daniel; I was in a sale shop opposite; I had not introduced him to the prisoner, but I caused him to be introduced by a person I have known a long time, who is a very respectable man, and works for some of the first houses in the City of London.</p>

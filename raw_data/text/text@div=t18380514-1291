On the 20th of April, a young woman came and knocked at the door and gave me information—I saw the parlour window open, which I had seen shut ten minutes before, and the wire blind forced off—I missed two decanter stands and a flageolet, from the cheffioneer, in the front parlour—I saw nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . My husband is a gentleman's butler; I live at Mr. Broxup's. On the 26th of March I was at tea in the room behind the shop; about six o'clock in the evening I heard a noise in the shop; I opened the room door and went into the shop - I saw two persons standing there, one (taller than the prisoner) apparently reaching over the counter - the prisoner who was the other was standing behind him; they could get the combs out of the glass case by reaching over the counter. I went round the counter, and saw the glass case was disturbed; the tall man asked me for something - I paid no attention to that but said to him, "Where is the other man gone? what is he gone for?" (the prisoner had then gone out) - the other man said "What's the matter? Have you lost any thing?" I missed some combs; he picked up his hat immediately, and said he would go after the man - but he took a contrary direction. I went out and caught sight of the prisoner about fifty yards off - secured him myself and brought him back; one comb was found in his pocket and two in his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you notice the prisoner when in the shop, so as to know him; A. Quite so.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to Queen-square Office, with three combs; I found a 5s. piece on him; also a farthing gilded to imitate a sovereign, and two new handkerchiefs,(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

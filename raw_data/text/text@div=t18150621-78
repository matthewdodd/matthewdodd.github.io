            . I am an officer belonging to Bow-street office. On the 12th of May, about nine in the evening, I observed the prisoner at the bar going towards <placeName id="t18150621-78-crimeloc449">Charing Cross, near St. Martin's Church</placeName>

I saw him following a gentleman about one hundred yards, and then he turned after a gentleman, whose name I afterwards found to be Haram. He passed him, and touched it; he then put his hand in, 
               <persName id="t18150621-78-person686">drew</persName>
             a silk handkerchief from him, wiped his mouth with it, and then put it into his side pocket. I immediately ran across the way and seized him. I tapped the gentleman on the shoulder and told him the circumstance; and he said he just wanted his handkerchief, and missed it. He said the handkerchief was his, in the presence of the prisoner. The gentleman gave me his card, which was, Captain

            , No. 84, Bloomsbury Square; and he said he would wait at Bow-street the next morning; but he did not. On enquiring at No. 34, Bloomsbury Square, I was told he was an <rs id="t18150621-78-viclabel450" type="occupation">India Captain</rs>

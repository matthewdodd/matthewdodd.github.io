When I went up Stairs I found most of the Locks broke, and where the Locks were whole, the Doors were split in 'peces.

            . I am a Broker and live in Harp-Alley. On the 1st of October the Prisoner offered me 2 Stove-Grates for Sale, but I suspecting them to be stolen, stopped the Grates, and him too. I took him to an Alehouse, and while I was talking with some People, he ran away, and I never saw him again 'till now. After this I took a Boat and went to Fulham to search the Prisoner's House, and found this Glass in a Chest of Drawers, and a Sconce-Glass under his Bed, but he was not at Home himself.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Davis. This Glass is mine, and one of the three which I lost at that Time.</p>
               <p>- Lacey. I was Constable of Fulham, and this Man desired me to search the Prisoner's House: Accordingly I did, and the first Thing I found was one Feather Bed under another, and then this Glass, a Window Curtain, and 10 or 15 Blankets; some of the Things were in one Place, some in another. After we had searched about some Time, we perceived a Sort of a Closet, and on demanding an Entrance into it, the Prisoner's Wife said, there was nothing but Corn in it; however, I took a Poker, threw the Door off the Hooks, and found 2 Bolsters , 10 Blankets, a Box of China, and 2 Feather Beds under the Corn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says he took a Poker to force the Door open, was it locked or bolted?</p>
               <p>Lacey. The Door opens into the Closet, and it was so secured that we could hardly get it open.</p>

            . I live next Door to Mrs. Davis at Fulham. My Daughter informed me that some Damage was done at Mrs. Davis's, upon that I went down the Garden and saw the Parlour Door open. I stepped in and cried Holla! who is in the House! But no Body answering, I went round the House and saw the Kitchen Doors open; a Window Case taken out of the Brick Work and thrown on the Ground, and the Casement lying by it. I then called my Neighbours, and we went in together, and saw that the House had been ranshackled very much.

               <p>Jury. Q. How far was the first paling from your warehouse? - A. About 50 yards, and the second paling is about 150 yards; I went back to get one of our men of the name of Robertson; I went with him to see if we could trace it, and we found the trace of a six inch wheeled cart, which went up to a brick-kiln, and we concluded that it must have been taken away in that cart; we traced the cart up the road towards Islington, about thirty or forty yards; we could not find any further track, then we lost it; we enquired at Islington turnpike, and found that several carts had come through, but none had gone through; as we could get no information, we turned back again; at the meeting of the two roads, at the corner of the City-road, we found the track of the cart again, and traced it down to the City road turnpike, and enquired if any cart had gone through; the man said, there was a cart with two horses went through about two o'clock, but did not know what it was loaded with; we came to Old-street end, and could not find any track; we then turned back again to the corner of Hoxton, by the Three Crowns, and there we found it again, it had turned up a back lane to the left hand.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What hour was this? - A. Between four and five, near upon five; we traced the cart up the back lane, to a lane that goes up to the white lead mills, by the Rosemary-branch, and there was a six inch wheel waggon before us, and we were afraid of losing the track, and we ran on before the waggon, and caught the track again, and traced it into a dust yard, at the high end of Hoxton; we went up to the gate of the yard, but did not see any thing like a cart; we staid about a minute, and then we went down the road to Old-street gate, and enquired if any cart had gone through there, and they said, no; then we went back to call up Mr. Lee's clerk, and we went to the Police Office for Mr. Armstrong,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220040"></xptr>and we went up with him to this dust-yard, in Hoxton; he went into the yard, and saw the man that it belongs to, I believe his name is Norris; he asked the man if he had any carts out that night, he said, he had lent one the night before; but what time it went out, or what time it came in, he could not tell, it was to go out in the night; Armstrong asked him who he had lent it to, he said, to the landlord at the King's arms, Mr. Bedell; he asked Armstrong to go with him to the King's-arms, which we did, the girl said, her master was come home, but what time she did not know; he then called Bedell up, he came in his shirt sleeves, Armstrong told him he must put his coat on and go with us; when he put his coat on, it was all covered with flax , but we did not find any there; Armstrong desired us to take care of the landlord while he went up stairs, he brought Chandler down with his coat covered with flax , of the same sort we had lost; after Chandler was brought down, Armstrong and Bedell went into a corner, and what conversation they had, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Do you know any thing of this Norris? - A. No; I did not know that I should if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some flax  hanging about some palings? - A. Yes; and some flax  hanging about the bar of Bedell's house.</p>
               <p>Q. So that yourself, or any body else, might brush it off upon their clothes by going past? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Norris said, he had lent his cart to the landlord? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it tied in whisps, or what? - A. Yes; in whisps.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Norris? - A. A scavenger; a common carman.</p>

               <p>Q. What hour was it when you went to Bedell's house? - A. Near seven, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as state what conversation you had with Bedell previous to his saying that is one of the men? - A. Bedell denied it at first; and after he was pressed hard, he said it; and then, I going up stairs, and seeing Chandler's coat in that condition.</p>
               <p>Q. Bedell was in custody at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took Brown, how was he employed? - A. He was walking along very near Bedell's house; but whether Brown had seen us with Bedell first, or not, he certainly passed Bedell's house; I cannot say whether he was going in or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Bedell pretty well, I believe, don't you? - A. No; I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any other charge against him? - A. No; I know there is some tin he was good enough to inform the Magistrate of afterwards; but he informed the Magistrate of that, and not me; there are some people in custody for it.</p>

               <p>I am one of the Police officers: I apprehended Townsend, on Saturday the 7th of May, just above the King's-Arms, in Hoxton; he came up to the house and looked in at the gateway; I saw him look in; I called to the landlady and asked her if that was one of the men; she said, yes; and I went and apprehended him; his outside jacket had the appearance of flax upon it; he came very quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. These men are all coal-porters, or corn-porters, by trade, are they not? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Townsend is? - A. No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes, all of them. I keep the Kings-Arms, at Hoxton: On Friday evening, the 6th of May, all the prisoners came to my house; I had met Townsend before that about six o'clock in the evening; Townsend said, he understood I had carts and horses to let; I told him I did business for Mr. Norris; very well, says he, if I should want a cart you can let me have one; I said, yes; I went home about eight o'clock and had some tea, there were a great many people in the house; he said he should want it pretty soon; all the prisoners were there at that time; he said, he wanted to move the things before he went to work in the morning, he did not say what things; they went away then all four of them together; about half past eleven I shut up my house, and went to bed; and, about one o'clock in the morning, somebody came and called me, and I got up and went down to the door, and Chandler was at the door; he said, the men wanted me to move the things for them; why, says I, it is very early in the morning; I harnessed the two horses, it was a six-inch wheel cart, a brick cart; he told me to go to the end of Goswell-street road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what you were to go for? - A. No; when I got there, Morris came up and laid hold of the fore-horse, and led him into the brick-field, and there I saw this quantity of tow; I said, in the name of God what have you got here; he said, never mind, turn your cart about, and take it up; they were all there then; when Chandler and I came with the cart, I found the other three there, and they were all present when it was put into the cart; I told them I would not take it up; Morris said, damn you, must take it up, there is no harm can come of it, and I did take it up; I took it home, and they all went with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did you go house? - A. Down the City-road, and up Mr. Scott's lane, that leads up to Mr. Scott's brick fields, by the Rosemarry-branch, and to the Lead Mills, I drove it into our own yard, Mr. Norris's; I took the horses out, and told them I should have no further to do with it, and put the horses in the stable, and they put it into a grain hole, and wished me a good morning; Chandler asked me if he could sleep at my house, I said, yes, he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the flax put into this grain hole? - A. No; I saw them carry it that way; I was very badly frightened.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did they pay you any money for the hire of your cart? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told us the truth about the matter? - A. I hope so, when I have taken my oath upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. How often have you been here before? - A. Never in all my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never apprehended before? - A. I never was before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220042"></xptr>Q. You were servant some time to Mr. Thomson the coal-merchant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to part with him? - A. On the 1st of August all the men struck for wages, and I did not go to work as the others did, and he would not let me go to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not scandalously charge you with a little misbehaviour? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. If he should be here, and say so, he would not swear truly? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And no one charged you with any misdemeanor in Mr. Thomson's service? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These men were all at your house the evening before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Playing at skittles? - A. There is no skittle-ground; they were playing at four corners.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never been before a Magistrate before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the story about the tin is all untrue? - A. I moved the tin for Chandler and Salmon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have been before a Magistrate before? - A. It is all one concern; they were all taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you fetch the tin away? - A. In May.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you let your cart for when you fetched the tin? - A. They were to satisfy me for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did they ever do that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. And when you were before the Magistrate, and the tin story came out, you thought it best to run away? - A. There was a man swore a very wrong thing against me, it was proved that he took a false oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Which so alarmed you that you run away? - A. I did not know but that man would swear my life away.</p>
               <p>Q. You were brought back and hand-cuffed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time, you have described you only worked for Mr. Norris; you had no suspicion of any thing going on wrong? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. And when Armstrong asked you about the cart, you told him truly at once all about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Armstrong has swore falsely, if he has said you denied it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you let out carts and horses? - A. I transact Mr. Norris's business for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. He deals in butter and pigs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other things besides? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it never happen to him to be taken up, within your knowledge? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not the curiosity to ask what goods they were going to move? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was all the same to you what kind of goods they had to move? - A. I did not ask them.</p>
               <p>Q. But very innocently went and fetched the cart, without asking what they would give you for it, or what you were to fetch? - A. They said they would satisfy me for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them happened to say they would satisfy you for your trouble? - A. Townsend.</p>
               <p>Q. Chandler was pretty merry at your house the night before? - A. They had been there, and were merry, and a great many more.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember Chandler being pretty drunk the night before, don't you? - A. I cannot say the man was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he so drunk that he was obliged go to-bed? - A. No, he was not; he did not go to-bed till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You let lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the flax put into the grain hole? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you said, I will have nothing to do with it, you had no suspicion then, I suppose? - A. I did not know what to make of it; I did not think it was come honestly by, and I was very badly frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know any thing about the tin being hid under the dung? - A. It was not hid under the dung, it was under a manger, where any body that came into the stable might see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the Magistrate, that it was hid under the dung, in your information? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. All you have been telling now is as true as that? - A. What I have said is true.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Lee was so good as to intimate to you, that if you discovered other persons and cleared yourself, you would be safe? - A. I never saw Mr. Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. James intimated that to you, I believe? - A. He told me, now young man, do you tell who had your cart; you cannot be hurt in it; and I said, I would tell him who had my cart, and I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you understood as the only means of saving yourself? - A. I did not know the dangers of it, till such time as I saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Before you were handcuffed you gave the account of the tin to the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This tin four people were concerned in? - A. No; Chandler and Salmon were the two people I had the tin from.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been asked, whether you made any bargain? You made no particular bargain, but they told you they would satisfy you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What trade are these people? - A. They work at the water-side as coal-porters.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; I know the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember them all coming to your house the night before this robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your husband and Chandler sleeping in your house? - A. I don't know that Chandler slept there; my husband was called up early in the morning; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. I believe you know the gentlemen were so good as to say they would let your husband off if he would turn evidence? - A. I don't know any such thing. (The property was produced.)</p>
               <p>Robertson. This bundle was wrought by one Leach, and this by one Knowles; it is their manner of tying them up; I have not the smallest doubt they are Mr. Lee's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Different workmen work in the same way? - A. I examine all the work myself, and what is not done properly I return; and what is done properly I make up; there is but one other shop in town that lays down flax in this manner, of this sort of flax; this is only fit for sail-cloth and sacking.</p>
               <p>Q. If that was among half a dozen other bundles you would not have been able to pick it out? - A. Yes, I should; I know it by the lay down; I am sure it is Mr. Lee's property.</p>
               <p>Chandler's defence. I know nothing at all about the robbery; I slept at Bedell's that night; there were fises and drums and dancing, and I was pretty much in liquor, and slept there; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Townsend's defence. I know nothing at all of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Morris's defence. I know nothing at all of the matter.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. That afternoon I went over to Bedell's, and sat there the afternoon drinking and smoaking till near eleven o'clock, in company with one Lawrence; I know nothing at all about it.</p>

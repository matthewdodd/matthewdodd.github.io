               <p>Mrs. SHEPHERD sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: On the 12th of September, the prisoner came into our shop; as she was looking at some printed cottons, I saw a piece drop from behind her upon the ground; I took it up, and called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200086"></xptr>Mr. Shepherd; I asked him if he had sold it, her, he said, he had not; he came on the side on which the prisoner was standing, and threw her cloak aside; I then observed another remnant of print fall from her waist, which I took from the ground, likewise a piece that she had tied round her waist; I took out a gown piece which she had tucked in her handkerchief, and gave it to Mr. Shepherd; the constable has got the property.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of July I was on duty, and saw Stamp coming along with these articles on his shoulder, in a sack - the other two prisoners were eight or ten yards from him; I asked what was in the sack, and desired him to shoot it out, which he did - he said he had brought them from Mr. Giles a saddler. in the Borough, and he was going to take them to Mr. Smith, a rubbish-carter - the other two then came over, and confirmed his account; I said, "You must go with me to the station-house" - I went to Mr. Smith, and he said it did not belong to him; he is a rubbish-carter, and lives in Vauxhall-road - I then went to a collar-maker who he said he got it from, and took one of the initials; he said he did not know it - I then took the prisoner before the magistrate, and the witness swore to the property.</p>
               <p>Harding's Defence. I was going over to Gravel-lane- a man came, and asked me to assist him; I was coming along the road, and saw these prisoners - I did not know any thing of them; I went over to see what it was.</p>
               <p>Clements's Defence. I was working with Harding - I went down to the watch-house with Stamp, and they locked me in.</p>
               <p>Stamp's Defence. I went to Mr. Johnson's to get work, and a man asked me to carry this to Westminsterbridge.</p>

I have known the prisoner about a fortnight - he slept in the next room to me on Monday morning, the 5th of May; I got up at seven o'clock, to work - I then went up stairs for my money, to settle with my master; I missed my waistcoat, four silk handkerchiefs, and this money - the prisoner was then gone; I asked the chambermaid if she had been up stairs - she said No: the prisoner had been about a fortnight in the neighbourhood, <rs id="t18300708-120-deflabel686" type="occupation">making hay</rs>

               <p>THOMAS SOPER. I went and took the prisoner, who was in the custody of two witnesses; I have four silk handkerchiefs, a waistcoat, and 42s., in half-crowns, shillings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080065"></xptr>and sixpences - I searched him, and found in his breeches pocket 3l. 2s. in silver; I then asked about the waistcoat: Kennaird said,</p>
               <p>"I saw him stooping under a tree" - I went and found the handkerchief and waistcoat there.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNAIRD. I am a labourer. I saw the prisoner at the top of a field; I called to a man to stop him, as I had seen him run across a field, and stoop under a hedge - I showed Soper the spot: I saw him come out of the back door of the public-house; he went past his work - the mistress of the house and the waiter asked me where the countryman was gone.</p>

            . I saw Cooper run across the field, and the witness after him; I and my mate ran and stopped him - I saw him pull a small bundle out of his hat, and put it under his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear I pulled these out of my hat? A. No; I cannot tell what they were.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PLUMRIDGE. These articles are mine - I had left the money in my trousers on the Sunday, and on the Monday morning it was quite safe.</p>

On Sunday the 28th of August in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070008"></xptr> afternoon I was going out; before I went out I looked in my till, there were thirteen guineas and a moidore; in the evening when I returned, between eight and nine, I missed four guineas; I enquired where the prisoner was gone, and was told he was gone to take care of a horse; I got a constable; when the prisoner came home I got him into the parlour, I asked him what money he had in his pocket; he said he had none but his own; I said, I was sure he had more, for no body had been at the till since I went out but himself, and desired he would pull his money out; upon which he pulled out three guineas and two half guineas; I had marked the money in the till before I went out, with a scratch over the nose on the head; the three guineas and one of the half guineas were so marked, which the constable put in a piece of paper, and put in his pocket; I thought I had marked every guinea and half guinea in the till, every one of them left in the till were marked; I think I left the till locked when I went out, and at my coming home I found it unlocked; I usually kept it locked.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did the prisoner give of this money found in his pocket?</p>
               <p>Russell. He told me it was the first time he ever attempted any thing of that sort, and hoped I would not hurt him.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Russell. When the prisoner came first to me he behaved as well as a servant could, but lately he has fallen into bad company, and has not behaved so well.</p>

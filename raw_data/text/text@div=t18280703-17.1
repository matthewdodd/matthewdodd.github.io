            . I am an officer. I was coming up Wormwood-street, and saw the prisoner with two more waiting about at the prosecutors' premises, and in a few minutes I saw one of the others come out of the shop with a parcel; they all three turned up a court; I went in and asked Mr. Hurren if he had lost anything. - I went out, but could not see them; I was going down Threadneedle-street in a chaise in about ten minutes and saw them all three together - the prisoner then had the parcel and when he saw me pull up the chaise, the threw it down and ran away - I jumped out and took it up; I lost sight of him for five or ten minutes, and saw him again in Bishopsgate-street; he was stopped by Thompson, who was in the chaise with me; I delivered the parcel to Mr. Hurren - I am quite certain of the prisoner.</p>

I beg to state that I have lately come from Sheffield and am a perfect stranger to the schemes and villanies of London; I met two young men, one of whom I knew at Sheffield - they took me into a house and gave me some ale; in Wormwood-street one of them came up behind and gave me the parcel to carry - when the officer came up, they told me to run away, which I did, and threw the parcel down.</p>

On the 25th of May, about a quarter after six in the morning, I was alarmed by a number of people at my door. I jumped out of bed, but before I had got my things on, my servant came up and told me somebody had stole a cup. I went down as soon as I could: there I found the prisoner in custody of some of my neighbours servants. There were the different articles as laid in the indictment upon the counter. They told me there was the prisoner, and the things that he had stole. (Produced in court and deposed to.) I sent for a constable, and he was committed.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I happened to get up that morning: as I opened the door I heard the spoons gingle, and saw the prisoner stepping out of the parlour into the shop. He ran out, and I after him as soon as I could, and called, Stop thief! He was taken by Mr. Hatton, a butcher, that lives near us. I saw him throw down the things at the bottom of the court (mentioning them); they were taken up by some man and delivered to me. The prisoner was taken in about ten minutes.</p>

In the course of the first week she was with me I missed a great many tippets; I did not know how they went; one morning, the week following, she took a tippet out of the first floor, when she went down stairs to get her water, and took the tippet up stairs with her; I missed the tippet.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you immediately follow her? - A. No; about one o'clock in the day I sent for an officer; it was found upon her; she had tied the tippet under her cloaths; I saw her untie it, and she laid it on a chair.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I know it to be mine; there is my private mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in great distress and poverty, with three small children, which induced me to do so rash an act, and my husband having been sick for eight months; it is the first time that my character was ever impeached, and from my extreme poverty in the world compelled me to do this, through my dear unfortunate babes; thus I leave my situation to the mercy of my prosecutor, and the humanity of a British Jury; if my witnesses are not in Court it is owing to their not being subpoenaed at Hick's Hall; and if I should find lenity, my future life shall be dedicated to the strictest of principles; I was given to understand by one of my witnesses, that my prosecutor offered to settle my prosecution for ten pounds, which I trust the Jury will take into consideration, as it was out of my power to comply with it.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. I am a journeyman smith employed by Mr. Glover. On the sixth of November, between eight and nine at night I was going up the staircase of my master's back premises, I clapped my hand on the prisoner Cross's head; not knowing who he was, I asked who was there, he made no answer. The people that lived over-head, on that staircase, were coming up the yard, a girl called to her mother; directly Cross got up, I heard him pull his hand out of the shop from between the boards that parted the staircase from the shop; when he got up, he asked me whether I wanted to hurt him; I replied no, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040075"></xptr>did not want to hurt him, but I should not suffer it, as I had seen him concealed in a place where I thought he had no business; he directly called me out of the yard, and by the public-house door he begged and prayed that I would not hurt him, nor say any thing to the master; I made answer, I could say no more to him; I advised him to go home to his apartment; I made my way to the front of the house and left him; I knocked at the door, and asked if the master was at home, I found he was not; I got a candle and went to the back part of the shop where I had seen the prisoner, and there I found on the wainscoating a board pushed or forced out at one end, about nine or ten inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a person from there take any thing out of the shop? - A. Very easily; he could reach the iron, or any article that had been placed there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been at work there near about that time? - A. About half an hour before that time; his hour to leave the shop was eight o'clock. Cross came to me the next morning when I first came to work, he asked me if I had said any thing to the master about it; I told him I had nothing to say to him; I dare say the master knew it before this time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so dark that you could not see the man nor the hand? - A. No, I did not see him, but I knew the man by his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you was on the staircase that you had the conversation with him? - A. Upwards of five minutes afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of the information that you received, did you send for Cross after his breakfast time? - A. I did. After I first came into the shop Oliver came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. From that information did you afterwards miss any of your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the articles contained in the indictment, the screws, rods, and all of them? - A. I could not miss the rods, I have so many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hole at the staircase, at the back of your warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance at the hole of any thing having gone through there? - A. Not through there; underneath the door there was the appearance of something having been drawn through; there was a hole underneath the door, about six inches in length, quite down to the ground, it appeared as if a bundle of rod iron had been drawn through the hole by the ground being disturbed, and the hole was very much scratched. I waited for two hours after breakfast-time to see if he came; he did not come; I sent my clerk for him and he came immediately. When he came in the began to cry, saying, he hoped I would forgive him, for he had taken nothing away, he had only made an attempt; I told him I was sure that there must be some iron gone, for I had seen that the ground had been disturbed, it must have been dragged under the door; the prisoner said, if I would forgive him, he would tell me where he had sold it, and what he had taken; I told him I would, if he told me the truth, but if I found one article more than he told me, I would prosecute him. He told me that he took one bundle of iron, and two dozen of large size stump joints.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these taken at one, or at different time? - A. I believe at different time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Now your counsel will tell you that you must confine yourself to one single fact, of taking at one time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I will take the bundle of iron. - You are to confine yourself to the bundle of rod iron. Did you afterwards go with Cross to Hamerton's and find the bundle of rods? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he tell you where he took the bundle of iron rods to? - A. Yes. He told me he took the bundle of iron rods to Hamerton, before Oliver catched him on the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bundle found? - A. No, my brother did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bundle that was produced, and found there in the cellar your property? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was; he found that and other property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose the prisoner was taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hamerton taken into custody? - A. No, Hamerton was not at home at this time; his wife was.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no other proof than the man saying they were your brother's? - A. No other proof than Cross shewing them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had been in Berkshire, and you had seen it in the market place, should you have known it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Does the recollection of the rods that you had seen in your brother's possession confirm that what Cross says is true? - A. I believe what Cross says to be true; he found it in the dark place; he said he had put it there.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Buckley.) You apprehended Hamerton? - A. I did, about nine o'clock the same night in his one pair of stairs room, after searching for him in different places.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between him and you? - A. Nothing very material; he seemed to know very little about the business at first, but after a time he said he heard of it about three or four hours ago; he seemed to be sorry for his wife; because not finding him, I took the wife to the watchhouse; I told him he was very wrong that he did not come forward, as she then might be liberated.</p>

               <p>Went and Hamerton were not put on their defence.</p>

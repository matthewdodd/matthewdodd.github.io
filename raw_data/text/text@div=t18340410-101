            . I am a policeman. On Saturday night, the 22nd of February, about a quarter past nine o'clock, I was in Crawford-street, and was called by Mrs. Butler - I went into her shop - the prisoner was there - I neither threatened nor made her any promise - I went down into the area and found one ring - the prisoner said, in going to the station-house, that this was not the shop she intended to rob; for she had marked out a watch or two in another shop higher up; but through being lazy, and drinking with another man, she was too late, and the shop was shut up - she thought she must have something, so broke this window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor, and did not know what I was about - as for breaking the window, I have no recollection of it, nor how they ever came into my hand at all.</p>
               <p>HENRY SAUNDERS. She had been drinking, but not so as not to know what she was about.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 24th of September, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner with this carpet, in Albany-street, about two hundred yards from the carpet-ground; I asked where he got it - he said from the carpet-ground, and that he was going to Newport-market; I said, "Where is your stick?" he said, "I belong to the ground, and we leave them there;" I again said, "Where are you going to take it?" he then said to Oxford-market, then to the Plasterers' Arms, and then to the Queen's Arms: I went to the carpet-ground - the master said the prisoner had been forbidden to come to the ground, and if the carpet had been left there it should have been taken to him, as he was answerable for it; the prisoner said he had been working with Waugh, who had left the carpet for him to carry.</p>

               <p>- MILLER. I am an officer of Lambeth-street office; I received information that the prisoner was on board a ship at Gravesend; when I got there I saw him coming on shore in a boat; I saw him searched; I saw this watch found upon his person; he was searched in the mayor's house at Gravesend, by one of the mayor's officers; I believe the watch was taken from the inside of his sash; these articles were behind him in a window seat, this ten yards of blue woollen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was in possession of it or not - A. I do not. It was a pinchbeck watch, the chain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120045"></xptr>is gold.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no duplicates - A. No; all that I speak of is the watch, and the cloth; these trowsers were taken from his person, and one pair of small clothes from his person, and one pair in the bundle.</p>
               <p>[The prosecutor being a foreigner was examined through the medium of an interpreter; the prisoner also had an interpreter.]</p>

               <p>SIDY HADGE ABEDELINZED BONHALEL. Q. to interpreter. Ask him what he is and where he lived - A. He is a <rs id="t18090412-57-viclabel342" type="occupation">Mahometan</rs>

On the 28th of March, he lost a watch, chain, and seal; he saw them the night before; he missed them on the 28th of March in the morning when he came into his apartment, and he found the prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Ask him whether the prisoner used to visit him in that house, or how the prisoner could get at them - A. He took him out of the street, to give him provision out of charity.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been with him - A. Five or six weeks; he slept in another room with his servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether he slept in his apartment on the 27th of March - A. He slept there the night before the morning of the robbery, he saw him; the things were not locked up, they were on a chair, and me watch hung up in the room; he never saw the prisoner after these things were missing till he was brought before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Ask him if the prisoner had given him any notice of leaving him - A. No; he gave information to the public office, and published hand-bills.</p>

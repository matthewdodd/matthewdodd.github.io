                  </hi>. I live at 25, Pratt-street, Camden-town, and am an undertaker's man. Last Saturday night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in Victoria-street—the prisoner Williams stopped me, and asked me to go home with her—I asked her where—she said down a court in Field-lane—I asked her whereabouts—she said "Just down here, not far"—at the same time a man came up, put his left arm round my waist, struck me a blow under the ear, and ran away—I called "Police!" looked round, and saw the man running towards Field-lane—I missed my watch, seal, guard, and key—two men in private clothes, who said they were policeman, came up, arres-ted Williams, and found the watch on her—it was a silk guard, gold key and seal—I have not found them—this is my watch(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Moram appears the same size as the man, and he had a cap on—Moram had one on at the station that night.</p>

               <p>in Victoria-street, at the bottom of Saffron-hill, which is not many yards from Field-lane, and about 300 yards from Fox's-court, Gray's-inn-lane—I heard a cry of "Police!" saw Williams struggling with the prosecutor, and took her into custody—I found this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in her hand—I took her to the station—I saw a man run away, and, to the best of my belief, Moram is the man; I saw him in custody about twenty minutes after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potman and waiter, and live at Pickett's-place, Strand. Last Saturday night, about twenty minutes-past eleven o'clock, I was standing at a post in Victoria-street—I saw Moram go across the road towards a man and woman who were standing by the rails—he put his left arm round the prosecutor's waist, struck him with his right fist at the side of the head, and ran off—there was a cry of "Police"—I went after the pri-soner, and when I got to the corner of Field-lane I was tripped up by some males and females—I then ran back, and saw Williams in custody—when I first saw Moram I was walking towards him, and was about a yard and a half, or two yards from him, and I had a good look at him, and gave Fisher a description of him—we went to several places, and at last found him standing at the corner of a narrow dark court in Fox-court, Gray's-inn-lane—the in-stant I saw him I said he was the man—Fisher arrested him, and told him the charge—he said it was a d—d lie, he had not been in Victoria-street all that day—he resisted very much—Fisher was obliged to call two more police-men before he could secure him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you saw him run away, you began to believe it was Moram? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I never saw Baker before that night—he is no trap of mine—I understand a <hi rend="italic">trap</hi> to mean a man who goes about with policemen, getting evidence—Moram resisted very violently—I did not hear Roberts say at the station, "That is not the man"—he said, "To the best of my belief, that (is the man"—I did not hear Baker say, "Yes, that is the man; I saw him strike you"—Roberts did not then come forward and swear to him—I was at Guildhall when this charge was heard—after the Magistrate had given the prisoners the ordinary caution, I did not see that Moram was about to make a statement—I did not hear the Alderman say, "It will be better for you to reserve what you have to say till your trial;" I will not swear he did not—Moram said he had nothing to say—I did not pass him by three times before I arrested him—I went straight up to him—I did not show him to Baker before I went up to him—Baker saw him at the same time as I did.</p>

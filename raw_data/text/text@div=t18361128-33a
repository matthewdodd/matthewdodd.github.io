                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Twickenham. On the 31st of October I came home to dinner at five minutes to twelve o'clock—my wife was at home—I did not see the prisoner—I went out at the back door to feed my pigs—I had looked at the watch as 1 passed through the kitchen—it hung over the mantel-shelf—it was exactly five minutes before twelve—I returned in three or four minutes, and missed the watch directly—my wife was not in the house then—the door was open—I shut it, and called to my wife—I received information from her, and went out—I came up with the prisoner about a quarter of a mile from my house, on the Hanworth road—he had a basket with herrings on his head—I said, "You must come back with me"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "You have stolen my watch"—he said he had not, and would not come back for any one, as it would spoil the sale of his herrings—I took him back, and gave him in charge of a policeman, who searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Old Brentford; the prisoner lives in the same place. On the 31st of October I went with him to sell herrings, at Twickenham—I did not go with him to Ford's house—I saw him go in at the gate—I remained outside—he opened the door and went into the house—I did not see him knock, I did not notice whether he shut the door after him—when he came back he said, "Here is a watch, go and hide it"—he gave it me directly he came out, as soon as he came from the door—they could have seen him from the window of the house—he did not say where he got it—I went and hid it underneath a bush on the Hanworth-road, just as you turn down a lane—I did not mention this to any one at first—I told the policeman of it next day, as the Magistrate said I should be liable to be transported for perjury—the policeman took me before the Magistrate, and charged me with this offence, and the pri<lb></lb>soner also—I was discharged, and told the policeman about it afterwards, as he said if the watch was found I should be transported—I told the Magistrate where it was, and he sent the policeman with me, and I took him to where the watch was.</p>

I took Pearce and the prisoner before the Magistrate on the 31st of October—they were both examined, and remanded—I took them again on the 1st of November, and then the prisoner was remanded, and Pearce discharged—he had not said where the watch was before he was discharged to my knowledge—the Magistrate told him he was now liberated, and if he knew any thing about the robbery, he had better tell the truth—he hesitated some time—the Magistrate cautioned him to be careful what he did say, to speak the truth, as he would very likely be brought before a Magistrate on his oath—after hesitating, he said, "Sir, I will tell the truth"—I am quite sure the Magistrate told him he was discharged before he said any thing on the subject, and he told him he had better tell as he might still be under difficulties—he then gave information—he took me on the Han<lb></lb>worth-road, and on Twickenham-common, near a gate-post, by the end of a</p>

When I heard the glass break, I looked at him; he put his hand in coolly, catched some pencil-cases up, and run off; when he ran away, I went into the shop, put my coat and hat on, and went out on Snow-hill; I saw one of the patrols, I told him I had been robbed; I told the patrol to watch to see if any person came again. I pulled off my coat and hat, and go to my business. I then perceived the window was broken as I passed along; I had heard it break; you might have heard it all along the ground floor. I went into my own shop, and went to my business; in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I perceived a hand in the window again; I ran across the shop out into the street as fast as possible, the patrole had got him when I came to the door; he then dropped the pencil-cases; I saw them drop; I picked up ten pencil-cases, which I saw him drop. I said, this is the second time you came.</p>

            . I am a patrole. Mr. Griffen informed me he had been robbed, and he had his window broken; I watched in the front of the broken window; there was a strong light in the window in about a quarter of an hour; the prisoner came down as if from St. Sepulchre's church; he put his hand inside of the window; he pulled his hand out of the window. I instantly laid hold of him; Mr. Griffen came out of the shop: I took the prisoner to the watchhouse; something fell from the prisoner, it sounded like glass, what it was, I cannot say; I had enough to do to take the prisoner to the watchhouse. I searched him; on him I found a silver watch, and some money.</p>

An acquaintance of mine met us, and took us to the Blue Boar's Head, King-street, Westminster. There was the prisoner, two serjeants, and two other soldiers. We joined company, and had four or five pots of bear. We came out, and went to go to a tavern over the bridge. I sat down on the bridge. Johnson came up, and stood before me. Ferguson was with me. Johnson snatched my watch out of my fob, and away he ran. I ran after him, but lost sight of him; Ferguson and I went after him, and found him at the Blue Boar's Head. He was taken to the Round-House: he denied being on Westminster-Bridge. I was sober.</p>

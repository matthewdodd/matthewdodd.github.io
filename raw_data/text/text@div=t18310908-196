The prisoner came to our house one Sunday, about three weeks ago, to see my son, John Bartholomew Cowmeadow; this compass was in a work-box on the back parlour mantel-piece when he came - I saw it there the night before; he stopped about an hour - when he was gone we missed the compass and a pair of gloves from a drawer in the bed-room, which belonged to Ann Esther Cowmeadow; it was under my care.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner between five and six o'clock the same evening - he had left the prosecutor's about ten in the morning; this pair of gloves was in his waistcoat pocket, and this bundle was at the Swan, at Kensington Gravel-pits, where he was stopped; I found 2l. 19s. on him - he said he knew nothing of any part of the property; he told me what he had done with the compass.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 21st of August, between three and four o'clock, I was in Praed-street, Edgware-road; I saw the prisoner standing, with some persons round, who said it was a shame he should be treated so - upon inquiry I found he had been into a shop for a pennyworth of curds and whey - that he said it was sour, and that the man of the shop had kicked him in the mud; he said he was going to Bayswater - I asked him to come to my house and have his clothes brushed; while he was there he seemed to take a great fancy to an opera-glass on my mantel-piece, and he offered me this compass in exchange for it - I gave him the opera-glass and a penknife for the compass; I gave the same compass to the officer.</p>

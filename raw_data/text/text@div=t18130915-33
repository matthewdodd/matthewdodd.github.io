Upon searching him; I found upon him a pound of tea concealed in a bag in his breeches. Upon my finding this bag of tea in his breeches he said he was sorry it happened. I gave the prisoner in charge of Mr. Over. Mr. Brooks came to him. I did not see any thing that was found afterwards. The bag appears to be a new bag; I don't think it has been used before. The company had tea there where the prisoner was employed.</p>

            . I am superintendant on the part of the East India Company, at their dock. The property in question is their property, and it was taken from their dock. I saw the prisoner in the Exciseman's office. On my seeing this bag I thought it was a systematick proceeding. I took the prisoner's hat; I found this bag; it went round the prisoner's hat. I then told the prisoner this seemed to be a systematick plan. The prisoner said it was the first time he had been persuaded by a man at Camberwell, a tailor, who had made these things. He said he got the tea from the Cumberland. I have seen the chests on board the Cumberland. I found a great number of the chests had been plundered of this tea.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

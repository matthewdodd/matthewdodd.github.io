            , that White, the prisoner at the bar, asked him if I was gone out? He said he believed I was, (they were both my servants;) he told me White was gone down into the cellar. I had had some suspicion he had robbed me before, we having over-night found three pieces of lead privately laid upon a shelf in the cellar; we had left it as we found it, after we had weighed it. It weighed a quarter of a hundred and three pounds; at seven that morning I had seen it lying there. I staid at the head of the stairs after he was gone into the cellar; after that I went down; the prisoner was then at the foot of the stairs; he past by me, and went up stairs; I went to see if the lead was there, and two of the pieces were taken away; then I ran after him, and found him at the room-door, and made him stand search. He went backwards, and there he dropt one of the pieces on a heap of old lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it?</p>
               <p>Bouchard. Yes, I did. Then he said to me, by G - d, master, you are catched out; you will find nothing. I said, what signifies that? you have dropt one, let us see the other piece, for you have got another; then he drew out another piece from his right-hand pocket, and gave it to me, (the two pieces produced in court, and deposed to.) I said, now I think you are catched out. He said, master, don't be ill-natured; you owe me a day and a half's wages, I will give you that towards this; and he would be d - d if ever he robbed me but once before in his Life, and he would down on his knees, and ask my pardon. I sent for a constable, and took him before the sitting alderman, there he owned he took it.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor; on the 25th of March, at night, my master, mistress, and I went down into the shop, and looked about to see if we could find any lead hid, having suspected the prisoner some time to rob my master.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090003"></xptr> We found three pieces on a shelf, we took it up stairs and weighed it, and carried it and laid it there again; and the next morning the prisoner asked me if master was gone out, saying, he wanted to get a dram, he went down into the cellar, and when he came up I saw him deliver one piece to my master, and heard him confess before Mr. Alderman Alexander that he did take the two pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had never any design to carry that lead out of my master's shop; I intended to carry it and throw it to the heap. I dropped one piece there, and gave my master the other; I had one piece in my right-hand pocket, and the other in my left. That lead has been stolen twice before; it comes from the King's-yard at Chatham, he bought this from there, and twenty-three hundred weight more; it has been a perquisite to the journeymen in the trade to take small pieces these hundred years.</p>

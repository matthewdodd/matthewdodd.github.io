            ; in consequence of what he said, I felt in my pocket, and found I had lost my pocket-book; I had felt it in my pocket in the course of the morning; I cannot speak exactly to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had not taken it out and left it any where? - A. I am certain I had not left it; he desired me to follow him, and he would shew me the parties; I went as far back as Norfolk-street with Bly, and Mr. Lake; Bly looking down the street, saw the two prisoners walking together, about half way down the street, on the right-hand side; we all ran up to them, and just before we got to them, Bly said, come Joe, knowing Davis, upon which they both stopped; I immediately laid hold of Davis, and accused him of picking my pocket; the moment I laid hold of Davis, I perceived my pocket-book at his feet; as I came towards them I kept looking, for I expected it would be dropped, and when he turned round to look me in the face, he dropped it from his left-hand pocket; we took them both to Bow-street; the officer has the pocket-book; they made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. (For Kemp). Q. It might have been two or three hours before this time that you felt for your pocket-book? - A. It possibly might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Kemp was at some distance from Davis, was he not? - A. No; they were walking together; and when I went down Norfolk-street, and called to them, they both stopped.</p>

             sworn. - I was with Mr. Holland, on the 18th of April; in consequence of information that we received, we followed two men down Norfolk-street, they were walking together; when we got nearly to them, Bly said, come, Joey, I think he added, let us see what you have got; at that instant, I saw the pocket-book drop from Davis's pocket, or the side of his pocket, which Bly immediately picked up, it was a red morocco pocket-book; at the same time. Bly desired I would secure Kemp, which I did; when I found he was an officer, and knew what he was about, I think, Kemp said, he knew nothing at all about it, or something of that kind, and begged I would not collar him; we were rather apprehensive of a rescue, from the gang that were about; we were desired, by Bly, to take care what we were about; we took them to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Kemp protested his innocence, and gave you no molestation in taking him to the office? - A. None.</p>

             sworn. - I live in the Strand: On the 18th of April, between one and two o'clock, I observed the two prisoners; I was sitting with the sash up, being a hot day; I saw a number of people walking, I saw Mr. Holland particularly, being very tall, and Mr. Leake; and immediately behind Mr. Holland was a person, whom I knew to be a notorious pickpocket, who is not taken, which led my attention that way immediately; after him followed the two prisoners together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the two prisoners held conversation together? - A. They appeared to me to be talking together; I was at too great a distance to hear what passed; at the corner of Norfolk-street, the person, that was immediately behind Mr. Holland, passed him and Mr. Leake, and walked close before them to Arundel-street; when they got to Norfolk-street, the two prisoners walked close up to Mr. Holland and Mr. Leake; they had not gone many yards, before I saw Davis stoop, and put his hand into Mr. Holland's left-hand pocket; he then stood upright, and the other prisoner stood on a parallel line with him on the pavement next the houses; Mr. Holland was likewise next the houses, to the best of my recollection; one of the prisoners then stepped off the pavement, and beckoned back the man that had preceded Mr. Holland, and then he turned back, but what became of him I cannot tell; the two prisoners walked down Norfolk-street, the third man followed them down Norfolk-street also; they had got about halfway down, when I saw Mr. Holland, and his friend, and several other persons running, I went after them, and went to Bow-street; my house is directly opposite Norfolk-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had never seen the person of Kemp before? - A. Neither.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - A. I know him to be the person, he was never out of my sight till he was taken; he had a drab greatcoat on, over a suit of black.</p>

             sworn. - I am constable of St. John's, Westminster: About half-past one, on Friday the 18th of April, I was walking from Templebar towards Somerset-house; I saw the prisoner, about half a dozen yards from me, and because they should not see me, I stepped off the pavement, that was between Norfolk-street, and Somerset-house; I know Davis perfectly well, and I knew Kemp some years ago; I turned round and watched Davis, and found him very nimble with his fingers, and pressing very hard upon two gentlemen, in blue coats, whom I afterwards discovered to be Mr. Leake and Mr. Holland; Davis was rather the foremost man, Kemp was next the houses, and Davis towards the kirb-stone; I walked on a few yards, and some people being between us, I could not see what they were doing; I then observed Kemp stop, and I got a view of Davis, but slightly, and as I suspected they had picked these two gentlemen's pockets, I made as fast as I could after those two gentlemen; I touched Mr. Holland on the elbow, with a small stick I had in my hand, and asked him if he had lost any thing, he at first said, no; but putting his hand to his pocket, he said, yes, I have lost my pocket-book; then I went with them after the prisoners; I had lost sight of them then for a bit, but I went on pretty fast, till I came to the corner of Norfolk-street; I looked down Norfolk-street, and saw the two prisoners walking together, I pointed them out to Mr. Holland; I then ran down, and said, come, Joe, I believe, I said, hand over; immediately the pocket-book was dropped on the pavement; I heard something fall, which I believe was the report of the book upon the pavement, it had hardly done moving.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not on the pavement before? - A. No, it was not. (Produces the pocket-book.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you observed them in the Strand, Kemp was rather behind? - A. Davis certainly was a little distance before him, but a very small distance.</p>
               <p>Holland. The pocket-book that I lost has my hand-writing in it, it cost me six shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at the parish of Ruislip, Middlesex. On Wednesday night, the 22nd of December, between one and two o'clock, I was taking my mare towards the common at Ruislip, to a rick of hay which I had there—I went down Clack-lane, and near a ditch there I caught sight of two men—I got close by them—they jumped out of the ditch, got on the bank, and struck me—they each had a stick or bludgeon about a yard long in his hand—they both struck me with the sticks on the side of the head, and both laid hold of my collar—I struggled with them—they got me into the ditch—I cried out "Murder" as loud as I could, but I was very hoarse—I had a bad cold, and could hardly speak—as I laid on my back in the ditch one of them pressed his hand very much over my nose and mouth, and my nose burst out bleeding—I told them not to hurt me, if they took my money—they rifled my pockets—one of them put his hand into my breeches and waistcoat pockets—I had in my right-hand trowsers' pocket a purse con<lb></lb>taining thirteen sovereigns, one half-sovereign, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and two land-tax receipts—my purse was taken—they got up, went away, and left me in the ditch lying on my back—it was a canvass purse—I have seen it since in the possession of Atkins, the constable—it was a very cloudy night, and mizzled with rain—there was a moon, but I could not see their faces to swear to them—I thought their faces were disfigured—they seemed blacked a little—I believe the prisoners are the men from what I saw of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 2, Vernon-place, Bloomsbury, in the house of John Hancock—there are several lodgers in the house, and Mr. Hancock himself resides there. On the 15th of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I missed a gold watch, a key, two seals, and a guard, from an inner drawer of a chest of drawers in my bed-room—I had seen them safe about eight that morning—I have seen nothing of them since, but I lost a purse at the same time, from the same room, and this now pro<lb></lb>duced is it.</p>

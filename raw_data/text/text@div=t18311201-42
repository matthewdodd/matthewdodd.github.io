            . I am a Police-officer. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing two sovereigns and two shillings, and then he recollected that he had changed one shilling, and spent 4d. out of it - I took her to the station, saw her put some money into her mouth, and then take it out in her hand; I found in her left-hand two sovereigns and a shilling; and 1s. 8 1/2d. in her purse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had known the prosecutor two months before - he met me at the corner of Hanway-yard, and we walked together to Russell-street.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBINS. I never saw her till met her in Russell-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I met him I asked him for a penny - he said he was very sorry he had no more money, but he would give me a couple of shillings - he put his hand into his pocket, and gave me what he had; my purse was in my right hand - I put what he gave me into my glove; I had 2s. in silver, and 10d. in copper - he said he was sorry we could not go to a place where we could be comfortable; a woman then came up and asked for a penny, and I gave it her from my purse; the prosecutor then put his hand into his pocket, and said he had lost two sovereigns - the officer then came up; the prosecutor whispered to me not to tell what had taken place between us.</p>

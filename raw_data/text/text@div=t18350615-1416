                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Caroline-street, Commercial-road. On the 27th of May, I was returning home, and met the prisoner about twelve o'clock at night, and was with her until four o'clock—I had been drinking, but was sober when I met her—there was another woman, and I believe a man, in her company—we went to a public-house and drank together—we then went to a house which the prisoner resorted to—the other woman, and two men went there with the prisoner and myself—it was a court in Brook-street, Ratcliff—we went on the first floor—we were all in one room, and on one bed in the room—I sat myself on the foot of the bed, and laid down on my back, with my clothes on, for some time—the prisoner was sitting at the other end of the room, and the other woman sat on the foot of the bed, on the right side, with me, and laid down with her clothes on—I did not unbutton my clothes—nothing took place be<lb></lb>tween me and the woman—I was dozing, and was disturbed by the pri<lb></lb>soner's hand in my coat pocket—I caught her hand in my coat pocket—</p>

               <p>my gloves had been in that pocket, 4 half-crowns and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were inside one glove, and that glove was put inside the other—I had a shilling in my waistcoat pocket—when 1 found her hand in my pocket, she ran down stairs directly—I missed my gloves and money—I ran down after her, and saw her turn to the right—I lost sight of her in less than half a minute—I ran up stairs, and asked the two men and woman if they wished to see me robbed—I ran down stairs again, and they followed me—I missed a bunch of keys when I examined further.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I heard a woman screaming, between three and four o'clock, and proceeded to the court in Brook-street—I found the prosecutor holding the prisoner—he gave her in charge for robbing him of 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a pair of gloves—I called in another officer, and left him there while I took the prisoner to the station-house—Ince went with me; and she told him, on the road, to stick to her as tight as he could—she appeared jeering him—I went back to the house afterwards, and found a bunch of keys down the privy—a person would pass the privy to come from the house into the street.</p>

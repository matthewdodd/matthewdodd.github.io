                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my sister and her husband, Moss Joseph, at N <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> 153, Waterloo-road. On the 5th of Dec., between twelve and one o'clock in the night, I noticed that the street door was locked and bolted—I had previously bolted the kitchen door—it is a bolt that goes up—I sleep in the kitchen—about three o'clock in the morning I got up, and lighted a match to see what time it was—I took up the watch off the bedstead to see what time it was, and put it down again—about four o'clock I was alarmed by the policeman, who had the prisoner in his custody in the house—I found the watch in the parlour, where there had been a struggle between the policeman and the prisoner—there was a chest of drawers there, and the watch was dropped by the corner of the drawers—three of the drawers had been pulled open—the kitchen door was open—it opens into a yard which adjoins that of Zion chapel.</p>

The prosecutor's house is in the parish of Lambeth—I was on duty in the Waterloo-road n Friday morning, the 6th of Dec.—about five minutes past four o'clock heard a noise inside the prosecutor's house—I listened for some time, and heard the bolts move, also the chain and lock undone—the door was then parti<lb></lb>ally opened—I rushed in—the door was pushed against me—I worked my knee in just inside the door, and got the prisoner behind the door—we caught hold of one another, and fell against the glass, and broke it—he got into the parlour—I laid hold of him there, and we struggled—he got from me again, and I sprang my rattle—two policemen came in, and he was secured in the parlour at the back of the shop—I saw no watch there—it was all in darkness—it was picked up while I was engaged with the prisoner—I found some lucifer matches on the prisoner, and a brad-awl, a chisel, and gimlet, were taken out of his hand by another constable in my presence—on the way to the station he contrived to get this auger out of his pocket—he had it in his right hand, and the constable snatched it</p>

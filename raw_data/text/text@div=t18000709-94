             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On the 29th of June, on the Sunday morning, I took the prisoners into custody, about six o'clock; I went to the prisoner Collett's house, No. 7, Two Swan Yard, Bishopsgate-street, and on a copper, close by where the prisoner stood, I found this piece of cambric muslin; I asked him where he bought those things; and he said, d-n me, I would buy any thing; I then took Collett to the Compter; I then returned, and searched the house; in his box I found a piece of black silk mode; I also found a piece of lace, while I was searching the house; I took the key out of Collett's pocket with which I unlocked the box; I then went to a house, No. 17, Old Bethlem-court, where there lived one Elizabeth Day; I took her into custody, and took her to Collett's house; I searched her, and found two pieces of silk handkerchief in her right-hand pocket; I apprehended Baldwin at the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he had told you any thing, did you make him any promises, or use any threats? - A.I told him I would do what I could, with his master, if he would confess what he knew.</p>

               <p>ROBERT READ sworn. Examined by Mr. Knpp. I accused the prisoner, Baldwin, of having robbed us of a piece of mode, a piece of cambric muslin, and eighteen yards, or a piece, of lace; he denied it; I mentioned the articles over again; he said they were at Sapwell's, the constable's house; he said, the cambric muslin is not your's; I then said, what are the other things, you have robbed us of them; he said, yes, and wished he had gone for a sailor before he took them; I asked him what could induce him to do it; he said, that Collett was continually after him, telling him to do it; he said it was his first offence, he never robbed us before, nor since, and he had received no money for the things; I told him if it was so, I Would not prosecute him. This silk mode is our property, it is worth forty shillings, it has not been sold by us; also the eighteen yards of lace, which is worth about forty shillings, that was found in Collett's box; the other things I believe to be our property, but will not swear to them; the handkerchiefs I am certain of, but the marks being picked out I will not swear to them; the cambric muslin, the mark being torn, I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner did not abscond from your service? - A. No; I sent for him, and he came to me without force.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to take upon yourself to say, that that black silk mode had never been sold? - A. If it had, it would have been entered in the book; on the lace there are figures made.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the figures always torn off the lace when it is sold? - A. Not always.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know any thing of Collett? - A. No; I never saw him till I saw him before the Lord-Mayor.(The confession of Baldwin was produced, and read).</p>
               <p>The Prisoners left their defence to their Counsel, and called six witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

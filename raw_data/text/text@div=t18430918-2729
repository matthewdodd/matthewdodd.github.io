                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, and live at Charing-cross. On the 31st of Aug., the prisoner came to my shop, and required an outfit to the East Indies for herself—I took her order—I placed my order-book before her—she wrote her name and address—the book is not here—she told me her address, "Miss Horton, 12, Paragon, New Kent-road"—she ordered a ladies outfit; shifts, night-gowns, and other things—she afterwards said she had been recom<lb></lb>mended by the Honourable Henry Berkley, of Spring Gardens—she requested to look at some silk handkerchiefs, that she might show them to her intended, who was a Captain in the 75th Regiment of Madras Infantry—I showed her about one hundred—she picked out three first and then six, and asked my permission to take them and show them to the captain—she took them with the understanding that she was to bring them back the following morning, whether approved of or not—she said so—I did not mean to part with them at that time; only while she showed them—she turned round, and saw some satin scarfs, and took one of them—she did not come back next morning with the handkerchiefs—I did not see her again till she was in cus<lb></lb>tody four days after—these are my handkerchiefs—they have my private mark on them, and are what I let her have to show to the captain.</p>

On the 31st of Aug., when the prisoner left the shop, I followed her to the house of a Mr. Priest, a pawnbroker, in Long-acre—she went in—she had a parcel with her, and when she came out she had none—she went down the Strand to a con<lb></lb>fectioner's, and then to a public-house—I then left and went home—on Sunday, the 3rd of Sept., she called at my master's, and asked if my master</p>

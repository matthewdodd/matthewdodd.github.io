               <p>JAMES BUTLER. I had the care of about two hundred and fifty pigs, leaving Bristol; I sold about twenty of them coming along the road, and on the other side of <placeName id="t18160710-104-crimeloc560">Staines</placeName>

The prisoner was present at the sale of a tired pig of mine, and I believe there, he saw my money; I had two assistants to help me to drive my pigs. I fell into conversation with the prisoner; I got tired, and he told me I had better sit down on the road side, and rest myself; and a coach or chaise would presently come past; he knew all the drivers, and he would get me a lift; I might get on a coach, and overtake my men with the pigs. I was induced to sit down by the road side, I fell asleep; the prisoner awakened me when a coach came up. I did not get into the coach, but I afterwards got into a waggon; the prisoner would not get in; after that I missed my money; I sent work back to Staines, and the next day the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

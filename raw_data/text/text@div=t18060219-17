               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a seaman. - A. He pretends to be one, I am afraid he is not, if he is, he is a disgrace to one; I lost the great coat on board the ship I belonged to (the ship Helena, belonging to London); this man came on board in order to ship himself in her, she lay off <placeName id="t18060219-17-crimeloc85">Bell Wharf, in London river</placeName>

               <p>Q. What day was this. - A. Last Thursday, between the hours of eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner entered himself on board. - A. No, he would not agree for the wages, he pretended he came with that intent, but I do not think he had any idea of shipping himself, only to take what he could; I was obliged to leave the ship to find him; I watched the door very narrowly, and at nine o'clock I found him; I took upon me to stand officer myself, it being plain to me that he knew where my property was; when I found him he had my handkerchief round his neck; the coat was found in his lodgings, it was altered and made a jacket of; I brought the tailor who altered it to the magistrate, he satisfied the magistrate that he had altered it; I produce the handkerchief and great coat, I can swear to them, they are mine; here is the piece the tailor cut off the coat.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose you took care there was no person there to hear. - A. Nobody answered to it.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge at our house, and quitted without notice in October last - when he was gone, I missed from my bed-room a watch, worth about 3l., an olive-coloured brown coat, which cost 50s., and had only been worn twice, a pair of blue trousers, worth 1l., two waistcoats, worth 13s., and some shirts, but they belonged to another person - on the 6th of October I went to No. 8, Playhouse-yard, with two Policemen - I waited in the passage, and the prisoner came into the passage; I was going to catch at him, but he made a start from me - I ran after him, and cried Stop thief! but no one stopped him; he made up towards Golden-lane - he had my husband's coat and trousers on; these things had all been kept in one place, and I missed them all at one time; I saw the prisoner again twelve or thirteen weeks after the robbery, in Aldgate; he ran from me, but I pursued, and he was taken.</p>

            . I live at the Flying Horse, Milton-street, Fore-street, and am a journeyman baker. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140038"></xptr>known the prisoner six or seven years - he called on me about four months ago; I gave him something to drink. and while we were drinking, he asked me if the hat he had on would fit me, and he put it on my head - it was too large for him; I asked how he came to buy such a hat as that - he said an old lady, who was lodging where he was going to work at on the Saturday week, had given him these things; he had white trousers on, and a dark coat - I think it was black: he called on me again in about a fortnight, and seemed rather destitute.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Jones - we lived at No. 8, Playhouse-yard. The prisoner lodged there as the husband of a young woman in that house - I remember the two Policemen coming there in search of the prisoner; they came up stairs, and Mrs. Driscoll was in the passage - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and on going to the window, I saw Mrs. Driscoll running after the prisoner; I saw him again on the Saturday afternoon in Chiswell-street - I accused him of taking money, which I thought he had taken: he said he had taken no money, but the clothes and a watch - I asked him how he got them out; he said he put them under his own clothes, and buttoned his own clothes over them - he said he ran into a privy in Ball-yard, Drury-lane, and sat there till nine o'clock in the evening.</p>

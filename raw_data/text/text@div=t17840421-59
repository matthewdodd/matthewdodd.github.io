               <p>On Saturday last about half past three I was returning from the Temple, going into Leicester-fields, and before I came there this young fellow and two or three more that were with him forced me on a step in <placeName id="t17840421-59-crimeloc330">Henrietta-street</placeName>

               <p>Was he stooping towards your pocket? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Which arm had the other hold of? - They got me round them, and the other person stood on my left side and this on my right.</p>
               <p>Had this man his other arm round you? - No, after they had picked my pocket the other that was with him separated, and this person struck me.</p>

               <p>I am a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect being in Covent Garden at the time the prosecutor has described? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you observe him? - I was standing there to see the election, I went to see Mr. Fox as I had heard talk of him, the prisoner stood next to me, the gentleman looked and looked, and at last he collared a man, that man goes away from him, he came back again and caught hold of the prisoner, says he you must be an accomplice with the other man, says the prisoner if I have done any thing amiss search me, the prisoner said he would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270103"></xptr> go away, the prosecutor took the prisoner, there was nothing found upon him.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean to say then that when this gentleman first collared the other, the prisoner was not with him? - The prisoner was on this side, and I was in the middle.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner was not with the other man? - He did not hold the other man nor was he near him, there were several together.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath Sir will you swear that? - I went to the Justice and told the same story there.</p>
               <p>Will you swear now that the prisoner and the other man were not together when you first saw them? - I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The witness here has said he mentioned the same thing before the Justice, he came into the room, the Justice would not suffer him to speak, he gave no account before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Constable. Not a word, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Bachara. I told the Justice the very same.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was not suffered to speak.</p>
               <p>Jury to Bachara. What are you? - A hatter by trade.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if these two people were together upon the business of picking pockets, and you believe that they shoved this gentleman up jointly, for the purpose of getting an opportunity of picking his pocket, and that they followed him for that purpose, and one of them got his hand into his pocket and the felony was compleated, the other being present and assisting at the time, the man whose hand was not in his pocket was equally guilty with the man whose hand was in; if you are clearly satisfied from the evidence, that he was actually aiding and assisting the others, in the attempt to pick the gentleman's pocket, you will find him Guilty; but whether the evidence under all the circumstances is sufficiently clear and certain to satisfy your minds of that, is a question for your determination.</p>

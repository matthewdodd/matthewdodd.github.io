On the 21st of March, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, the witness M'Carthy came and gave me information, in consequence of which I missed a man's cap, which I had seen safe at five o'clock, hanging in the passage, against the parlour door—my street door was shut, and fastened with a catch-lock—it could be opened outside—you must come through the passage to get to the shop—the shop door was open—that is on the right-hand side of the passage, and the parlour door on the left.</p>

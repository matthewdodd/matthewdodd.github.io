             sworn. - Q. Do you live in the neighbourhood of Kenton Green? - A. Not now; I was there on the 25th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon; I was putting up a scaffold about one hundred yards from Mrs. Pring's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners? - A. Yes, I saw them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they are the two persons? - A. Yes, I am sure of it; I saw them go into the yard of Mrs. Pring's house; I saw them open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they open the door? - A. They lifted up the latch, and both of them went in; the woman lifted up the latch, and went in first, and her husband followed her; the prisoner, Daniel, said the woman was his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to see whether they did more than lift up the latch? - A. I did not see them do any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut when they went in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stop? - A. They might be in about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come out again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe when they came out, whether they had any thing with them? - A. Yes; the woman had the tea-canister under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that under her arm when she went in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any bundle? - A. No, I did not; when she came out, she dropped the canister upon the stones in the yard; she took it up again, put it under her arm, and went over to the public-house, and the man with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the public-house near? - A. Yes; about an hour after I went to the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not suspect any thing then? - A. No, I did not know but the young woman was at home; when I went to the public-house, they were both sitting against the door drinking beer; while I was there, the young woman came to the door into the yard, crying, and making an alarm; I then asked the man if he had been in the house, and he said, no, he had not; then I asked the woman, and she said, no, she had not been in the house; then I contradicted them, and said, they had, and sent for a constable, and took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched in your presence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon them? - A. No, nothing belonging to the young woman; and after they were taken into custody, they offered to give the young woman something to make it up, and said, they were guilty of it, - that they had taken the tea-canister out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the canister after they were in custody? - A. Yes, Lost brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the other things were found upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw no other person near the spot at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had made the man some promise of forgiveness, had not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else hear him say that? - A. Yes; the young woman was with me; I don't know whether she heard it or not.</p>

            . I am the wife of George Pimley; I lodge at Pentonville. I went out on the morning of the 15th of March; when I returned my husband had some words with me. I then went out, and met the prisoner - I asked her for a lodging; she told me to go with her, and she would say I was her aunt; she went to a door and knocked - I went in and went to bed, and she came about one o'clock to sleep with me, and got into bed. I had not been asleep - I heard her moving, and said,"You have got my money;" she made no answer, but I heard two men in the next room talking to her, and I was afraid to say more; there had been 1s. 9d. and some duplicates in a purse in my pocket. I took the pocket out of her hand, and they were all gone - she said in the morning, it was a pity I had been robbed, and she would get up and make me a cup of tea - but she did not she got up and went into the next room to the two men and a woman, who were in bed there. I told her she had left me destitute of a farthing; I went out, and met her again in the evening, when I had her taken into custody. I had pawned a cloak about a quarter of an hour before I met her in the evening; I went to the pawnbroker's, and found she had taken it out, and pawned it again.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner at the the corner of Whitecross-street - I asked her if she knew any thing about the woman's things - if she did, she had better give them up. The prosecutrix wished for her cloak above all things; she said she had pawned it at Mr. Fothergill's the night before, and that the duplicate was with ten others in the purse, with 1s. 9d.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met her much intoxicated; she asked me for a lodging - and as she took out her money to pay for it she dropped this duplicate - I took it up; I went to bed afterwards, and found a gin bottle under the pillow; I told her in the morning I had picked up a ticket of a cloak, and if she would go with me I would give it to her</p>
               <p>E. PIMLEY. I was quiet sober.</p>

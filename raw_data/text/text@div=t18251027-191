I afterwards found he had been to a shop in Cranbourn-street, and got 7 l. 10 s. from a customer.</p>

            . I am shop-woman to Mr. Curtis, of Cranbourne-passage. On the 20th of October the prisoner came about three o'clock, and asked me for the cash, for Mr. Carter - I asked if he had a note; he said No. I gave him six sovereigns, and 1 l. 16 s. in silver - he appeared sober, and said his master had desired him to get it.</p>
               <p>ALFRED CARTER re-examined. Q. Had you authorized him to receive this money? A. No. I had not taken him to the Magistrate, but admonished him, and said he had disgraced himself.</p>

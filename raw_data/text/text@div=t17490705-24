            , and another person that lives at Ben. Johnson's head at Stepney, we being there saw those two prisoners pass by with large bundles on their backs. I said to Mr. Neal these two fellows have got each a load which seem not to be their own; let us stop them and enquire whether they came honestly by them or not. We went after them and stop'd them, and ask'd them if the goods were their own; they said they had them in Spittlefields; one of them said they were going with them to Limehouse-hole; the other said they were going to Black-wall; said I, we shall stop you on suspicion that you have not come honestly by them; I went for a constable, and desired Mr. Neal and the other person to take charge of them. I went and brought an Officer and a Watchman; they were gone with the bundles and Mr. Neal followed them, so we went down to Limehouse Hole to see if they were gone there: we saw a person at the plying place who told us there were no such persons come that way; we all three went back again, and Mr. Neal's wife came and told us they had charg'd Mr. Neal with hindering them in their passage, and he had charg'd the Constable with them: This was in Ratcliff high-way, I went to them, and we had them before Justice Rickets, and he sent them to Clerkenwell Bridewell.</p>

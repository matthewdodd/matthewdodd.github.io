               <p>Q. In the course of last year had you occasion to leave town - A I had. In some part of May I went in pursuit of my business professionally. I took my wife with me. I left my house, No. <placeName id="t18110109-33-crimeloc194">9. Commercial-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long have you known her. - A. Near three years. I had great confidence in her, or else I would not have placed her there. I and my wife returned to town on the 7th of December. On my arrival in town, about twelve at noon, the door of my house was opened by a person of the name of Lewis. I did not find the prisoner in the house which I expected. I immediately went up stairs, and on my opening my drawers I found the things were nearly stripped from them. The wardrobe in the passage I broke open. I found that was stripped. I found all the clothes that I had left nearly gone. Several boxes, which I had sent up from Scotland, were also nearly empty; all these things stated in the indictment were gone. I applied to Mr. Griffith's, the officer. The prisoner was taken into custody; she delivered up the duplicates to the officer. I said to her,</p>
               <p>"Kitty, what have you done with my things; are my things sold, or what is become of them?" She told me they were not sold, but they were in pledge. She cried and said,</p>
               <p>"how could she look me in the face after what she had done."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the different duplicates to the different pawnbrokers. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two letters, and tell me whether they are her hand-writing. - A. They are, I received them by post since she was in custody. - (The letters read.)</p>
               <p>"Honoured Sir, I hope you will pardon me for the first offence; I served you three years, which I lived with you always truly and honestly. I can safely say before God and man, that I never wronged you in my life. I own I have committed a great fault; it was distress that drove me to it; give me time, whatever I have done wrong I will gratefully return. I hope you will have a feeling to a fellow-creature. I long to see you both; my heart is almost broke; pray, for God's sake, have a little mercy. I am your's, faithfully,</p>
               <p>CATHERINE DOWSE."</p>
               <p>Directed to Mr. Crawcour, King's-place, Commercial-road. No date - Post-mark, December 7.</p>
               <p>Another Letter, dated 15, Clerkenwell prison, directed the same.</p>
               <p>"SIR - I once more solicit your pardon; if you have one grain of feeling, and recollect there is a good God that over-rules us all. The punishment you have inflicted on me at present is quite enough for a fellow-creature to suffer; what I would not wish you nor yours to suffer one hour. If you have no feeling for me, I hope you will consider an aged parent's sufferings for her child's misconduct, that never had her name called in question before I unfortunately came into your house. If you would take it into consideration, and think that you might have a child of your own, that may want forgiveness, as I do. If you do not forgive, how can you expect to be forgiven? the day may come when we all want forgiveness; then how shall we prosper if we do not forgive? I have found you to be the greatest enemy that ever I had in my life. Only have feeling for one moment.</p>
               <p>I am your's, respectfully,

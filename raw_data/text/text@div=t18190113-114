On the 9th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, I found the barn broken open - the lock had been forced off; I had locked it the night before, and left thirteen sacks of wheat in the chaff there, and a quantity loose about the floor. I missed four sacks of wheat in the chaff, which would produce ten bushels of wheat; there were foot marks of above two persons in the granary - I traced them into Nicholls's yard, which leads to both houses - I traced them to both houses; the shoes of one man had iron tips on them, but one was only half-tipt, as if it had been broken - they appeared to be the mark of one man; the other man had no particular marks. I have since seen a pair of shoes in possession of Mead; they corresponded exactly with the marks of the tips; I tried them with several, and have no doubt but they were the shoes that made them. I went with the constable to search Tyler's house between twelve and one o'clock that day, and found a sack there with loose chaff in it, also some chaff, and kernels of wheat on the floor. I then went to Nicholls, forced open the door, but found nobody there; I found about two sacks of loose chaff on the floor, in the sleeping-room; it appeared to have been lately separated from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130050"></xptr>wheat - it was scattered as if it had been sifted. The four sacks of wheat would produce two sacks of chaff; we found no sacks there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Can you say whether the marks were made at night or in the evening when they left work - A. The marks appeared fresh - there were marks where they appeared to have rested.</p>
               <p>Q. Might they not have gleaned it - A. If wheat is gleaned, it is generally taken to the mill immediately, and not kept until December.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had Nicholls any business in the granary - A. No, it is in the orchard close to the house - they came to work at six o'clock the next morning; I found four sieves and a pan, at Nicholls's.</p>

I then went to Nicholls's, and found the loose chaff in the house. I afterwards apprehended both the prisoners; Nicholls said if Godfrey did not mind what he was about, he would do for him.

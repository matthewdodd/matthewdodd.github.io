            . I am a draper. I was speaking to the officer, and he drew my attention to the three prisoners; I saw them go to a stall, buy an orange, and then walk on towards Billingsgate; they met the prosecutor -I saw Brightley touch his pocket; they all turned, and followed him, and two or three doors before they came to Fish-street-hill, they made another attempt; he then went on under the arch, and Brightley there took the handkerchief - the others were close to him at the time; he dropped the handkerchief - I took Jackson, who was walking off, and the officer took Smith.</p>

             PARISH. I am an officer. I saw the three prisoners, and pointed them out to Bates; I followed with him about half way towards Billingsgate, where they met the prosecutor, and returned after him -I did not see the attempt made, but I saw he had hold of Brightley; I went up, and the prisoners were secured.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Brightley's Defence. I was waiting at the London-docks - a gentleman asked me to carry a box to the steam-pocket, which I did, and he gave me 6d. for it - as I came back this gentleman took me.</p>

               <p>Jackson's Defence. I was going on an errand, when the prosecutor laid hold of Brightley, and then the other gentleman said I was one of them.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. My father sent me to my aunt's, in the Strand, and told me to call on a man at Billingsgate; I forgot it till I got to the bridge - I turned back; I saw the man, and was then going on, and they took me behind a cart.</p>

            . The 24th of Oct. the prisoner came to my house and wanted to pledge this coat, waistcoat and breeches, telling me her husband was lieutenant of a man of war, and she wanted to dress herself as such officers wives usaally do; I told her I did not think to take in any such things without she could be recommended by some house-keeper, she being a stranger: she went out, and in about half an hour's time she returned with a little boy; his parents are very honest people, and he told me his mother knows the woman, and believes you may take in the things very safely, and on that account I lent her 45 shillings on them.</p>

            . On the 24th of Oct. I was just come home, the prisoner had been out for some water, and she made me believe a gentlewoman of my acquaintance desired to see me at her own house that afternoon: I went to the gentlewoman's house and found it to be false, I return'd immediately in about 10 or 12 minutes, and found my back door open and my child in the street, and all these things were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is your husband of?</p>
               <p>M. Fitzsimonds. He is a taylor and salesman both; she own'd taking the goods before me, and said the devil was in her when she did it; this was before they went to the pawnbroker.</p>

When Mr. Fitzsimonds met with the prisoner accidentally he sent for me; she immediately own'd taking the goods, and said she had pawn'd them with Mr. Samuel Trimmer in Hounsditch: said I, do not you think you have done very ill in serving these people thus? she said all they could do, was to transport her, then she would be in her own country. She says she was born in South-Carolina.</p>

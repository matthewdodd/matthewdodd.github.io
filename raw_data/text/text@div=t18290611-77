On the 11th of May I received information from a person in the lane; the prisoner afterwards told me that he had some cloth to send to town, and asked if the carriers were gone - I said Yes, he had better send it to-morrow; he said, "I shall not;" I said,"If you will leave it with me, I will send:" about half-past ten o'clock, on the 12th of May, he gave it me as he was going out with his coach - I said I was going to Clerkenwell, and would take it; he put on it a direction,"

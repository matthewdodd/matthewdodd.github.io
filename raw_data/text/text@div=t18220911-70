            . I am a constable. I was returning from the counter, and saw the prisoner, in company with another, standing against a post in Newgate-street. I watched them, and saw Mr. Yonge pass with a lady; I did not see a handkerchief in his hand; the prisoner and his companion immediately followed them; he laid hold of the pocket with his right hand, and 
               <persName id="t18220911-70-person736">drew</persName>
             the handkerchief out with his left. I took hold of his two arms - his companion escaped. I informed Mr. Yonge the prisoner had concealed it between his legs; he looked at it, and gave me his address; he had an apron on.</p>
               <p>MR. YONGE. The handkerchief resembles mine, and has my wife's initials. I had one of her's in my hand, but do not remember putting it in my pocket; she misses one.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">straw-plait dealer, Wilderness-row, Clerkenwell.</hi> I had a mare pony for sale at Robinson's depository, Little Britain. On the 31st of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, it was brought into the yard—the prisoner Mellson came to me—he said, "Is that your pony?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "It appears to be a very nice one; what do you want for it?"—I said, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Is it quiet and sound?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, would I go along with him to his friend; and I accordingly went with him to the Red Lion, King Edward-street—he introduced me to Procter—Procter said, "I understand you have got a mare pony to sell"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I should like to see it"—I returned to Robinson's depository, and fetched it—it was trotted up and down—Procter came out, and offered me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I would not take it—he offered me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I closed for it—we went into the Red Lion—the pony was in the street at the time with a person who held it—Procter said he did not intend to buy a horse that day, and had not got cash enough; in fact, he bad not got any with him—I said I should not take anything but money—he said, if I would go with him to Newington Causeway, to his lodging, I should find he had money—Mellson said, "Don't let that binder you, 1 will give you the money for a note of hand"—he took out of his pocket a load of Bank of England notes, as I believed they were—I agreed to go to Newington for the money—I never agreed to take a bill or note of hand—we went to Procter's lodging—just before we got there, they both wanted to put the mare into a stable—Procter said it was his stable—they pulled a bell—a person came—I said, "I will not have the mare put in here, I will have the money first"—it</p>

            . I was at the watch-house; Scott brought Davis in - I thought Scott rather the worse for liquor, but I was not acquainted with his manner - he said Davis had taken his handkerchief, and had given it to another man, whom he should know; Davis said he knew nothing about it: I took Davis to High-street next day, and there he said that Stoney (meaning Shaw) had got it; I took Shaw next day - Scott said he was the person. - Scott did not stagger, but he talked a broken sort of French - he said afterwards that when he got a drop he talked in that way - he is a native of France.</p>

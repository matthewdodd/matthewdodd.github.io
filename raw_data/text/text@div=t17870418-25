               <p>I saw the prisoner in the morning of the 15th of March, picking greens in the field, Green Cole, at the bottom of Bow Common; it was about a quarter after eleven; a field belonging to Mr. Mann; I asked him what he was doing there; he said he was picking a few greens; I said, you shall not take them out of the field, and he said he would; have you ploughed the land, or sowed the greens? then I looked round, and saw Mr. Mee at a little distance, and I beckoned him to come and assist me; I said something to him; says he, I will stab you; he had a sack with him, on his left shoulder, and when he saw Mr. Mee coming to me, he threw it down, and said I might take it and be d - d, and he ran away.</p>
               <p>Had you asked him any thing about the sack before? - No.</p>
               <p>What was in the sack? - Five pewter dishes, seven large plates, and three small ones; there were three copper saucepans, a tin one, a stew-pan, a copper pot, and a quantity of kitchen furniture; Mee pursued him; I stood by the things; I took the things to the very first house I met with, that was a public house at Mount Pleasant; I left them with the landlord, his name is Horn, on the same day that I took them; he dropped them from his back.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - On the 16th of March, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - On the Thursday; the next morning, I took them to the rotation office; they opened them before the justice, and they were tied up and sealed; I left them at the office; the prisoner was there; he was examined before the justice; he said he lodged somewhere down at the ruins at Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Was his examination taken down in writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What business are you? - I am a bricklayer's labourer.</p>
               <p>Was you at work in that part? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What had you to do in this field? - A gentleman gave me so much a week to look over that field.</p>
               <p>Then you was not at work as a bricklayer's labourer? - Then I was watching the field for a draught of beer.</p>
               <p>And the dispute between you and this man was, whether he should cut three greens or no? - That was all.</p>
               <p>How long was he in the field cutting them, from your first observing him? - About five minutes.</p>
               <p>You was some time disputing too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man absolutely insisted he would cut the greens? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he his knife out cutting them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If he would have given up his purpose in cutting greens, he might have gone off? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell the Magistrate that he came into the field to cut a few roots, and that in this field he found this sack? - I heard him say nothing about the sack.</p>
               <p>Are you sober now? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what this man said before the Justice? - I cannot mind what he said; he said nothing where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Are you a bricklayer's labourer now? - No, I be not.</p>
               <p>Are you out of work now? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this was on the 16th? - Yes, pretty sure of that.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was on the Thursday? - Yes, I think it was the Thursday, and I think it was the 16th.</p>

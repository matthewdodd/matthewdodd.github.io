I am a soap-manufacturer, and live in Prince's-street, Lambeth, The prisoner was two years in my service—in consequence of information from the last prisoner's wife, who brought me in some soap, which I knew could not be got without the prisoner's knowledge—I sent for a policeman, and called the prisoner to me—I said to him, "Can you account how Gay came in Possession of this soap?"—he said he did not know—I said, "He could not have it without your knowledge"—he said "I know nothing of it"—I ordered the policeman to search the prisoner's house, and he found the articles stated in the indictment—I was liable to a penalty of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for concealing it—it is not in bars—it has been cast into different garden-pots, and different things, instead of bars, and taken away—the prisoner's house is on my own premise, in my yard, but entirely under his controul—when he was taken to the station-house, he said he was surprised his stock was so large, and if he had known it he would not have taken so much—the soap weight 23<hi rend="italic">lbs</hi>.—it is worth about 4 1/2. a pound, in the state it is in—we make it in a frame, the size of which is according to the act of parliament, but not a bit of this could have paid the duty,</p>

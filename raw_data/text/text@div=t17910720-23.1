               <p>I am a builder: on the 20th of June, in the morning, at four o'clock, on Monday, the patrole called me up, and told me he had discovered some lead stolen from some of my building; I immediately got up, and went and found some lead concealed at the end of Howland-street, under some scaffolding; the watchman brought it out, and I looked at it, and I said to the best of my knowledge it was some that had been affixed to some of my buildings; I sent a labourer to watch the lead, to see who would come for it; after that, it was taken to the place by Grace and myself, and fitted; it was taken from the North end of the house; it fitted very plain; it was torn from the wall-hooks, and part of the wall-hooks left in; I saw the lead on Sunday afternoon, near the evening, as I make a rule of going to see every evening if every thing is safe, as I several times have lost things.</p>
               <p>- MURPHY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labourer; my master sent me to watch the place, to see if any one came after the lead; about seven in the morning these two came; one of them went into the scaffolding, where the lead was hid,

               <p>I asked this man for a job; and going along this lad went into this place, and found this lead, and brought it out to me, and we were going to get it owned.</p>

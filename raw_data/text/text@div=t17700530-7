On the 23d of April I lost a pannel saw from a building belonging to Mr. Grant, where I was at work. The last of my seeing it was about eleven o'clock, but did not miss it till two in the afternoon; then I thought a young man of my acquaintance had it. On the Thursday morning when I went to work, I could not find it. I was informed there was a saw advertised; I went as directed, and found it to be my saw.</p>

            . On the 23d of April, about one in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house, and offered to pawn this saw. My apprentice said, Is it your own? The prisoner said, Yes, to be sure. I went into the shop, and said, Are you a carpenter? No, said he. Then I said, How can it be your saw? He said, he was sent by a carpenter, named Watson. I said, I must see him. Said he, If you don't like it, give it me again. I said, No. I sent my apprentice with him to see for this man, but no such man could be found. When they came back again, I took him before Justice Welch; there the prisoner said his name was Ross. (Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

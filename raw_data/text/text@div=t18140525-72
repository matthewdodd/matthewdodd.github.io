            . I am inspector of the watch of the parish of Cripplegate. On the night of the 2nd of May, I took Fulwell into custody, about ten minutes before ten at night. I placed myself up Dyer's-court, and watched. I saw Fulwell open his master's door, in <placeName id="t18140525-72-crimeloc428">Aldermanbury</placeName>

               <p>Q. When he came out, did you see him bring any thing with him - A. He did. In consequence of that, I took him into custody; I asked him what he had got in the bag he had with him across his shoulder; and taking him towards the watchhouse, he threw the bag down, and ran from me. I picked the bag up, and took care of the bag and the property. He made his escape. I afterwards took him in his master's stable; I broke open the door. That was on the 2nd of May, the same night, about an hour and a half after. I conveyed him to the Counter. Coming along, he told me it was not his fault. I told him, if anybody was implicated with him, he had better tell me, it might be of service to him. In consequence of his information, the next morning I apprehended the prisoner Powell. I went to Powell's masters house, Messrs. Smith and White, linen-draper's, in a court in Bow-lane; he is their porter. I took him in custody; and when he came to the Compter, he wished to retire. I then immediately searched him; in his pocket I found this book, and some other papers. Powell then requested that he might send somebody to his wife. I told him I should go up to his house, and I would tell her the situation he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search any apartment of Powell's - A. I did; I went into the room, and said, does Powell live here; she said, yes, he does, I am his wife. I then began to search. She was very much alarmed. In Powell's apartment, I found underneath the bed in the back room, this basket, which contained ten pounds weight of thread, half a pound of raven-grey silk, and two dozen pieces of tape. I examined the thread; it corresponded with the thread that Fulwell described. On the Monday night he said he had caried that thread to Powell; and he told me that he had carried thread three times the week before to Powell. I brought it away in the basket. I took the basket to the Compter; Powell owned the basket; he said the goods were brought to him under the idea of their being bought at a sale.</p>

               <p>Q. Are there any entries in that book - A. There are; they have a reference to the articles in this basket, as far as it goes; it does not go to the full extent.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of the thread found in Powell's possession - A. About two pounds, and the silk twenty shillings. Before the Alderman, Powell said the person who had left them at his house was an entire stranger to him.</p>
               <p>Fulwell said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Powell's Defence. After the property was brought to my house, I understood it was bought at a sale. Fulwell brought them to me, and asked me if I would let him leave a parcel a day or two, until he called for it.</p>
               <p>Powell called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

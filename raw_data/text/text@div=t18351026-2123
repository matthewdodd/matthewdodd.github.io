                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper, and live in High-street, Stoke Newington. On Tuesday, the 22nd of September, I missed a cow from I field there—I had seen it safe on the Monday—I milked it at half-past one o'clock—I saw it again in the presence of Arnold, the constable, on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 26th of September—it was worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time.</p>

On Tuesday, the 22nd of September, I was on duty at Stoke Newington, about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's field, and saw the prisoner close by the Manor-house, in the New-road, with the cow—I stopped him—he had an um<lb></lb>brella in his hand, and was driving the cow along in the road—he said he had got very wet the day before—I asked him where he brought the cow from—he said from Woburn, and was going to take it to a butcher in Re<lb></lb>gent-street—he mentioned a name, which I forget—I allowed him to go on—I have since seen the same cow at Lambeth, close by Queen-square, in possession of the man at the shed—it was the cow I saw him with—Arnold was with it.</p>

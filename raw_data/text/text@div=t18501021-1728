                  </hi>. I am a stock-jobber. On 30th July the prisoner was in my service—it was a part of his duty to keep a book, as a check to the bankers' pass-book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and here is the bankers' pass-book—it was his duty to fill up checks overnight, previous to the settling-day, for me to sign in the morning—it was his duty to get from Lubbock and Co., my bankers, a blank check-book when I wanted it—they were in the habit of return<lb></lb>ing cancelled checks every week—it was the prisoner's duty to fetch the pass<lb></lb>book with the cancelled checks, and to check them with the entries in my own duplicate pass-book, and tick them off—on 30th July I am debited in the bankers' pass-book with 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is not entered in the prisoner's book—that book is in his writing—the check appears to have been drawn on self—I drew no check in favour of "self" for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th July—I never authorised the prisoner to draw, sign, or receive any such check—if any such check came to his hands, either paid or otherwise, it would be his duty to account for it in the book—I obtained these two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) horn my bankers somewhere in Sept.—one has on it "R.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185010210034"></xptr>
               <p>I keep my check-book in a drawer in a desk in the Exchange—the prisoner had the key and would leave it in the drawer for me if he had to go away—there are about 800 persons in the Stock Exchange—I hare bad two check<lb></lb>books at a time, I do no think I have had three—the prisoner had no autho<lb></lb>rity to sign checks for me—he had to fill them up every day for me to sign—an entry is made in the margin at the time the check is drawn—the prisoner is seventeen or eighteen years old—his salary was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was recommended to me by Mr. Ricardo, who is a friend of his—there is great noise and confusion in the Exchange at times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, at Messrs. Lubbock's. There is a partner named Sir John William Lubbock, Bart.—there are others—Mr. Keyaer keeps an account there—on 30th July I paid a check for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner, over the counter—I gave him two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 78407 and 78408, both dated 1st July, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—this is one of the notes (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is the custom to return paid checks to the customer—it was the prisoner's custom to receive his master's pass-book each week, with the paid checks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the objections must fail; the evidence supported the fact, that in the regular course of business the check would come into the prisoner's possession; and the notice served on the prisoner in gaol, entitled the prosecutor, in the absence of the document, to give secondary evidence of its contents; for although the prisoner was not a free agent, he had the means of communicating with his legal adviser, and through him, obtaining it; a notice was as binding upon a prisoner as it would be if served on a party bed-ridden or incapable of moving.</hi>

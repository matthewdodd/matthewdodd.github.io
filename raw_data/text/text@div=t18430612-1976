                  </hi>. I am assistant to my uncle, a hosier in New Bond-street—Greville was in my employ from Jan., 1839, till July 3rd, 1841—it was his business to give out work made by women, but principally to Dawson—he introduced her to us as a person who could do needle-work—I knew her as Mrs. Greville—he was known as George Greville.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Broad-street, Groevenor-square. The prisoner was errand-boy to me for about ten days—I sent him, on the 18th of July, to the collector of the assessed taxes at Charing-cross—I gave him three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, two half-crowns, a groat, and a halfpenny, to pay on my account—he went out, and never returned—I was looking for him till November, when he was taken on another charge—he was taken on this charge from Clerkenwell prison, on the 24th of February.</p>

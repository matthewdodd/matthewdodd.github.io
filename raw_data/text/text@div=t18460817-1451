On the 16th of March, about ten minutes after seven o'clock, I was coming down the stairs of Mr. Savory's house, and heard apparently a key opening the front door, which in<lb></lb>duced me to stop—the door opened, and two men rushed in quickly—it was light enough for me to see them—the prisoner was one of them, I am quite positive—he was in the passage, and the other one went up stairs—I have since been to the Penitentiary, seen the other man, and identified him—that man said to the prisoner, "you remain here, John; I will go and see"—the man stepped on the stairs, looked me in the face, and then went up past me—he said nothing to me, nor I to him—it was quite light at the time—Mr. Hans<lb></lb>ford lodged in the second-floor back room, over my head.</p>

My mistress puts some of her washing out—Wednesday is the day for sending the linen—on the 1st of Dee., between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner waiting in the kitchen—I put out a linen while she was there—she was not employed to wash anything—I do not know myself what she came a bout—the value of the articles put out for the laundress was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed them afterwards—they were taken away by somebody.</p>

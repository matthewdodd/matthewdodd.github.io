            . I am a Thames Police-constable. I came up and took hold of the prisoner by the right breast - the captain had hold of him with his left hand; there were a great many odd characters there - as we were going along, the prisoner said he would give me a fiver if I would let him go - I suppose he meant a 5l. note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did it not mean a rap in the mouth? A. I do not know; I was not near enough to see who dropped the book - (this is it.)</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was there any thing in his breast when he was taken? A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had mistaken his person in the crowd, and declared his innocence.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the piece of silk upon the counter before the prisoner came into the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the place where the silk laid? - A. Within half a yard; I covered the piece of silk with the goods I shewed him; he then requested to see another piece of the same kind he had looked out before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by design you had covered this, or by accident? - A. It was rather by design.</p>
               <p>Q. This silk was nothing of that fort that he wanted to see? - A. No; while my head was down, I heard the rustling of silk; I took the goods he looked at out of the counter; I took this third piece from under the counter, and I was obliged to put my head down to reach it out; I suspected it to be the piece of silk that I had covered; I shewed him another piece; he then asked what quantity was sufficient to make him a waistcoat, and, likewise, one for a little boy about twelve years old; I told him the quantity, and what the price of them would come to; he then fixed upon the pattern that he wanted; I went round the counter to get the patterns; and then I saw that the piece was gone; I then pushed too the door, which was not close; I then took the patterns out of the drawer, on the other side of the shop; and, not wishing to be alone, I called the boy to bring me a pair of scissars; the boy brought me a pair of scissars; as soon as I saw the boy coming, I told him, he had stole a piece of silk off the counter; he said, he had not, and turned about and went from me, across the shop, put his hand in the right hand pocket of his great coat, and took out a piece of silk, laid it upon the other counter, and covered it with a piece of goods that was spread upon the counter; he came back again to me, and said, he had not got it, and immediately crossed the shop again, to the place where he had laid the silk; he lifted up the piece of goods that he had covered the silk with, and said, here it is; I told him, I had seen him lay it there; by this time the boy had returned; I sent him to call Mr. Rigge; he very soon came; I related the circumstance to him, and he sent for a constable; the prisoner offered to pay for it; he would do any thing; he would go down upon his knees, or do any thing, that was his expression; Mr. Rigge has the silk, and has had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Is that young man, that you speak of coming to the shop door, here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shopmen have you? - A. None but me.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had a little suspicion, and that induced you to cover the silk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rigge). What is that? - A. A remnant of facing, for under waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (John Strap). That is the silk that lay upon your counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into this shop to buy some waistcoats; as I was going to sea; I went in on the Monday morning to see a piece or two, this piece was enough to face two or three flannel waistcoats, to make me comfortable on board of ship; I desired him to give me a pattern, to be advised whether they would wash in salt water, as fresh water is sometimes scarce; I asked him for a pattern, he turned round to the other counter, and asked me where the piece of silk was I was looking at; I took it in my hand to the other counter where he was, and said, here it is; what I was going to take a pattern of was for flannel waistcoats; I pulled out the money, and said I would pay for it; says I, the only way will be, to send for some person; he sent for his master, and it might be ten minutes before he came, I sat down by the counter; and when he came, he said, he hoped I would not come to defraud him of such a piece of silk as this, as it was only facings for waistcoats; I said, I should not wish to go before a Justice, and I would take it with me, and pay him for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Does your Lordship think there is any evidence as to the capital part of the charge?</p>
               <p>Court. I think there is a great deal of evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. My Lord, the statute of Elizabeth, was made to protect persons in their shops, who, with all their diligence, could not protect themselves; this man declares he had a suspicion that the prisoner was about to commit a felony, and yet he gives him an opportunity of committing that felony, by stooping down, and then he hears the rustling of silk. My Lord, I think there was a case decided by your Lordship, the case of Austin; which is the only case in the books that comes exactly up to the point now under consideration; but the case of Austin was this; he was prosecuted by an emi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130101"></xptr>nent jeweller, in the Strand, into whose good opinion he had contrived to ingratiate himself; but having some suspicion, he laid a plan to detect him; he marked some goods, and when he knew Austin was to come, he leaves the shop, and sets a person to watch, and leaves it entirely under the dominion and controul of Austin; he returned, after some time, looked for the property he had marked, and missed it. It was held, I think, by your Lordship, that that case did not come within the spirit of the act; inasmuch, as he supposed the prisoner was about to commit a felony; and, in consequence of his own want of diligence, gave him an opportunity to commit that felony. I submit to your Lordship, therefore, that it does not come within the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Court. In this case, there is sufficient evidence to go to the Jury.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday morning last, about half past nine o'clock or rather later. I was in Chequer-alley, White Cross-street, and met the prisoner with this basket under his arm, the tin case was in it covered with three large live lobsters and two cabbages. I asked what he had got there, he said he had been to market. I put my hand into the basket, and said "Why here is this on box, where did you get this, and where are you going with it?" he said "I am going to my father's, pray come with me." I took him into a shop - my son came in and searched him. The case contained the articles stated in the indictment, he said he was paid to carry it.</p>

            . I am a green grocer, and live in Fetter-lane. Last Saturday morning about five minutes past nine o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and asked if I had got any potatoes, I said No; he then asked for two cabbages, and while I was looking them out, he picked out three live lobsters, and took from under his coat a red bundle, containing something which from its appearance, I believe to be this box; he asked if I could lend him a basket, saying that he lived at a pawnbrokers in Fleet-market, and wished to carry them down there, and offered to leave me a deposit for it, but I said there was no occasion; he put the bundle in the basket, the lobsters and cabbages over it, and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he with you - A. Four or five minutes. White Cross-street, is about a mile from my place, and beyond Fleet-market. I have no doubt whatever of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday morning about five minutes past nine o'clock, I was in Long-lane, a gentleman who alighted from a chaise cart in Long-lane, gave me two shillings and sixpence to carry it to the flower pot, in Bishopsgate-street, and leave them in the name of Mason. I was going to my father's first.</p>

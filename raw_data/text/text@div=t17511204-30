I had not been there above 3 minutes before a young lad called and told me I had been robbed. I went into the shop and missed a canister No. 8. I went to the door and saw Mr. Hill holding the prisoner by the coat. I begged he would secure him. South went to unbutton his coat, then Mr. Hill secured him by his coat and waistcoat. I saw at the time the canister fall from under the prisoner's waistcoat. There was a pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040018"></xptr> and six ounces of tea in it. [The canister produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill confirmed that of securing him, and seeing the canister fall from him.</p>

On Wednesday the 13th of November, I dined at home and served some customers in the shop, then the goods were there. I went out, when I came home, my wife told me I had been robbed of the goods mentioned, and that the wooden till was found in Jewin-street. On the Thursday se'nnight following, we heard Mrs. Taylor had been robbed, and the person taken in the fact. That his name was South, and that when he was examined before alderman Asgill, he owned he was concerned in robbing me, and mentioned the two prisoners, upon whose information they were taken. South and Farrel were brought to Guild-Hall on the Monday. Sir

             thought necessary to examine them separate. There Farrel gave information where some of my things were. After that he told me how he committed the robbery. That he came into my shop, being best acquainted with it, (as he was apprentice to a shoemaker near me, and has been in my shop often.) He said to Barker, you may as well tell where the things are. Then she told me that she and a woman whom she called Long Sue, sold the tea chest for 3 s. to one Costers, that keeps the Queen's Head in Chick-lane. That they went to one Ferguson's in Barbican, and pawned the stays for 4 s. and the Spoons and Tongs for 6 s. in the name of Cob. I went there, and upon examining their books, there were a pair of stays pawned in the name of Cob, but were fetched out the next day by the same person that brought them. I inquired after the tea chest, but could get no account of it. The people said they knew the prisoners, and that they had been at their house.

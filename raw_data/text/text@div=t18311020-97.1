On the 17th of October last I was in the parlour, between nine and ten o'clock; a person came into the shop, and found the prisoner behind the counter - I went out, and saw him at the street door; I then went to the desk, and missed the bowl, with about 16s. in it - a little boy raised an alarm, and a neighbour pursued the prisoner and brought him back; I went a little way in pursuit, but returned - I did not see him taken, but I am certain he is the same person as I saw at the door; I had seen the bowl of silver safe, about ten minutes before.</p>

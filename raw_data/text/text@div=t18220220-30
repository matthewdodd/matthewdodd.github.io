            9 and 10, were delivered me by them, and stowed in our warehouse, in Moor-lane - I checked them off as being delivered. It is my business to take an account of goods coming in and going out. On the 21st of January, we had an order from Lawrence and Jolland's for goods, and found there ought to be such packages in the warehouse - I entered them in the carrier's book for Ansford to take them. No. 10, weighed 2 cwt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who wrote this paper - A. One Huggins, he is not here. I saw those very packages, nine or ten days after they were brought. If Ansford had not called them over, I should not have checked them off. The guard delivers goods on the road, but when brought to the warehouse, he has nothing to do with them. The waggoner is under the direction of the guard, to whom the bill is delivered. The goods in Moor-lane, are in my care; I lock up, about eight o'clock, and keep the keys. When we are short of hands, the waggoner is employed in the warehouse. We have watchmen at night, and when I am absent in the day, I have a substitute.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Would Cochrane have to load and unload - A. If he had time; his duty is generally out of doors; he did not guard these goods to Moor-lane.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When goods are to be taken from Moor-lane, the waggon is brought there - A. Yes; but they generally take from there direct to Paddington - they are generally loaded by Cork, Lord, and Ansford. If they are to be delivered in town, the waggon comes into the warehouse, and the goods are lowered into it - Cork would be one of the persons to do that. Ansford calls them over, and I tick them off, which enables me to say they came into the warehouse.</p>

            . I slept in Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square, on the 9th or 10th of January, at Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200022"></xptr>Morris's. I had been to the play with Mr. Morris and his wife, and slept there all night; he is no relation of mine, they lodge there. I have a brother named Smith, who is now indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, next morning, take away any goods from there - A. Yes. I went home in a coach, and took them with me - the goods had been in the passage at Morris's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Morris's did you expect any goods to be there - A. No; the goods were lifted into the coach by Morris and my brother. When I got home, I opened them, and found they contained muslins, they were corded up in coarse wrappers - I did not notice whether they had been opened before. There was a mark on the wrapper, in ink, I did not notice the figures or letters. My brother went home with me in the coach; he got out at the end of Old Jewry - I went on in the coach to Tenter-street, with the goods, and put them in my passage; I got home a little past nine o'clock in the morning, and my brother came home in about half an hour. Barber and I helped him to take the goods up stairs, into the sitting room, it was opened there, and contained from sixty to sixty-five pieces of muslin; I left them in the room without packing them up again. About an hour after this, Cochrane came, the girl might be in the room, and if she was, I sent her out - Cochrane said he wanted 73 l. for the muslins; I said I I could not tell what I could give for them, until I saw what they would fetch; my brother, Smith, was present at this conversation. Cochrane said he should send his wife for some for her own use; he went away, leaving the goods, and my brother went out - I did not look at the packages when they were at my house, to see the marks of them. Cochrane's wife came in about an hour or two, and took two fine pieces and another coarse, this was either on a Wednesday or Thursday. Cochrane called again the same day, and said if either of the other two men should call with him, I was to say I was only to give 40 l. for them. On Saturday night Cochrane, came with Atkinson, whom I had seen in his company in the street before, and am sure he is the man; Cochrane said to him,</p>
               <p>"These are the goods, and Mrs. Smith is to give 40 l. for them," Atkinson said,</p>
               <p>"Very well," they went away; I think my girl let them in that day - they were in the bed-room where the muslin was. Cochrane called in the course of the next week, to know if I had any money, I told him I had not, I had told him his wife had had three pieces, he said, very well - his wife afterwards came, I gave her 8 l. I afterwards told him she had 8 l., he said, very well; he called several times for money, and I paid him 6 l., he and his wife had in all 28 l. at different times - I thought it was 30 l., but it was counted up, and was only 28 l. On the Sunday after, before I was taken to prison, on the Monday, I saw Cork at my house, it was on the 27th of January, Cochrane was with him; we went into the bed-room, Cochrane said,</p>
               <p>"Mistress how much money have you paid?" I said 30 l. Cork said,</p>
               <p>"That is, right Mistress; I thought Robert was on the shuffle" - my husband's sister was there at the time, but not in the bed-room. Cochrane went away, and Cork stopped and had some ale with my brother, who was at home, but not in the bed-room - Cork called several times at my house, and enquired for my brother, but nothing passed about the goods. My brother lived with me, he was a pawnbroker's servant out of place. I paid 28 l. in all; there was one 5 l. Bank note among it; I pledged some of the goods, (two parcels) at Mr. Sowerby's, Chiswell-street, for 1 l. 10 s., and sent some to be pledged by my servant; I think she only pawned two pieces. I know Mrs. Bowers she pawned some for me. I offered some to a gentleman one morning for sale, I asked him 30 s. a piece for the fine, and 20 s. for the coarse. I know Forster, I told him I had goods to sell, and he said he would send a gentleman to look at them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Your's is a room over a stable - A. Yes; I have two rooms, one leads to the other. My brother lived with me; I have two beds in one room, and a turn-up one in another - I do not know where my brother is; I did not give him notice to be off - I have not seen him since the morning I was taken to prison - he was to receive no part of the money for them, nor pay any part, he only lifted them in the coach. I was only put to the bar once at the office; I was taken there three times, as a criminal. I did not know that my brother was off when I became a witness. I had no communication with any body. Cochrane shewed Atkinson the goods, and said,</p>
               <p>"These are the goods," he said, very well. I do not know whether my servant saw Atkinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How much did you raise on the muslins which you pawned - A. I do not know; I gave the officer all the duplicates. I went to the play with Mr. and Mrs. Morris, and next morning, Morris came up, and said George had left a large bundle in the passage, and George came up to me, he said he had them from Cochrane, and he was coming to my house to look at them - it was bulky, I did not know the contents till I got home, I did not conceal it.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not conversation in one of your rooms be heard in the other - A. Not without paying particular attention. I told the officers of it directly they came to my house. I was not so much surprised to find muslin in it, as I might have been. I gave Cochrane's wife a 5 l. note, which I had saved for my rent; I mentioned this at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you send the servant out of the room - A. No; she was in the sitting room - I went into the bed room. I have been in custody ever since. I have had no promise that I shall not be prosecuted.</p>

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have seen your mistress in Giltspur-street Compter, three times - A. Yes; I could not hear what Cochrane said to my mistress when he came, I heard talking in the room.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I went to Mrs. Smith's on the 28th of January, and found a quantity of muslins; Horn cut patterns of two of them - I found nine duplicates of muslins, pawned at different pawnbroker's, in a cash-box, in her parlour, I think it was locked. Mrs. Morris gave me one or two pieces, at her house, in Wilmot-street.</p>

            . I am captain of Mr. Bache's boat, the Defiance. About the 21st of January, I met Cochrane, at Paddington, by Pickford's warehouses; he asked me if I had met his waggon, I said, No. He said he thought the waggon had been come, and that he had been into the town, to carry a great deal of money for Mr. Bache; he put his hand to his side-pocket, and shewed me a great quantity of sovereigns, there was a handful of sovereigns.</p>

            , re-examined. Cochrane had some talk with me about money, about the time the muslin was missed; he came to me and said, he had been extremely fortunate, that he had found a purse, containing a sum of money; I asked how much, he said there was some sovereigns in it. I asked him if there was any bills in it, to lead to a discovery of the owner, he said, Yes; there was a bill; I asked if it was a bill of exchange, he seemed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200024"></xptr>not to understand me; I asked if it was a Bank of England note, he said it was very much like one, that he found it near the London Docks - I advised him to have it advertized, he said he would look at the papers and see if the owner had advertized it. I cautioned him not to make an extravagant use of it; he said he would not, and that he had handed it over to his wife. About a week or ten days after, we had a further conversation; he said it contained more than he had told me. I asked him what, he said it contained a bill of 10 l., payable at the Bank of England, but not a Bank note, and that it had been out for three or four years, that his brother had taken it, and it was paid without hesitation - he had 32 s. a week.</p>

               <p>COCHRANE'S Defence. I can account for the money. My master sent me to Charing-cross, for twenty-one sovereigns; I often had 30 l. of his money. The money I spoke to Haynes about I found the Sunday before Christmas-day; as I was going to Limehouse. I told him to look in the papers for an advertisement - it was as hard for me to get the goods, as to break from this bar.</p>
               <p>Atkinson put in a written defence, denying the charge, and stating that the guard always directed him to deliver the packages.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 5, Fort-street, in the Liberty of the Old Artillery-ground, and am a silk-manufacturer. On the night of 7th Feb., I retired to bed about eleven o'clock—the doors and windows were all fastened—the window on the staircase on the first-floor was shut, but not fastened—I rose the next morning, between seven and eight—the staircase window was open, and the warehouse, the drawers, and other packet, in great confusion—I missed a great quantity of goods, eight pieces of black satinette, worth about I 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a piece, and one piece of blue, value about 1 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after a careful examination of this black satinette dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and comparing it with my usual goods, I am deliberately of opinion that it is cut off from one of the pieces I had lost—I examined the shute, the warp, and the leasure, and from that I firmly believe it was a piece taken from mine—I have no doubt of it in my own mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Edmunds. On the afternoon before this robbery, I was standing near the staircase-window, at a little after four o'clock—I saw Arno on the other side of the way, looking up at the window—I was very near the window; I did not go quite close to the glass—I am quite sure he is the man—he then turned himself to the door of a public-house, and appeared to me as if he called a person out—I could not hear what he said—a person, who I believe was Langford, came out and joined him—they entered into conversation for a few minutes, both looking up at the window—I left them there when I went down—next morning, about seven o'clock, I observed that window open—I afterwards went to Stepney station—I saw the officer—I was shown several men, and picked out Langford.</p>

I lived with the prisoner for or five years as his wife—his right name is Arno—I recollect his saying they were going to a silk <hi rend="italic">drum;</hi> I do not know who he meant—he came home, and said the old man was not in the country yet—I do not know what day this was; it was eleven or twelve weeks ago—about a fortnight or three weeks after that, he asked me to come to Langford'8—on going there, we found him in bed with his wife; it was between seven and eight o'clock in the morning—Arno said to Lang<lb></lb>ford, "Arthur, give Harriet sixteen yards of black satinette"—Langford brought two sixteen yards from a table in the end of the room, put them on a table in the middle of the room, and tore them in two—Arno gave them to me, and I carried them home—while we were there, Langford's wife said she should like a dress of some blue silk, but they said it was too well known, she must not have it—when I took the two sixteen yards of black satinette home, Arno offered one to a young girl that used to come there, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she would not buy it—I had the other made up into a dress; this is it—I afterwards gave it to Smith, the policeman—I had to pay Arno 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, at four times—a young woman who is outside saw me pay him the money.</p>

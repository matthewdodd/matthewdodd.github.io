The prisoner came into our room and I was alone, she desir'd I would go and fetch her a dram : said I, I cannot go, and I told her the shop was just by, and she might go; for, said I, there is no body in the house but my self: No, no, said she, I must not go out; I may as well have it here that you may drink some: I refus'd going; then she said, Go, huffey , if you don't I shall make you; at last she gave me a penny, and bid me go for a penny worth of anniseed; then I went and met my master; he ask'd me where I was going; said I, For a dram for a gentlewoman that came in a little time ago: After I came back, my master went to the closet, and said he missed his waistcoat, I said, no body had been there but that gentlewoman, (she was drest very well or I would not have gone out for her.) When she got up the waistcoat hung down longer than her cloak from under her arm, and my master took it from her : she went to run out from him and he stop'd her; she said she would give him a crown not to expose her, but he did not let her go; then the neighbours came in and they took her up.</p>

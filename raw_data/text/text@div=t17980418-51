               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the boy? - A. Yes; I cried out, You thief, you thief; he had no shoes on, and he ran to the door, and jumped down three steps; I called watch, thieves, and he jumped almost into the watchman's arms, and he brought him in immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in this till? - A. About three pound's worth of halfpence and farthings, and three shillings and sixpence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he near the till when you first saw him? - A. Quite close to it.</p>
               <p>Q.How could the boy get there? - A. By opening the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen the drawer? - A. Not ten minutes before; he saw me serving a person with a quartern loaf, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure no person had been in after that customer went away? - A. Yes; I then went and sat down to my work in the parlour, till I was disturbed by the noise of the rattling of the money.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you no servants that might have gone out in the mean time? - A. Every body in the house was in bed but myself, and a little girl about twelve years old, and she was in the room with me all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shut the door when the customer went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180035"></xptr>away, the customer or you? - A. I did; there is a latch to the door, and a bell upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you put down that latch? - A. Yes; I am sure it was latched.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you paid that attention to it, that you can swear the latch was down? - A. Yes; I do; we always do it after every person that comes in after dark; I am sure it was down.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear your latch open? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the door open? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was quite dark at this time? - A. Yes, past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband at this time? - A.in bed. He came down in his shirt when I cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure he is the same boy you saw in the shop? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You say there was a bell at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear the bell go? - A. No. Any body might come in if they opened it gently, without the bell ringing, if they opened it with a steady hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do not you think it more probable that he might have slipped in when the customer went out, than that he should have opened the door? - A. No, he did not come in with the customer.</p>

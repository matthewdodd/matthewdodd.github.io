On Thursday, the 27th of June, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I saw him close by the East India Docks, about three miles from Mr. Byas's house, walking towards London, with a bundle under his arm wrapped up in a blue handkerchief, with a white cloth round it—I could see the blue handkerchief through the cloth—I asked him were he was going—be said to London—I asked what he had in the bundle—he would not tell me—I went down to Mr. Byas and gave him information of what I had seen—about ten o'clock I went with a police<lb></lb>man to Petticoat-lane—we saw the prisoner standing there, and took him to the station-house—I saw the policeman take a red handkerchief off his neck.</p>

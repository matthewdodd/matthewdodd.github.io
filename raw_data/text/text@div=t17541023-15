I laid hold on him; he threw it on the ground; I held him by the collar with one hand, and took the handkerchief up with the other. Then I sent to Billingsgate for a constable; before the constable came the prisoner pulled out a claspt knife and opened it. One Mr. Wright, a shipwright, who knew me, coming by, assisted me, for there were then two other persons who I believe belonged to the prisoner, for they wanted to get him loose. The constable came and took the knife from him; then he was taken to Guildhall and charged with it, but he there denied taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner from you when you mist your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>J. Pecknall. I only took one step and laid hold on him; he had not had the handkerchief half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the handkerchief?</p>
               <p>J. Pecknall. It cost as. it has been very little us'd.</p>

            . I am constable; I took this knife from the prisoner (producing one) there were two or three more persons with him when I first came to him, but they made off. We took him before Mr. Alderman Alexander, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going down Darkhouse Lane eating, a bit of bread and cheese, with my knife in my hand, and the gentleman took hold of me, and accus'd me of picking his pocket; I saw it lying on the ground, and had taken it up; I said, Sir, if it is yours you may take it from the ground for I took it from thence, and flung it down again: and before I could put my knife up he took it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Question to the prosecutor. Was the prisoner eating when you took hold on him?</p>
               <p>J. Pecknall. No, my Lord, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q Had he his knife in his hand then?</p>
               <p>J. Pecknall. No, he pull'd that out while I had him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he threaten you when he took it out;</p>
               <p>J. Pecknall. No, he did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a zinc manufacturer in the Hampstead-road. On the night of the 23rd of May I was walking along Middle-row—I felt a pull at my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner close behind me—I seized him by the collar—he attempted to escape—I succeeded in detaining him—there was a struggle—he knocked my hat off, and struck me in the left eye—he ran—Mr. Wrench came up, laid hold of him, and I gave him in charge—I missed my handkerchief—it was not found—there were two or three others near—I am sure no body could have been close enough to take it but him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather-finisher, and live at 3, White's Ground, Westminster. Last Sunday morning, about half-past twelve, I was in Petticoat-lane—I had a silver watch in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, with a silk guard attached to it, which went through a button-hole and round my neck—I was surrounded by three or four men, and afterwards I felt my guard come tight round my neck—I put my hand to my pocket and found my watch was gone—I turned and saw the prisoner with a part of ray watch<lb></lb>guard in his hand—I went and drew the guard out of his hand, and asked him what he had done with my watch—he turned round and said, "Do you hear this <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> accusing me of stealing his watch?"—I saw the officer, told him, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder, of Collingwood-street, Bethnal<lb></lb>green. I was in Petticoat-lane—there were a good many people there—I saw the prisoner come down the lane, with a waistcoat on his arm, in a very great hurry—he crossed over and joined three other persons—they then met the prosecutor, one in front, two behind, and the prisoner on one side of him—I saw the prisoner's arm in a particular kind of way, as if he was about to take the watch, but I cannot swear he did take it—I saw his hand working,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185002040049"></xptr>
               <p>and then he drew it out and passed a watch to a man behind—I saw the back of it—the man who had it, escaped with the two others down a turning—I said to the prosecutor, "There goes the man that has got your watch"—he said, "Never mind; I will keep this one I have got," and he kept him till the policeman came.</p>

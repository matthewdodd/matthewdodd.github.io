                  </hi>. I live in Museum-street, Bloomsbury. On Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 8th of Sept., between twelve and one o'clock, I met the prisoner at the bottom of Oxford-street—we went to a public-house—I staid there from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour—I then went with her to a house in George-street, and staid there from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour—we walked about from that time till between four and five o'clock in the morning, when I went with her again to George-street, and staid till between nine and ten o'clock—I had some money in my right-hand trowsers-pocket—there was no one in the house but the prisoner, I, and the servant, who came up to let us into the room, and locked the door on the outside—when I got up, be<lb></lb>tween nine and ten o'clock, I put on my trowsers, and my money was gone—I accused the prisoner, and she said she had not taken any—I said she must, for there was no one else in the room—I knocked—the servant came up and opened the door—I told her, and went out and got a constable—I am sure I had the money when I went into the room with her—I counted the money after I gave her a half-crown in the room, after the door was locked—I had then 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loose money in my pocket—she said she would show the money in her hand to the landlady's daughter at the door—I said there was a sixpence I could swear to—I knocked the sixpence out of her hand—I took that in my hand before I went for a policeman—it is a sixpence I have had in my possession some months—I gave it to the inspector.</p>

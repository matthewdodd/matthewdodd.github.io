                  </hi>. I live in Harrison-street, Grays Inn-lane. I met the prisoner on Sunday morning, the 30th of July, between half-past three and half-past four o'clock, in company with another female—I went home with them to a house in Church-street—to the second floor—I was quite sober—I was in the room about half an hour altogether—the other woman was not present at the time—I sat down, and was dosing off to sleep—the pri soner thought I was asleep, and put her hand into my pocket, and took out 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a pen-knife—she placed a chair across the bedstead—I felt the tug at my watch, and found the door shut and bolted all in a moment—I called out of window, but could get no attendance—the key of the door was turned on me as well—I burst the door open in about ten minutes, got out, and went to the station-house—an officer went with me to look at the place, but could not find the parties—he advised me to go to wards Covent-garden, and in Belton-street I met the prisoner, a man, and another woman—while I was looking for a policeman, they gave me the slip—I went to the station-house and gave information, and on returning to the room, I found all the furniture gone out of it, but an old bedstead—I can swear the prisoner is the person who took my watch—I saw her with it—a chair was put across the door-way to trip me up, and before I could pass it, the door was fastened on me—she shut the door, and hasped it, and then must have placed the padlock on it—it was done momentarily—I stumbled over the chair, and she shut the door before I could get up—she was on the other side of the chair—she had placed it so as to have a free passage to escape, and to trip me up with it—the place was not dark, but it was placed so near my feet I stumbled over it—I have never found the watch.</p>

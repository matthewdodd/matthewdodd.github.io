                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector</hi>). On the 5th June I was watching the Royal Oak beer shop, kept by Lawrence, in Chenies-street—about half past 10 o'clock in the morning I saw Jacobson come there—I knew him before—he could not see me, I was in a house—Jacobson staid in the Royal Oak about five minutes, then he and Lawrence came out together—they proceeded to a place near there, called North-street mews—I followed them—Lawrence has a stable there, and they both went into it together, and were in there from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour—they then came out, and Jacobson was carrying a bundle under his arm, tied up in a handkerchief, which I now produce—it contained this vase and stand—(neither of the pri<lb></lb>soners had anything when they went into the stable)—when they came out, they went into North-street, and both went into a public house—they remained in there about two minutes—they came out together, and had a conversation for two or three minutes—they then separated, and I followed Jacobson, who had the parcel—I stopped him in Mortimer-street, which is in a line with Goodge-street—I told him I was a police officer, and asked him what he had got—he said, "A vase"—I asked him where he got it from—he said he had bought it—I asked him when—he said, "This morning"—I asked him the name of the person of whom he bought it—he made no reply—I asked him where the person lived of whom he bought it—he made no reply—I asked him what the person was of whom he bought it, and he said that he knew him very well, and he believed him to be a respectable man—I then asked him his name, and he said his name was Woolf—at this time I was joined by the officer Smith—the prisoner then said his name was Jacobson, and that my brother officer knew him—he said his name was Woolf, and he lived at 16, Tottenham-court-road—I asked him if he had any other place of business except in Tottenham-court-road—he said, "No"—I have since discovered another place of business that he has, at 315 Oxford-street—he there has the name of Woolf over the door, and at Tottenham-court-road the name of Jacobson—he is there a refiner and watch maker, and at Oxford-street a watch maker and jeweller.</p>

            . On the 15th of December I was at the end of London-bridge, and saw the prisoner and another person cross from Fish-street-hill; I turned to watch them, and saw this lad going down Thames-street - the one that was in company with the prisoner got in conversation with the boy; he then came and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150055"></xptr>spoke to the prisoner, who went and spoke to the lad, and took him down as far as Brick-lane - I still watched them, and when they came to Fashion-street, I saw the prisoner with the boots in his possession; I crossed the street, and asked where he was going with them - he said to his master, who lived in some square; I cast my eye on the direction, and said, "This will not do," you must go back with me - the boy still said it was right, but I said it was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with another man? A. Yes - the other one went as far as the Custom-house with the boy, and then afterwards he followed behind the prisoner and the lad when they got to Tower-hill; the boy was not above ten yards from the prisoner when I detained him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Thames-street, and crossed Tower-hill - the lad came and asked me the direction; he had first inquired of an oyster-woman - I could not tell him; he said he had never been there before - when the officer took me, he asked where I was going, and I said to Webb-square; I said "The boots are not mine, they belong to that lad;" I have a brother lives in Fashion-street, and I was going there: I was sent here for stealing, and you cannot prove this is stealing - it was getting them under false pretences. <rs id="t18290115-130-verdict681" type="verdictDescription">

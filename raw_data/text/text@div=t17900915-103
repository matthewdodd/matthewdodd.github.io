               <p>I am a native of Jamaica: I lodge in Basinghall-street. On the 16th of July, I was coming through <placeName id="t17900915-103-crimeloc547">St. James's Park</placeName>

               <p>How soon did you pick him out? - When I got up to him, they had got as far as the middle walk of the mall; after he was searched, he was carried to Bow-street in a coach; there he was examined for a long time; and at last I saw the watch produced, but did not see it pulled out of his pocket; the watch was handed to me by Sir Sampson Wright, and I gave it back again into his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. You have been used to see the king go to the levee in this country before? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Then, perhaps, you have known that you have seen as great a crowd before? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>You had no opportunity of discovering any persons faces, but in the midst of that crowd? - I believe I recollect that man before.</p>
               <p>The crowd that happened to you was no more than is common? - Yes, it was done in rather a different manner than common crowds are.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Macmanus searched the prisoner in the park? - Yes, I was; the prisoner never went out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Even at Bow-street, there was nothing found on him but your watch? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. There was a great crowd that day? - No, there was not much crowd, indeed not so many as usual, on that day; I suppose there might be about 100, and sometimes there are 5 or 600.</p>

               <p>- I am a broker; I was in the Park, attending at the King's levee, when this matter happened: there was a piece of work, and I ran to see what was the matter; and the prosecutor said he was robbed of his pocket-book and watch: Mr. Macmanus had the prisoner in custody; we found nothings on him then; Mr. Macmanus delivered him into our custody, and we took him to Bow-street: he had an hearing; and Sir Sampson desired we would examine him more minutely; which we did; and, in searching of him, we found the watch in his left-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What time was this? - Between two and three.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the robbery was committed that you had him in custody? - About five minutes.</p>
               <p>You searched him before, and you found nothing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never thought of examining the pocket before? - Yes, we had done it before, but it was not there then.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of July, between twelve and one, just as the King was getting out of the coach, and going in to the levee, there was a great noise behind where I stood; I looked about, and saw the prosecutor and another man standing; and he said, that is the man there that robbed me: I and the prosecutor followed him, and he rather stood still; I took him and searched him, and found a watch in his fob, which the prosecutor said was none of his; I said to the prosecutor, be careful what you are about, this man having nothing about him as I could see; but he was still suspicious, and we put him in a coach in Pall-Mall; I was obliged to stay at St. James's, so did not go to the office.</p>
               <p>The watch was produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor, as also the seals.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

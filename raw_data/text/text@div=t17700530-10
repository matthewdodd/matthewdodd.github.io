            . On Saturday the 5th of May, between four and five in the afternoon, I was returning from settling an account with a merchant in Thames-street. I was gone into a house; soon after Mr. Mosely came in, and said, You have had your pocket picked. I said, if it was, it is a silk handkerchief. I had not missed it; I felt, and missed it. He said, when you was turning to go into this house, I saw this man take your handkerchief out of your pocket; he had the prisoner and handkerchief with him. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)</p>

I ran after him; he ran on to the Tower-ditch. When I was within a yard of him he flung it into the ditch. I had him held till I got down and got it; then I brought him back to Mr. Bristow with the handkerchief.</p>

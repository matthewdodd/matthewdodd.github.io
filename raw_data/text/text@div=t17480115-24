             . On the 19th of Dec. I was at my shop-door, in <placeName id="t17480115-24-crimeloc141">Holborn</placeName>

I thought it was a pity the gentleman should have his pocket picked, and I went after him, but lost sight of him, and could not find him. Another gentleman said, if I saw such a thing done, I was to blame, if I did not take them up: for I connived at felony. I followed them into Wild-street, and I met a neighbour; he asked me what I was going about, I told him; he said, they were gone before. I took one of them in Clare market, and my neighbour, the next witness, found the handkerchief in the Prisoner Harvey's breeches. Harvey said, there is the boy that took the handkerchief: I secured him too, and they both charged one another with it. I am sure these are the two boys, whether they had the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, or not, I can't tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cromer-street, New-road. At half-past ten o'clock at night, on the 23rd of Nov., I met two females, but not the pri<lb></lb>soners—I went with them to the Crown, and had a quartern of gin—there I met the two prisoners, and we all went to the <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry</hi> shop, and had I a pot of ale—we then all went to No. 10, Church-court—I, and my partner, and all the women went together up stairs—I sat on the bedstead, and as I was rather intoxicated, I went off to sleep—when I awoke there were two policemen in the room—I had lost 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my hat and handkerchief.</p>

               <p>the bed—the prisoners and the other two left—I locked the door, and when the prosecutor had lain there about an hour, I took off my coat, and was going to lie down by his side—a shilling fell out of my pocket, and that seemed to arouse the company in the other room—the room door was burst open, after I had locked it—the two prisoners came in, and three fellows stood at the room door, and said they would kill me if I said a word—the prisoners I went up to the prosecutor, and laid on the bed with him—I saw them rob him—they took his handkerchief, and the money was in it, in his pocket—I cannot say which of the prisoners took it—one of the men threatened my life if I said a word—after they had quitted the room I went down to get a po<lb></lb>lice man, and I was thrown on my head into the passage by a lot of fellows—I got out, and got two policemen—I was sober—I had been with the prose<lb></lb>cutor from about half-past nine till about twelve.</p>

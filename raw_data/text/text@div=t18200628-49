The party separated - the prisoner passed me, and went into a baker's shop. I cannot say he was one of the party. I went into the shop, and accused him of picking my pocket. He wanted to force his way out of the shop, I pushed him in, and said he should not go till he was searched; and in the act of pushing him in I saw him throw the parcel into the street; I jumped out and picked it up, it was my parcel. I laid hold of him - one of the party came and said he would assist me in taking him - I said</p>
               <p>"You are an accomplice, and I shall not let him go." The prisoner then struck me, the men jumped on my arm, and wrenched him away from me - I followed and secured him without losing sight of him. He struck me and got away again; several of them rescued him - everybody was afraid to assist me. I dodged him round a cart and took him again, he was then secured. I never lost sight of him.</p>

He broke from the prosecutor, and was taken again. I was afraid to assist in taking him, but never lost sight of him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alderman Plomer. The prisoner has been a <rs id="t17731020-52-deflabel266" type="occupation">weekly servant</rs>

               <p>- Carter. I keep a public house in Leadenhall-street: the prisoner was in my house the 22d of September, drinking a pint of beer; Mr. Plomer sent for me, and told me he was under an apprehension that the prisoner had been robbing him of some soap, and asked me if I ever knew of any being brought to my house; Mr. Plomer went with me and stood at the door; I went in and told him somebody wanted him at the door; he saw Mr. Plomer, and did not go directly, but staid to drink his beer, and then went to make water; Mr. Plomer came in and took him away; I looked under the place where he had his beer, and found the soap; I do not know who left it there; I had not looked in that place I suppose a twelve-month before. On his cross examination, he said the prisoner denied taking the soap at first, and then he said he took it for his own use; that he told him if he confessed, he believed Mr. Alderman Plomer would pardon him for so trifling an offence if he confessed it.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not tell him you had any authority from Mr. Plomer to promise him that?</p>
               <p>Carter. No, but that it was my opinion.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. It was the means that induced him to confess?</p>
               <p>Carter. I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Thomas Street. I am the constable that took him; when he was before the Aldermen he said it was the first offence, and begged the Alderman to pardon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The offence I am charged with I am innocent of; no man living can say I took the soap.</p>
               <p>He called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

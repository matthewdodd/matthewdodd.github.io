            . On the 21st of June, about ten o'clock at night, I was going along <placeName id="t18220703-48-crimeloc255">Goswell-street</placeName>

I instantly pursued him, crying Stop thief! He was stopped - I came up and collared him; I am sure he is the man. I lost sight of him a short time; there was a strong gas-light by the spot where he robbed me - I knew him again instantly; I saw his face. I have not found the watch.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker. I was about two yards behind the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner run down the passage - the watch was in his hand; I did not see him again till he was in the watch-house. I am positive of him by his dress - he had a fustian jacket and white apron tucked round him. When he ran down the passage, two young fellows ran up to him. There was a good gaslight.</p>

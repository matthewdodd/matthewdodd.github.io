                  </hi>I live with Mr. Peter Brandon, a surgeon, in Tavistock-square. On the evening of the 31st of December, the prisoner came to the house, and said he came for a lady's bonnet from Mrs. Allen, of Regent-street—I told him no such article had been ordered—he desired me to inquire, and having received orders not to leave the street-door, I called another servant and she went to inquire—he asked me after she was gone to go up stairs too, but I would not quit the door—he then snatched the coat off the hall-stand and ran off—I pursued him directly, and never lost sight of him—I gave him into custody—this is the coat—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is my master's.</p>

                  </hi>I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's house with a coat, and run off with it—I pursued, and saw him taken into custody—he threw the coat on some railings as he ran.</p>

He threw the coat down, and ran on to the bottom of the square before he was stopped—he had only got five or six doors off—the policeman was on the spot within two minutes—he could run fast enough—he was not in the least drunk—Brockbank pursued him as well as me, and seized him immediately—he took the coat as I was at the door—I had the candle in one hand, and the handle of the door in the other.</p>

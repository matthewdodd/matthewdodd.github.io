                  </hi>. I live in Gloucester-street, Commercial-road, and am a cigar manufacturer—my warehouse is in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney. I locked up the premises on the 18th of March, at nine o'clock at night—I Went there next morning, about half-past six, and found the yard gate broken open, and the warehouse entered by breaking two locks—I missed three cases of cheroots, worth about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., weighing 210lbs., and about 45lbs. of cigars. in a bundle—I made inquiry of a turnpike man, and, sent the constable to the prisoner's house, in Dean-street, Spitalfields—I went there myself soon after—a woman opened the door, and gave the keys to Pritchard—the gates were locked—the woman opened them—I went in, and found a cart there, with some broken pieces of cigars in it—the horse was standing in the stable, and appeared to have been driven, for the sweat was dried on its neck, and not cleaned off—I went into the house—I noticed a door on my right hand on the second floor which was fastened—I forced it open, and in that room found my three chests of cheroots, and one box with the cigars k it—they as made in London, and are my manufacture—the lids of the chests were left behind in the warehouse—I have compared them with the chests and have no doubt they are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Mile-end, and am toll-collector at the gate. On the 19th of March, between one and two o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I was on duty at the gate in Whitechapel-road, and saw a cart pass through, the prisoner and two other men were in it—I had known the pri<lb></lb>soner for eight months before—I saw the name on the cart was Gummer or Gunner—I asked him what he was doing out at that time in the morning—he made no answer, but paid me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and drove on—I am certain it was him—I saw the cart pass through again in about three quarters of an hour, in the same direction as it had originally gone through—there is a way it could have gone without coming through on the way back, and the same lad, I thought, who drove before was in it then, but not the prisoner.</p>

On the 19th of March before two o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise, and went to the window—I saw a cart standing at Mr. Johnston's premises—there was one man in the cart, and two or three out of it—I had not time to distinguish their faces—they threw a box on the shaft of the cart, and one inside—the men who were out<lb></lb>side lifted or threw it in—the man on the cart took the reins and drove off quickly, and the men walked off.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Bricheno, at the Skinner-street place, where the prisoner was employed - he ought to account to me there, for the money he receives every day, in the evening; he had a book of cheques, by which he kept his account - he calls the account over from the counterpart of his cheques, and I enter it into a book, and then call it over again, to see if it is correct - I then ask him how much cash he has; he gives me an account of his gold, silver, and copper, and if anything is short, he puts so much short; the counterpart of the cheque is written by him. Neale, of Philip-lane, sells our intermediate beer: I have an entry to him on the 1st of May, of half a barrel, 12s. 6d., and 12s. 6d. paid - I took that entry from the prisoner's month, and from his receipts; here is the counterpart of the receipt in his writing - it corresponds with my entry, and at the end of that day I have his own writing for the money he paid in, which agrees with the account he gave; 12s. 6d. is the only sum he accounted for as received from Neale. On the 13th of June, Springsguth came, and particularly wanted some beer to be sent; he ordered one half-barrel, or eighteen gallons - I could not send it till one of the men came home - he came again about eight o'clock, and soon after I sent by the prisoner one half-barrel for him, and another for Mr. Wilkinson, of Tenter-row; he returned at half-past ten, saying he had brought one back, as Wilkinson's was shut up, and had put it into the ton room - he paid me 12s. 6d. for Springsguth's half-barrel; there are so many casks in the ton room, we could not discover whether the other had been put there or not - he never gave me an account of having sold Springsguth two half-barrels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it your business to pay over to the prosecutor the sums as you receive them? A. No, in a lump - I pay them next morning, keeping each drayman's cash in a separate bag; the prisoner never ran an account with me - he said on the 24th of July, that he had been knocked down and robbed of his books; that was after this transaction - he did not send for me to his lodgings: I went there to take him into custody - that was about three days after he said he had been knocked down; he had not come to business after the 24th; I did not find him at his lodgings, but in the street: five days before he was taken, a message was sent that he had been knocked down, and lost his book; that was the very last day he went out with the dray - when I saw him he seemed as if he had been fighting; he said he had lost the books, not that he was robbed of them - he is married, and has a family.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he had laid out any money for necessaries, would that be charged to him immediately and deducted? A. Yes - that was settled every Saturday night: I produce the original book; he accounted to me every night for what he received.</p>

            . I live in Old-street, and deal in intermediate beer. On the 13th of June I had two kilderkins from the prosecutor; I never before, nor since, had two in one day - here is the receipt for them: I sent to the prosecutor that day, and the prisoner brought two kilderkins on a sledge; he was to take one to another person - he asked if I objected to take two; I took them, and my brother paid him for them, in my presence; he filled the receipt up - here is the receipt; it is for two kilderkins - here is my hand-writing on it.</p>

            . This receipt is in the prisoner's hand-writing; I have not got the counterpart of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Look at both these receipts - do you say that both these names are in the prisoner's handwriting? A. I am positive the same person wrote both; he did not pay me more than 12s. 6d. - it is impossible I can be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written) I most solemnly assert my innocence of the charge altogether. As regards the money which Mr. Springsguth's brother says he paid me, I can call to mind, that on the 13th of June last, late in the evening (it might be about nine o'clock), I was sent out with beer to several customers, and among the number Mr. Springsguth was one, and ordered one cask; after going to the customers (to whom I had been), on my return homewards, I called upon Mr. Springsguth, having two casks left; always alive to the interest of my employer, I prevailed upon Mr. Springsguth to take both the casks, for which, it appears by the receipt, he paid me. My Lord and Gentlemen, I observed before that as Mr. Springsguth ordered but one cask - the counterpart of the receipt might have been marked for one cask, while I delivered the money for two casks, thus the error might easily arise; he it as it may, I am confident the money was accounted for; Mr. Greathead (if he speaks impartially) cannot deny that errors have crept in, in the manner I have just now described- I am conscious of having given Mr. Springsguth's money to Mr. Greathead; it being late, he put the money into his right-hand waistcoat pocket, and did not enter it in the book - next morning he might have forgotten it.</p>

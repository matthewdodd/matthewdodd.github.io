I am quite sure he was one of the three.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I running when I was stopped - A. I think he was, I came up immediately as he was stopped.</p>

            . I am a market-woman, and live in Gilbert-street, Bloomsbury. I was going up Lombard-street, about seven o'clock in the morning, and heard the prosecutor crying Stop thief,! and saw three men coming along with pipes in their mouths, one ran and the other two walked to the end of the street - the one ran up Birchin-lane, I went up the lane, and called out Stop thief! the prisoner walked with another person to the end of the street, and then ran, he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You told the Lord Mayor that another man passed me in Birchin-lane - A. The first man ran up there, then the prisoner ran up also, he was one of the three I am certain.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was given to me in Birchin-lane - I found nothing on him, Welsh was by, and said he was one of the men who ran away, he said nothing till after I took him away, he then said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Snow-hill, and turned down Birchin-lane, I heard the alarm, saw nothing, and went on, the prosecutor and woman turned the corner, and said "Stop that man, he is one of them", I said I knew nothing of it, he said he would hang me if it laid in his power.</p>

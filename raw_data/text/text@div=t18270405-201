I was standing still, and received a blow on my back, and before I could turn, another person rushed by me, and nearly pushed me down - I saw Moses running away; Jacobs seemed to be mixing with the people, and walking fast - the people gathered round and told me I was robbed - and I missed my purse; I have not found it.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure they are the same men? A. I am, for one of them struck me the first time in Whitechapel, and the other lifted up the lid of my basket. I did not see them the second time till I saw Moses running away - I suppose Moses is the one who took the purse. I have said I could not identify the man who robbed me, and I repeat it, for I did not see it done.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 10th of March I was with Hackwell in Whitechapel, and saw the prisoners together near Petticoat-lane. I kept them in sight for about twenty minutes, and saw the prosecutrix come out of a cheesemonger's-shop - we had followed the prisoners to that shop. Moses stood in front of the shop, and Jacobs up a little court - they joined, and followed her to the corner of a street - Moses let his apron down; Jacobs struck her on the back; Moses put his hand into the basket, took something out, and ran off. I pursued and took him, but found nothing on him - Hackwell took Jacobs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Moses run into the road? A. Between the curb and kennel; he might run about one hundred and fifty yards. I did not lose sight of him.</p>

            . I was with Keys, and saw Moses' hand in the basket; I saw him run away - Jacobs was close to the prosecutrix's back, but did not see the blow - she staggered, and Jacobs run among the crowd, but I took him. I had watched them for twenty minutes - I had not seen the prosecutrix before.</p>

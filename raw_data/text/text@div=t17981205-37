               <p>THOMAS BROWN sworn. - I am shopman to Messrs. Peacock and Davison: I was sent into the warehouse to see if there were any tumblers missing, the same that I had marked; I missed six, it might be then about a quarter past seven o'clock, I informed Mr. Peacock that there were six missing; I was in the street when the constables took him and brought him back, I was not a yard from them; I saw him searched, and I saw the tumblers taken from him.</p>

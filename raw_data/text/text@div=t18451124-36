               <p>in Great James-Street, Lisson-grove, about three in the morning—I had a charge of assault against two of them—I found them all three in company with five females—I called Mitchell out of the room, and said to him, How came you to knock that man about in Steven-street?"—He said "I have not been in Steven-street to night"—I said, "Oh yes you have; you must go with me to the station, both you and Burke"—he said, "Well, I will go with you; let me drink my coffee first"—I said, "Yes"—he took his coffee up in his left hand, and with his right he took out a handful of half pence from his pocket, and handed them over to Grogan—I saw them in his hand—I said, "What are you doing? I shall not allow you to pass any<lb></lb>thing in that way"—Mitchell said, "He (meaning Grogan) must pay for the coffee"—I did not see the coins sufficient to identify any of them—I took Mitchell, and another officer took Burke—I saw Grogan take eight penny pieces from the rest of the copper Mitchell had given him, and hand them to the coffee-shop keeper for the coffee—we took the prisoners to the station-house—I searched Mitchell, and found on him a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, two pence, eight half pence, and a farthing; some lucifer matches, two keys, a knife, tobacco box, and book—the prisoners were placed in the dock at the station-house—I left them there about a quarter of an hour—when I came back I found them in the same place—Mitchell's arm was leaning on the bar close to a cupboard—I heard of Mr. Clark's robbery next morning—I went there about half-past seven and found in the back parlour several things upset, and the window of the room open—there was a trace of footsteps over a wall on some leads to the back of No. 3, Salisbury-street, Devonshire-place, which is about eighty yards from Steven-street—Devonshire-place turns round on the right in Salisbury-street—between Nos. 2 and No. 3—it is like a paved court—I traced the footmarks over the wall—we could trace somebody having got out of Devonshire-place to the back of 3, Salisbury-street—Stafford-street it twenty or thirty yards further from Salisbury-street than Steven-street—I went to the coffee-house again, and saw the landlord, to whom I had seen the money paid—he gave me this coin—I went to Grogan's house, and apprehended him—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, and found on him sixteen halfpence, one penny piece, two far<lb></lb>things, and a French coin, and in his jacket pocket a small portion of cheese, which I produce, and some lucifer matches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Oliver Staples, and live in Godfrey's-gardens, Millbank-road, Westminster. On Saturday, the 12th of Oct., I went into the angel public-house, Broadway, with my brother and daughter, about nine or ten o'clock at night—I had a basket containing 50 brass chains, 100 pieces of leather, and some twine—my brother took it off my arm, and placed it on the tap, in the corner, while we drank a pot of half-and-half—I saw the prisoner there—we were there about a quarter of an hour</p>

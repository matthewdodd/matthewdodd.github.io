               <p>John Radbourn. About five weeks ago, as near as I can guess, the prisoner stole a vessel off the dray.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose dray was it ?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. It was Mr. Willoughby's dray.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. He lives upon Tower-Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the dray when the vessel was taken?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. It was in <placeName id="t17561208-35-crimeloc179">Watling-Street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17561208-35-crimeloc179" type="placeName" value="Watling-Street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Was the dray standing still or going on?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. It was standing still.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the dray was you when he took it?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. I believe I was about a hundred yards from it</p>
               <p>Q What time of the day was it ?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. As near as I can guess it was between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he carry it?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. He carried it about forty or fifty yards. I followed and collar'd him, and he seemed to make resistance against me, by shoving me two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for his so doing?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. He said he took the vessel from the dray to knock a nail down in the heel of his shoe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I took the vessel down as it was going along, with ent to set it down. There was a coach and car going by I set it down as soon as I did not carry it above four steps.</p>

When I came on shore on the 21st of June at Billingsgate; I came to the India house, to get my discharge filled up. After that, I went to a public-house, to inquire for the master at arms of the vessel in which I had come; the prisoner told me he knew him, and knew where he lived; and he lived at his house at Poplar. Then we went to the prisoner's house at Poplar, in a hackney coach; when we got there, I paid the coachman, and the coach was discharged. The prisoner then took my things up stairs, and he assigned the one pair of stairs room, as my lodging. He then ordered half a gallon of beer, and I went up stairs to lay down. I went up stairs to lay down, being extremely tired; I had the property in question on my person when I lay down. When I awakened, I missed the property, and called out; nobody answered, and I went down stairs. I saw the prisoner

The man prisoner said he would go and fetch the man that employed him to sell them; but I would not let him.

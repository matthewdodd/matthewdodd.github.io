               <p>Q. Did you lose any of your clothes. - A. Yes, I missed them on the 27th of October, about four in the afternoon; I had seen them on the same day at twelve at noon, they were safe in my father's house in the one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the door of the house generally left open. - A. It is always open, from morning to night. At four o'clock I was going up stairs, I saw the door on a jar,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280047"></xptr>in which room I had left the things, they were in a drawer all but two of the gowns; they were left hanging up in the next room. I turned the key when I came out, I cannot say whether it was locked, I did not try the door to see whether it was or not; on seeing the door of the room a-jar I went in, nobody was there: the drawers were open, and the things taken out; I missed four gowns out of the drawers, and these two gowns from the line.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the six gowns. - A. I cannot say, I think two pounds; the petticoats are worth four shillings, the shifts three shillings, a pair of stockings a shilling, the habit shirt and the half shawl are worth sixpence each; I saw two gowns and a bed gown the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find all your clothes at the pawnbrokers. A. No, I have not found them all yet.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know either of the two persons at the bar. A. I know the prisoners are the two persons that came to pawn the gown on the 27th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening; they both came and brought this gown; I lent them seven shillings on it, it was Riley that gave me the gown; I gave her the seven shillings; I perceived the gown was too wide for her, I asked her whose gown it was, she said it was her sister's, and she had sent her with it. The young woman came to enquire, and left a pattern; when I came home I found the gown. Going along Drury-lane I saw Townshend, I acquainted him with it; they were apprehended the next day, and I appeared against them at Bow-street. I produce the gown.</p>

On the 19th of December, about the middle of the day, the two prisoners came to make a purchase the person that served them, his name is Baxter, he suspected that they had robbed us,</p>
               <p>Q. He gave notice of his suspicion, did he. - A. Yes, and I shewed the prisoner some other articles that were laying near them, in order to ascertain whether they appeared guilty of having taken any thing before, they appeared very much confounded at my looking very hard at them, and the ticks that I had been shewing them they said they would not do, and requested me to reach one that was rather too high for me to get without getting upon something; I kept my eye upon them, and I saw the prisoner, Hannon, endeavouring to replace a piece of print that she had taken, I immediately returned to the counter, and observed the prisoner Ryan take from under her great loose coat, another piece of print; the other woman had a shawl on. I charged them with having committed the theft.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the subject of another charge. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Jeremy. On the 19th of December the prisoners came into the shop and desired to look at a gown, I shewed them a great variety; they wished to look at more. I went to get more, and when I returned, observed Ryan with her hands behind her, she appeared confused, she ordered a gown to be cut off, and wanted to leave the shop in a great hurry. What she bought came to twelve shillings and eight-pence, she gave me a two pound note to pay for it; I went into the adjoining parlour to Mrs. Jeremy, to get change for it. I told her I thought the prisoners had taken some print; she said I had better tell Mr. Smith, he was turning his back upon them. I returned from the parlour and gave them the change; I kept a pound back by way of detaining them. I then went into the parlour again, and as I was returning I observed the prisoner Ryan take a piece of twenty yards of print from under her coat, she was going to put it on the counter, Mr. Smith took it out of her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the piece of print here. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Ryans Defence. I met this woman, she said come along with me. We were going up Holborn, we looked at the cottons. Mrs. Hannon bought the cotton, and half a yard of linen; the master came in the shop; he said you took a piece of print from under your coat; I did not, it is as true as the Lord is in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Hannon's Defence. My husband gave me a two pound note, I went up Holborn, I met Mrs. Ryan, she went with me into this shop, I bought six yards of cotton, and two yards of linen. I gave him a two pound note, he brought me the wrong change; the master said that Mrs. Ryan took a piece of print from under her coat, he said he would transport us, as he had done a good many.</p>

             - my daughter Rosetta is six months old. I had her in my arms on the 13th of June - she had a coral necklace on her neck, and it was taken from her; I saw the prisoner's hand over the child's shoulder, and he snatched it away, but I did not see his face - the Policeman has the necklace; this is it - I know it by this piece of crape, which is to it.</p>

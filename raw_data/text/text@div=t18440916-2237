                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Peat, and live in Heddon-court, Regent-street—we let lodgings. On the 19th of Aug. the prisoner came and took a room for himself and another person, for a week, to sleep in, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he slept there on the 19th—we got up a little before seven o'clock next morning, and he was gone—I never saw him again till he was in cus<lb></lb>tody—he was alone that night—he said the other young person was to come the night following—I examined the room in the morning, and missed the property stated.</p>

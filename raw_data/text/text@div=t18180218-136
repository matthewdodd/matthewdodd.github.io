            , Esq. On the 15th of November, I left it safe, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and took the key with me; the coppers were fixed to the building, nobody sleeps there. I returned on the 17th of November, and missed them, at nine o'clock in the morning; I told Mr. Clark they were moved from the bricks and mortar. I saw them again in the possession of Furzeman, three days after.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a magistrate of Middlesex, and treasurer of the Irish free school-the premises are mine.</p>
               <p>JOHN FRENCH. I am a watchman of Crown-street, which is about a quarter of a mile from George-street. On the 17th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw a man come out of Lloyd's-court, into Crown-street, with something on his head, covered with matting, and corded. Kelly, who was with me, asked him what he had there? he said, they were coppers, and went on. I stopped him, and asked where he was going with them; he said, to Mr. Pontifex, in Shoe-lane, who was his master; he had one large, and one small copper. I told him that was not the way, and he must go to the watch-house; as we were taking him there, he threw them on me, in Bowlyard, knocked me down, and made his escape; I took him about ten days after; I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I will not swear to him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KELLY. I am a watchman. I was with French, the prisoner is the man; I knew him before; he said, he got them from Oxford-street - he threw the coppers at French, and ran off - I pursued, but lost him.</p>

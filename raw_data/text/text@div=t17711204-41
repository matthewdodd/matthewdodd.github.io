            . The prisoner lodged at my house with Walker; she passed for his wife; I lost while she was there three pair of sheets, two flat irons, and a tea-kettle. I do not know whether she took them, or him.</p>
               <p>(The sheets produced by Walter, a pawn-broker, who took them in of the prisoner, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I thought the goods were his own; he took me there, and when I was distressed, he bid me make money of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did they bring any goods with them?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, only the cloaths on their backs; she had the irons of me, and the sheets.</p>
               <p>(A pawn-broker produced the irons, which he took in of the prisoner, which were deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was very innocent of it; it is all spite; they would have made it up for eighteen shillings and six-pence. Walker used me very ill; the landlord and landlady know how I have cried out murder.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes, they have said that already, that he used to thresh you.</p>

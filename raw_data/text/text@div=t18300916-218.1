               <p>MATTHEW MURPHY. On the 29th of August this property was in my left-hand pocket; at two o'clock that morning I met two men in Rosemary-lane, who asked me if I knew where they could get something to drink - I said No; I then went on, and met Lyddiard, who was a <rs id="t18300916-218-deflabel1114" type="occupation">Policeman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How many public-house had you been into? A. I believe one or two before this - I swear I had not been to three; I cannot say what I had drank - I did not take account of it; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160099"></xptr>might be four or five pints of beer - I cannot say whether I had had any gin; I will swear I had not had six glasses of gin - I had not taken twelve glasses; I was not drunk - I was quite sensible; it was not because I was drunk that the landlord told the Policeman to take care of me, but there were some persons making a disturbance outside the door; to the best of my belief it was for that, and nothing else - I was sober enough to know what happened, or I should not have acted as I did; Lyddiard counted the money before the landlord, and I returned to the house - I had not been back two minutese before Lyddiard came back to the same house; I should think I left it a little after two o'clock - I had not begun drinking till about eight o'clock.</p>

            . I keep the public-house. My wife gave the prosecutor change for a sovereign - he had a crown and four half-crowns among his change; I had turned out two men who came in with the prosecutor, and when he was going I told Lyddiard to take care of him, as he had change for a sovereign - Lyddiard took out the money, counted it, put it into a purse, and took him out; I considered him not capable of taking care of himself - Lyddiard put the purse into his pocket, and said it would be as safe as if it were in the Bank of England: Barrett then knocked at the door, and Lyddiard said, "I have this man's property - see him out;" they then went out as it were, together - they had not been a great while gone before the prosecutor returned, and asked what the Policeman had received; he laid down his money, and I missed two half-crowns and one crown - by the time we had counted it, Lyddiard came back; the prosecutor said, "You have robbed me" - he denied it, and said, "Come along with me to the station-house;" they went away, and I saw no more of it - I said to Lyddiard, "There is a crown and two half-crowns missing;" he said, "It is all right enough - come along;" he gave me no explanation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you written down the account? A. No - I considered the prosecutor drunk; the persons he first came in with were at the door - I do not think they were sober; from what I have seen and heard here I think the prosecutor has said what was as near right as possible; but I did not think him capable of taking care of himself - Lyddiard returned to the same house, and when he was accused, he said, "Come along, it is all right;" I shut the door, and heard no more.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. What part of the counter did you see these goods on? - Almost at the further end of the warehouse, furthest from the street, under a press in a large hole, where there is nothing but lumber.</p>
               <p>Is that part of the warehouse a good deal frequented by the persons in your trade? - Yes; by our own people.</p>
               <p>Did not you recommend to Mr. Hotham or his partner to lay some plan, which I call some trap, and this particular plan to put this piece of goods under the counter? - No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Recollect? - I do not know whether Mr. Hotham bid me put it, or that I recommended it.</p>
               <p>Where were these goods taken from before they were put under the counter? - Out of a hole, a partition of about five or six yards from the place, and it was found by me under the press.</p>
               <p>At the time you found it there you suspected it to be put there for the purpose of being taken away by Jones? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it put there again for the purpose of being taken away by him? - It was put there to see what he would do with it; we expected it would be carried away by him; it was certainly put there to see whether he would carry it away.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with Mr. Hotham? - Five years.</p>
               <p>How long did Jones live there? - About four years.</p>
               <p>Upon what terms have you lived together? - We have always lived on very friendly terms, only sometimes we quarrelled.</p>
               <p>Have those quarrels ever proceeded to blows? - No; only once he told me he would tear my heart out; there was no grudge between us at the time because we were upon friendly terms, but I shall always do the best I can for my employers.</p>
               <p>How long is it ago since he gave you blows? - He never did give me blows.</p>

               <p>I was requested to keep a look out, and on Wednesday morning I was in Grace-church-street before Mr. Hotham's warehouse was open; I saw the porter open the warehouse; a little time afterwards, I saw a man come from the door with a parcel; there is a court very near the warehouse; the man turned up the court, and I followed him; in that court there are several turnings different ways, and he escaped me; from the description I gave of his person it was supposed to be Davis; I went with the officer and Mr. Robinson, as soon as I saw Davis, I said it was him.</p>
               <p>Was it him? - I never was nearer him than fifteen yards, he was in the same dress, to the best of my knowledge it was him; I was present when the goods were found; they were found in Davis's apartments in a box near the fire.</p>
               <p>Was the box locked or open? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How did you know the apartment you searched was Davis's? - I did not know they were his, the constable directed me to them; Davis was present in the apartment; he said he had bought the goods of some person, but I do not know who; he looked out a great many bills of parcels, but did not find the particular one that contained these goods; there were two pieces of goods found there.</p>
               <p>Did he say he bought those pieces of goods before or after they were found? - After they were found.</p>

               <p>You do not mean to be understood that he was the man that came out of the house? - I believe he is the man.</p>

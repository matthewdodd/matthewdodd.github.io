(The watch produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

            . I am a watchman; I stand at the corner of Silver-street; on the 9th of August, about two in the morning I heard watch called twice; on the second call I went, and about five doors down Wood-street, saw Hall and the prisoner both down together, by the side of the kennel; Hall said the prisoner had robbed him of his watch and handkerchief, and throwed it over on the pavement; when I came up they were struggling to get up; I found the watch about a foot from him on the pavement, and the handkerchief about half a yard from the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether the prosecutor was not asleep on a bench near his stand?</p>
               <p>Vernon. I had not seen him before; the watchman who was on the stand before me who went off at two o'clock told me there was a man asleep there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He swore before my Lord Mayor he was on the stand, and saw the man asleep on the bench.</p>
               <p>Vernon. I never said such a word.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Silver-street; I asked the last witness who was asleep on the bench; he said a post boy belonging to the Little Axe, in Wood-street, as the watchman told him that was gone off the stand, and bid me let him alone, that he would take no hurt; I saw him lying there with his left leg on the bench, and his right on the ground; I went up Silver-street to my box; I had not been there above a quarter of an hour before I heard the cry of watch, two or three different times, pretty loud; I looked down Silver street, and missing my partner's lanthorn I thought there was something amiss; I went down to Wood-street and saw the prisoner, prosecutor and watchman standing together; the prosecutor said he had been robbed of his watch and handkerchief; I advised taking the prisoner to the watch-house to be examined; when we came to the watch-house the prosecutor said he looked like a poor fellow, and if he would give the watchmen half a crown to drink and he had his goods, he would give himself no further trouble about it; I said it was a capital offence, and he should do no such thing.</p>

                  </hi> I am an attorney, and live at No. 14, Duke-street, Adelphi. I keep a banking account at the house of Brookes, Dixon, and co., Chancery-lane—the prisoner was in my service as clerk—he quitted me on Saturday, 5th Dec.—no part of this cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn on my bankers, and signed in my name, is my handwriting—I believe it to be the prisoner's writing—I never gave him any authority to draw on my bankers in my name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you pay the prisoner any salary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I know him to be of highly respectable connections, and the brother of a clergyman—I believe he was articled to an attorney in the country—after being articled he was in Mr. Lithgow's office—Mr. Lithgow took a partner, named Martin, with whom the prisoner subsequently became partner as solicitors—I also know that he became involved in Martin's liabilities to an enormous amount—Martin took the benefit of some Act—I afterwards took the prisoner into my employment—he had several business friends and connection who might be important to my business, and it was understood that as far as he could he should bring the connection of his partner to me—after a period, I proposed to allow him a participation in the profits of the business—it was understood he was to have a share in the busi<lb></lb>ness in the interval, between the period when he came to me and that period—he conducted himself in a manner that me with my entire approval up to very recently before this transaction—in consequence of his connection with some woman I remonstrated with him, and the result of that remon<lb></lb>strance was, that he immediately married her—he appeared very eccentric and irritable at my remonstrance—what he was entitled to, depended on what he had expended—he had kept my cash, and I should have had to go through that to ascertain—I am afraid he would not have been entitled to anything, but I am not able to speak with certainty—if he had wanted 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should have let him have it—after I remonstrated with him I handed him a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for business purposes, and in consequence of the exceeding eccentricity of his manner I took it away from him—he occasionally had possession of my cheque-book—I drawn cheques on plain pieces of</p>

I am one of the cashiers at the house of Dixon and Co., in Chancery-lane—there are three partners, William Dixon, Francis Henry Brooks, and John Shot Dixon. On Saturday, the 5th Dec., at about four o' clock, this cheque was presented to me at the banking-house—I do not know by whom—it was the busiest day of the week, and the busiest hour of the day—I paid it in the three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—one of the notes was No. 26577, which note I have now in my hand—the writing and signature of the cheque has a resemblance to that of Mr. Shearman, but in the hurry of busi<lb></lb>ness I did not notice it as I should have done—the prisoner never had any account at Dixons' to my knowledge—I have been in the house twenty-three years.</p>

               <p>Sibilla Hetherington. On Sunday night, while I was at church, I was robbed of four thirty six shilling pieces, and some guineas and half guineas, there was upwards of forty pound in all. I had a ready furnished lodging, and the Prisoner used to come to that house as working for the shop, and she came to do something in my room, and stole this money; it was in a trunk in my room, the nails were drawn out of the trunk: She was represented to me as a very honest person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a lodger in the house?</p>
               <p>Hetherington. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took it?</p>
               <p>Hetherington. Because she went away from us upon that account; and she said before Justice De Veil, that she took it: There is thirty pound of the money in his hand, which he said I should have. The Constable took it from the Prisoner [ the money was produced in court, and shown to the Prosecutrix, viz. four thirty six shilling pieces, and a parcel of guines.]</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what pieces are yours?</p>
               <p>Hetherington. These four thirty six shillings pieces are mine, I can swear to them, one is a crooked piece, as to the guineas I cannot swear to them, they may be alike. <rs id="t17440223-22-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

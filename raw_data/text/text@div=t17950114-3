            's, these were purchased in the piece, and cut out from the piece, and made up into the articles they are now.</p>
               <p>Q. What effects of Mr. Barlow's was it you first saw when the prisoner was taken? What is Mr. Barlow? - He is a <rs id="t17950114-3-viclabel15" type="occupation">silk mercer</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you know of his losing any thing on the 8th of December last? - The property was taken before we knew of the loss, we lost three womens duffield<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140009"></xptr>cloaks, and four childrens striped great coats.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he lost them? - I know they were lost, because they were missing from the place where they were usually put up.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last, before you missed them? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Not even to a day or two? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them a week before that? - We are very frequently selling these articles, and daily making application to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they usually lay in the shop? - They lay on the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Having missed them on the 8th of December, where did you see them again? - I see them on the 8th of December, in the evening, in the passage of Mr. Barlow's house, a little way from the door, the outside of the door about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition were they? - Loose laying on the ground, I took them up, brought them into the shop, and the man was brought in after them, the prisoner at the bar, from thence he was taken to the magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took him to the magistrate's? - The watchman and another or two took him to the magistrate's, I did not go with him, I followed him, and from thence he was committed. I was examined before the magistrate, and swore to the property being Mr. Barlow's, and after that Mr. Barlow was bound over to prosecute, and I to appear to swear to the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any thing of the prisoner before the goods were missing? - I had not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At the time you received this alarm, I believe neither you, your master, or any body was attending in the shop, you had left it to take care of itself? - Not in that shop, a glass partition was between the two shops.</p>
               <p>Q. I see they are the ordinary sort of goods? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you charge the selling price on them, you have put them at three pounds in the indictment, but, perhaps, you would not put them at above thirty-nine shillings, where a man's life is at stake? - They would fell for a deal more.</p>
               <p>Q. But it is very hard to pay your profit with our lives.</p>

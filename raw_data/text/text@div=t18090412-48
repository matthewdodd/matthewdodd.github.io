                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120037"></xptr>Q. Who lodged in the room with you - A. Nobody but me and my wife; the prisoner's room adjoined mine; the rooms were separated by a partition and a door which was nailed up; the nails were of the prisoner's side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in possession of this room - A. Four days. On Wednesday the 1st of March I went out about half after two o'clock, my wife was out, I locked the door and took the key with me; I came home alone, about half past four; I found my room door locked; I unlocked it; on my going into the room I found my wife's box on the bed, I left it by the side of the door under another box, it had been wrenched open; it was left locked; there were two pictures, a child's cap, and a shirt left in it; I found a bonnet and a red gown gone from the great box, that box was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you examined the box what observations did you make about the room - A. When I entered the room I found the box on the bed; I examined the other box, and then I turned round and found the door between her room and mine open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lock upon that door - A. It was only nailed up with six or seven nails; the nails had been wrenched, and a bit of the wood cut off; I went through the door into the prisoner's room, she was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner afterwards - A. In about ten days after I met her in Beech-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been acquainted with her at all - A. I had been laid up with the rheumatism seventeen months - one night I laid myself down on the chair by the wainscot; I heard a moan, I said to my wife who is that, she said the young woman in the next room; I said go and see what is the matter with her; she went, she was laying on the boards without any thing over her; she brought her in; I gave her victuals, and kept her till eleven o'clock at night, thinking she was in distress. I met the prisoner in Beech-street, I said are not you a pretty creature; she said she would not run away. I brought her home to my wife, my wife asked her if she could tell her any thing about the things, she said she knew nothing at all about them; after keeping her from six o'clock to eleven, I went to Mr. Stanton the officer, he searched her, I saw two caps found upon her, a caddie spoon, two housewives, and one piece of gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of the other things - A. No.</p>

After my husband was gone for the officer, I asked her what she had done with the things; she said after she got out in the street she did not know what she had done with them.</p>

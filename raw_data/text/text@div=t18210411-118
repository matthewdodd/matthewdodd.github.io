On the 3d of February, a man named Jones, (who was convicted last Session) came and asked the price of a table; in about half an hour he came along Long-alley, with the prisoner, who came and asked for a halfpenny worth of bread - they were both together then, and while I was serving the prisoner with the bread, Jones took the table and put it on his head, it was fastened inside with a cord, I ran after him and the prisoner ran after me, and said</p>
               <p>"Drop it Jones, drop it Jones;" he dropped it directly and was taken, the prisoner escaped, but came again afterwards. I was afraid to touch him, because he caught hold of my shoulders and pinched me, to prevent my running after Jones - he told me to take him if he was guilty, the officer was out and I could not take him. When he heard I had a warrant out against him, he came by about a month after, and said,</p>
               <p>"What you have transported one, and when you catch me you may transport me; and if I see you out of doors, I will see you do not go home alive again." His sister lived servant with me once, but I did not know where he lived, and I did not then know he was her brother. I had seen him in the shop many times, but did not know who he was.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took Jones, and on the Monday following I went after the prisoner. I had seen him that night, but did not know he was concerned, he was in the alley standing by, I only came up after Jones was taken by the watchman. I took him on the 27th of March. I had been looking for him several times, and once saw him, but he jumped out of the window in his shirt at one o'clock in the morning and escaped.</p>

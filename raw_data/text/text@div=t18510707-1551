                  </hi>. On 24th June, I saw a crowd at the corner of Gibson-street, Lambeth, about a quarter-past 11 o'clock at night—I went to see what it was—it was a man in a fit—I had not been standing there more than two or three minutes when I felt a twitch at my left-hand waistcoat pocket, in which I had a silver watch—I looked down and saw the prisoner's hand coming away from my waistcoat pocket, and my guard hanging down my person—the guard had been round my neck, and in my pocket—it was still round my neck, but not in my pocket—I caught hold of the prisoner's hand, and told him he had stolen my watch—he said I must be a very wicked man for saying so—I saw him put one of his hands at the back of him, and one hand up to his shoulder, and I saw a boy run from behind him—there was a policeman minding the man in the fit, and I gave him the prisoner in charge—I have, not seen my watch since—I went after the boy, but there were so many companions round him that I could not get him.</p>

               <p>Henry Norris. On the 12th of July I was going up Queen-street and turning into <placeName id="t17530718-21-crimeloc103">Bow church-yard</placeName>

I immediately follow'd him up Queen-street pretty briskly, and over-took him just by the late Mr. Stiles's shop the hosier, near the corner; I took him into the shop and told him he had stole my handkerchief, he said he had not, I search'd him, and he had it in his hand behind him under the lapets of his waistcoat, he then said he did not take it, but that another lad that was in company with him had given it to him. I cannot say that he took it out of my pocket.</p>

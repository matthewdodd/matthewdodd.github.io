                  </hi>. I am bar-man to the prosecutor. I was in the bar on the 4th of June, and saw sixteen papers of halfpence on the shelf under the bar—they were opposite a stove which the prisoner was clean<lb></lb>ing, and within his reach—while I was engaged I had him under my observation, and I saw him extend his arm in the direction of the half-pence—I afterwards missed two papers from them and told my master—the prisoner had a pail with him—he set it down by the tap-room door—he went into the tap-room—then came out and went down stairs with the pail—he would pass the place where the halfpence were said to be found.</p>

I was called by Mr. Beasley on the 4th of June—I went down to the kitchen and saw the prisoner—I said I must take him for robbing his master of two papers of halfpence—I went and found the money under the stairs on a shelf—there was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a paper and 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by the side of it—the other parcel was gone—I went into the kitchen again and searched the prisoner—I found 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him in halfpence, which were quite wet—I put them into my pocket—he went to the water-closet, and I waited till he came out—I took him to the station-house, and he was remanded—I went back and found 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence on the soil in the water-closet—one of the halfpence was marked F—the prosecutor stated that there had been two 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers of half-pence on the stairs, but one was gone—I kept the money in separate papers—this is the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

I am a tailor, and live in the Commercial-road—Henry Jolly was in my employ for several months, and I discharged him—I got an officer, and went to William Jolly's house, where all the prisoners live—I saw Phebe who is Henry's mother, and Mary Ann Jolly, who is his sister—I asked if Henry was at home? his mother said he was not—I asked if I could see his new great coat which he had, and which was made out of two yards of cloth—his mother said it was in his own box, which was locked—his sister went up stairs—I saw her break open his box, and there we found the great coat, which was made of the two yards of cloth which he stole from me—in his box we found, belonging to me, three</p>

               <p>short lengths of black silk velvet—we then examined a box, which the mother said was the box of Mary Ann Jolly, who was I believe gone at that time to fetch her father, William Jolly—in that box, which I think was not locked, we found a laventine scarf, two duplicates, and some few buttons—while the daughter was gone to fetch the father, we opened a small box, in which the father kept his private papers—(he stated that it was his)—and in that we found two dozen of my bill-heads—a chest was then opened, which contained the father's and mother's clothes, and in it we found a dress made of Alpaca cloth, which I had lost a considerable deal more than ten yards of, and also a pair of trowsers, made of stuff which I have a piece of here—while we were thus looking, William Jolly, the father, came in, and he solemnly declared that no person was allowed to touch his box in which the bill-heads had been found—that box was not locked—we found a small handsaw of mine under the stairs below, and a small telescope, which was in the looking-glass drawer, in the lower room—I do not know who slept in that room—we found a number of small things belonging to me in various parts of the house—I found my property in almost every cupboard and drawer and box that we opened—I think the whole amount of my loss is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think William Jolly is a flax-dresser—Mary Ann Jolly, I believe, makes slop waistcoats, or is a dressmaker—she said her brother had made her a present of this laventine dress—this is the dress—there is about four yards of what we call laventine silk in it—I believe she has only worn it about one sabbath—I have examined this, and the whole of the things—I believe they are all mine.</p>

               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Laycock. This petticoat I swear to by a darn, and this apron I stained with some rabbit's blood, and my child's stay has three streaks of ink, and I believe all the rest of the things to be mine, by their general wear, and I had such things in my drawers.</p>
               <p>Have you recovered all your things? - No; these are all I have seen since, here is a cotton petticoat, a cloth apron, a child's frock, seven clouts, and a number of little articles, and a quantity of new cloth, which I can swear to; they are all worth two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Bamford. Do you know this Pickering? - Yes, I have seen him, I was present in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I believe the account this boy gave, was, that Pickering told him he was acquainted with Mrs. Laycock, and that he asked him to carry some things.</p>
               <p>What is become of Pickering? - I do not know, I could not find him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going to the Black Dog to have a pint of beer yesterday was a month, and one Pickering came in to ask for a porter; I asked him what for? he said to carry a bundle into Crispin-street, No. 13, up two pair of stairs: I said, can I do? he said, if you will go with me, you may do as well as another; I went with him to Blossom-street, and he bid me to go on till the man took me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

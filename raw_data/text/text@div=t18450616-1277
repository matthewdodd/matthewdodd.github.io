                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner five or six years—about last Christmas I was taking a drunken man home—I saw the prisoner take the man's purse out of his pocket, and go away with it, and I gare information of it to the policeman—one Monday, last May, I went to tie Red Lion public-house in Holborn, and saw the prisoner there, about a yard from the doorway—directly I entered the house, he said, "You b—old rogue, I will do for you"—he caught hold of my neckcloth, and three me right down on my back on the floor—he kept hold of my neckcloth, and held it for five minutes, until I was nearly strangled—I could not get up—he was standing straight across me, leaning down towards me—a female in his company interfered, and said, "Let him get up," or he would have strangled me—she did not pull him off—she persuaded him to let me go—he let me get up, and then gave me a very violent blow in the breast, as I thought, with his fist—I did nothing to him—I found it a very curious feel, and as he pulled his hand away he cut the top of my thumb, and I saw the blade of a knife in his hand—he walked out directly—I am down on the bench, and had a pint of beer—my breast felt very painful—when I had had my beer I went home—I did not undress, it was so painful, I laid down with my clothes on—in the morning I found I wat covered with blood all over—I found it so about two hours after I got home—I complained to my brother about it—this is the coat and waistead I wore—the wound was right in the centre of the breast—here is a mark of bloood inside the waistcoat all round—it is a double-breasted waistcost—it is not cut, as it was not buttoned up to the top.</p>

               <p>morning, the 19th of May, the prisoner came in with a female—he was talking to her about the watchman accusing him of taking a purse out of the pocket of a pawnbroker—he swore against the prosecutor's life—he said the moment the watchman stopped his bread, he would stop the watchman's wind—he swore what he would do with him if he got hold of him—the moment Dowling came in, the prisoner caught hold of him and said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, you are a b----y old rogue"—he caught hold of him by the neckerchief, and held him down on the ground, strangling him, hold<lb></lb>ing him by the neckerchief, and pulling the upper part of it—he held him to until he was black in the face—I called out to him, but he did not loosen him—I called to him again, and then went to run round the bar, and he allowed him to get up—after that there was a deal of swearing, the prisoner swore two or three times over, and said several times that the moment he stopped his bread, he would stop his wind—after that Dowling moved towards a desk at the end of the bar, from the prisoner—there was a deal of talking between them about this robbing the pawnbroker, and the prisoner laid hold of <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> laid hold of his nose—I was busy at work, and was not aware after seeing him get off the floor, that any<lb></lb>thing but angry words was going on, and did not pay attention to it—the prisoner aecused <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> of having sent him to Bow-street for taking the pawnbroker's purse—<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> said, "It served you right," and he wrung him by the nose, and at that time I certainly saw a great deal of <hi rend="italic">fumbling</hi> about the chest—the prisoner struck Joe on the breast, I mean, and the moment he finished that, he ran out, leaving the woman behind—it was not a gentle blow—it was a sort of <hi rend="italic">thumping</hi> with both hands, while <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> had hold of his nose—I did not perceive that the prisoner was drunk in the least—I had never seen him before.</p>

               <p>Lion-street—we went into the public-house together—he was telling me he was much hurt in consequence of a watchman's accusing him of a robbery on Mr. Crocket, the pawnbroker, at the corner of Dean-street, and it was old <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, the watchman, who caused him to be brought into the station house, and given in charge of a policeman—he said that he did not appear against him, he was too late—I do not think it was named when—we were not taking any refreshment, we had not time, for at that instant the watchman came in, and the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, you are a d—d old rogue; if you stop my bread, I will stop your wind," or something to that effect—a scuffle ensued between them, and the watchman was knocked down on his back by the prisoner—I cannot tell how, it was done in an instant—my back was towards them—when he was down the pri<lb></lb>soner caught him by the neck handkerchief—I was not close enough to see whether he held it loosely or tight, but I insisted on his letting him get up, which he did, and the watchman stood with his back to the door—I looked at his face, and it began to look a little black—I told him so, and he let him get up by my persuasion—another scuffle ensued, and the watchman was down again, but I did not see that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not interfere to prevent this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did interfere, because his face looked black—I persuaded the prisoner to let him get up, and he did so instantly—he let go, and let him get up—as soon as he got up he pot his back by a little desk by the door, and another scuffle ensued, but I was at a little distance, and what followed I did not see, for I was very much confused to see it—the prisoner went out directly—I went out afterwards—I was present the whole time—I cannot tell what happened at the second scuffle—I saw nothing more than a scuffle between them—the watchman got hold of the prisoner's nose—I could not see whether the prisoner put his hand on him after he got to the desk—my back was to<lb></lb>wards them—the prisoner's back was to me, and the prosecutor's face towards me—they seemed quiet then—I did not notice whether both the prisoners hands were down—I saw no more than the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner's nose—the prisoner's back was to me—I was going out at that instant, and the prisoner went out at the other door—I did not see more than I have named—the watchman came across, and the pri<lb></lb>soner went instantly out of the house—the watchman sat down and seemed much confused and pale—he called for a pint of porter and asked me to drink, I put my lips to it, and wished him good morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and lodge in the kitchen of Mr. Olive's house, No. 40, Pulteney-street. On Tuesday evening, the 18th of Nov., after five o'clock, I went out of the kitchen, out at the back door into the water-closet, which is in the back yard—while I was there somebody pulled at the door—there was a light in the back room, it was past day-light—when I came out of the privy I saw the prisoner Lloyd in the back yard, standing, looking up at the windows—I afterwards went into the kitchen from which I could see over the way, across the road, and saw two men stand<lb></lb>ing on the other side of the street—Radbone was one of them—I saw a girl, named Healey, who lodges in the house—after I had been up stairs a second time, I spoke to her—after speaking to her, I was standing at the street-door, and saw Lloyd come along the passage of the house—he had a large blue bag and a bundle—the bag was full of something—he went out at the door—I made room for him to go out, and he turned to the right—I did not look after him—I saw the prisoners in custody on the next Monday morning—I knew them again—they are the same men.</p>

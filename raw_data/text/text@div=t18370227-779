                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Coram-street, in the parish of St. James's, Westminster. The prisoner was my errand boy for about ten weeks—on Monday morning I missed ten sovereigns from a drawer in my desk, in my surgery—it was locked—I had seen them on the Saturday—I found the drawer still locked, but the money was gone—I charged the prisoner with taking it, and he denied it—I had no reason to sus<lb></lb>pect him particularly till last Monday, when, in consequence of information, I watched him—he went to a coffee-shop in Windmill-street—I then sent for an officer, and had him apprehended, and on his person was found 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some few halfpence—he said he had found the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Satur<lb></lb>day last, near the Pantheon—I went to the prison to him, and told him it was impossible he could have found the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as I had heard of his changing two half-sovereigns—he then told me the other sovereigns were in Duck-lane—I went to where he named, and found six sovereigns.</p>

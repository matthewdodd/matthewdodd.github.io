            . I am a wharfinger at Custom-house quay. On the 17th of September, in the morning, about eight o'clock, the master of a vessel laying next to the brig Samuel; the brig Samuel was then laying at the Custom-house quay; the master of the vessel produced to me this pocket-book, observing that there were ship papers in it; no doubt it belonged to the master of a ship. I examined the book in his presence, and found the papers of the Samuel. On shewing them to the captain and mate of the Samuel, the captain stated these papers were in his book previous to his losing it. This book was found on the deck of the vessel, as if dropped by accident. On examining the letters in the book in a foreign language, which are Portuguese, they got an officer; they went in search of the thief; in so doing, the Samuel went away from the Quay. On the 14th of October following, a Yarmouth vessel was laying at our Quay; her name, the Hannah, Captain Miller On the night, or early the next morning, the prisoner was detected in the state-room in the act of taking his watch, previous to which he had pulled off his shoes and gone into the forecastle and took the boy's jacket; he afterwards went into the captain's cabin, where the captain seized him; he was taken to the Compter. The captain of the Hannah was going away the following day, and Captain

We went into Denmark-street where he stated he had got some linen, which he should be glad to have. This direction was to a female in Denmark-street, who took the officer over to the other side of the way to where the bundle of linen was; the officer and the female brought the bundle of linen to me, and in that bundle the first thing we found was Captain

            . I sell things in the street. On the Tuesday before the officer came to my house, the prisoner came to my house; he came in with a handkerchief in my hand; he had a pennyworth of spice-cakes, which he paid for; he had a pipe in his hand; he lighted it, and went to the street door. I was going out to get some cakes. I said to him, do not leave your handkerchief there, perhaps my child may play tricks with it. He left the handkerchief, and went to where he resorted. It is the same handkerchief the officer found.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in it - A. I don't know; it was in the same state that he left it. On the Friday afterwards I asked my child if the man had been for the handkerchief; she said, no.

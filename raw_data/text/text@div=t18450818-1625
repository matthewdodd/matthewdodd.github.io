                  </hi>. I am steward to the United Brothers' Provident So<lb></lb>ciety, held at the City of London public-house, Sidney-street, City-road—in the beginning of 1844 the prisoner was secretary to the society, and bad been so, I think, about five years—it was the duty of the steward to keep the books of the society—I was steward at the time—it was the prisoner's duty to make the entries in the books—there was a minute—book kept and a depositor's book—this is the minute-book—the depositor's book we have been unable to find—there is a resolution entered in the minute—book, on the ht of Jan. 1844, in the prisoner's handwriting, that the senior steward, in conjunction with the secretary, should add the interest to the principal in the savings bank—I went on the 2nd of Jan. with the prisoner to the savings bank for that purpose, and made the necessary arrangements—I think the principal and interest, when added up, was 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I saw the prisoner produce the depositor's book at the bank—I believe it was the duty of the steward to take care of that book, but the prisoner had always been in the habit of having it—it was returned into his hand at the bank, with the minute-book, and I have never seen it since—I never asked the prisoner for it—here is an entry in the minute-book, of the 5th of Feb. 1844* in the prisoner's handwriting, "J. Randall deposited the bank book in the <hi rend="italic">book</hi>"—there was a conversation with the prisoner afterwards about that entry, and he said he must have made a mistake, he must have meant <hi rend="italic">box</hi>—I never did deposit the bank book in the box—I first found it was not in</p>

Randall, Sept. 29th 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., ditto 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," &amp;c.—that is, money I was receiving when 1 was sick—those entries are not made under the direction of the steward—the se<lb></lb>cretary makes them of his own option—he knows what to put down—the stewards draw the money from the landlord, and pay it to the sick members—the secretary gets the account from the landlord's book, which we sign for his security—I have seen this book before, but never examined it par-ticularly—the other stewards had also an opportunity of seeing it—I believe the minute-book was generally on the table every night of meeting—the books were kept in the box, but this book the prisoner had in his pos-session—it has never been kept in the box since 1 have been there—there were three keys belonging to the box in which the bank-book was kept—the prisoner had neither of those keys—the two stewards had each one, and the landlord one, each for a different lock, so that all three keys must be there to open the box—James Andrews was my fellow-steaard, and Hume Graddon, but he was not a free steward—we always kept the bank-book in the box till it was taken to the bank—our accounts were generally made up and balanced in Dec.—this book does not contain the receipts and expenditure, it is called, "Receipts and Expenditure-book"—here is an entry, "Balance to treasurer"—we were never aware that this book contained any entry of the sort—it was a larger book in which that was entered—this is the book—this other was expressly for a minute-book—I never examined to see whether it was marked with receipts and expendi-ture—nothing but minutes of meetings had any business in it—I have belonged to the society rather better than five years—here is a minute in the book, authorizing me to proceed to the bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often were you in the habit of going to the bank to have the interest added up, in order that it might become principal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It used to be done once in six months, but lately once in twelve—I am not aware when it was done before Feb. 5th, 1844—it was not my duty, after April,</p>

Randall deposited the bank-book in the box?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It could not have been so—the handwriting is all one, and the ink may have been all one, for what I know—I do not think any of us ever looked at the minute-book—we trusted too much to the prisoner—we had a steward's book, in which we kept an account against him of what members paid, and what they did not pay—the name of Wil<lb></lb>liam Jones is not in the notice, only in the receipt—I believe it to be the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing—the W. and J. are like his—he sometimes signed his own name William, and sometimes W. only—my attention was called to this receipt some time in June last.</p>

                  </hi>. In Jan. and Feb., 1844, I was a manager of the Fins<lb></lb>bury Savings-bank—the Birmingham United Brothers' Society banked with us—before they took out their money, it would be necessary that a notice should be sent—I find such a notice in our "Notice and Repay-ment book," on the 14th of Feb., 1844—we have certain numbers in our book, and also in the depositor's book, held by the customer—the number referred to tells me whether or not it is a right account—I attended on the 21st of Feb.—I find on that date this receipt, "Finsbury-bank for savings: We the undersigned do hereby acknowledge the receipt of the sums annexed to our respective names, this 21st of Feb., 1844;" and, under the No. "9," are the names "William Nash, Thomas Bond, and William or Willan Jones"—three persons must have been present to have signed that, or I should not have given the check—we require the pre<lb></lb>sence of all the three parties signing, as they do at the Bank for a transfer of stock; and upon their signing, I give a check, which is paid by another person—the depositor's book is essential to be produced—it gives me the clue where to look, and also where I am to refer for the amount I have to pay—I then take their names and I have their minute-book before me at the same time, to see that the signatures are the same as I have taken—we do not require the same signatures to the notice that we do to the re-ceipt—I do not know the persons signing the receipt, only from the minute-book, and the Secretary comes—I find their handwriting in the minute-book—with</p>

               <p>reference to this particular transaction, I do not remember the production of the minute-book at all—it would certainly not have been paid unless the minute-book had been shown—there is only the name of Thomas Bond in the notice—I paid a check of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the per<lb></lb>sons signing the receipt—here are my initials, both in the book and on the check—I should not have given the check until I had seen the depositor's book—I personally do every act myself before I part with the check.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have no recollection of this particular traos-action, except by referring to this book, and judging of your usual regu-larity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—we require the depositor's book both when notice is given, and also when the money is paid—as far as I recollect, it is invariably present when the money is paid—I cannot say that in no one instance has money been paid without it, because I do not pay all the money—I firmly believe I never gave a check without the minute-book being produced—I do not think it is at all possible I should give a check without the minute-book being before me—I did not receive the notice—I do not know whether the depositor's book and minute-book were produced then—I do not recollect any transaction with this Society before—I could not swear that I compared the signatures in this book with those in the minute-book on this occasion—most likely I did—I cannot recollect parti-cularly as to this single transaction, but it is the usual practice to do so; and I should expect I did so then—I gave the check to one of the three persons who signed—the secretary most likely—he is generally the party who takes it—there is no "secretary" marked here, but I should give it to the one who would call himself secretary, although he has not signed u such—there is nothing in this entry to show me to which of the three the check was handed—the depositor's book, after passing through the ledger, comes to me as having to give the check.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the United Brothers' Society. In Jan. 1844, I was steward to the society—I held a key of the chest—I saw the bank, or depositor's book on the club evening, Jan. 1,1844—I have never seen it since—it used to be kept in the box before that time—I saw it that evening, and examined it—it was out on the table—it wai not replaced in the box that evenig—it was left out to go to the bank next day—it was neglected or forgotten afterwards—it is only required once a year—the prisoner was our secretary—I know his handwriting—I believe the name of Willan Jones to this receipt to be the prisoner's handwriting—I have been in the habit of seeing him write very frequently for nearly six years.</p>

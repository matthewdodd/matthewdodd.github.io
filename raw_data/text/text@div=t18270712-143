            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor and witness were both drunk on this night, but not insensible; he distinctly stated to me, that three men met him, that a tall one took his watch and gave it to the prisoner, whom he seized, and he gave it to the other, who got away; he stated this distinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying he was drunk? A. He staggered - they both knew what they were about; the woman gave the same account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He said he picked this woman up, and she robbed him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MAHER. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not taking up for passing bad money once? A. I once took a half-crown in change, and was in the watch-house ten minutes for passing it. I had four pints of beer between me and the woman.</p>

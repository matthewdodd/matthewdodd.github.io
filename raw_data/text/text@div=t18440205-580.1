On Sunday, the 24th of Dec., he came to my lodgings between five and six o'clock in the morning, but I did not see him—I went in the middle of the day to Mr. Mil<lb></lb>ler's, No. 18, King-street—Mrs. Miller had sent for me—when I got there he was in the house, but I did not see him then—he afterwards came into the room, and asked me how I did—I said I was pretty well—he asked how the</p>

               <p>and at the third blow I became insensible—he had struck me on the temple—I felt the blood spring from my head through my right ear—when I recovered he had got me on the other side of the room—he had dragged me from one side to the other, and was jumping on my breast with his feet, and beating me on the head occasionally—he said he had come to do for me—he gave no reason for this, except saying Miller was my <hi rend="italic">fancy man</hi>—I was too much beaten to recollect what he might say, but I recollect his coming forward with a pair of scissors—I put up my hand, and the scissors cut my finger, and went through my lip—I became insensible; and when I came to myself, the floor was covered with blood—my head smarted very much; I felt it bleeding very much, and became quite blind—he shook me, and told me to look up—he said, You are not dead yet"—some time afterwards he called me an ugly name, and said, "Look up, here is your child"—I said, I could not see my child—he said, "You shall never see it more till you are in hell; I could finish you with one stroke, but it would be too much mercy for you"—he said, "I have a deadlier stroke for your heart yet; if your much beloved son was here, you should hear his cries while I thrust his heart, and you could not help him"—he went and opened the door, and listened, and seemed to stand in an attitude—I could not see him, but heard him unlock the door, and he seemed as if listening—some period afterwards I heard voices coming up stairs—the officers then came—I went to the hospital, and was there twelve days or a fortnight—my head is still in a great deal of pain.</p>

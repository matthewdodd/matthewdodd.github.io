                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in St. Paul's churchyard. On the 14th of March I fell in with the prisoner near to Convent-garden, between two and three o'clock in the morning—she was a stranger—I had been making merry with some friends, and was rather <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—we walked together as far as Bedford-hotel, Bedford-bury—we went to bed directly—I awoke at seven o'clock in the morning—the prisoner rose at that time and dressed—I looked at my watch, it was then seven o'clock, and I laid down again—the prisoner went out, and I missed the witch and guard in about twenty minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller. The prisoner came to my shop on Saturday, the 1st of April, between one and two o'clock in the day—she put a gold watch into my hand, and asked what I thought it was worth—I hesitated about giving her an answer—she said "Is it worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said I don't know—she said "Yes; I know it is; for it has been pawned for that, and I am the woman that has pawned it"—I then went away, and left her; she came again, and my wife asked me to take it to pawn for her—I said I would not have any thing to do with it, she had better take it to where she was known—she said she had taken it to one or two, and they had not so much to lend—I said, perhaps they thought it was not her own—she said, "It is; I met Mr. Johnson, and told him I must have some money, and he took the watch from his guard, and told me to pawn it for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and send him the duplicate in a letter."</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise on condition he'd tell you?</p>
               <p>Ribott. I promised to be as favourable as I could, and upon that account I have only laid the indictment for some things of a trifling value to what I lost. I have not laid it capital, but without his confession I could not have come to the knowledge of them, for out of many goods it is almost impossible to miss a few pieces when taken away.</p>

            . The prosecutor imagining he might have lost more goods, he desired me to go to Clerkenwell-bridewell, and there to get what I could not of the prisoner. I went and told him, as he had robb'd his master of a great many goods, his only way to make his master as favourable as possible, was to let him know of them that he might get them again, and said, I'd call again the next day, that he might have time to recollect. I called accordingly, and he said he had recollected, and gave me a list of things he had taken away; part of which are in the indictment.</p>

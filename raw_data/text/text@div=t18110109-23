            . I was in company with Leadbetter. On searching him I found this purse with a shilling in it, and an Irish one pound bank note. It has the same direction as the other; it is endorsed A. Storey, the same as the other.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been along with this master a year and a half; he lost some money last Christmas. My master saw this watch; he asked me where I got that watch. I got money before I came to London. I brought this money from Ireland. It is my money. When my master saw the watch, he said, this is the way my money goes. I slept in the accompting-house. I never saw the money at all. This watch cost me four pound ten shillings. I bought the watch at Wapping. My master said, he had lost the money, and I had bought the watch with it. I said, No, I got money before I came to London. This master gave me victuals and drink, and clothes; he gave me no money.</p>
               <p>JURY. The notes are dated 4th of June, 1810. The prisoner said, he brought them to London he could not have done that.</p>

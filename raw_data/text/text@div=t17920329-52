               <p>My business lies so open to my servants that I cannot miss a small quantity of goods; I went up stairs with the prisoner, and he opened two boxes; there was a third, which he said belonged to another person; I sent for him, and when he came he said the box did not belong to him; I then told the prisoner I would not be trifled with, and I sent for a constable; then he pulled out the key; the box was opened, and I found the six bags; I gave charge of him; he begged for mercy; I desired the constable to search him; he found forty-seven guineas and a half on him.</p>

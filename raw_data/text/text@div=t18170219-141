            . I am a carpenter. I was walking in Whitechapel with Simmons. Three men met us-the prisoner is one of them. They would not let us pass, neither on one side or the other. As soon as we passed, Simmons missed his watch. We pursued the prisoner - I never lost sight of him till he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He ran away - We were quite sober.</p>

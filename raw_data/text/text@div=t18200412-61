On the 11th of March, at night, I went to a surgeon's in Seven Dials; I was returning between eleven and twelve o'clock at night with Hudson.

I told the watchman, and ran into the market, but could not find him; we then went to the theatre door and saw him. He ran away, I pursued, and the watchman stopped him. I charged him with stealing my watch, he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say that I have it?" A number of persons assembled, I was pushed into the court, and he was taken to the watch-house. On the way to the watch-house I was suddenly seized by the mob, very ill-used, and had my jaw-bone broken - I am certain he is the man, I had a full view of his face. My watch was safe just before - I have not found it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's fellow-apprentice, and was with him. The prisoner came before us, and dodged us - I am certain he is the man; he left us and came again. Harridge pushed him away, and immediately said he missed his watch. We found the prisoner at the corner of the Piazza; he set off as hard as he could run, but was stopped. I am sure he is the man; a mob came round, and said he should not go to the watch-house. They struck the prosecutor very violently, and broke his jaw-bone.</p>

               <p>"Come on, and I will get away!" About twenty came up to rescue him, and struck me on the head. I at last got him to the watch-house.</p>

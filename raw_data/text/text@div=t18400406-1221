                  </hi>. I am the son of Mary Ephgrave; she keeps a little farm at St. Stephen's, in Hertfordshire—she sent me to town on the 10th of October, with half a load of hay to sell—the prisoner met me at Pad<lb></lb>dington—I had a slight knowledge of him before, but I had never sold him any hay—he asked how much I wanted for that hay—I said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would give me 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and it was for his master, it was not for himself—I said, very well, he should have it—as we were going along I asked if his name was not Catlins—he said, "No"—we went on to a yard in West-minster—he went in, and said his master was not at home there—we then went on to Tothill-street, and I saw him speak to Mr. Wall, who I thought was his master—he then came, and told me to go into the yard and un<lb></lb>load, which I did—I then asked him for the money—he said, "If you will wait ten minutes I will bring you the money—I waited for an hour and a half, and he did not come—I then spoke to Mr. Wall, and told the police-man—I went to my mother without the money—I saw no more of the pri<lb></lb>soner till I went before the Magistrate at Edgware—I then knew him.</p>

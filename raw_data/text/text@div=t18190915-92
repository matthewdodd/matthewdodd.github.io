            . I live in the Poultry. On the 20th of July, between twelve and one o'clock at night I was going down <placeName id="t18190915-92-crimeloc494">Cheapside</placeName>

I saw no person near me, but the instant I fell six or seven surrounded me - I had my watch and seals about me. They pretended to assist me up, but in so doing they kept me down a few minutes. One of the party said,</p>
               <p>"I hope you have not hurt yourself, Sir?" I said No. A person called out,</p>


               <p>"Have you lost your watch Sir?" I immediately felt and missed it - I saw two or three persons running. The watchman desired me to stop, and in a minute and a half two men came back with the prisoner; one of them immediately handed me my watch and part of the chain - it was then broken, but was entire before. Before I gave him in charge the watchmen begged some beer, and while one of them was gone to fetch a gallon, another said the prisoner had escaped.</p>

            . I am a whitesmith, and live in Chicksand-street, Brick-lane. I was in Cheapside, and saw the prosecutor fall - the prisoner lay down by the right side of him, and I saw him take the watch from him; three or four others were behind - I heard the seals rattle; no one but the prisoner could have done it, from the situation he was in. He got up, and walked two or three yards, then ran over to Honey-lane-market, where he stopped. I asked the prosecutor if he had lost his watch - he missed it. I saw the prisoner brought back, and took the watch out of his bosom. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a printer. I was going home, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground - I inquired if he wanted assistance; the prisoner, and several others who were round him, ran away, I followed them - they parted, and I took the prisoner at Honey-lane-market - he said he had nothing. Swaddling took the watch from his bosom.</p>

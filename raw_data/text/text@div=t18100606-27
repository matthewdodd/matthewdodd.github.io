Mr. Steadman and I came up to them at Bishopgate church-yard, Emanuel again ran off; other friends came and Carney was secured. I ran after Emanuel and secured him in Houndsditch.

            . I am clerk to a ship broker. On the 21st of May, between four and five in the afternoon, I was in Leadenhall-street; Mr. Hutton informed me that he had seen the captain's pocket picked, he pointed out the two men; they turned down a small court, I lost sight of them. I procured information of the route they had taken, and in Bishopgate-street I observed the two prisoners walking along quietly as though nothing had occurred.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sure they were same men when you came up to them - A. I am positive they turned round and saw Mr. Hutton and others pursuing them; they took to running; Emanuel ran down Houndsditch; I pursued Carney calling out stop thief; he was knocked down by a constable; he got up and escaped from the constable; I got up to him and collared him; an officer came up and searched him and found a pocket book on him. I assisted the officer in conveying him to the compter, and on examining his contents of the pocketbook it was found to contain ten one pound notes, a cr party on the ship Ockham, commanded by captain Schutt. I saw captain Schutt that day in Bishopgate-street; he claimed his pocket book in the presence of Carney; Carney said he picked the pocket book up.</p>

             was the name of the captain; I was present when the captain gave in that name. I saw Carney, he gave me the pocket book out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARDY. I am an officer. As I was walking up Bishopgate-street, on the 21st of May, about half past four in the afternoon, I saw a number of people run, I joined in the pursuit; Carney was stopped just by Bishopgate church; Emanuel made down Houndsditch; I pursued Emanuel, I collared him a few doors lower than the Quakers meeting, in Houndsditch. Emanuel said he knew nothing of the other man; sometime after the pocket book was found, the captain came and owned it. I searched Emanuel and found nothing at all on him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hutton. Is that the pocket book that you saw taken from the captain - A. Yes. When we got to the compter the captain told what was in the book, I examined it and found it was so.</p>
               <p>Carney's Defence. I was passing down Bishopgate-street, I picked up a pocket book; whether any body saw me I do not know. As for stealing it from the pocket of a gentleman I did not, and what was in it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Emanuel's Defence. I know nothing at all of it, I am innocent of the affair. I know nothing of Carney, he cannot say any thing of me. I was walking up Houndsditch, I heard somebody call out stop thief; I ran as well as others; that gentleman came and took hold of me, and let me go, then he came after me and took me.</p>

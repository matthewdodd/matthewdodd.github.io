I fell in with the prisoner on the 5th of May, in Broad-street, St. Giles's - I had walked from Reading the night before; I met with her about eleven o'clock in the morning; she asked me where I was going, I said to find a place to lay down on, as I had been walking all night - she was a stranger to me; she showed me into a place where she said she had a nice clean bed; I gave her 1s. 6d. and laid down on the bed, and she by my side - I fell asleep and slept for two hours and a half, when I awoke she had locked me in - I had had my money in my waistcoat pocket; there was 10d. in copper in the outside pocket, and a sovereign and a half in the inside pocket - I found her hand in my pocket when I awoke, and asked her what she wanted; she said some half pence to get some tea; I said that was no object, and I gave her a few; she then went out and locked me in - I remained three quarters of an hour, she then returned, and asked if I was going - I had missed a sovereign and a half sovereign, I said nothing to her about it, but went out and found the officer; he went with me, and took her to the station - my sovereign and a half had been in a piece of paper, which I know very well.</p>

             (Police-constable E 34). I went and took the prisoner with this piece of paper in her hand, which the prosecutor said his money had been in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He spoke to two females and he left them and came to me; he said he had been out all night and would give any thing to go to bed - I took him up stairs and asked what he was going to give me, he said a shilling, I said it was a very small compliment, he then gave me another sixpence, and I wrapped the money in this paper, which I found in the fire place, and put it in my bosom; he staid there till two o'clock, and then asked me to have something to drink; I came out with him to have it, we saw the policeman on the opposite side, the prosecutor called him, and said he had been robbed; the policeman asked me what I had in my hand, I opened my hand and gave him the paper which had had the 1s. 6d. in it, but which I had then taken out and put with 3s. which I had saved for my landlord - I was then taken into a room and stripped, but nothing was found on me - the prosecutor said he had been drinking the whole of the night before, and he was very much intoxicated, he stated that before the magistrate - I am an unfortunate girl, and cannot have a character, but I am perfectly innocent of the charge for which I am brought here.</p>

            . I left London last Sunday three weeks, I staid one week in the country, and then walked to town; I started at eleven or twelve in the day, I walked on all night, and as to drink, I had no more than two half-pints of beer, and one glass of gin - I know I had my money safe as I was going up the stairs, a few minutes before I got on the bed.</p>

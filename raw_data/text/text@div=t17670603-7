               <p>Mr. Ward. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner at the bar brought this gold watch to me (produced and deposed to) on Thursday the 21st of May; she said she brought it from a watchmaker that lived in Baldwin's-gardens. I stopped it; she was to have brought a gentleman to prove it; but never returned. Soon after I was going out, and a man came from Clerkenwell Bridewell to enquire about this watch; he said she was committed there; I said, I should not satisfy him as to the marks of the watch, but I went to her; at first she said she had it of a journeyman baker, that he was ill in bed, and it was his own watch which he used to wear; then I went to Baldwin's-gardens, but could not find such a person she had mentioned to me. I then went to her again; she told me the journeyman baker was named Delmey, and his master lived in Moor-lane; we enquired all over Moor-lane, but could not find an owner; then we went into Little Moorfields, there was a baker; I went into his shop, it was the prosecutor's shop; he described the watch, and owned it directly, but had not missed it till I went there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

             (police-constable H 32). I received information, but could not find the prisoner till the 19th of June, when I met him with these two sticks. I took him to Allen, who said, "I do not know you now," but in the morning he knew him - the bird and cage have not been found.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK WILLIAM BUTLER. I had a linnet in a cage, which I have lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How high was your bird? A. Over the window, about ten feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not that enough to make any body a thief? I was going down the Hackney-road, when I was taken - the Lord above is my protector.</p>

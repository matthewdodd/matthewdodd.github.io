                  </hi> I keep a beer-shop, in Diamond-row, Camberwell. On Friday, 11th Feb., about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came there, asked for half-a-pint of beer, and paid me with what I considered to be half-a-crown—I looked at it with some attention before I decided on taking it, and compared it with another half-crown in the till, of Geo. Iv.—the one she gave, was a Victoria—I am positive there was no other half-crown in the till—I decide on taking it, and gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and the left—I placed both half-crowns in the till—I was in the bar from the time I took the half-crown, until the place was closed—I went out twice during the evening, with some beer to customers—I was not away above a quarter of an hour—I left my wife and daughter in the bar—they are here—when the place was closed, I took the money out of the till, and put it into a cash-box to take it up stairs—I then found two half-crowns in it—I recognised them each as the same I had seen before, the Geo. IV., and Victoria—I had taken no other—next morning I brought the cash-box down, left it in charge of my wife, went out about nine or ten o'clock, and returned at night—I saw the Victoria half-crown again, on the Monday, in Mrs. Thorpe's possession—the prisoner came again on Wednesday—I was in the room behind the bar, and saw her—my daughter brought me a Victoria half-crown—I went into the bar, and told the prisoner it was a bad half-crown, and that she had passed me another bad obe last week—she said she did not, she was not aware this was bad, she had taken it the night before of a gentleman—I then sent my daughter, who brought Mr. Thorpe, and the other half-crown—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was given in charge, with both the half-crowns, to Boxall, the officer—I marked them first—theses are them (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

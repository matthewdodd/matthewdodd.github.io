                  </hi>. I am butler to the Duke of Somerset, and was so to Sir Josiah John Guest—I left his service on the 2nd of August, but did not leave the house till the 8th—he lived at No. 13, Grosvenor-square—we were all discharged but the housemaid and coachman, as he was going abroad—the prisoner was there as footman—I am not certain whether he left on Saturday or Monday, as I went out of town on Saturday, and re<lb></lb>turned on Tuesday—he had then left—he had had his discharge on the 2nd, but I think he remained in the house a day or two afterwards—there was a silver ink-stand, which was put on Sir John's table on the 20th of July,</p>

               <p>when it was brought home—I saw it last on the Wednesday following, the 25th, on the table where I had placed it—I did not see it after that, but it was not missed till Monday, the 30th—I made inquiry of the prisoner on the 50th about it—he told me he had not seen it since it was last brought home—I saw it again, on the 23rd of October, at Marylebone office—the lid was then broken off, and it was broken into pieces.</p>

I remember, eight or ten months ago, their selling an inkstand to Mr. Guest—I cannot say that I saw it there afterwards, but I believe it was there to have a crest on it—I saw it on a glass case on the warehouse, done up in a parcel, directed for Mr. Guest—that was about a month after the sale—I did not see it put into the parcel, but it was directed for Mr. Guest—he was not a baronet then—I know the inkstand well—I have seen a portion of it since, the bottom of it, in the pawnbroker's possession—I think it was on the 2nd of October.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Hall, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Marylebone. On the 1st of October the prisoner came and offered me a piece of plate in pawn, weighing 42oz.—I asked what he wanted on it, he said "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I then said, "How much?" and he said "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I asked who it belonged to—he said it was not his, but belonged to the house-maid—I asked him what he called it—he said she used it as a work-box—I asked him if he had the top of it—he said he had, but he did not bring it as it was a glass top, and he was afraid he should break it—I asked if he knew how the house-maid became possessed of it—he said he did not know—I asked where he lived—he said at No. 13, Grosvenor-square—he said, "You know where I live, I pawned my watch with you some time back—I live at the same place"—T said I thought it very suspicious, and sent for an officer, and gave him into custody—while I was gone up to get my hat to go with the officer he made his escape—I went next day, with an officer, and apprehended him at the Barley Mow, to Duke-street, Grosvenor-square—I knew him before—in its present state this is worth 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as old silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer living at Kingsdown, near Sittingbourne. On the 14th of July I had a gelding, a cart, and a set of harness—when I came home, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the gelding put into the stable, and the cart into the chaise-house—part of the harness was in the stable—next morning it was all gone—I have since received the geld<lb></lb>ing from Mr. Thoroughgood, at the Blue-boar, public-house, Aldgate, and the cart and harness from Bennett, in Wandsworth—the horse was shown to Roff, in my presence—the value of the whole is about 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

On the 15th of July he came, driv<lb></lb>ing a horse and cart, to the White Horse at Brixton, about noon—it looked as if it had been driven a long way, it was all in a sweat, but was getting cool—he called for the ostler, I attended to him—he told me to take the horse out, and take the sweat off—I said I would put him into the stable—he said he did not wish him to be in the stable, as he was going to show him to a gentleman—I began to clean him, and another young man finished it—the prisoner said the horse and cart was for sale, and asked what I thought it was worth—I said I could not tell him any thing about it—he said he could sell the lot, he thought, for about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked why he wanted to sell it—he said his master had got two horses,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190190"></xptr>
               <p>but had not work enough to keep two—I have since seen the horse, in the presence of the prosecutor—it is the same horse—the prisoner rode it out of the yard—he asked me to take care of the harness and cart till next day, till he came back—he came back next day, but did not bring the horse—I asked if he had sold it—he said, "Partly sold it"—Bennett was with him—they went into the yard, and began to deal for the cart—Bennett had bought the harness for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they went away together with the cart.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

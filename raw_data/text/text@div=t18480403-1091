On Friday evening, 10th March, I was sent for to Mr. Rees, 18, Great Russell-street—James Hastings was given into my charge—I received this pareel, and between nine and ten in the evening I went to Rabecca Hastings, I, Wellington-place, Albany-road, Camberwell—I saw her, and asked her if she had a son living in service in Russell-street, Covent Garden—she said yes—I asked if he had a bedroom it that house—she said yes, and his brother was sleeping there—I said I wanted to see his boxes—she said he had no boxes, but some drawers, and she would rather I would come next morning—she took me to a back room at the top of house, and showed me some drawers—they were lacked—I asked her for the keys—she fetched them from another room, gave me them, and said, "What is it all about?"—I said I was a police-officer, and her son was in custody for robbing his master—I opened the drawers with the keys, and found 9 scarfs, 19 handkerchiefs, and 5 lengths of cloth, some folded up, and some as if they had been used—this toilet-cover was on the table, this length of carpet was standing in a corner, and this piece of baize was near the window—there was a cupboard in the room, which was Jocked—I asked Rebecca Hastings what was in it—she said, some old things—I broke it open and found a paper parcel containing these 6 lengths of new cloth, about 52 yards, and a basket containing pieces of linen and dirty things—I found in a box on the drawers a gold watch and chain, a duplicate of a silver watch, and a piece of cloth, pawned in the Borough—on a landing on the same floor I found several boxes; the first was locked—this is it, her daughter brought me the key—I found in it 9 lengths of cloth, 2 of velvet, and I of silk serge, all new—I saw a second box—Rebecca Hastings said, "That is my lines chest"—I asked for the key; she gave is me—I found in it a piece of merino, 2 pieces of cotton print, 40 yards of cotton in pieces, and some sheets and table linen that had been in use—I proceeded to the front room on the same floor, which I believe was her bedroom—I found a chest of drawers there—I asked for the keys; she gave them to me—some of them were locked—while I was opening, them I looked across the room and saw her coming from another chest of drawers with a small box in her hand—I went round the bed towards her—she put her hand behind her and dropped the box on the floor—I took it up—it contained these 10 pairs of new gloves—I found in the drawers 4 lengths of cloth, 2 toilet covers, 2 pieces of window muslin, 1 length of cotton print, 6 yards of serge, and a length of velvet, and in another set of drawers, 2 pairs of women's shoes—some kid gloves which have been worn were about the room; while I was searching the room she said, "My son brought them home, and I always understood he paid for them"—they were all tied up then—Mr. Rees was waiting.</p>

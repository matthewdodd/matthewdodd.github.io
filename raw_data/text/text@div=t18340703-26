            . I live at No. 23, Great Earl-street; my husband is a broker - on the morning after the robbery, I went through my shop to empty my tea-pot - the prisoner came to sell this clock - I did not speak to him - I never saw him before - I saw him sell it for half-a-crown - there were two more persons outside the door, but I did not notice them at all - there were no weights to the clock - the prisoner said he would bring them in the course of an hour - he sold these fire-irons with the clock - we put the irons into the old iron.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mrs. Elizabeth Jones - these tongs and fire-irons are hers - I had them to clean some months ago - I began to clean them - they were then put away, and the servant oiled them - I missed them about twelve o'clock on the day they were found at the broker's - I had seen them about a month before they were lost - on the Saturday before I had seen the prisoner on the leads, while I was at work in our shop - he looked into our shop, and then into Mr. Hallam's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The place he speaks of is at the back of the house I live in, at Short's Gardens - I was coming from the water-closet, and there is an old lumber room which they are making into a dwelling-room - I went on the leads, and their window comes out on the leads - I could not avoid seeing them, nor they seeing me - I was taken from my bed at nine o'clock in the evening - there were three other young men taken; one of them had vitriol all over his trowsers, and the master said the bench had been overturned, and the vitriol spilled; but that young man was discharged.</p>

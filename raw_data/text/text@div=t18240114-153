            . I live in Warwick-street, and employed the prisoner to make a pair of tuggs at his over hours, about three months ago. He said he had nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140056"></xptr>to do after seven o'clock. He made them, brought them home, and I paid him for them - they were not large enough, and I returned them. I told the prosecutor of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who found the buckles for them - A. I did. I never had them back.</p>

When I heard of this, I questioned him about it; he said they were in the fire place, under the copper in my kitchen; I found them there - they are mine. I never authorised him to dispose of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The whole things together are tugs - A. Yes; it was mine in its made up state - he never made them himself; he was taught to make them with loops, and these have pipes. He has lodged out of doors lately. He was seven months in the hospital; I did not neglect him there, but repeatedly took him things.</p>

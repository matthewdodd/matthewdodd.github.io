                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Taylor, a fisherman—he fishes on the coast of Holland—our home is No. 11, Globe-yard, Black-wall. The prisoner lived in our neighbourhood—he goes about selling potatoes—on the 6th of February he came and asked me to buy some—I refused—he carried the potatoes in a truck—he showed me some, and at last I went to the truck, and was picking them out—he said he was going to serve a neighbour, Mr. Richards, who lives next door—he was about ten minutes away—I picked out sixpenny worth—he came back, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to the station at a quarter past nine o'clock, and there I heard the watch had been stolen—I looked where the prisoner lived—his mother, who lives in Cottage-street, told me—I went to his house in Castle-street, Poplar—I searched about: the room and found nothing, and then went into the yard—in one corner I saw the earth had been disturbed—I turned it over, and found the watch, wrapped in a handkerchief, buried in the ground—that was on the 6th February—it was lost about eight o'clock at night—I searched the same night.</p>

            . On the 1st of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I lost my purse out of my pocket, with three new guineas, and a piece of silver belonging to a seal; I observed the two prisoners to be very near me: the man stood before, and the woman sometimes before and sometimes behind, but did not know that they had taken any thing from me, Some time afterwards there was an advertisement in the papers, describing the purse, and the persons that took it, then I applied to Mr. Lediard.</p>
               <p>Cross Examin'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you lost your purse?</p>
               <p>Reisig. In the passage going into Warwick-street chappel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a great croud at your going into the chappel?</p>
               <p>Reisig. I cannot remember, but don't think there was at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it that you missed your purse?</p>
               <p>Reisig. I did not observe that I had lost it till Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it lost on Sunday?</p>
               <p>Reisig. Yes, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go into the chapel that day ?</p>
               <p>Reisig. No, I did not go in that Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What place was you going to when you went into the passage?</p>

               <p>Q. What became of you after 11 that day?</p>
               <p>Reisig. I only call'd into one house, and did not stay there, but went directly home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your purse or piece of silver since ?</p>
               <p>Reisig. No, I never saw it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had it when you was at the chapel ?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see it after you came out of the chapel ?</p>

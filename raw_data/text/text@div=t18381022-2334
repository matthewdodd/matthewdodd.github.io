                  </hi>. I am a tin-plate worker and brazier, and live in Union-street, Borough. On Friday, the 12th of October, the prisoner Elvin came to me between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and asked me to go out and take a drop of half-and-half, for he wished to speak to me—in crossing the road he said he had a friend of his who had got some good bills he wanted discounted, if I could do it—he pointed out the prisoner Langford as his friend, and we held a conversation about the bills—I told Langford I could do nothing unless I saw them—they both said they were very excellent bills, that they knew both the drawers and acceptors, and they were sure to be taken up when they became due, that they were at different dates—I asked the amount, and I think it was Langford said about 167<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I appointed to meet them at six o'clock in the evening, hav<lb></lb>ing some suspicion, and at seven o'clock in the evening I met them at the Goldsmiths'Arms, Southwark-bridge-road—Langford there produced the bills out of a red morocco pocket-book—I sat next to Elvin, and he handed them over me—I took particular notice of several of the names, and one</p>

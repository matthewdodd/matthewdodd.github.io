            . About Whitsuntide was twelvemonth I let the prisoner a two pair of stairs room, he continued in it five or six weeks with a woman I took to be his wife. Having a gentleman going out of a first floor, I let it to the prisoner about the beginning of April. I had a mistrust my things decreased; I went up and search'd the room, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment. He told me, if I would be easy, he had some money to take, due for wages on board a ship, and he would get me my things, saying, he had pawned them; but he only deceived me. I went where he told me they were, and have got only the worst of them again, the people deny the others. Some of the goods produced in court the prosecutrix deposed to them as her property.</p>
               <p>The two pawnbrokers, Mr. Buckley and Darcus Mackenzy, depose to the taking in the things of the prisoner, which were produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister, and am British Secretary to the Mixed British and Portuguese Commission—the office is No. 94, Mount-street, Grosvenor-square—the title of the commission is, "The Mixed British and Portuguese Commission, for investigating and determining the claims of British subjects, who served in the war of liberation, on the Government of Portugal;" (and the commission is constituted under a convention of the ministers of the two governments)—"for services performed for Donna Maria II., Queen of Portugal"—it is a mixed commission, partly British and partly Portuguese—(<hi rend="italic">looking at paper No.</hi> 1.)—this is one of the forms of a notice to claimants, to come in and hear the award—it purports that the Commission have come to a certain determination, subject to any objection which the claimants on coming in may make—the sum in the margin is the award which the Commissioners have determined to be due to the claimant, subject to objection, which is the privilege defined in article 40, alluded to in this form—this would intimate that the claimant was entitled to the sum in the margin, if he was content to take it—he might possibly get more, but he would certainly be entitled to that sum, if he did not object to it—I never saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, except at the time when I was called down, and saw him at the office—we have a claimant of the name of Peter Click—I hold his original power of attorney, and his subsequent appointment of a person named Leslie to be his attorney—the number of Click's claim is 154—the original amount of the claim was about 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the award was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—if Click appeared by agent, the award paper would, in the usual course of business, be delivered to his agent; and if he appeared himself, it would be delivered to himself—this power of attorney would authorize Leslie to receive the award paper—this is the power constituting Leslie his attorney, subsequent to the revocation of the first power—I have examined this paper (No. 1,) and can distinctly discover an alteration on the face of it—the party to whom it is addressed is placed in the wrong part of the paper, and there is decidedly an alteration in the sum itself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you ever see the person called Click? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot undertake to say, in the immense multitude of claimants which we have—I have ascertained that a person named Click did make a claim, from reference to our books—I have no personal recollection of issuing that claim myself, except from its having my own signature on it—I can merely infer that this was issued to Click from the usual course of business—I cannot tax my memory as to having done any business with Click—my sig<lb></lb>nature would only show that this is a claim which was issued by myself, in the usual course of business—without reference to books I cannot say</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of the Mixed Commission. This paper (No. 1) has my writing on it—I made it out originally-—the name of Bouch was not then in it—it was written on the 28th of October, which appears by the date of it—I remember writing it perfectly well—it is part of my duty—the original name has been erased from the paper, which is very evident, by some kind of acid, and this "William Bouch" introduced in a new place—that is not my writing—my figures were 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and now it stands 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the I has been converted into a 6—the number of the claim was originally 154, but the I has been converted into a 2, and it now stands 254; and I think the address was originally, 17, Tabernacle-walk, but it has been altered to 27—I do not know in whose handwriting the alterations are.</p>

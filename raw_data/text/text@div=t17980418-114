               <p>Q.Did you see what the parcel was? - A. No; it was in a hempen wrapper, under an old mat, at the upper end of the yard, near the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it be seen without removing the mat? - A. No, it was concealed; I was desired to sit up at night to watch it; the next morning, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner come and take the wrapper away; it was before the yard was open, and I told Mr. Wallis of it, and he and Mr. Brown went after him.</p>

               <p>Q.Then you had no means of knowing it again? - A. Yes, I knew it when I saw it again, because I had marked it.</p>
               <p>Q.That was after you had taken it from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the bundle, that was brought back by Mr. Wallis and Brown, appear to be the same that you had before seen in the yard? - A. Yes.</p>

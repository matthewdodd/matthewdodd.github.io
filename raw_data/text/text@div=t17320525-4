Mrs. Peach, my Lady Pembrok's Woman hearing of it, came to Mrs. Laserre's, and said, her Lady had lost a Head. Mrs. Laserre sent me to the Prisoner to tell her that a Gentlewoman waited to see the Head, and if she liked it, and the Price, she might be a Customer. I went and fetch'd it, and Mrs. Peach said, she'd swear that that was her Lady's Head; she put it in her Pocket, and went with me to the Prisoner, who told her the lowest Price was twelve Guineas.</p>

The Prisoners came to Lodge at my House for a Day or two, pretending they were going to Holland with Captain Allen, and only waited for the Ship's Sailing. They were recommended to me by Mr. Baily, my next Door Neighbour. About Noon I had Occasion to look in my Drawers, and I saw my Money and Goods were there. I lock'd my Chamber Door, and came down Stairs. The Prisoners lay in the next Chamber to mine. In the Afternoon a Man came to them from Mr. Baily's, and went and fetch'd a Coach; they came down, and paid me 5 s. for five Days Lodging, and then they all three went into the Coach, and one of them bid the Coachman drive to St. James's-street. About Ten at Night I went up to Bed, and opening the Drawer to put some Money in, I found I had been Robb'd. The Spoon I had lost was none of my own, I had lent 10 s. on it.</p>

             (with whom I had some Acquaintance) brought the Prisoners to my House to get a Lodging for them. Bradley went for the Mistress, and Holms for the Maid. The Mistress had (as she still has) a sort of a scurvy Humour broke out in her Face; she said it came by a Surfeit that she got with Dancing, and that she was going for Holland, to try if drinking the Waters at the Spaw would do her any good. I could not spare Lodging-Room at my House for any more than Maccartney, and so I recommended the Prisoners to Mrs. Jackson for a Bed; but they used to eat and drink at my House, for which in 5 Days they run up 18 s. I saw no Money they had till just before they took Coach, and then Bradley gave me 2 Half-Guineas to take my Reckoning, out of which I did, and returned her 3 s. Maccartney fetch'd a Coach, and he and the 2 Prisoners went in, and Bradley bid the Coachman drive to St. James's-street directly. As it happened, I took so much Notice of the Coachman as to know him again; he wore a blue Coat; he was lame in one Foot, and his Shoe was cut to give it Ease. About 10 at Night, Mrs. Jackson came and told me she was robb'd, and I went next Morning in search after the Coachman, and at last I found him at the Saracen's Head in Camomile-street. I ask'd him to what Place he drove those two Women and the Man? he said at first that he did not care to tell me, because they had charged him not to let me know, if he happened to see me. But after a little Talk with him, he said, Well, Master, you look like a good honest Man, and if you'll give me a Pot I'll tell you. I call'd for a Pot of Beer, and then he told me, that when he had carried them a little way, they order'd him to drive to Billinsgate, where they took Water for Greenwich. I told Mrs. Jackson of this, she went with me, and we found out the Waterman who carried them, and went with him to Greenwich. He brought us to the Porter who had help'd them to a Lodging. Mrs. Jackson went to a Justice for a Warrant, and as she was coming back, Maccartney happened to see her, upon which he ran to the Waterside, took Oars for London, and escaped. We went to the Prisoners Room, and met with 'em both. We searched 'em, but could find nothing about 'em that Mrs. Jackson could swear to but this Shilling.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173205250005"></xptr>Mrs. Jackson. I know this Shilling to be Part of the Money that I lost out of my Drawer ; it looks blackish, I suppose it had lain in Gun-powder before I took it; I remember I scupled it and made this Scratch to see if it was good, and besides, here's a little Dent just by the Edge.</p>
               <p>Bradley, the Prisoner. After I got out of Newgate. I met with Holms, and we went to a Friend's House, and enquired for a Lodging. A Woman who was there told us, that her Brother Macartney had an Acquaintance who kept an Ale-house, in White-Lyon-street, by Rag-Fair, at which House she believed we might lye; but when we came thither, there was not Room for us, but Mr. Baily, the Man of the House, provided us a Lodging at the Prosecutor's, who lived next Door to him. Mrs. Holms and I had agreed to go to Holland with Capt. Allen, but while we waited for the Ship's setting Sail, we happened to quarrel, and she threatned to tell Mrs. Jackson that I came out of Newgate, upon which I was resolv'd to leave that Lodging.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you at first order the Coachman to go to St. James's, and as soon as you were got out of the Prosecutor's Hearing, bid him drive to Billingsgate ?</p>
               <p>Bradley. Because at first Mrs. Holms intended t o go to her Sister in St. James's, but soon after she chang'd her mind, and was willing to go with me. The Jury <rs id="t17320525-4-verdict34" type="verdictDescription">

            , merchant, No. 4, Crescent, blackfriars-bridge: On Sunday morning, the 2d of November, about half past six o'clock in the morning, as I was opening the shutters, I saw the prisoner endeavouring to get over the area; I ran into the back yard, called the groom, and we went round to the front door and took him; we found nothing upon him; when we got round, he was not quite out of the area; there was a bundle lying in the area, I let it lie there till the constable had charge of the prisoner; the bundle contained fifteen pounds of beef, and two quartern loaves; I missed them from the larder in the area; the cook was taking the bone out of the beef the night before, when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the cook here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it put in the larder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if the loaves were there overnight? - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say that any loaves were missing? - A. No; the bundle was tied up in an apron, such as glaziers generally wear.</p>
               <p>ISAAC WRIGHT sworn. - I am groom to Mr. Griffulke; I was called by the last witness; I went round with him and took the prisoner as he was getting out of the area; I said to him, you shall not get away this time, so easy as you did before, and we secured him; he was taken before the Alderman and committed; there was a bundle lying in the area, with some beef and bread in it; I had seen the beef in the larder the night before, I did not take any notice of the bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing done to the larder? - A. Yes, the padlock was broke off; I saw the cook lock it up the night before, and the beef in it; there was another lock to it, besides the padlock, which must have been picked, because we found it locked.</p>
               <p>SARAH GRAY sworn. - I am a nurse in the family of Mr. Griffulke: I saw the beef and bread in the larder about half past eleven on Saturday night; the bone was taken out; it was made on purpose for bouillie beef; there were six loaves in the safe; two were taken away; the next morning I heard a noise, I looked out at window, and saw my two fellow-servants; they had hold of the prisoner; I came down stairs, and saw the padlock broke off, and the other lock was locked; I saw the bundle in the area, and a long string to it, which went up to the top of the area; when the constable came, I saw a key taken from the prisoner, which unlocked the safe, and locked it again; he was taken into custody immediately. (The constable produced the padlock and two keys, which he had taken from the prisoner, one of which opened the larder).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Sunday morning, the 2d of November, I was coming along Bridge-street, and these two gentlemen came out, and laid hold of me.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18001203-42-verdict225" type="verdictDescription">

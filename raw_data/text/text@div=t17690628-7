               <p>James Hill. I live opposite the prosecutrix. On the 31st of May I heard her crying out, and the people said she had been robbed by a brewer's servant. She ran and I ran. I came up to the prisoner, and saw part of a coat hanging out of his apron. I seized him by the collar, and asked him what he had got there; he muttered something, I can't say what. I told him he should carry the things back, to where he had them; but in leading him back, the mob was so great, that we were forced to take him into a public-house; (there was another man with the prisoner who made off;) we sent for an officer and the prosecutrix, and she owned the things. (He mentioned the things as laid in the indictment.)</p>

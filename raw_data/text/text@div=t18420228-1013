                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Morriss, and live in Eaton-place, Eaton-square. On Saturday, the 26th of February, I was in Mrs. Goswell's shop, in Sloane-square—the prisoner reached his hand in at the window, and took a piece of meat from the shop-board—he ran away—I gave information, and ran out—I saw him running down the square, towards George-street—I called "Stop thief!" several times—Mr. Marchant brought him back—he had not got the meat then, but I saw grease on his sleeve, and on the hip of his coat—it was fresh grease—Mrs. Goswell said if he would bring back the meat she would forgive him—he said he would get it.</p>

On Saturday night, the 26th of February, I saw the prisoner running in George-street—Morris directed my attention to him—while I was pursuing him he turned down a turning leading to a main sewer—he went through there, and I lost sight of him till he got to the other side, and he said "Catch me if you can"—I went through the water, thinking I should catch him, but I could not—I afterwards took him to the prosecutrix—the meat was found the following morning, down an area.</p>

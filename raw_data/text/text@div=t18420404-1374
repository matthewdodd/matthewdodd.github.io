                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live in Vauxhall-street, Lam<lb></lb>beth. On the 5th of April I was in Tothill-street, Westminster, going home, and saw the prisoner—I did not know her—she spoke to me first, and took hold of my arm—I desired her to go her way, and leave me to mine—I believe she observed a policeman, and she did leave me for a moment—after I had walked about twenty yards, she came to me again, took my arm, and asked which way I was going—I told her to leave me altogether—she did not, but took hold of my arm, and in a minute gave me a turn round the corner of a street—she directly put her fingers into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and took out 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had changed a soveregin not long before, and had counted my money before I met her—I had it in my waistcoat-pocket not ten minutes before I met her—after she had taken it I felt in my pocket, and missed it—I did not like to accuse her of robbing me, and walked about twenty yards down the street with her, expecting to find a policeman—I then asked her whether she would, or would not, give me up the money that she had taken from me—she directly got from me, and ran away—she gave me chance down two or three turnings—I was close on her the whole time—I did not lose sight of her—I caught her again by Duck-lane—she instantly called out for the assistance of a man or two—she called out "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>" and a man directly came up with a girl—directly she found the man had come up she threw the mo<lb></lb>ney away—the man and girl picked some of it up—the prisoner then wanted to get away from me—I 'still kept hold of her—she then caught my hand</p>

               <p>in her mouth, and bit a large piece out of it, and also bit two of my fingers—I kept hold of her till she bit my fingers so severely that I was obliged to loosen her—I then caught hold of a portion of her frock, <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> out very loudly for a policeman—one came up, and the man and girl who picked up part of the money made off—I picked up a half-crown and two shillings, which the prisoner had thrown away, close to my feet—I swear positively that the man picked up some.</p>

On the evening in question I heard a cry of "Police"—I found the prosecutor holding the prisoner by the arm at the corner of Duck-lane—he gave her in charge, and told me in her presence that she had robbed him of 15$.—I asked him what it consisted of—he said half-a-sovereign, half-a-crown, two shillings, and sixpence—I took the prisoner to the station, and found on her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prosecutor's hand was bleeding when I came up to him.</p>

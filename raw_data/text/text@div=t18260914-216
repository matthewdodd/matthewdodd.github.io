            . I am a constable - the prisoner was taken up for disorderly conduct on the morning of the 20th of June; at three o'clock, she was brought to Lime-house watch-house, and I found on her two silver teaspoons; she had a gown and a pair of shoes on, but I knew nothing about them; I detained the spoons, and took her to Union Hall - she had three examinations, to give us an opportunity to discover the owner; she was committed to Brixton, and on the day she was discharged I endeavoured to follow her home, but she avoided me, and was given in change to another officer.</p>

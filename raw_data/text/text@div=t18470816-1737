                  </hi> I had charge of a wharf at Battle-bridge for Mr. Brassey—in March or April last, a large quantity of iron-rails were brought there from Wales, for the Great Northern Railway—part of them were afterwards removed to the line of the intended railway, in the Caledonian-road—in May last, I missed 181 of the 15ft. and 8 of the 12ft. rails—in consequence of information, I afterwards went to Mr. Plumley's premises at Bankside, and found 182 of the rails, which I claimed, as belonging to Mr. Brassey—I have every reason to believe they were part of the rails that were placed in the Caledonian-road—they have a red mark on each end, and some white paint on some of them—the police took possession of them—they were worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I have a carpet-ground near the line of the intended railway, in the Caledonian-road—I saw iron-rails carried away from there several times—the last van that came I took particular notice of—it was on the 1st of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—it was a yellow van, with an iron-grey horse—I had never seen that van and horse before, but I was given to understand it had been there in the morning—the prisoner was the person who was driving the van, and had charge of it—I am quite certain of him; there were others with him loading, he assisted to load—he put the rails into the van, and they drove away to the King's Head bar in the Holloway-road.</p>

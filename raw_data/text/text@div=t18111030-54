               <p>Q. Do you recollect losing any money at any time. - A. Yes. I saw my money safe in my box on the Friday or Saturday week before she was taken. I always kept my box locked.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your money consist of. - A. Three one pound notes, and two guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever seen your money in this box. - A. I do not know, I had never shewn it her. On Tuesday I agreed with her to stop, she lived with me weekly, I then settled with her. On the Wednesday morning she went away with her bundle telling me that she was going to a place where she should have two shillings a week. About an hour after that I went to the box, it was locked, I opened it, my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know while she was living in your room, whether she had any money or not. - A. I am certain she had no money, she always begged of me to give her a bit of tobacco until her week was up, she had lived with me about eight or nine weeks. I never saw my money or notes again.</p>

            . On Wednesday the 16th of October I was coming through Coventry Court, I saw Mrs. Redding, she had hold of the prisoner, she said the prisoner had robbed her of three one pound notes and two guineas. The prisoner put her hand into her bosom as if she wanted to take something out, I took the prisoner into a house in Rupert Street, I put my hand into her bosom, I took out a little bag containing seventeen shillings, two half crowns, and the rest three shilling pieces. In her pocket I found this key, and eighteen penny pieces, she told me it was money she had brought away from Ireland. I took her to Bow Street, the key I found in her pocket I tried to Mrs. Redding's box, it locked and unlocked it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They are my own gowns, myself bought them, I brought the money from Ireland in my petticoat, I told my mistress if she would not give me two shillings a week, I would part with her, I gave her a week's warning, and then left her, I never saw the inside of the box since I was born.</p>

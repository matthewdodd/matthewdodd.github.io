                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Grove, Hammersmith. On the night of 10th Nov., I went to bed at a little after 12 o'clock—before going to bed I examined the house—I went round to the outer doors; they were all bolted—I cannot say whether the water closet window was closed—I did not open the water closet door—these coats are mine—when I went to bed they were hanging in the passage upstairs—I was the last person up—this hat was in the passage—this dress was in the parlour—it belongs to my daughter—she was working at it that evening, and left it in a chair in the parlour—I have no doubt this toast rack belongs to me—it was usually kept in the kitchen—this pipe I believe is my son's—he had one, and he has lost it—this axe I can identify—it was kept in the safe under a shelf, and I saw it the next morning in the kitchen—I should say the value of these things altogether is about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the policeman brought Rogers upstairs, and gave him into my custody while he went about the house—he brought up three pairs of shoes—Rogers was without shoes, and he said, "Let me put my shoes on?"—the officer said, "Which are your shoes?"—he turned round, and pointed, and said, "These are mine."</p>

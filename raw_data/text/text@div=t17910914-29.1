               <p>I live in Houndsditch, in Five-ball-court; I am a draper.

I asked him to shew it me; he pulled it out of his waistcoat pocket. I asked him, if he had any more of it; he said, he had about 40 or 50 ounces more at home. I asked him where he lived; he said, he lived in Brick-lane, Piccadilly, at one Mr. Carter's. I was going along Duke's-place at this time, coming out of a place of worship. I asked him, how he came by it; he said, he brought it from Birmingham. I told him to stop a little there, and I would fetch a man that would come and buy it of him. He stopped there; and I went, and fetched a constable.</p>
               <p>What became of the silver? - He had it all the while himself. The constable's name is Davis; he took him into custody, and took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met that person, and asked him to buy some silver. He asked me, what I would have for it; I told him, a guinea. He said, he would give me half a guinea. I told him, I would not take it; and with that he got a constable, and took me into custody.</p>

I asked, how he came by he said, he brought it from Birmingham; and it was better than the London silver; and said, if I chose to go home with him, he would shew it me; he said, he lived in Brick-lane, Piccadilly. I was going home with him; and when I came to the Poultry, I put him into the compter. When I came to the Poultry, he said, for God's sake let me go, and take the property to yourself; and when he was at the compter, he said, he lodged in Whitecross-street; I forget the name of the court; I went to the house, and his wife was at home; and I asked her, if she knew any thing about her husband having any silver about him; and I learned from her, that he worked for Mr. Bateman, Bunhill-row.</p>

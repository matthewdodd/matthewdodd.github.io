               <p>I was in Holborn when the prisoner was stopped, he called upon me for assistance, and I went with him to the watch-house, we searched two or three coach houses, and we went into this coach house and the doors of the chariot were open, and the tassels lay there; he said he was going to sell them to a coachmaker.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing further to say than that I know nothing of the robbery, I never committed it, Welch told me right or wrong it was immaterial, I should be hanged, I said I hoped not, I asked him if he had the law in his own hands, he said damn the law, I should have enough by and by.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this indictment is so framed as to make it a capital offence, why it was so framed after hearing the evidence, I am at a loss to conceive; for the prisoner might as well have been indicted under any other statute in the statute book as this, there is not the smallest foundation whatever for that part of the charge which makes the capital part of the indictment, for these coach-glasses were not stolen in any place belonging to Dr. Tarrant, nor were they stolen in any coach-house, but they were stolen from under a gate-way in a yard; you will therefore reject that part of the case and consider the evidence, you are to judge on comparing these strings, whether you are satisfied they are the same, I looked at them myself, and they do very strongly appear to be separated one from the other.</p>

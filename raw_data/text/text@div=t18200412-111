On the 13th of March, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I went to a banker's in Henrietta-street, on business. My watch was then safe - it was the time of the election. As I returned towards the City, the prisoner, and two others, surrounded me, and forced me into the crowd. I begged of them to let me go, as I did not want to go into the crowd. About a minute after they gave way, and let me out. I immediately missed my watch, turned my head round, and saw the prisoner hand it over to one of the others. I immediately rushed in and collared him, and his companions called for assistance. The others was rescued by the mob, but I never lost my hold of the prisoner. I have not recovered my watch.</p>

            . I am an officer. As I was going along the market, there was a cry of Rescue! A great mob was following the two witnesses who had the prisoner in custody. I went into the mob - the prisoner said, I will go peaceably with you, your are an officer. I found a knife in his pocket.</p>

            . I was with Waters, we were both quite sober, opposite the Punch Bowl, the prisoner and two other females met us, they clasped us round, and wished us to go with them, we refused, and immediately they withdrew - Waters said his watch was gone, I pursued and overtook them just going through Temple-bar, the prisoner ran up Shire-lane, and in the passage of the Star Hotel I caught her with the watch in her hand, she threw it on the floor, I picked it up, and gave her in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not say it was done out of fun - A. No; she said she wished the watch and the owner at the devil.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Several men and women stood together as I passed. I heard a running behind me, I tried to get out of the way - I was knocked down, and as I lay on the ground, I picked the watch up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Blake, as brewers, at Baker-street, Enfield—there is an entrance-gate in Baker-street, and it was possible for a person acquainted with the premises to enter them from a field at the back—there is a counting-house in the yard with a large counting-house desk in it, with a lock and key, in which was kept a cash-box and some papers and memorandums—on Sunday, about four o'clock or half-past four I went to the desk and locked the cash-box, which contained four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, thirty-five sovereigns, and some silver, up in the desk, locked the counting-house door and took the key with me—about ten at night I went to the counting-house again, and found the door and the desk broken open and the box and money gone—I had placed the notes there on Friday, Nov. 1—I had received them from Mr. Finch, Jun.—there were marks on the door and desk—the prisoner had been in my employ as groom for two years and six months; he left on 17th Aug.—I had occasionally paid him his wages in the counting-house, and taken the money out of the cash-box in that desk.</p>

On the day of the robbery, I went to the premises between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and examined the marks—on 18th Nov. I went to the prisoner's house, and found him there, and his wife and two children—I told him he must consider himself in my custody, on suspicion of commit<lb></lb>ting the robbery at Mr. Blake's—he said he was innocent of it, he could prove where he was on the night of the robbery; he and his wife went to Hedges, on Clay-hill, and he never was out of Hedges' sight till twelve at night, and Hedges could prove he had never left him—Hedges is a gar<lb></lb>dener; I know him by sight—I found on the prisoner this purse containing 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—in a drawer up-stairs I found another purse containing 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver; also 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a work-box—I found this watch and chain in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, N</hi> 30). I took charge of the prisoner while Collins searched—I searched a shed at the back of the house next day, a few yards from the back-door, and found this iron crow-bar(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I compared it with the marks on Mr. Blake's door, and have no doubt they were made with it, and also those on the desk, where the impression was stronger—I returned to the station, and told the prisoner I had found an iron chisel in his shed, and it corresponded with the marks on the desk and door—he said it belonged to his mother-in-law—I said there were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes found, and, I think I said, traced to his sister-in-law—he said, "I changed those two notes at Mrs. Edmunds' beer-shop, and I found them in Mr. Edinboro's field—that was on the 19th—Mr. Edinboro's field is about 200 yards from Mr. Blake's; it joins the road which passes in front of the prisoner's house—as you leave Mr. Blake's to go to the fields, you pass the prisoner's house first—he did not say which field; Mr. Edinboro has two or three—the fields at the back of Mr. Blake's are in a different direction, at the back of another road.</p>

I am a carpenter. I examined the marks on the counting-house door and desk—to the best of my belief they were made by this instrument, the point of it is a little turned, which makes a mark in the centre—I found that mark on the door and on the desk.</p>

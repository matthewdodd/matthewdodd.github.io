I lived at Mr. Wood's, in Windsor-terrace—I got acquainted with the prisoner when I was at my sister's house—he visited there, and then he became a lodger—he paid his addresses to me, and I consented to marry him—on the 31st of December I left my watch on the mantel-piece in the sitting-room—the prisoner came in, and when he went out I missed my watch—I followed him, and asked him about it—he said he would return it when he came home—when he came back I saw him, and asked him about it—he said he would give it me, but he had put it in the cupboard in his bed-room—I was surprised at not getting it, and in a few days I asked him again—he said it was in the cupboard, and he would give it me—it was worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it had a ribbon to it, and a key, which was my brother-in-law's—some time after, the prisoner went away into the country—I never got my watch—I never gave him authority to take it, or to pawn it, or to sell it.</p>

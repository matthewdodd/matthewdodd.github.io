               <p>Q. What is your yard? - A. An open farm yard; he was in the yard close to the stable-door; I ran after him, and as he was going out of the gate he dropped the cock, I saw him drop the cock when he got there; he then ran down Pigwell-lane, about two hundred yards off; I catched hold of him, and brought him back, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he live in your neighbourhood? - A. We do not know where he lives; he told the Justice he lived in the parish of St. Luke's; I know nothing of the man myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Where was your yard dog at the time? - A. He was in the stable with me, and he came out with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out of the stable he was going out of the yard? - A. I saw him close to the stable-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the cock in that young man's possession? - A. Yes; I saw it drop from him.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the middle of the day, there were a number of people passing and repassing? - A. There were none in my yard; I saw the cock drop from him.</p>

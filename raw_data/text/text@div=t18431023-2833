On the afternoon of the 7th of October I went, with three other officers, to No. 3, James-place, St. Ann-street, Westminster—we found the street door open, and went up stairs—there is only one room up stairs—the door was shut—I put my shoulder against it, to endeavour to open it; and on doing so, a rush was made towards the door by persons inside, pushing it back, and trying to keep it closed—we ulti<lb></lb>mately succeeded in forcing it open, and found all the four prisoners in the room—the moment I entered I saw Burrows go towards the window, which was open, and throw something white out of his hand across the court, and into the open window of a house opposite, and I then heard the jinking of coin falling on the floor of the room opposite—he then jumped out of the window, right across the court, a distance of between five and six feet, into the window, of the other house—I saw him stoop repeatedly in that room, go towards the fire-place, and throw something into the fire—he then came to the window, dropped down into the court, and made off—Brook followed him—I assisted in securing the other three—I left them in the care of Lupton and Goff, and went into the opposite house to the room I had seen Burrows in—I there found these three counterfeit shillings on the floor, two others on the hob, and two in a piece of paper under an ornament on the mantel-piece—I saw melted metal running from the grate into the ashes beneath—I picked some of it up—here is part of a shilling which I picked up—I came down into the court again, and between the two windows in the court I found this shilling—I then went into the room into which I originally went, and found in the cupboard some plaster-of-Paris in this bag, also this iron spoon, which appears to have contained metal, and three or four Britannia metal teaspoons.</p>

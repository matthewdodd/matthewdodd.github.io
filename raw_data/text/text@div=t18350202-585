                  </hi>. I am one of the beadles of St. Pan-cras. On Monday evening, the 26th of January, between six and seven o'clock, I was passing along Zion-terrace to Argyle-place—I saw a num<lb></lb>ber of people collected—I went up stairs in a house in Argyle-place, in the front room, first floor, and saw five or six persons there, and a man lying dead on the bed—the prisoner was sitting on the side of the bed, near the corpse—I asked her how the man came by the cut in his side, which I could see, (it was bound up, but I put the wadding on one side and saw it)—she said, by cutting a piece of wood to put on the fire—I asked her if</p>

               <p>she was a married woman—she said she was married to Jenkins, the de<lb></lb>ceased—I asked her where the knife was—Phoebe Davidson came up stairs, and took the knife out of the cupboard—I asked Davidson if that was the knife—she said it was—I said, "Can you swear to its being the knife?"—she said, "Yes, it is; is it not <hi rend="italic">George?</hi> "(speaking to the prisoner,) and the prisoner said it was—I produce that knife—I then asked the prisoner to tell me whether she actually was a married woman or not, and she replied that she was not—I asked her if she and Jenkins had had any quarrel—she said they had, on the Saturday night, about Phoebe Davidson—she said the quarrel was because Davidson would not come up to sup with them—Davidson lodged down stairs—I found so many people there, I said nothing further, but desired them not to bury the body until an inquest was held—I went down stairs, and went to a neighbouring beer-shop, and not feeling satisfied, I sent for Campbell, a sergeant of police—he came, and we both went to Dr. Jones that night, and from what Dr. Jones told us, we felt ourselves in duty bound to take the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody—I went to the station-house, and then returned and got the de<lb></lb>ceased's clothes, which I have here—there is a cut in the clothes—it has gone through the great-coat—the prisoner said the clothes were hanging up behind the door, and I found them there—the cut has gone through the great-coat and two waistcoats, in the place corresponding with where the man was cut in the side, and it corresponds with the knife—his shirt was cut also in the same place—there was no under-coat—the shirt has been found since—I did not see it found—there was no appearance of any wood being cut in the room.</p>

I went on Mon<lb></lb>day evening, with Stanley, in consequence of what he said—we got there about half-past seven o'clock, and found the prisoner in the room, sitting on the foot of the bed—there were other people in the room—I asked her if she was the person who cohabited with the deceased—she replied she was—I asked her then, how the accident had taken place, by which the man had lost his life—she said, that in cutting some wood to put on the fire, to fry some sausages, the knife had slipped and cut him—she said it was on the Saturday night—I asked her if there were any other persons in the room, except herself and the deceased, at the time of the accident—she said none—I asked her whether she had alarmed any of the inmates of the house previous to fetching the doctor—she said she had not—I learned from her that Mrs. Wilkins and her daughter lodged in the front parlour, and a young woman, named Phoebe Davidson, in the back parlour—those were the only persons she mentioned to me—I asked her whether she and the deceased were good friends, or had any words within a short time of the accident—she said, "Oh yes, we were quite good friends"—I said, "Are you quite sure that you had no quarrel at all with him, shortly before that?"—she said, "I will tell you the truth, we had a few words, he lifted his hand to strike me; I turned ray back from him towards the table, and at the same moment I saw he had lifted his hand, I heard him call out, "Oh, I am cut'"—I asked her how could that be reconciled</p>

               <p>with her former statement, that he had been cutting wood, as he could not be doing two things at once, cutting wood and string her at the same time—I used these very words to her—she made no answer—I asked her if she had any objection to tell me the subject of the dispute between her and the decesed?—she said, "It was relative to the young woman, Phonebe Davision, who lived in the back parlour, and he went to strike me in consequence of the words we had about her"—I then told her I should feel it my duty to take her into custody, which I did—she remained in my custody during the night—she stated that at the moment she found he had met with the accident, she ran for Mr. Jones the surgeon—she app<lb></lb>peared very much distressed and agitated—in fact, it was with some dif<lb></lb>ficulty I could get her from the body—I tore her from it—she threw her<lb></lb>self on the corpse, and I could hardly get her from it—Phobe Davidson was present during the whole conversation—the prisoner stated, in her presence, that the deceased was very angry with her because Phoebe Davision would not came up to supper—she remained in my custody all night, and about six or seven o'clock in the morning, I ascertained a Ca<lb></lb>tholic clegryman had visited the man—I went to her to ask where he lived—she said she did not know, and she said, "Oh, Jenkins, Jenkins, little did I think it would have come to this; you have often threatened to stab me and yourself, but little did I think it would have come to this"—I said, "You do not mean to say he stabbed himself, do you?"—she said, "He might have done it, for my back was towards him?"—I said. "You told me last night, you always lived very happily together?"—she said, "Oh no, he has often beat me, and left me weltering in my blood: as my late landlady, who lived next door, can testify."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Judd-street. I was not acquainted with the deceased before the accident—on Saturday, the 24th, between ten and twelve o'clock in the evening, I saw him at No. 1, Argyle-place—the prisoner came to my house for me to go—she seemed very much distressed—I went with her, and found the deceased in the front room, up stairs—I do not recollect whether he was in bed—he stated that he had cut himself in cutting wood—the prisoner was with me—on ex<lb></lb>amining, I found an oblique would, extending between the seventh and eighth rib on the left side, about three quarters of an inch long—it appeared to be made with a sharp instrument penetrating obliquely from the left side to the right—it had entered on the left side—there was only blood on the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you say the treatment you resorted to after seeing him on Sunday morning, was under circumstances of entire ignor<lb></lb>ance on your part, as to what he had been doing himself, or what he had taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought he had taken nothing but what I ordered him—there was nothing about the wound on Saturday which led me to conclude the result would be fatal—I could not conclude that, as was evident from the nature of the wound—the immediate cause of death was inflammation about the internal parts in which he had received the incision—the peritoneum, when wounded, takes inflammation very soon indeed—a wound, externally, if sufficient to produce inflammation, without the peritoneum being wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is the character of peritoneum inflammation, you say, to give a low, quick pulse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We understand, by the pulse I describe, a quick, small pulse; that is, a sort of pulse I should desire a patient to be bled with under those symptoms.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would not have thought it judicious and discreet to bleed him, if you had not first given him ammonia to raise him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not say that I would—it would have been highly injudicious to bleed him, when, under the shock and fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you apprehend that internal bleeding had fol<lb></lb>lowed the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not discover, on dissection, that it had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You opened the body, and I ask you, was the wound, it your judgment, the cause of his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so—there was effusions of fluid into the cavity of the chest—not of blood—it is the nature of in<lb></lb>flammation, for that description of fluid to flow, much more than can be ta<lb></lb>ken up, and so it remains in the cavity—I have not a doubt the wound was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the pulse rise after what he went through in your shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly; I took about twenty ounces of blood from him, besides what he lost from the wound—he only came to me once; I was astonished to find him there—many individuals, after losing blood to a considerable extent, are perfectly capable of walking a considerable distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having received a severe wound on Saturday night, and losing twenty ounces of blood, should he have gone out in the cold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There would not be any objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The considerable effusion you named was not blood, but arising from the peritoneal inflammation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that effusion was the cause of his death, and that appeared to have been caused by the perito<lb></lb>neal inflammation which was caused by the wound—it was not by the bleeding, or any other cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The wound might have existed, and yet in<lb></lb>flammation might not have appeared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it possible—the very process by which it was to be healed would be inflammation—I think if he had had raw spirits, or brandy-and-water, the inflammation would have been more likely to have a fatal tendency—I did not know of his taking spirits, until the inquest.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of taking spirits, or is it very seldom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never do take spirits—I had not been to market on this night—the prisoner and the deceased came into my room—I had not been to any wine vaults with her—I recollect the words she said distinctly—she said she had stabbed Jenkins with a knife, not that Jenkins had stabbed himself with a knife—I do not recollect using any other words before the Coroner—I am sure I did not say she had <hi rend="italic">stuck</hi> him with a knife—what I said before the Coroner was read over to me be<lb></lb>fore I made my mark to it—her words were, "I have stabbed him with a knife"—I did not say "stuck" before the Coroner—I paid attention to the</p>

               <p>deposition when it was read over to me—I am sure she said "stabbed"—she did not say "struck"—I was not asked before the Coroner if I might not have mistaken the word "struck" for "stuck"—he never asked me that question if it was "struck," and I am quite sure I never used the word "stuck"—the word "stuck" was not read over to me—the pri<lb></lb>soner came down to me about half-past eleven o'clock—it could not be after that time that Mr. Jones was sent for—it could not be much after half-past eleven o'clock—it was not past twelve—I went to bed after twelve—I saw her about half-past eleven, as near as I can tell—I did not go to bed till past three—I occupy the front parlour—the deceased occupied the front room over my head—a young man, named Fisher, occupies the first floor back room—he was not at home—I go out charing and washing—my daughter lives with me—she is not married—I have three boys, one of hers and two of mine—I never had a word with the prisoner—I was called on, on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, to repeat what she had said to me, before the Jury—that was the first time I repeated the words she said to me—my daughter was present.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Upon reference to this witness's deposition, she had used the word "stuck" instead of "stabbed" before the Coroner.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness, and am single—I lodge with my mother on the ground floor. On Saturday even<lb></lb>ing I went out with the prisoner at eight o'clock, and returned again shortly after—I did not go out with the deceased—I came home with the prisoner about half-past ten or near eleven o'clock—we had met the deceased when we were out—I did not go up stairs with them when I came in—I remained in ray own room—they both came into my mother's room with me—it must be near upon eleven o'clock—they seemed to be on the best of terms—both went up stairs very friendly together—they had been up stairs near upon half an hour when I heard a loud talking—I could not distinguish voices at all—they were both talking, and he more than her, as if quarrelling—I heard something very heavy fall on the floor—I thought at the time it must have been a chair or table—I could not say which it was—soon after that, I heard her run down stairs and go out—she did not call at our door as she went by—she went out of doom—I heard her return in about ten minutes with Mr. Jones—I saw Jenkins again between eleven and twelve o'clock on Sunday morning—I heard him go out before I saw him—I went into the room, he was in bed—I asked how he was—he said he was very bad—that was the last time I saw him—she had come into our room on Sunday morning, and my mother asked her at the same time how she came to do it, and she said she was in a great passion, and she would serve any man so who called her a bad name (mentioning a very bad name)—she said he had been having a great many words with her concerning a young woman (Phoebe Davidson) who would not come up to supper, and he had put her apron on the fire, and was going to tear her new bonnet which she had just had made—she had made the bonnet herself, I went out with her to buy the stuff—she said he had his hand up to strike her, and she told him if he hit her again she would hit him—she told me he had hit her several times—he had often beat her before, I know—they appeared on very friendly terms that night—she always showed great affection for him, and was very sorry for what had taken place.</p>

               <p>When was you robbed? - The 28th of September last, I met with a man in Ratcliff-highway, In a cook's-shop, that was the prisoner, I went in to get my dinner, and he came in just after me and sat down and got his dinner, and I came out again, and just at the cook's shop door, I saw two of my countrymen, and we went into a public-house to drink, the prisoner followed us to the public-house, and he called for either one or two pints of beer, my company<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190005"></xptr> and me were sitting together, and he was like to breed a quarrel with us, and he wanted to fight, and I said I would sooner drink with you than fight with you any time, so would I too, says he, we sat there till near the evening dusk, then he would see us home, he was very good company, and he saw us home to our own apartment, there were two and himself were three, and I and my wife were five; and we drank, and were pretty merry, and he was very good company till I got a little groggy; then knowing the man, and he being in the house, and it drawing late, I laid down to get a sleep, then the prisoner begged to stay under the roof of the house, because he was locked out of his lodgings; I let him stay as he was a poor sailor like myself, to harbour him for fear any harm should come to him; when I awaked it was between three and four in the morning, and the man was gone, and the money, and my property, and my wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Where was the man when you went to sleep? - I will tell you, I had not a bed to put him in, but he said, never mind a bed, I can plank it, I have planked it many a time; I left him laying upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Was any body else left in the room besides him? - Yes, one of the men that was along with him, that man slept in the bed with me, my wife awaked me, the strange man was laying on the backside of the bed, I was laying in the middle, my wife was laying with her clothes on upon the bed, she put her hand under the pillow where she put her pockets, and they were gone, and the man was gone, and the money was gone; through the alarm I waked the man, and run up stairs to get a light, this other man that was in the bed put his hand in his pocket, and he said to me, Dick, all my money is gone; says I, it is fallen out in the bed, and I put my hand into my pocket; why, says I, all my money is gone too, so she came down, says I, what is the matter; Oh dear! says she, matter enough, the man is gone, and the money is gone; I missed thirteen shillings and sixpence out of my right-hand breeches pocket, and I had only three shillings and six-pence in this breeches pocket that I was laying on, he could not get at that.</p>
               <p>After you missed the money, did you look for the man? - I never had any thoughts to look for the man, what should I look for a man for that I never saw with my eyes before; my wife locked the door, bolted the door, and latched it; that is, it was latched first.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the door, when you first waked, to see whether it was open or shut? - My wife did.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing else besides your money? - Yes, a waistcoat, a washing jacket that I had under my coat, and I have not another in the world, and a shirt; and when I took him he had my shirt on, the shirt and jacket were laid for him to lay on to keep him as warm as I could.</p>
               <p>Where did you take the man? - In the Half-way-house at Stepney, I had intelligence on Thursday night about ten; I directly got up, and took him, and I took my garters off my legs and tied him, and I found my own shirt upon his back, with a name my wife clapped in with her own hands, the waistcoat was not to be found, nor the money.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the man before? - Never with my eyes till I saw him in the cook's-shop.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man that you found at the Half-way-house was the same man that you saw at the cook's-shop? - Oh, I am sensible, would I go to say or swear a false thing, my Lord. no, I would sooner die first.</p>

               <p>Yesterday was three weeks I went to the cook's shop in Ratcliff-high way to get my dinner, and there was a man in liquor, I went in, I never minded the man, and the prosecutor and the woman was sitting at dinner; in three or four minutes the man that was abusing the man at the cook's shop, was hauled in, having broke the windows, the man that was in liquor that broke the windows, asked the prosecutor to pay for the windows; I said this man and woman have said nothing amiss, they sat at table at dinner, they were charged with a constable, at last the prosecutor agreed to pay the man for the windows, but before that, says the woman, you have seen we have done nothing, and we will go before the Justice, and we will pay you for your trouble; says I, good woman I have nothing to do with your affairs, the man that broke the windows proved to be the prosecutor's landlord, tho' he said he did not know him. I often dine at this cook's shop, and the young man the son said to me, will you go over the way and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190007"></xptr> have a pint of beer? and we went, and there was the prosecutor and his wife and three more men, seamen, they had, I suppose, five or six pots of beer; I paid for a pint of beer, and we had another, they would insist on my drinking, I refused, however, they got pretty still, and one of the men that went home along with us began singing a song, then they insisted upon my joining their company, we continued there all the afternoon drinking and singing, and I put down a shilling and said let us see what that will do, one of these seamen put down another, the other men said they would not pay any thing, they were asked in; so one being a stout man, says to the prosecutor, you was my total ruin you know by false swearing before, and you have an undoubted right to pay my reckoning, and the woman said, do not have any words, I will pay the next of the reckoning, and she paid it, and we all went to their house together; I was for leaving them, no, no, says the prosecutor and his wife, let us go home and have a bit of supper, and a song or two at home, we went there and she put some victuals upon the table, and fetched half a gallon of beer, that was soon out, and I paid for another half gallon; there were two others, a man and woman came up, we had three half gallons of beer, and at ten I said I should be locked out; never mind that says the woman, and one of the men said we shall all pigg here to-night; I insisted upon going home, they insisted I should not; about eleven we had three half gallons more, and being in liquor, I said I cannot sit up, let me lay down to sleep; I laid down and one of the men pulled his jacket off and put it over me; the woman came up stairs and said says she there is a woman lays there, you may lay down with her, they saw before I had money, and I said I want no woman; the other two men were up and down stairs several and several times; I fell asleep, and the woman waked me, says she you must get up because my husband will be very angry, he does not remember your being here in the room, and these other three are his country people, he will not be vexed with them, but he will with you, for he will not remember you, as he was in liquor, and she went down with me and let me out; I went and set with the watchman till day-light, and gave him threepence; on the Thursday evening I went to the Half-way House at Stepney, and we had some beer there, and in came this man and his wife, and another man, and took and tied my hands; says he, he has pistols about him, I was searched, I had neither knife nor pistol; well, they took me down to Shadwell, there they stripped me of every thing, the shirt was taken off my back, and she made oath before the Justice that it was her shirt; she then said it was marked with I. L. I bought the shirt of Mrs. Winnes who sells clothes near the New Road, and a pair of stockings and a black handkerchief; I received this money at Chatham.</p>

               <p>Court. Is Mrs. Winnes here? - No, I had no money to subpoena her, all my money and things were taken from me.</p>

               <p>Court to Elby. When did you first see any thing of this matter? - The prisoner was brought up to the public-house where I was drinking, with his hands tied, and charged with robbing them of some money, and this shirt, seven guineas I think it was, the shirt was then on his back.</p>
               <p>Whereabout is the mark of the shirt? - In the bosom; I searched him and found two guineas upon him.</p>

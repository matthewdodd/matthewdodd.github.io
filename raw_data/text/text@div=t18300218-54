On Friday last I was at work in my spirit-room the whole of the day, and had occasion to go into the cellar - I did not lock my spirit-room door after me, but left it open; the prisoner was my <rs id="t18300218-54-deflabel293" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>GEORGE TWOART. I was sent for to the prosecutor's, and found the prisoner just raised up in bed, quite in a state of intoxication; Mr. Beddoes wished me to look if there was! my spirits - I looked into a box, and found this glass nearly full, and this bottle full of rum; the wash-hand basin was not in that room, it was at the door, in a box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took none in the wash-hand basin - I took that in the glass; I took not more than two table-spoonsful, and it made my head swim; it is the greatest falsehood to say I was drunk; I have been an honest hard-working servant for upwards of thirty years - trace me all round, and you will find me an honest character; they have a spite against me.</p>

                  </hi>I am the daughter of Ann Broughton, who is a widow, and occupies a house in Alie-place, Great Alie-street, Good<lb></lb>man's-fields, in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel—the prisoner was my mother's servant. She came to us about the 29th of November, and left on. Wednesday, the 4th of December—I was out at the time, and my mother' was out of town—I went out at eleven o'clock on Wednesday morning, and did not return till between eight and nine o'clock on Thursday evening—she was gone then—I did not leave her in the house when I went out; I had sent her out, and I went out before she returned home—I had no knowledge of her intention to go—I found the house in confusion, and missed a copper tea-kettle—I did not miss any thing else till between eleven and twelve o'clock, when the policeman came—I then examined the house, and found the plate-box and all the plate gone—the policeman brought some linen and wearing apparel of mine, and a table-cloth—I went to the police station-house in Bow-street on Friday morning, and found the plate there, and part of the property was produced at the office.</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 5th of December, about ten o'clock at night, in Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner coming along, apparently very much intoxicated—I stopped till she came close to me—she dropped a quantity of plate from her person in the street, which I now produce—I asked how she came by it, she gave me no an<lb></lb>swer—I took her to the station-house, after taking up the plate, and she said it was given to her by a young man, of whom she gave a description—I found four table-spoons, two gravy-spoons, eight forks, one soup-ladle, one sauce-ladle, one caddy-spoon, and some wearing apparel on her.</p>

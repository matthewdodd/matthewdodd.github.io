               <p>Q. Is there a gate through which persons come into the yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a private watchman in the yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A person of the name of Holliday, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you go to bed that night? - A. At ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house fast when you went to bed? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the private watchman on duty in the yard at that time? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time, in the course of the night, were you awaked? - A. A little before two o'clock; on Wednesday morning, the 6th of October, I was awaked by a singular noise, as if it proceeded from the yard; I listened, but did not hear a repetition of the noise, and therefore concluded it might be an engine, or some workmen that might be at work in the yard, not knowing, at that time the hour in the morning; I laid down to sleep, and was again alarmed by a crash, as if it was in the dwellinghouse; I got up, and went softly down stairs, listening as I went, to ascertain if my doubts were just; when I got a little below the first landing-place, on the stairs, I saw a glimmering light in the parlour, and could hear people talk, and could plainly see that the house-door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door was not open when you went to bed? - A. Yes, I fastened it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock it? - A. No, I left it on the spring-lock; I went out at the door so opened, and proceeded up the yard to the accompting-house, where I found the private watchman of the yard; I informed him there were thieves in the house, and desired that he would arm himself, and come with me, and assist in taking them; I proceeded again to the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he arm himself to accompany you? - A. He did not, though I desired him several times; I went into the accompting-house, seized the firepoker, and desired him to come along with me, which he did; we proceeded across the hall together, towards the parlour door, two of the men immediately came out of the parlour into the hall; I struck at them with the poker; a scuffle ensued, and the watchman's light was immediately put out; I instantly went outside of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to have any thing about them? - A. When I struck with the poker, some of the plate sell down from them; two of the men rushed out at the street-door; I called out, stop thieves, one man sprang over the rails, and ran towards the gates; I made a blow at the prisoner, Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say, the prisoner, Johnson, had you light enough to see his person? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you have since learned is Johnson? - A. I know him by never having lost fight of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was not Johnson that sprang over? - A. No, another man sprang over the rails; I knock him down, and struck him again as he was rising, his hat came off. I knocked him down twice; he then proceeded towards the yard gate, I pursuing him, and striking him as he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get over the rails? - A. Those rails go from the outside of the steps, leading to the dwelling-house; there are about five steps from the yard to the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get over the rails? - A. No, I threw him head long down the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. What gates do you mean? - A. The yard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270095"></xptr>gates; the rails were only on each side of the steps, there are no rails at the bottom; I then pursued him, striking him as he ran.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did your watchman attempt to give you any assistance? - A. I never once saw him after I had desired him to arm himself; the first man had got through the wicket, while I was engaged with Johnson; Johnson was going through the wicket, and I struck him several blows as he was getting through; he then proceeded through the wicket, along Little Pulteney-street; I followed close to him, through Crown-court, until he came to Little Pulteney-street again, where he was met by the watchman, O'Donnel, and secured; I followed him close all the way, striking him several blows as he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him before he was stopped by O'Donnell? - A. Never once; he was without his hat all the way he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, he lost his hat in the scuffle in the yard? - A. Yes, his hat was left in the yard, where I first knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then return to the house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to enable you to see the features of the other man? - A. No, there was not, it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon returning to the yard, did you find the hat belonging to Johnson? - A. It was picked up by the watchman, O'Donnell picked up one hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both hats dropped in the yard? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When you returned, did you see that which had fallen from the persons, when you attacked them? - A. I did, on my return to the house; I went into the parlour, and found an iron crow lying close to a cupboard that had been broke open, and in the hall, and across the yard, I found several articles of plate, which had been taken therefrom.</p>
               <p>Q. What articles? - A. Three silver bottlestands, several silver labels, a silver wine-strainer, and a silver waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find all the silver labels that had been taken away in the yard? - A. Some were found in the yard, and I believe the street watchman picked up one.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the whole that were lost, in the yard, and in the house? - A. No; on examination, I found one silver bottle-stand missing, which has not since been found.</p>
               <p>Q. How had they got in? - A. By breaking the street door.</p>

               <p>Q. How were you able to ascertain that? - A. There were impressions of the crow upon the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. It appeared forced? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the lock of the street door? - A. The fastenings inside appeared to be very much strained; they were torn open, the screws were in a great measure drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. In such a way as a crow would have occasioned? - A. Yes; the door-posts were very much torn.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did the plate belong that was found? - A. The private property of Mr.

I apprehended the prisoner Johnson; I was on my beat a few minutes after two o'clock, I heard a cry of stop thief, upon which I pursued towards it; passing the top of Crown-court I saw the prisoner Johnson come running without his hat, I laid hold of him, we scuffled some time, and Mr. Jennings came up, having a weapon in his hand, which I believe was a poker, and desired me to hold him fast; I asked Mr. Jennings if that was the thief, he said it is if he has a cut in his head, so I turned him about to the lamp and accordingly he had, upon that I conducted him to Mr. Jennings's house, where we found a number of things lying.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a watchman, in Hopkins-street; a little after two o'clock in the morning, I heard the rattle spring; I ran from Husband-street into Hopkins-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with any body before you came to Green's-court? - A. When I came to the gateway, at the end of Green's court, I saw Remington, I then looked and saw a pair of white stockings standing up against a door which I found to be a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that turn out to be? - A. That is the man (pointing to Shires); I took him to Mr. Jennings's, and from there to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When you first heard the rattle you were in Husband-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From thence you came to Hopkins-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from Hopkins-street you came into this gateway? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Hopkins-street a thoroughfare? - A. Yes, there is coach way through.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any body going the way you came? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But if any body had got into the gateway they might have gone the other way before you came up to them? - A. No, they could not, because there was another watchman coming after him from Green's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at the end of the gateway before the other watchman came up? - A. About a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any person had gone through the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270097"></xptr>gateway before you came up, that person must have gone a different way from that which you came? - A. I suppose so.</p>

               <p>Q. Then wherever he had been he had not left his hat behind him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you come up to the gateway as soon as Remington did? - A. Yes.</p>

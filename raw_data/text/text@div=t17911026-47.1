               <p>The 28th of September, about four in the afternoon, the prisoner came into Mr. Owen's shop (I am a journeyman) she asked to look at some clear lawns; as we had no lawns wide enough, she asked to look at some muslins, I went and fetched them; on my return I missed a piece of lawn, I shewed her the muslins, she offered a price I could not take; the woman who was with me in the shop kept me in conversation, which induced me to think the woman who was gone was the person who stole it. I followed her and stopped her, she dropt it; the lawn was brought into the house in a minute or two, I do not know by whom; I have kept it in my box ever since. It is marked I | D.</p>
               <p>(The lawn produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor, who said that he was out of town at the time of the robbery, but he had seen it a day or two before he went out of town.)</p>

               <p>I had three or four glasses of liquor, the woman who was in the shop wanted me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179110260038"></xptr>take the lawn. I do not know what I did. I have three small children.</p>

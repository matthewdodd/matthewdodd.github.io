On Sunday morning, the 16th of June, about ten minutes before four o'clock, I was in bed, and was awoke by a noise in my yard—I got out of bed to see what it was, and saw Borritt in my yard, which leads into Mr. Whiting's at the beer-shop—I returned to the bed side, but could not awake my husband—I returned back to the window, and saw two men both in my yard with a bag containing something—Borritt was one—I cannot speak to the other—I went to open my yard door, and Borritt got over the wall towards Norton's-buildings, which are in Back-lane—he could get out that way—he would have to get over three walls before he came to mine—when I saw him getting over the wall I opened the street door, and called "Police"—the short man was standing in the yard—he had handed the bag up to the tall man, (Borritt,) who sat across the wall—I opened the side door, which opens into Norton's-buildings—a person coming from there must pass my door—I saw Borritt come past—he passed me close, and when I called police he said, "You b—fool, what are you making a noise about? there is nothing going to hurt you"—I said, "I don't know that, you had as lief hurt me as any one else, it is you, is it, sir?"—I saw who it was, and knew him when he spoke to me—I knew him by the name of Punt—I went out to the end of the court, and saw a policeman, and then Borritt ran round—the bag was dropped over the wall as Borritt jumped over—it fell on the outside in my court—I kept it till Barber the policeman came, and gave it to him—I swear Borritt is the man that spoke to me.</p>

On Saturday night, the 15th of June, I was on duty near New Gravel-lane—Hart's house is seven or eight doors from High-street, and West's-gardens about the same distance—a person coming from the beer-shop could get into Norton's buildings without going up New Gravel-lane by getting over a pigstye, and coming round Dockwall, then getting over into the beer-shop yard, and from there over some fences into Norton's-buildings without coming into the street at all—a man came to the door next door to the beer-shop, and called "Police," a little after three o'clock—in consequence of what he said I went up to him, and heard a cry of "Police" from Norton's buildings—before the man could hardly speak to me I turned round, and saw Borritt running as fast as he could—I immediately sprang my rattle, and followed, but could not catch him—they then said, "Here are some more backwards in the yard"—I went through a house into the beer-shop yard, and looked round—I saw a short man dropping from the beer-shop wall into Norton's-buildings—I went round to catch him, and in the court was Mrs. Clark, who gave me a sack containing property, and said Borritt had just dropped it—I searched for the short man, but he got away—about twenty minutes after as I returned from the station-house I saw Wiseman at the top of New Gravel-lane close by Norton's-buildings—I knew him, and said, "Wiseman, do you know any thing about the sack you lent Borritt?"—he said, "Yes, I lent him a sack, he said it was to get some tobacco out of the Docks, and I am very sorry I did now"—when Borritt was taken into custody, which was on the Monday week following, I went to</p>

                  </hi>. I, my father, and my brother, are in partnership toge<lb></lb>ther, as cap-makers, in Houndsditch. We occupy five houses behind ours—Griffiths was our clerk and foreman for three years, down to the 8th of July—Lethborg came into our service about three years since, and left about the beginning of January—his wife had been taught the trade on our premises—on Saturday, the 8th of July, I received information which caused me to have inquiries made about some goods—I received a communication from Griffiths—I was not aware that Lethborg was the proprietor of any shop in the same line of business—I went to Lethborg's shop within an hour after I had re<lb></lb>ceived the communication, with two officers—I found there were caps there of what we call No. 132, and some we call naughts—Lethborg's shop is in Worship-street—I found him at home, and took him into custody—I told him it was for receiving stolen goods—I searched his premises, and found a number of cap-tops and other things—we purchase them in this state—we could not miss them, our stock is so very large—this worsted plush is ours—here is a piece of gingham that I believe to be ours—it has our mark on it—this other piece of plush I have no doubt is ours—I asked Lethborg who marked these things—he said he did—I asked for the pattern—he pro<lb></lb>duced one, which was too large, and then he said he must have lost it—I asked if he could not tell me where he bought the gingham—he said he could not, but it could not be ours, it was commoner than we used—I ex<lb></lb>amined, and found it was of the best quality we ever used, and is made for us—I asked where he bought the cap-tops—he said, "Of a man over the water"—I asked where—he said he could not tell, but he had been to his house—I asked where his house was—he could not tell—I asked whether it was near Southwark, Westminster, or London-bridge—he could not tell—I asked the name—he said he did not know—here is other property, which, from the appearance and trimmings, I have no doubt are ours—I never knew two houses that trim exactly alike—they all make a difference in the man<lb></lb>ner of trimming—there are some things here which I do not like to swear to—I believe the whole of the articles mentioned in this indictment to be ours.</p>

I was porter to the prosecutors for nearly three months—I left about six weeks ago—there was a person named Perceval in their employ—Griffiths was in the service at the time—Lethborg was not—the side gates of my master's premises lead into Cock and Hoop-yard—the gates merely lead into the yard for the reception of goods—on a Saturday morning, about eight o'clock, I was with Perceval and another person—it is about three months ago—something passed from me to my fellow-servant, and I went into Fire Ball-court to watch—there is a stair-case which leads to a door-way in Cock and Hoop-yard, and then to Fire Ball-court—I saw Leth<lb></lb>borg come out of Cock and Hoop-yard, at the back of our premises—he had a bag on his shoulder—Griffiths came out of the same court directly after—I did not speak to either of them—they went by me—on the following Satur<lb></lb>day I saw Lethborg up Cock and Hoop-yard, opposite Mr. Robins's pre<lb></lb>mises—I said, if he did not instantly go away I would give him in charge—he said, "I do not know what you mean," or something of that sort; and then he said, "You will never see me here again"—he went away instantly——I did not see him again till he was in custody—I afterwards saw Griffiths on my master's premises.</p>

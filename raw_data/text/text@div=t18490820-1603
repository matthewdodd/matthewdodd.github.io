                  </hi>. I live facing the prisoner—the deceased came to my house on this evening, and shortly after she left I heard them quarrelling—their eldest daughter was in the familyway, and I heard the prisoner say to the deceased she was a complete walking-newspaper, and the neighbours were always looking after her—he said she had been talking about it—she said, "No, I have not; the neighbours can see pretty plainly without my telling them"—he said, "She is mine, and I will not see her lost for you"—(I understood that he would see her through her confinement—the mother did not mean to abandon her—I heard her say she would act a mother's part, and see her through her trouble)—in five or ten minutes afterwards the younger daughter came oyer to me—I went and found the deceased on the floor, with blood run<lb></lb>ning from her head—the prisoner was there—I said, "Oh Mr. Ward, what have you done to your poor wife?"—he said, "I have struck her over the head with the poker, but I did not intend to do it"—she was alive, but insensible—I picked the poker up and threw it inside the fender—it had laid inside a chair at the side of her head—I asked him if he would give me a little water to wash the wound—he said, "Don't take cold water, have warm water"—he made some water warm, and got a bit of rag and wiped the blood from her head—he then went out, and I saw no more of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. About twelve months - he was a stamper; he had been employed making tea-pot handles, and he brought back some deficient in weight - the press is mine, but he worked there; cuttings are never placed behind it.</p>

             EDWARDS. I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodging, and found some silver there - this is what was found by Mr. Haynes.</p>
               <p>MR. HAYNES. This is my property - it is cuttings, and could not have been there for any honest purpose; it should have been given back to te foreman.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the foreman here? A. No; the articles are cut out in his shop, and the cuttings should have been left there - there could be no silver on my premises but my own.</p>

            ; against the Statute, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THREE OTHER COUNTS, varying the manner of stating the charge.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TUCKER. I am assistant-overseer of St. Giles in the Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury. I have seen the prisoner, but not on this occasion - this order is not my writing, nor did I ever authorize any one to write it; the prisoner has been a pauper of our parish from his childhood, I believe, but I have only known him twelve months.</p>
               <p>SARAH BAILEY. I am matron of the <placeName id="t18310512-196-crimeloc1143">workhouse of St. Giles in the Fields</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310512-196-crimeloc1143" type="placeName" value="workhouse of St. Giles in the Fields"></interp>
                  <interp inst="t18310512-196-crimeloc1143" type="type" value="crimeLocation"></interp>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t18310512-196-off1141 t18310512-196-crimeloc1143"></join>, and St. George, Bloomsbury. On the 22nd of March the prisoner came and presented this order - he was a pauper out of the house; I was commissioned to give what Mr. Tucker ordered - the prisoner produced this order, and I gave him a shirt and pair of stockings; I took it for granted this order was genuine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Tucker gave me the order; I asked him for it that morning, and he gave it - he is in the habit of being intoxicated, and very often is in a great bustle with having two or three hundred paupers about the house; very likely he forgot to enter it in the book - he and the other overseers have said that if it cost them 100l. they would get me transported out of the country; I was here last Session for a pair of shoes, but they never appeared against me - they said if I did not tell who forged these orders they would have me taken up.</p>
               <p>MR. TUCKER. This is not my order, nor is there any person in the parish who gives these orders but myself.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Is it a resemblance of your hand-writing? A. It is somewhat like the signing, but the order altogether is not.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. BAILEY. I presume you are well acquainted with the signature of Tucker? A. I receive a great many; I believed this to be Mr. Tucker's signature- had I had any suspicion I should have sent to him to inquire.</p>

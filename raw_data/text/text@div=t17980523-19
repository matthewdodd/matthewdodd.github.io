            : On Monday the 14th of May, a little after five o'clock in the afternoon, we were busy loading the waggons, and I saw the prisoner go by with a box, he had it in his hand, I thought he might have come into the yard and fetched it as being his own; I immediately went into the warehouse to our master, and asked him if he delivered in a little box; he said, no, he had not; I then went after him; sir, what are you going to do with that box; he made me no answer, but walked very fast towards the gate-way; I called out stop, stop the man with the box; the Bath coach was just loading and going out, and the Bath horse-keeper stopped him; he had let the box fall.</p>

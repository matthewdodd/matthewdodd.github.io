               <p>Q. Has the shop any communication with the house. - A. It is at the front of the house; I went out on the 7th of February, between three and four in the afternoon. In the shop I had before me a rail, where I put my watches to time; I had left hanging in the window several watches; I returned home near six in the evening, or a little after; immediately on my return I put up the shutters and shut up the shop, and then went down to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing was missing. - A. No, I never looked, I shut up in a hurry; while I was at tea a person came for his watch or a glass; I went into the shop, and in attempting to take down the watch for the person, I discovered a third part of the rail entirely bare; there were about seventeen watches I have since found out were missing from off the rail in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you observe at that time whether the window had been broken. - A. I conceived at that time that somebody had come in by the door having been left open; my grandfather found it out, he sent to me at Bow-street, about eight o'clock, that he had discovered the window broken; between eight and nine I returned back to the shop, and found on the left hand of the window, a pane of glass was cut in a circular hole, big enough to admit a man's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that hole was there when you went out. - A. I can safely say it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could an arm put in at that place reach the number of watches that you had lost. - A. It could.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of these number of watches, did you ever see any of them again. - A. One of them I saw on the 27th or 28th of February, in the possession of Crocker the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the same state as when you lost it. - A. There was a pair of gold hands on it then, it had no hands when lost.</p>
               <p>- CROCKER sworn. I am an officer of Bow-street; on the 27th of February, I was in Mercer's-street, Long Acre, I saw the prisoner at the bar and another; I knew the prisoner to be a <rs id="t18060416-25-deflabel139" type="occupation">deserter from the navy</rs>

            , I saw him put his right hand (I had hold of his left) very near the jacket pocket of Pring; I thought at the time that he was going to pick Pring's pocket from his motion, I saw him take his hand away, but nothing was in it; I took them into Mr. Carpmeal's, and in about three or four minutes Pring came in, Pring challenged the prisoner at the bar with putting a watch in his pocket; Pring delivered the watch to me, I produce it.</p>

             sworn. Q. What are you. - A. I am a coach-trimmer; I live at No. 5, Mercer's-street, Long Acre; I was at home at dinner, I heard a noise in the street, opposite to where I lived; I looked out of the window, and saw Crocker, had the prisoner and another, one on each side of him; I went out and followed them to Bow street, out of curiosity, hearing Crocker say they were the two lads he took up at Croydon; at the corner of Bow-street, I was close by the side of the prisoner, at the bar, I felt him touch my left hand jacket pocket, I wondered what he touched me for, I was not afraid of his picking my pocket, because I had my jacket on; I waited outside of the door while he took them in, in about two or three minutes I put my hand in my jacket pocket, I found a watch in my left hand pocket, it not being my property, I thought it was proper that I should give it up; I knocked at Carpmeal's door, I went into the little room where Crocker and the two prisoners were; the prisoner addressed himself to me, he said young man come and set down, and let us have something to drink, he seemed very urgent to get me to set by him; and after he had put that question to me twice over, I looked at him very steadfast, and said what did you put that watch in my pocket for, he then said, I put that watch in your pocket, I never saw you before in all my life, you b - y thief; I left the watch in Crocker's custody; I am positive no one put the watch in my pocket but the prisoner, because I felt him touch me so plain, and I had my hands in my pockets before when I was walking along. (The watch identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

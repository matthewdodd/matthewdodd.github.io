            . I am a porter at Messrs. Spode and Copeland, of Portugal Street. I saw the prisoner on the 24th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, in <placeName id="t18250217-182-crimeloc1065">Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-Inn Fields</placeName>

The prosecutor was going along; I saw the prisoner looking hard at his right-hand coat pocket: my suspicion was drawn towards him; I watched him about four doors, and saw him lift up the gentleman's right-hand pocket with his left hand, and draw the handkerchief out with his right. I took hold of his hand immediately, and said I would not let him go; he said, "Pray do, Sir." He did not get from me. I called to the gentleman to stop; but he could not understand me. I then collared the prisoner, and threw my basket into the Freemasons' Tavern, and told them to mind it: I kept calling after the gentleman, and the prisoner said, "I will show you the gentleman;" we overtook him in a short time; I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him he had lost his handkerchief; he could not understand me. We then met a gentleman who could speak French, I believe, and he made him understand. We all went to Bow-street, and the prisoner was given in charge.</p>

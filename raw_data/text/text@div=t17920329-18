I saw the things mentioned in the indictment when I left the Crown: I could not swear who took my hat, but I know the prisoner took my watch; she had fast hold of me by the breast: they threw me down off the pavement, and ran off: I have seen the prisoner several times in Russel-street, but never spoke to her before: the prisoner might ask me for something to drink, but I cannot say whether she did or not: I am positive she is the person: I am not mistaken.

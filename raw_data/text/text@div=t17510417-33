I went to bed, and the next morning the door was open again; then I went up and searched about and missed ten buckskins, which were put there over night, and I believe were there when I went to search about. Then we imagined the prisoner had stole them; we sent about for him, but could hear nothing of him till about a fortnight after; then we sent to him to come to us, he came, we taxed him very hard, and threatned to send for a constable, also we told him we would make it easy with him if he would tell us; he owned the fact, that he had opened the door and taken the ten skins away, and carried 5 of them to Wantage in Berkshire, and the other 5 he sold at Wheatly in Oxfordshire. I went to the last named place, and there I found them at one Mr. Radford's, four of them were cut into breeches, and one whole skin produced in court. There were the workmens private marks upon all the skins, I don't chuse to swear to the breeches, but I do to the whole skin.</p>

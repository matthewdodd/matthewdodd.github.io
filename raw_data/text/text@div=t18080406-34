On the 28th of February, from Mr. Prosser giving information to one of our servants, I went into the dining room and missed the knife case from the side board.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060024"></xptr>Q. Had you seen the man in the house. - A. No. I then opened the front door, I told Mr. Prosser the article was gone; the prisoner was pursued and taken; I received this property and the prisoner, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>MR. PROSSER. I am a grocer; I was passing down George street, Hanover square, I observed the prisoner come out of Dr. Pearson's house with this knife box before him, his great coat covering part of it; from his apparent agitation I supposed he had stolen it; I told the woman servant of it at the top of the area steps, that I thought he had stole it from their house; she informed the butler, he went up into the dining room and found it was gone; the next witness came up, he ran down Maddox street, and saw the prisoner; he came back, and informed me; we pursued the prisoner and brought him back to Dr. Pearson's, with the knife box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you stop him. - A. In Bruton street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. - A. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Will you swear that I am the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Yes, he does swear to you.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Walters; I was coming down George street, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock on Saturday the 20th of February; I met the prisoner with this knife case before him, about twenty yards from Dr. Pearson's door; seeing the last witness look after him, I particularly suspected him.</p>
               <p>Q. You took such particular notice of him that you are certain he is the man. - A. I am certain he is the man; when I came up to the last witness, having suspicion, I asked him; he said he saw him come out of the door; I pursued the prisoner, I catched him in Bruton street, I asked him where he got the knife case; he said he picked up the knife case at a door in Bruton street; I took the knife case from him; Mr. Prosser came up; we took him back to Dr. Pearson's; that is the same case I took from him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What I am accused of, I am as innocent as a child unborn; I was going down Bond street, I met with a gentleman's servant, he asked me if I was out of work, I said yes; I had just come from the Cape of Good Hope along with sir Home Popham; he said he would give me a shilling for carrying this case; I said a shilling would help me and my wife and family.</p>

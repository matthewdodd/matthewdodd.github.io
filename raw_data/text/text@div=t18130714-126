            . I am a carter. The prisoner came to my fellow servant, and asked us to take a parcel up at the bottom of Harrow-hill; we had a hay cart coming to town; he asked if it was heavy; he said no it was only a parcel of sieves that he had bought at a sale. When it came day light we perceived that it was a copper; the prisoner walked with me several miles; I am sure as to his person.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of June, just as I got to Walham-green, Smithers, a parish constable, called me. I went with him to Golden-lane, Barbican, and when we came to a public-house Smithers said here is the man in the house. I then said to the prisoner where do you live; he said fifteen miles down in Kent. I said I am sure you do not, what made you here; he said let me have a drop of porter, and send to my wife. I took the prisoner in custody. On the Monday after the prisoner had his hearing I went down to Pinner to find the prosecutor, and the lads, the witnesses; I slept at the King's Head, kept by Ball; I asked Mrs. Ball if ever she remembered Collie coming there; yes, she said, very well; he was in the house the evening that Mr. Cushion's copper was taken away. The copper has not been found.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner first from the dress he had on; his whiskers were large at the time, as described in the hand bill; he made his escape from the magistrates; he was left in the care of a constable in the yard; I went to his house, and there I found a red waistcoat, the same as was described in the hand bill.</p>

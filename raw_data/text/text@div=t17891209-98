               <p>These are files belonging to my father; I know them by a mark G W, which was our private mark on the paper; each paper contains half a dozen; this mark is on one paper; they were tied up together; sometimes we sell them with the paper; we seldom sell more than one or two together; the paper contains three dozen and a half; we possibly may have sold half a dozen; but I do not recollect, and it possibly might have this mark on it; I was present when they were taken from the prisoner's right hand coat pocket; he was reluctant: he said they were his own, and he bought them at Hammersmith, and they were made by one Rocking, of Birmingham; these were made by one Rogers of Sheffield; here is his mark, a heart and star; I know by that mark, that they were made by Rogers of Sheffield: there is a maker of brass work at Birmingham, of the name of Rocking, but not of files that I know of; I do know where they came from.</p>

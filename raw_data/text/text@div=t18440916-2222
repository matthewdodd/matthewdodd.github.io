The prisoner was in my service for twelve days—I told him on the night of the 24th of Aug. to go with a note to East County Dock—next day, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I heard him coming down stairs, and heard the shop door shut—I got out of bed, went into the kitchen, and he was gone—I had given him a new suit of clothes the day before—I examined my stock, and missed a gold watch, nine silver watches, and two German silver guards, and other articles, worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I gave information to the police, and found him in cus<lb></lb>tody about one o'clock the same day—he ought to have taken the note about seven in the morning, but I had not given it to him, and he could not have gone out with that.</p>

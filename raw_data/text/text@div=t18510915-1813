               <p>am lodging at the Ranelagh Club, Ranelagh-road, Thames Bank. On the night of 14th Sept. I was in the street, about a quarter of a mile from where live—I cannot explain where it was, because I am a stranger here—I met the prisoner and another woman, and walked with them a short distance—I went with the prisoner into a place where there were buildings going on, and I had connexion with her—the other woman remained a little distance off—I gave the prisoner one shilling from my purse, which I took from my trowsers-pocket, and put back again—she could see me take the shilling out of my purse—I had also two twenty-franc pieces, two five-franc pieces, an Austrian coin, three Genoese coins, one sovereign, one half-crown, and four or five shillings also, in my purse—we then left; and after the prisoner had gone, I missed my purse and money—I ran after the prisoner, but did not catch her—I gave information to the police—I am quite sure the prisoner is the tame woman—this money (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is what was in the purse—there is no mark on it, but it is foreign money—I have not seen the purse since.</p>

On the morning of the 15th I received information, and afterwards took the prisoner and another female into custody, in Peter-street, Westminster—I told the prisoner she was charged with robbing a foreigner; she made no reply—I took her to the station, and she there said, "It served him d—d well right; they are a very mean set; they never give more than 1."—she put her hand into her pocket, and took out some money; I grasped her hand, and took 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some foreign copper pieces from it—she was afterwards searched by the female searcher, and I received the money from her—the prisoner said the prose<lb></lb>cutor gave her one foreign piece, and another Frenchman gave her the other pieces.</p>

I came down as soon as I conveniently could, and found the prisoner at the bar in custody of a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who locked the door?</p>
               <p>Bigge. The street-door was safely locked; the back-door was bolted with two bolts; there was a window-shutter, that I fear was not properly secured; the sash-window was down; the watchman told me he had catched the prisoner with the greatest part of his body in at that window, and had pulled him out by his legs; he shewed me a handkerchief, in which were tied up two flat irons, a round towel, a piece of veal, and a piece of bread; they were tied up in the handkerchief, and safe in my house before I went to bed, which was a little after eleven o'clock, which he said he found upon the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a watchman; about one o'clock the prisoner, another man, and a woman, came by me; they said nothing to me, nor I to them: they went up the street and were gone about half an hour; then I saw the other man and woman come from the prisoner; soon after that, I heard something fall, which I take to be the flat irons. I went and saw the prisoner on the opposite side the way to Mr. Bigge's house; I saw him look at the handkerchief which he had in his hand; he set it down by the side of the house, and crossed the way, and went directly in at Mr. Bigge's parlour-window; I went and took hold of his feet, and pulled him out; he was all in but one foot: I said, what business have you here, and whether he belonged to the house: he said he was doing no harm; when he was out, he struggl ed very hard to get away; but I held him fast till assistance came. A man looked out at a window at the next house when he heard us, and said, hold him fast, I will be with you presently. He came down; I desired him to get a cord, which he did, and I tied the prisoner's hands behind him; then I knocked at the door for the gentleman of the house, he came down; I showed him the handkerchief and things in it; (the things mentioned in the indictment, except the veal, produced in court.)</p>

            . About half an hour after two that morning, the watchman called for assistance; I looked out, and saw him have hold of a man's legs at the window; the prisoner began to be resolute; I got a cord, and we tied him round one hand; he offered to hit me on the face; then I flung up his heels, and tied his other hand, and brought him, like a person going to the gallows. Mr. Bigge came down, and owned the handkerchief, and things in it; in the mean time, the brush dropped out of the prisoner's bosom; when we came to the watch-house the prisoner said, the other man that had been with him, whom he called Murphy, and his wife, were the two people that enticed him to do it, and they left him in it; this he said also before Mr. Alderman Cockayne.</p>

            's gate, three or four hundred yards from the prosecutor's - it was in the high road to London; the prisoner was first - I laid hold of him, and I saw behind him a man carrying a sack - I put the prisoner aside, and seized the sack; the man who had it struggled with me, and we both went down, but I still held the sack; the prisoner begged me to let it pass - I said they might go for that time, but I would retain the property; they went on - a great deal of the wheat came out of the sack; I took it, as well as I could, to the prosecutor's - the next morning I went to the barn; I saw a little track of wheat from there to the high road, and on to the place where I met the men, where it had come out in a body; I compared it with what was in the barn, it corresponded - the other man has since been transported for another robbery - I did not find the prisoner till last Wednesday night; I knew him before - he had lived in the neighbourhood twelve months.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the service of Mr. Corfe; his barn was locked up, and all was right - I went the next morning at six o'clock, and found the lock had been removed, and somebody had been in the barn - I missed about three bushels of wheat - the sack was not my master's; there was a track of wheat from the barn to the main road - I had threshed the wheat; I have been all my life acquainted with wheat - I have no doubt it was Mr. Corfe's.</p>

I know nothing of the wheat - I had been watching Mr. Corfe's premises when he had expected to be set on fire; I heard a piece of work that night - I went back, and saw Young and Barrett struggling; Barrett said, "Young, you may go, and if I had known you had been this road I would have gone some other;" I gave Barrett a lift up with the wheat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Richard Everard, a butcher, living in Waterloo-terrace, Commercial-road. On the 11th of November the prisoner came to master's shop—I did not know him before—he said, "If you please will you take 1 1/2 lbs. of mutton chops, and change for a five-shilling piece to No. 7, York-street, West?"—my master sent me with the chops, and two shillings, three sixpences, three penny pieces, and three halfpence—I got to York-street, knocked at the door, and nobody there wanted chops—I was coming away, and turned into White Horse-street—I saw the prisoner—he said, "You have not taken <hi rend="italic">them chops</hi>"—I said, "No, Sir, I can not find the place"—(I knew him to be the person who ordered them)—he said, "Oh, you have made a mistake as to No. 8; but give me the change, I want to get some beer"—I said, "No, Sir; I shall take the change where I take the chops"—he said, "But I want to get some beer"—I said, "Then they can give you change where you get the beer"—he said, "No; they cannot give me change"—I said, "They can always give change at a public-house"—he then took the money out of my hand—I had it in my hand—I was not holding it tight—he took it suddenly from me, there was no struggle for it</p>

               <p>—I was not aware of it—he put a bad five-shilling-piece into my tray—I took it up, looked at it, and said, "It is a bad one"—he turned away directly—I said, "It is a bad one"—he said, "No, it <hi rend="italic">ay'nt</hi>"—I went to a public-house at the corner, and they looked at it—the prisoner went away with the change—I kept the five-shilling-piece, and left my chops at the beer-shop—I went to look for him, and almost directly saw him at Mr. Burton's railing, a good way off—I did not speak to him—I called, "Stop thief," but nobody was there—I saw no more of him till he was in custoday, a fortnight afterwards—I swear positively to him—I gave the crown-piece to mistress, and master chopped it in halves next morning.</p>

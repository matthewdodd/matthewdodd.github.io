               <p>"You scoundrel, you have got my watch!" he immediately ran away, I followed - he was never ten yards from me. I called Stop thief! a gentleman named Burfoot stopped him; I came up and collared him - I never lost sight of him; nobody but him was near me. My fob was buttoned; I found he had broken the chain. We took him to the porter's lodge to search him, they were not found on him. Mr. Kay afterwards found them, and produced them.</p>

            . I am clerk to my brother, who is a solicitor in the Temple. I was passing from Sergeants' Inn to Clifford's Inn, reading a letter - I heard the cry of Stop thief, turned round, and saw the prisoner running - the prosecutor called out Stop thief; no other persons were in view but them. I seized him; he said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you do that? I have done no harm - you will choke me." I kept my hold; Mr. Kew came up, and said he had robbed him of his watch - we were about fifty yards from the porter's lodge. I said we had better search him; we took him into the lodge, where we searched him, but found nothing on him. The watch-chain was brought by Mr. Kay - it was broken from the watch.</p>

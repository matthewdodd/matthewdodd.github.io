               <p>Brasnell. He will be thirteen next July: we missed things at times for about two months, we found a handkerchief upon the lad the  April, then he confessed the whole affair.</p>
               <p>Q. What degree of understanding has he?</p>
               <p>Brasnell. He is a boy of pretty good sense.</p>

               <p>Brasnell. I have; some are in the custody of the constable: the woman owned before the Alderman she had disposed of all the rest of the things; she said, she bought every thing that the boy brought, thinking they were honestly come by; she owned she gave six-pence for a pair of stockings that I had wore but once or twice; the shoes and stockings cost me 10 s. which the boy confessed she gave him 1 s. 6 d. for.</p>

            . I am constable, those things the woman delivered to me, which she said she bought of the boy. (He produces two pair of stockings, the prosecutor looks at them and deposes they are his property.) She owned before the Alderman she bought the pair of shoes which the prosecutor speaks of, and a pair of stockings for 1 s. 6 d. and at the same time she owned she had some of the things at home, which she bought of him, which afterwards she delivered to me; she lives in Pudding-lane, her husband is a cobler.</p>

            . My master is a barber and lives on Fish-street hill, her husband is a cobler. First of all, I gave a shoe to mend, then she asked me if I had got any thing to sell; I told her I had an old whitish handkerchief, she gave me 3 d. for it; after that she said, get whatever you can, I'll buy it, for I buy any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago?</p>
               <p>Payworth. I have been at master's nine months, and it was when I first went there: after she said so, I asked her if she would buy shoes or stockings, she said, she would; I carried her a pair of shoes and stockings together; she asked me what I would have for them; I asked, what she thought they were worth; she said, she would give me 1 s. 6 d. she was going to give me the money, but her husband had a pair of shoes of mine to soale and heel-piece, and said that should pay for them; after that I carried her two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you them from?</p>
               <p>Payworth. Out of my master's drawer in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. How many handkerchiefs did you carry to her?</p>

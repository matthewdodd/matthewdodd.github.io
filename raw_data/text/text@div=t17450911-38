               <p>James Lane. I am lighterman to Mr. Harris; he had a lighter of corn at his own wharf, at Pickel Herring stairs, there were four sacks filled with oats; these are Mr. Harris's sacks, there were two sacks missing, and I take these to be two of the four.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the sacks?</p>
               <p>Lane. They were filled with black oats, and there are black oats in the inside of them now. These two sacks contain eight bushels.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the search warrant?</p>
               <p>Phillips. The 30th of August.</p>
               <p>Robert Harris. These are my sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they filled with oats?</p>
               <p>Harris. They were filled with black Devonshire oats; and I believe these oats which are left in them, are part of those oats. On the 19th of August, Mr. Smith was searching for some of his sacks, and he found these sacks of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these oats worth?</p>
               <p>Harris. They were currently sold at that time for 13 s. a quarter.</p>

               <p>- Fellows. I bought a quartern of oats of the Prisoner much about this time, and gave him 10 s. for the quartern, they were old oats. I asked him whether he came by them honestly, he said, he had a great many coasters, who left corn with him to sell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You bought them of me for 10 s. it is true, and I gave 10 s. for them to the man's servant; you had them at the same price that I had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you prove this?</p>

               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner say so first?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes, he did; he said, he bought them of my man Bob, but I had no such servant; I asked him whether I should bring that servant, and he said, there was no occasion for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could your man come at Mr. Harris's oats?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, he could not.</p>

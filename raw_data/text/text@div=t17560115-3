               <p>Sise. No, I did not; but as I was going to take her out of the park, I saw her put forth her hand to the centinel, as though she was going to give him money. The justice was not to be spoke with that night, so I took her to the watch-house at Covent-Garden, and the next morning before justice Fielding, to whom she owned she had pick'd my pocket of something; but could not say how much.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>As I was going through St. James's-park I met with this man and another; they asked me where I was going: I answered, Home. They wanted me to take them with me: I said I could not. Then they asked me if I could take them some where else: I said no, I could not. Then this young man said, if I would let him go and lie with me, he would give me some money. He shew'd me some silver, and desired me to lie down on the grass: I said, no, I would not. He said if I would lie down he would give me some more: then I lay down, and he lay with me. When he had done he called for the other man to come and lie with me: He came, but I would not let him; then he pulled me down, and I call'd out. After that the man that is here said I had rob'd him; but he gave it me to lie with me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not lie down with her, neither did I give her any money. I believe my fellow servant was concern'd with her for his 6 d.</p>

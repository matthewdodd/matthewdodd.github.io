               <p>Amias King. I came to London about the 10th of January, and locked my house up, and when I came home again in two or three days, I found the back part of my house had been broke open, the outward door was broke to pieces, and the other door was likewise broke open. - I lost two guns, some Carpenter's tools, &amp;c. (my husband was a Carpenter,) - Gregory confessed before he was taken up, that he was concerned in breaking the house open, and wanted to make it up with me. He said one Dyer, Robinson, and old Hayes were concerned with him in doing it; the house was broke open twice, once was four or five weeks before the 10th of January, and then they took a pail, and some other things. - I know nothing but what Gregory told me.</p>

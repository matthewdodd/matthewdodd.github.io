                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live at No. 12, Great Chapel-street, Westminster; I am single, and live by myself. I first saw the prisoner Fletcher on Friday, the 27th of November—between seven and eight o'clock that evening, I was looking in at a picture-shop in the Strand, at the corner of Southampton-street, and somebody pushed against me—I moved to the other window, and felt the push again from somebody, I did not know who—I did not see Fletcher there—I then went into the City, and on my return home about ten o'clock, through Spring</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184102010043"></xptr>
               <p>Gardens, Fletcher tapped me on the shoulder and demanded 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said if I did not give it him he would instantly charge me with an attempt to commit an unnatural crime—being frightened I gave him the shilling—I did not say any thing—he said before I gave it him, that he wanted it to ride home with to a lady that he lived in the Regent's Park with—he said nothing more after he got it—on Sunday night, the 29th of December, between ten and eleven, I met the two prisoners together in Pall Mall—Fletchersaid, "You are just the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> we want," and then they both asked for something to drink, Fletcher first, and Chittem afterwards, and Chittem said if I did not give it them they should press the charge that Fletcher had persevered in on the Friday, and under the fear and dread of being accused of such a crime, I gave them drink—first of all I tried to take shelter from them by going into a public-house in Duke-street, they came in after me, and after we had got into the parlour they ordered a pot of half-and-half, a glass of rum and water, and two cigars—they left the house first—I staid behind and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the articles—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I had no more money in my pocket, and could not pay the demand for the cigars—when I went out I saw nothing of them till I had got across the Park in my way home—when I got into James-street, near Buckingham-gate, Fletcher accosted me and said he wanted 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he was Lord—'s servant, that he was locked out from the barracks, and if be did not have the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he should press the charge against me still—(Chittemwas with him then)—I told him I had no money with me, that if be wanted any he must come round to where I lived—they walked round James-street into Little Chapel-street—Fletcher remained behind there, and Chittem came round to the door—I opened the door and went into my house—I went round the counter, got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the till, and came round with the intention, if I saw a policeman, of giving them in charge—Idid not see one, and gave Chittem the money—he said nothing, but went away—Fletcher was then in Little Chapel-street, not within sight or hearing—on the 13th of December Fletcher came to my house by himself, and said he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and when he had got the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he said it was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he wanted, and not 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him three more shillings, and he went away—on Saturday, the 19th, between nine and ten at night, I was proceeding up Strutton Ground, Westminster, and saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners—Itried to avoid them by going down Artillery-place, and round into Little Chapel-street home, but when I got into Little Chapel-street Fletcher first of all came up—he called Chittem by the name of <hi rend="italic">Jem,</hi> who then came up, and when they were both together, Fletcher said he wanted a sovereign—I told him I had not got any money—he said he must have it, and if I did not give it him, he would go round to every neighbour in the place and tell them that I was such and such a character—upon that, through the fright and fear of being accused of such a thing as that, I went over to a neighbour, very nearly opposite, and borrowed a sovereign—he lent me a half-sovereign, two half crowns, and the remainder in shillings—Ihad first of all been to my own house, but had not the money—I gave the money to Fletcher in Chittem's sight—Chittem directly said that he wanted a sovereign, for he had had an accident to break the window of his master's carriage, and he must have it—I told him that I had not got it—he said he would press the charge, he would go round as Fletcher bad said and tell the neighbours I was such and such a character—I then went down to a friend of mine in Tothill-street, and borrowed another sovereign—they fol<lb></lb>lowed</p>

               <p>me—on getting the sovereign I gave it to Chittem, and told him if ever they came down again I should instantly give them in charge, but that was not in Fletcher's hearing—I saw them again on Thursday, the 24th of December, as I was in my shop—they waited about half an hour before any notice was taken of them—I then told my father of what had taken place, and asked him instantly to go out and speak to them—he went out and spoke to Fletcher—I saw him, but did not hear what he said—myfather came in and told me something—they both waited about an hour after that before they went away—I suppose they went because they were tired of waiting any longer—on Monday morning, the 11th of January, the prisoner Fletcher came to my house about eleven—he was very abusive and used a great number of bad words—he said that I was a s—, and that he would not go away from the place till he had given me in charge—I told him he had better go about his business, if he did not I would most as<lb></lb>suredly give him in charge—he still staid—I sent a girl that was cleaning for me in the house, through the premises of a next door neighbour, to fetch a policeman—she came back and said she could not find one—a friend then went out, saw a policeman, and brought him in—Fletcher pushed open the door, rushed into the parlour, and there he staid bullying and abusing me till the policeman came—I gave him in charge to the police<lb></lb>man—Chittemwas not there then—he was taken up the same after<lb></lb>noon, and was brought to Queen-square between four and five—I did not order him to be taken, but Mr. Burrell, the Magistrate, did—I had never seen either of the prisoners before this occurrence.</p>

On the 11th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, about half-past twelve o'clock, a person named Hunt came and told me there was a disturbance at Mr. Cundale's—I went and saw Fletcher—Itold him it was on Mr. Cundale's charge that I apprehended him, and that he must come before a Magistrate with me—he said it was Mr. Cun<lb></lb>dale that ought to have been taken, and not him—he made use of bad ex<lb></lb>pressions, and the crowd called Mr. Cundale bad names, such as a s—I took Fletcher to the police-office.</p>

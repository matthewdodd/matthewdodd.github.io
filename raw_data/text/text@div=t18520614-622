                  </hi>. I keep the Red Cross, 33, Barbican. I have a brother, a carpenter, who lives at 21, Gerard-street, Soho—the prisoner Grover had been in my brother's service—I had known him about two years—on Saturday, 17th April, about 4 o'clock, he came to my house before the bar, and called for a pint of porter—he said, "How do you do, Mr. Salway?"—I said, "I am very well, thank you; what are you doing now?"—he said, "Nothing"—he stood there for some few minutes, and then put his elbow on the counter, and whispered to me, "Have you ever taken any bad money since you have been here?"—I then said, "Well, what has been brought I have been very fortunate, I have detected it"—he then put his hand into his trowsers' pocket, pulled out a shilling, and said he served butchers and bakers, and publicans, with this sort of coin at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per dozen—I then asked him how long he had followed that profession—he replied, "About a month after I left your brother, as I had neither money nor clothes"—he then took the shilling up off the counter, and went away as he saw me going towards the private box, I suppose he thought I was coming out to him—after he had gone I told the sergeant of police—I saw no more of Grover until the Saturday following, when he came about 10 in the morning—he asked me if I could change him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked him was it genuine, or how he came in possession of it, knowing the capacity he was in before—he said, "It is; we fell across it," or "tumbled over it in Drury-lane"—I then said, "Well, bring it and let me look at it"—he then said, "What time shall I come?"—I said, "At 5 o'clock"—he said he would come at 7—I said, "I shall be busy at that time, come at 5"—he agreed to do so, and went away—I went to the police station, and told them what had occurred, and about 4 in the afternoon Bull and Packman came, and waited there up till 11 at night—Grover did not come, and they then went away—on the Saturday following, 1st May, about 7 in the evening, Grover came, in company with Donoghue—they came together—I was at the bar—Grover said, "I have brought these notes, can you change them for me?"—I then did as the police constable had told me, invited them into the parlour, and went into the parlour to them—I first sent my barman over for the police—Donoghue pulled the notes out of his pocket—they were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I did not look at them at that time, but I did when I took them into the kitchen—I said, "What do you want for them?"—he said, "17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Grover was in the room, and within hearing—I said, "I suppose you would take 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would you not?"—he said, "No, not less than 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; look at them"—I did not look at them—I put them into my pocket, and went out—I told them to wait a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>, and I would bring them the change—I went out of the parlour to the back door, expecting to find the police—Costigan, an officer, was there—my barman had fetched him—I took him to the parlour, and said, "Stop these men; don't allow them to move out of the parlour"—before that, as I was coming out of the parlour, I heard Grover say to Donoghue, "It is <hi rend="italic">all over</hi> with us"—I think he saw Costigan—he was in his uniform—I then went into the kitchen with the officer Banks, who had come in afterwards—I showed the notes to him, and told him what had transpired—I then returned to the parlour with Banks, and said to the prisoners, "These gentlemen will give you the change"—the policemen took them into custody—I handed the notes to Banks.</p>

               <p>Court. You are sure the prisoner had them in his hands? - Yes, my Lord, I asked him what what he was going to do with them, he made some excuse that he wanted to buy something, then my master came, and I was sent for a constable, I am sure the prisoner at the bar took them off the rail, I saw them in his hands, I saw him fling them down, I saw his hands heave them off.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, in the month of September last, offer to sell you any wine - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did he propose to sell you - A. A hogshead of Port wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree with him for it - A. He said himself that he had got a hogshead of Port wine to sell by commission; I told him if he would leave a sample, and if I liked it I would buy it of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was done - A. Which was done; I approved of it, he asked me forty-eight, finally I agreed for forty-six pounds. The hogshead of wine was brought to my cellar door.</p>

               <p>Q. Received by some person - A. I rather think I had a man watching for it at the time, I came and found it in my cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. What number of gallons were marked on the cask - A. Fifty-eight gallons were marked on the cask by the guagers mark; I had a bill of parcels and a permit. This is the bill of parcels, it was paid by two bills of exchange that he drew upon me; these are the bills.</p>

               <p>Q. From whom did you receive the permit - A. I rather think I received it myself from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after the cask came - A. I saw him the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he brought you that bill of parcels and that permit - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time say any thing to you about returning that cask - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was it that he spoke to you about sending it back - A. About a month or three weeks afterwards. He said he wanted a fresh headed hogshead, and if I would let him have that he would give me another in return.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took that hogshead away - A. I rather think my boy rolled it to Mr. Robertson's cellar door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Watkinson desire that it might be brought to Mr. Robertson's cellar - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been lately at Mr. Robertson's cellar - A. I have this day week, I saw a claret cask there it had the guagers mark. Claret hogsheads are very much alike.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you to say positively. Do you believe it to be the same - A. It has every appearance of being the same cask that was in my cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned just now that the prisoner delivered to you a permit - A. Yes, it was given to the exciseman by myself; I think the man's name was Cross, it was either Cross or Ray; I rather think it was Cross.</p>

               <persName id="t18120408-43-person461">Platt</persName>
             and Clark - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the sample of this wine - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What quality was the wine - A. Very fair.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought it at forty-six pounds a hogshead<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080039"></xptr> that is a large hogshead - A. No, I do not call it a large hogshead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Q. You do not know yourself who brought the wine - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know, you saw it in your cellar and you paid for it - A. I saw it in the cellar and I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to swear that you cannot swear to a cask they are so much alike - A. No, I cannot swear to a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. This cask was not applied for until some time after - A. Not until three weeks or a month after.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Robertson is in a great way as a wine-merchant - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you know that it is frequent in the trade for cellar-men to sell wine by commission - A. I do not know it is customary in the trade, I never bought of a celler-man before. He shewed me a catalogue, and said he bought wines at sales.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you knew that his brother-in-law was a wine-merchant - A. I knew that he was in the wine way, I did not know where he lived, nor where his cellar was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you received the permit from the prisoner, or somebody else - A. I rather think I received it from the prisoner himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot. Q. You say, sometimes persons in the trade lend wine to another in the trade, is Watkinson in the trade - A. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that the day the wine came, Watkinson came to you and told you the wine was in the cellar - A. No I did not say that, I said he came to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. When he told you that he wanted the cask back again did he tell you where it was to go to - A. He told me that it was to go to Mr. Robertson's cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he as early as Wednesday communicate the fact of the robbery - A. He did, and I think he did on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure he did on the Wednesday - A. I am sure he did on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Until he communicated this circumstance did you know any thing of Mr. Ireson - A. I never heard of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then upon his information that you resorted to Mr. Ireson and obtained the information that he has given us - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the claret hogshead been pointed out to you by Tonge - A. I saw the claret hogshead in my cellar in William street, where it was unusual.</p>
               <p>Q. Where should it have been - A. In Villiers-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did it come into your cellar originally - A. In the month of April last; this time twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it then contain - A. Claret.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that bottled off - A. By the prisoner's cellar-book in the month of July, that book is kept in the prisoner's own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever authorised the prisoner to sell any wine to Mr. Ireson - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, did you know at all of this cask of wine going out of your cellar to Mr. Ireson - A. I never knew of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you if your cellarman is a place of a considerable trust - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you his character, if he had not been honest you would not have kept him in your service - A. I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the cask - A. I know the mark and number and cut guage, and the time it came into my possession; the shipper puts that mark, I can speak to the marks and the cut guage.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you observed them before July last - A. I bought them upon the Quays myself, I bought ninety-nine hogsheads of Claret at one time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Upon each of which, I take it were the guagers mark - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not singular to find the guager's mark - A. Some guagers do not mark, the cellar-book will show the mark of this cask most likely.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this hogshead purchased - A. I think in the month of April in last year.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably at the time of their coming into your cellar, was in July. Pray, sir, is fifty-eight gallons a small or a large hogshead - A. They are from fifty-five to sixty, very few of them sixty; sixty, we call them a large size.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner leave your service of his own account, or did you send him about his own business - A. It was then each mutually agreed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you soon afterwards take any account of your stock, with a view to discover any loss - A. Not with a view to discover any loss, because I had a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find you stock upon that taking correct - A. That I could not tell, the management of my stock was necessarily under the care of my cellar-man.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you now if you took it for any purpose, did you examine your stock before he left you - A. He rendered me an account of the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause any examination to see whether the stock of wine that he rendered was accurate or not - A. No, I took it as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Who succeeded the prisoner as your cellar-man - A. Barnaby Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that your stock is so large that it is impossible you could have missed any part of your stock - A. I trusted to my cellar-man.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man, Tonge, was eighteen years in your service, and it was not till he was pressed very hard that he told any thing - A. He was not pressed very hard, I was led to suppose that my porters had wine in their possession, I applied at Bow-street office, Mr. Stafford sent Taunton to me, we searched our porters, I found some wine in Tonge's possession upon searching his apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had master Tonge fled at that time - A. He was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you took him in into custody - A. I did not, I took him into my accompting-house, and told him his salvation depended upon his telling me what he had taken, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many considerable wine-merchants in this town, is it not the custom of some of them to permit their cellar-men to trade themselves - A. I have been twenty-five years in the trade and I never knew of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080041"></xptr> Q. Perhaps if great ones do not, little ones may - A. I do not know, I should be very sorry to allow it in my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When Tonge made this charge, how long were you before you took the prisoner into custody - A. From the Monday to the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you took up his brother-in-law - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And then on the Friday the prisoner came and surrendered - A. He did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Tonge communicated to you on the Tuesday - A. He mentioned it on the Monday night when detected, and mentioned it on Tuesday morning: he mentioned it on the Monday night that I found the wine in his room.</p>

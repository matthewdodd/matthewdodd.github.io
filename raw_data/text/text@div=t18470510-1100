On the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you obtain it"—I told him to call again—I found he wanted the money very quickly, and said no respectable tradesman would go about such a business on the instant—he said, if I could tell him anybody who would advance the money, I should be remunerated—I mentioned two respectable tradesmen; he left, returned, and said he could not do any business with them—I said, "Well, if I go about it is it by good maker?"—he said "Yes, by Wood and Thornthwaite, of Newgate-street"—I said, "Is their name on it?"—he said, "Yes, but that could be easily erased"—I said it was objectionable, having a name, for how<lb></lb>ever respectable tradesmen are, they don't like to have a name on an instru<lb></lb>ment—I asked him, how long it had been pledged—he said "Under a month, it would not cost more than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to look at it—he left.</p>

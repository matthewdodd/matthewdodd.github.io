            , On Saturday the 4th of October, about five o'Clock in the Afternoon, as I was going along by St Paul's, I felt a Motion at my Pocket, I immediately clapp'd my Hand to my Right Pocket, and found that my Handkerchief was gone; I turned to the Left, and saw the Prisoner standing with my Handkerchief hanging out at the Breast of his Coat. - I took particular Notice of him; he is very remarkable because he has but one Hand; he begged to be released; the Boys would have pumped him, but I think this is the best Way to get rid of these Fellows who insest the Streets.</p>

            . I was going along with Mr Diass, and saw him take the Handkerchief from the Prisoner; Mr Diass went to give him a Blow with his Stick; he ran away but was soon taken; he fell down on his Knees, and begged to be released, but I advis'd Mr Diass to charge a Constable with him. - I believe this to be the Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was passing by the Gentleman, and he gave me a Blow over the Head; it is very strange that a Man should pick a Pocket who has but one Hand. <rs id="t17431012-4-verdict15" type="verdictDescription">

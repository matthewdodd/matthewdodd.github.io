                  </hi>. I am eighteen years of age, and live with my father at the cruer of the New-road. I was in Stephen-street, Lisson-grove. a little before twelve o'clock on the night of the 4th of June, and saw the female prisoner—she asked me to go in with her—I refused at first, but at last prevailed on me—I went, and she asked me to give her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but she agreed to take 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I took out my money and said "I have got 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she said I need not be afraid, she should not rob me—I said no, I was not afraid—I went to sleep and found her hand in my pocket, and the male prisoner was on the other side—I said, "Who is that?" she said, her husband—I felt in my pockets and I had not got one farthing—I said, they had got it—the man used threatening words and said he would kick me out—I went to the door, and they shut me out—I stopped some time, and then went home and told my brother—he said I had better get a policeman in the morning, which I did about half-past six o'clock, and went in the morning, which I did about half-past six o'clock, and room—I had been in the kitchen before that—I had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., where I came up from there, I gave the woman 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and had 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. remaining—there was a light in the room at the time she put her hand in my pocket—the button had been taken off, and the man there, quite close on the other side of the bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William Tucker</hi> I saw the prosecutor in the kitchen with a female, and she told me he had given her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>

I went with the prosecutor to No. 20, Stephen-street, and was let in by the female prisoner—the man was lying on the bed—I searched Wm. Tucker's pockets, and found 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a duplicate on the woman—she said that the prosecutor had been down stairs before he came up into their room, and then came up and gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—the prosecutor pointed them out as the person—the person of the house said they were husband and wife.</p>

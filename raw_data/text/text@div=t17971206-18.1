               <p>Q. The ingots are delivered to you in bars? - A. Yes; we have the charge and custody of it, and are responsible for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner? - A. What they call a sizer, he oils the guineas, and carries them in various states from one room to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Having access to the different commodities that are there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there, on the 3d of November, or before that, golden blanks for guineas? - A.There were, on that day, and the next, I believe, I cannot speak exactly, we missed them frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say there were some taken away? - A. Yes, certainly, I should think so; this is the blank that I received from Cuff, the pawnbroker's man, it has the assay mark upon it, but I should have known it without.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner when he was apprehended? - A. Not till he was before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. A number of men are employed in the same office that this man is? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not your duty to inspect the office he belongs to? - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, you do not know any thing about any loss, except by the comparison of some books? - A. Yes; I have missed blanks several times, but could not tell how they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How often? - A. I cannot say, every day almost.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great number of men employed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No individual man has any particular charge over any particular portion of it? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. There are six monies of the Mint? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any superior officers to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of commission have you? - A. A commission from the Crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the capacity in which you are authorized to dispose of any of the property that comes into your hands, is merely a capacity of so many persons, moniers in the Mint-when you undertake to perform any particular act, you must perform that act in your capacity as moniers, and in no other capacity? - A.Certainly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060030"></xptr>Q. Therefore, any other act which is not done by you, as moniers of the Mint, must be null and void? - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose five of you were to do an act without the sixth, that act must be null and void? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular Act of Parliament by which you have authority to act? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the authority you have got, giving you a privilege to act, is that a joint authority, which says you shall do so and so? - A. I neverread the authority under which I act.</p>

               <p>Q.Sterling gold you know, is what they call Yorkshire gold? - A. We did not know it was sterling gold.</p>
               <p>Q. You a pawnbroker, and not know sterling gold; do you not try every bit of gold before you deal about it? - A. Yes.</p>

I am a pawnbroker: The boy came to me on the 3d of November, and brought me eight blanks of gold, and some other pieces; I was at my uncle's, No. 70, Leather-lane; I returned them to the man again in the same state that I had received them from the boy.</p>
               <p>Cuff. These are the pieces I had from Mr. Fullwood.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Notley). These pieces that you received from Cuff, you gave your master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicholl. I had these from Cuff, before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cuff. That is one of the parcels that I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Fullwood. Before I got home, I had applied to a person in Leather-lane, Mr. Aspinshaw, who is a smith in the Mint; I then went home, and had got Mason, the constable, ready to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came into the shop, did he apply to you, or to the man? - A. He applied to the man at the door; I did not hear distinctly what he said, but hearing something, I went out, the constable followed; I produced the pieces, and he said, what will you give me for them; I told him, I thought he had not come honestly by them, and I should give charge of him; the moniers of the Mint came, and so did Mr. Aspinshaw; before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060031"></xptr>they came, I had asked him if he sold them for himself, or for any one else; he said, he had brought them for no person but himself, they were his own property, and so he should make it appear; we expressed surprise that the parties were so long in coming; he seemed to wish to know who the parties were that were coming; Mr. Aspinshaw came about five o'clock, or it might be something more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a pawnbroker? - A. I am a silversmith and salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a pawnbroker? - A. Yes; but not in that shop; it is my uncle's shop; I have the management of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he manage the pawnbrokering business now? - A. I am obliged to mind that for him.</p>
               <p>Q. These blanks had been in a good many hands besides yourself? - A. Yes; I gave them first into the hands of Mr. Aspinshaw's father, and he shewed them to his son; but they never passed my sight; the time Mr. Aspinshaw wanted to take care of them, I would not leave them.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen Yorkshire guineas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And these are very small to Yorkshire guineas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were very much like Yorkshire guineas? - A. I went to a refiner for his opinion; if I had known it had been stamped for gold, I should not have let him have them for three guineas; it would have puzzled a refiner in that state.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there not been something before the Magistrate about guineas? - A. What Magistrate? I have heard nothing about it, except before the Lord-Mayor, in the present business; I never bought any like this.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about Yorkshire guineas? - A. I had taken them in the way of trade.</p>
               <p>Q. And you a silversmith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Not till the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would purchase one hundred pounds worth of such goods, if they were brought to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were at Mr. Aspinshaw's? - A. His sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear these pieces are the pieces that came from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you buy silver, do you always go to a refiner's, to see whether it is gold or silver? - A. Yes; but when gold is in this state, it is impossible to tell what it is.</p>

             sworn. - I went to the house of Mr. Fullwood, and saw Cuff, to take charge of a person they expected to return about six o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it that you saw the prisoner at the bar? - A. About five o'clock in the evening, being in the parlour, I waited for a signal to know when the man was come; he was pointed out to me; I went into the parlour, Mr. Fullwood came into the room; the prisoner seemed very sorry for what had happened; and I desired him to sit down, for I expected a gentleman to call; Ball sat down in a chair, and wanted to know how long it would be before the gentleman came; I talked to him, and endeavoured to persuade him to be satisfied for a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before any gentleman came? - A. About half an hour; while I was in the parlour, I asked him if it was his own property, or if he sold it for any body else; he said, it was his own, he had bought it of a man; I asked him who that man was, and where he lived; he could not tell, but said it was his own property; I asked him if he had got any more; he said he had got no more at all; still he was very impatient; he threw this piece of paper on the fire, accordingly I picked up the piece of paper; after that, Mr. Atkinson and a Mr. Gregory came into the house, with some other gentlemen; soon after that one of the moniers gave me charge of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there was a little contest between you and Mr. Nicholl, about this gold, whether it would be identified? - A. No; the man never said what gold it was, I was informed before that they were blank guineas.</p>
               <p>- ASPINSHAW sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are employed in the Mint? - A. Yes; I went to Mr. Fullwood's house in consequence of his calling upon me, I saw the prisoner there; I asked him how he came by them, and whether there was any other man concerned besides himself; but he said, it was all his own doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he had got them? - A. No; he had hid them in various places, and that no one was concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Q. In various places where? - A. In the building.</p>
               <p>Q. You meea in the Mint? - A. Yes; I asked him how he got them; he said from different places, some were taken from the size-room, and others were taken from the Mint office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that where the blanks are lodged? - A. No; the pieces of cecil are.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. In what state do you receive the gold from the moniers, is it not in bars? - A. No; they receive it in bars.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in bars when the moniers give it to you? - A. Yes; it goes through various processes.(Mr. Nicholl proved the blanks having come from the Tower).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How does the money come to you? - A. It goes in ingots to the melter, and from him to us; and we return it to the Bank of England weight for weight, as we receive it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Wm. Winsor, in Rathbone-place, as artist's colour-manufacturers—the prisoner was in our employ, and was discharged last October—a few days ago I went to his house, No. 44, Crescent-street, Euston-square, with an officer, searched it, and found a box containing these articles, the greatest part of which are our manufacture—we have lost such articles—the prisoner was not at home.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120146"></xptr>
               <p>I missed any of it in September or October last year—I had not missed the Vandyke brown till I found it—I had missed a quantity of pink madder, and I know this by my own make—no other person makes the same kind, it is a chemical process, and every manufacturer has a different mode—there are not more than three makers—the peculiarity consists in the clear<lb></lb>ness of the tint—I am certain it is mine by the peculiar tint—I found about 14oz. of that at the prisoner's house—it is worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—here are also two cakes of colour which have our name on them—I cannot say they have never been sold—here is a parcel of crimson lake, in a state of half preparation—I know that by a peculiar circumstance—it was ground up, and not wishing to use it all at the time, it was cut up in shreds, and none of that was ever sold, for it was not in a saleable state.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to the house, No. 44, Crescent-street, with the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner's wife there—I afterwards went to the pri<lb></lb>soner, and told him I apprehended him on suspicion of robbing his late employers, and asked how he accounted for the boxes I found, pointing to the boxes I had in a coach, which was waiting for him—he said, "I bought it at different times"—among other things, I found some circulars, signed "F. Merchant," about cake-colours and other articles produced, stating that he had commenced business, and could serve at 15 per cent, cheaper than any other house in London, for ready cash.</p>

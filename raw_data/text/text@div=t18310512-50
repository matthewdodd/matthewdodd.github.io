               <p>MRS. THOMAS. This is all mine - I never permitted either of them to pawn any thing; I never received the money - I am certain the person she mentioned never gave her the things to pawn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I slept in the same room with her sister, and was never out of the house but one day, except before my mistress came down in the morning - her sister Maria always had the money; Mrs. Thomas always had the money again; I never locked my box before that day; her sister used to get up in the morning to serve in the bar, and when she could not get enough money to take up to mistress at eight o'clock, mistress used to complain that we had been feasting ourselves; she used to give me these things to go and get money on them, as she said she should get scolded for not taking more - I got part of the things out again; a person once saw me at the pawnbroker's, and Maria told me to deny it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Neptune public-house now, but I was pot-boy at the Victoria, on the night of the 28th, when the prosecutor and Waller came there—the prosecutor was drunk—they sat down by the win<lb></lb>dow—I afterwards saw Davis on one side of the prosecutor, and Waller on the other—Giffin was standing before him—they were drinking together—the bell rang for me, and I went to get change for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my master—when I came back, Waller offered me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw Davis take the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's head on her lap, and Waller and Davis spoke over his back—I went out, and returned in five minutes—Davis and Giffin were then gone out-Waller offered me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wanted to know what it was for—he said, "Put it in your pocket"—I took it in my hand, and said, "I don't want it"—I gave it him back again—then Giffin and Davis came in again—Giffin used bad language, and said, "We have only got two or three shillings"—Waller had not said any thing to her—they all bid me good night, and went out; and while I was telling my mistress what they had offered me, all three came in again—I took my supper in the tap-room—Davis and Giffin went into the yard, and Waller went across to where the prosecutor was sitting, he put his hand into his pocket—he then came to me again, and offered me half-a-sovereign, and said, "Put this in your <hi rend="italic">cly</hi>"—I said I did not want it—he had got half-a-crown, one shilling, and three halfpence—when he offered me the shilling he said he had only got two or three shillings—he asked me if I had seen anything—I said "No"—he said, "Oh, I thought you saw it all"—Giffin said, "I have only got two or three shillings out of him."</p>

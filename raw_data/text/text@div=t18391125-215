About four or five o'clock that afternoon, the two prisoners came and asked for a pair of shoes—I showed them a pair—Evans said they did not fit her—she wanted la larger pair, and was to have them by Saturday night—she went away, and said she would call and let us know whether she would have them—they both came back in about half-an-hour, and said we were to make the shoes, and if they did not come for them, I was to take them to No. 7, George-street, in the name of Jones—these trowsers were there when they came, and directly they went the trowsers were missing—I went to George-street, and they did not live there—in about three-quarters of an hour I saw them go by—I went and called them in, and gave them into custody.</p>

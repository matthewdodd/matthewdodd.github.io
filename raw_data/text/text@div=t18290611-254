            . On the 16th of May I met the prisoner at the corner of James-street, and gave her something to drink at the White Lion public-house; I then came out, and went to Mrs. Porters, <placeName id="t18290611-254-crimeloc1338">No. 3, Legg-alley</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not tipsy? A. No, not at all- I was not sick; I had not had any oysters - I gave you a shilling, and you went and got bread and cheese and raddishes for supper; I did not bolt the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHIELDS. I was night-constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - the prosecutor said she had robbed him of half a sovereign and half a crown; I saw a piece of gold in her mouth, and tried to get it, but she swallowed it - I found a shilling in her purse, half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110107"></xptr>crown in her bosom, and half a crown in each of her stockings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not put your finger into my mouth? A. Yes, but I took it out again pretty soon, for I know you of old.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor in Longacre; he asked me to get him something to drink - I had 6s.; I took the prosecutor to the White Lion, and had a glass of wine - he asked if I had a room; I said I had not, but took him to No. 3, Legg-alley - he gave me half a crown to stop with him; I scrupled to take it - he then gave me a shilling to get some bread and cheese and raddishes, and he took my bonnet lest I should go away; he shut the door, and bolted it - the landlady went up and knocked at the door, and then he opened it and said"It is all right;" he then said he had lost his money - he had been sick on the bed; I gave him back the half-crown, and said I would not stay with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that all inquiries would have been baffled if the prisoner had made them most diligently, to find her out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as we were con<lb></lb>cerned, but in his letters to me he always asked me to tell him where his wife was—I understood from her, when I saw her a month ago, that they have been separated nearly thirteen years—since her separation I have always understood she has been attending to the education of her two daughters, and keeping them, as far as possible, concealed from the family, entirely eluding inquiry—she has the interest of a little more than 5, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the 31/2 per Cents.—I should suppose it was his interest in a pe<lb></lb>cuniary point of view to have lived with her, and that always appeared to me to be the motive for his letters—I have never seen her since her mar<lb></lb>riage until a month ago—I did not see her when she was married—I know her before she married—she has always gone by the name of Aldhouse since her marriage—I have directed letters to her, and she has written to me—the prisoner's inquiries were after that person as his wife—I was the half brother of her father.</p>

H. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your conversation with the prisoner was as far back as 1831—was there anything to draw your recollection to the precise language that passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, he was stating that his partner in life was not a very comfortable one, he could not live with her—I under<lb></lb>stood</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220237"></xptr>
               <p>that he was involved in law proceedings—probably it was on account of a by-gone transaction of his wife's—my impression is, that he spoke of his wife as then living—he was not a stranger, I had met him several times on the same ground—my impression at the time was, that his wife was living—he stated it in that way—he did not positively say his wife was living—he said his wife would not allow him to see his child—that he particularly spoke of, and it was a child for whom he had some fondness apparently—he spoke of that precise time—that is my impression—I am confident it was in 1831, because I came to Egham in April, 1831—I was at Wands<lb></lb>worth before the Magistrate, but was not called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What led to this familiarity between you and the prisoner, that he should talk of his affairs to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He frequently took the same walk that I took in the evening, and, from the number of times I saw him, we came into conversation with each other, and, from his dejected manner, I took the liberty of asking him the cause of his appearing so dejected—I am confident of the time, from letters which I have at home.</p>

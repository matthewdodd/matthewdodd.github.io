            . I keep a sale-shop, in Field-lane, Holborn. On the 18th of December the prisoner came and brought two coats, a waistcoat, a shirt, and a handkerchief; I asked whose they were - he said they belonged to a gentleman's servant; he asked so much under the value that I did not like to buy them - I said he must take me to the person; he took me to Clerkenwell, pointed down in a vault, and said there was the young man - I found no one there, and gave him in charge.</p>

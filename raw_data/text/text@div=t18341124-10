                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 33, Bishopsgate-street Within. The prisoner was in my service—I carry on the business of a butcher—on the 2nd of November, I had occasion to make some alteration in some boxes I have up stairs—I went up into the prisoner's bed-room, and looked into a linen chest—I there found some things between two fea<lb></lb>ther beds, which she slept on alone—they had been in a black leather trunk in the room next to her room—we call it the box-room—there was a gown skirt, petticoat, and some trifling articles—this induced me to ask her to let me see her box, in which I found some lawn, holland, nankeen, lace, and several other things—I missed some rings and lockets a day or two afterwards, and they were found concealed under some bricks in the cellar, in my presence—she had access to the cellar—the rings were taken from a glass drawer in my bed-room, and a key, which I saw found in her box, fitted that glass drawer—it was not the proper key, but it would open it.</p>

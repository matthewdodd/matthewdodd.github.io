            . I am a watchman. I was standing nearly at the top of Swan-yard, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner come hastily through the posts, from Swan-yard, into White Hart-yard. I heard the cry of Stop thief immediately, and supposing him to be the thief, I ran across to take him, but he passed me. The road being up from one end to the other, he stumbled, and I secured him. Mr. Kipling immediately came up and said he was the man. Nobody was between him and the prosecutor.</p>

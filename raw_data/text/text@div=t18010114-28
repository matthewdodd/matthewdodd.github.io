             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Portsoken ward, Aldgate; I saw the two prisoners look into Mr. Buttenshaw's shop, on the 6th of January, between six and seven in the evening; I saw them advance to the window, where there was a quantity of stockings exposed for sale, they kept pointing at the stockings as if there was a particular pair that would suit them; then I saw the two prisoners go into the shop, I saw the prisoner Kelly point at some stockings for Mrs. Buttenshaw to take out of the window; in the intrim, I saw Mrs. Keef pull at some shawls upon the counter, but they would not come, which gave me a suspicion that they meant to rob the shop; then the man came out a second time to point at some stockings in the window, and he went in again, and Mrs. Buttenshaw was reaching the stockings; I saw Keef take the bombazet off the counter, she put it either under her cloak, or between her legs, or somewhere; she came out with it; I desired her to deliver up the property that she had got, and she said she had none at all; I then took her into the shop, and when I came to the shop door, she dropped it, and I took it up and gave it to Mrs. Buttenshaw; I took them to the watch-house, and one shilling and two or three halfpence were found upon them; Kelly had the shilling, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Buttenshaw.) Where was this bombazet when these people came in? - A. Upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Kelly's defence. I was going through the Minories, I stopped at this window to look at the stockings, and this woman asked me how much those stockings were, I said, three shillings and sixpence, they were marked, and then this woman went in, and asked to look at a pair of stockings, but not the stockings that I had been looking at; I went into the shop, and asked to look at a pair of stockings, and as soon as I went in, the woman went out, and the patrol came back with her.</p>
               <p>Keef's defence. I was looking at this window, I asked this man to tell me the price of a pair of stockings in the window, I went in and they did not suit me; I then asked for some flannel, I came out and the patrol stopped me, and brought me back, and said I had got something; I know nothing at all about it, they picked it up on the ground, and said I had dropped it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Buttenshaw.) Did the woman ask you for any flannel? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Kelly called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

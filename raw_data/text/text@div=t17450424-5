             . I lost a silver tankard the 13th of March, and on the 14th it was brought to my house . I don't know that the Prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sellon . I keep a goldsmith's shop in the Borough of Southwark. On the 14th of March last, the Prisoner came to buy a pair of silver buckles , and asked me, if I would take silver in exchange , and pulled out this piece of a tankard [ The body of the tankard was produced without lid or bottom. ] This appearing so very suspicious, I asked him his name, where he lived, and how he came by it ; he said, he bought it of a man for two guinea and an half. I sent for a constable, and carried him before Justice Lacey, who committed him for further examination, because he would not confess any thing: but when he was in goal, he sent to his brother and he brought Mrs. Burgess, and she owned the tankard.</p>

I saw a tankard there wrote round the bottom as this is: when I came back, I searched the Prisoner, and found in his pocket the bottom of a tankard wrapped up in his handkerchief, which appeared to be cut out. I asked him whether he cut it out himself; he said yes, and that he cut it out of this tankard , and he said he took it out of Mrs. Burgess's house, where he lodged.</p>

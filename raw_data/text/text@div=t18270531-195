               <p>THOMAS ALLEN. On the 14th of April, at a quarter to five o'clock, I was passing <placeName id="t18270531-195-crimeloc1038">Sparrow-corner, Tower-hill</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This was in Rosemary-lane? A. Yes. The prisoner's face was very familiar to me; several persons were there - nobody but them were near enough to me to take it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near to where your watch was taken did the prisoner fall? A. About three yards.</p>

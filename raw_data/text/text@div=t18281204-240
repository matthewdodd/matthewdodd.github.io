Sir, I implore, that after this confession you will deal as leniant with us as possable, and not let the law take its course; that we are deserving of yours and the laws correction we well know, but we allso know that you cannot be so unfeeling has to deprive a fellow creature of liberty and reputation, for commiting a crime when urged to it by hungar and distress; under all curcumstances, we we will rely upon your humanity, and throw ourselves entirely upon your mercy -We remain, your verry humble servants, &amp;c, G.

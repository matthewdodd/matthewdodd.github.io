I stopped eight bagatelle-balls, at Mr. Williams's, pawnbroker, Smith-street, Westminster—since then I have been in search of the prisoner, I took him into custody on 19th Feb., and told him it was for pledging some bagatelle-balls—he said they were given him by a friend to pledge, and he had been to Ireland since that time.</p>

These balls are mine—they have been originally billiard-balls—I can swear to this one with a black mark in it—regular bagatelle-balls have not that mark—I had them reduced in size, but the mark goes all through—there is also a mark on the black ball where it is worn—on 31st Oct. the prisoner slept at my house—I let him out in the morning, for the train, at half-past five—about nine I missed the balls from the bagatelle table—any person in the house could get to the bagatelle room, but the prisoner was the only stranger there that night.</p>

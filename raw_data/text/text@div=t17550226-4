I asked him where he was going with that bundle? He said a gentleman gave him three-pence to fetch them. I secured him, and took him before justice Fielding, who committed him; the stockings were in my shop when I went out:</p>

               <p>I had been at Abchurch-lane to see for work; coming back, a man stood near the prosecutor's shop, and said, my lad, will you earn threepence? I said, in doing what? He pointed to that bundle, and said, to take that bundle and follow him. I went in and took it, and the prosecutor said it was his property.</p>

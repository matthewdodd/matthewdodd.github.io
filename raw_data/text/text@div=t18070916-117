On Saturday, the 11th of July, I received two checks on account of my employer on the bankers. I gave them to the prisoner, one was a draft on the house of Ferrol and Co. for 42 l. 16 s. 6 d. the other on Robarts and Co. for 25 l. I desired him to go to the banking houses and receive the money, and return with it to me. He took the drafts and went, and I saw no more of him till Sunday the 19th of July, then I saw him with the officer at Oxford; the officer who took him gave me to the amount of 32 l. 6 s. On my return to town I discovered that he had a watch, which I took form him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a watch before. - A. No, I do not know that he had. I have the drafts that I gave him; these are them.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Union Street, Middlesex Hospital. On the 11th of July, near dusk, me and another young woman stood at the door; she asked him if he would walk in, he came into her apartment; he sent her servant out with a shilling to get something to drink. After that he went into my apartment; he gave me a 20 l. note for myself, he sent it out by my servant to get it changed, she brought in the change, I told her to give them to the gentleman, he told her to give them to me, and told me to lock them up, that I might not lose them; he staid with me that evening. On Sunday morning he and I, and a Miss Row, rid in a one horse chaise to Brentford; he staid with me that evening when he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you set off for Oxford. - A. On the Tuesday morning. My friends live there. We went in a one horse chaise; we got to Oxford on the Wednesday, he was taken on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid your expences to Oxford. - A. The prisoner. The officer asked me if I had any property, I said yes, it was at my mother's house, and I would fetch it. I went to my mother, she lives at Oxford, I fetched him 15 l. I told him I had laid out 5 l. I told the officer I did not know it was not his own money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am friendless: every thing is clear against me.</p>

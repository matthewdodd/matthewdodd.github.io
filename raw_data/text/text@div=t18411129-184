About eight o'clock in the evening of the 15th of No<lb></lb>vember I was standing at the corner of Wellington-street, Strand—a friend asked me if I had lost any thing—I looked, and missed my handkerchief, which I had in my hand about a quarter of an hour before, in St. Paul's Church-yard—the policeman showed it to me in about three-quarters of an hour.</p>

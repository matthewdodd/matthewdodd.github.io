             sworn. Mr. Warren came into my shop to buy a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live near Mr. Hartwell. - A. Yes, the next door; Mr. Warren called Mr. Blackman into my shop as he was going by, Mr. Blackman said there are two thieves going by, with that I looked out of the door, I saw two lads going by with a dial under their arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the dial under his arm. - A. I cannot say, it was under the arm of one of them, I was so terrified I cannot say, I hallooed out, and these two gentlemen went out and they were taken.</p>

             sworn. I was coming by with a prisoner at the same time Mr. Warren was in at Mrs. Molloy's, Warren called to me, I stepped into Molloy's shop to speak to Warren, mean while Foley and Aris came by, I knew them, I drew back and secreted myself in Mrs. Molloy's shop, I said Mrs. Molloy, there are two thieves, they are going to rob you, step out, you will see what they are about; they went into the next door, and took the time piece out of the shop; Mrs. Molloy says, come out, they have got it. Warren and I followed them down the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210022"></xptr>Hampshire Hog yard, and I believe it was Aris, the smallest prisoner, that flung away the pedestal; I picked it up, Warren pursued and overtook Foley, and apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the clock. - A. I cannot say; when Warren laid hold of Foley it was in a narrow passage, I could not get by them; Aris ran away and got off; they were both in company together.</p>
               <p>JOHN WARREN sworn. Q. You are an officer. A. I am; on the 25th of April I went to Mrs. Molloy's house to buy a pair of shoes, and whilst I was fitting them on I saw Mr. Blackman over the way, I called to him, he came into Mrs. Molloy's, he had not been in the house two minutes before he saw the two prisoners at the bar looking in Mrs. Molloy's window, Blackman says there is two thieves, take care Mrs. Molloy else you will be robbed, she immediately went out of doors and looked about, she had not been out half a minute before she cried out they had got it; I immediately ran out of the house and followed both of the prisoners into the Hampshire Hog yard, I think it was Aris that threw away the pedestal, I did not stop to pick it up, I pursued them and took Foley in the little court.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hands. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the time piece nobody knows. A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARTWELL sworn. I only know that this is my property; this is the pedestal of the time piece, I lost the time piece and the pedestal altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the time piece. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it. - A. On the morning of the 25th of April, before I went to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that to be a part of the time piece you left in your shop when you went out. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that worth. - A. The pedestal is not worth any thing; I suppose the time piece and that altogether was worth about ten or twelve shillings; I am sure the pedestal is mine.</p>

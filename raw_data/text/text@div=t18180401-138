On the 25th of February my servants had been thrashing wheat - They left work at five o'clock, and left about ten bushels in the barn uncleaned.

               <p>JOHN IVES. I am Mr. Rutter's servant. On the 25th of February I left the barn safe at five o'clock. I traced the wheat, by the chaff, over into Mr. Trotter's field, to a dunghill, and there found a sack of wheat buried in the dung. I left it there, and watched with Arslett, to see who would come for it. About half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, Holden, come to the dunghill, and take the sack out - I came up and took him with it.</p>

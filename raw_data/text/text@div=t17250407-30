I had seen her several times before; and the last time I was with her, she made me promise to call upon her when I came that Way; and so I was willing to be as good as my Word. When I came in, she was in Company with two or three more Women; but they went away. I felt her Hand about my Breeches, and ask'd if she had a mind to pick my Pocket. We drank Brandy; and I went away at Five o'Clock. I did not miss my Watch till I came to Smithfield; and then I went back and demanded it. She deny'd it, began to call me Names, and was for pushing me out of Doors. I consider'd that it grew late, and that I had eight Miles home to Whetstone; and so I left her for that time. I came again next Saturday, and threatned to fetch a Constable and send her to Newgate; and then she told me, if I'd give her a Guinea, she'd help me to it again; But I would not comply to that, tho' I could not tell what Course to take; for I did not care to tell any body, for fear my Wife should hear of it. So I went home and consider'd of it, and came again next Saturday, and then she took me to the Eagle and Child, where

            , her pretended Husband, and two or three more Women, came to her; and then she told me that the Watch was in Pawn for a Guinea; and except I would give that, I should never have it. So I was forced to treat 'em, and go without my Watch too, which I was not very well pleas'd withall. Whereupon, I began to think with myself, This wicked Jade puts upon me, because she sees that I am a Man in Tears, and don't much care to have the thing known; but that shan't save her, for I'll tell my Wife of it myself. So home I goes, and tells her that I had committed a great Fault, which I was very sorry for, but I would make her Amends for time to come; and then I let her know the whole Concern. Mrs. Odell thus depos'd; I went with my Husband to the Prisoner, and demanded his Watch. The Prisoner told me it was at Pawn; and if I'd give a Guinea to redeem it, I should have it; but otherwise, not. Upon this Confession, and Refusal, I sent for a Constable, and gave him Charge of her.

We open'd the Paper, and found the Prosecutor's Watch. <rs id="t17250407-30-verdict171" type="verdictDescription">

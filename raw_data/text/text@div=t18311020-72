            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Goswell-street. On the 7th of October I was in Cheapside - a crowd collected round a horse; Mr. Beachcroft came past on the pavement, between Honey-lane market and Milk-street -I saw the prisoners go round the crowd and try several people's pockets; Mr. Beachcroft came by - they followed him; one of them took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and gave it to Preston - I am quite certain of them both; Preston put it under his coat - Walker went back and Preston turned round the crowd; I sent Day, who was with me, to tell Mr. Beachcroft he had lost his handkerchief - I immediately took hold of Preston, and took the handkerchief from under his coat; I asked, what he took it for - he said, "It is my own, I bought it;" I told him I had seen it taken from a gentleman's pocket, and given to him - he became very obstreperous, tried to get away, and said he would not go; Day returned, and I got him to the corner of King-street - he there struck me on the mouth, put his feet behind me, and tripped me up; I still held him, and he was secured - nobody would assist me, in fact, they tried to get him from me, but I got him to Guildhall - I came back, and in King-street saw Walker; I said he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200033"></xptr>the other man, and must go as well - he said he did not knew what I meant, and would not go, but at last he went with me; the handkerchief was advertised, and on the Monday the prosecutor claimed it - I could not give him information of it, as he went on.</p>

            . I am porter to a carrier. I was with Toole; a mob had gathered - the prisoners were following several gentlemen, walking up and down; at last Mr. Beachcroft passed - they followed him up; I saw Walker put his hand into Mr. Beachcroft's pocket, take the handkerchief out, put it behind him, and give it to Preston -Toole told me to inform the gentleman; I went through the mob and spoke to one gentleman, but could not find the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Walker. You said at Guildhall that you went after the gentleman, and he said he had lost a handkerchief, but would not take further trouble about it, Witness. I spoke to a gentleman who had lost one, but that was not the prosecutor.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Preston's Defence. There was a great crowd - Toole came, laid hold of me, and said I had stolen a handkerchief; I said, "Why have you not laid hold of the gentleman as well as me? I am willing to go back to the gentleman" - he said I must go with him; I asked for his authority - he said he should not show it; he tore my shirt, and threw me down.</p>

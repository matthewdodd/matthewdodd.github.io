                  </hi> I am a constable of the London Docks. I received information on 26th Feb., and went to the east-quay tobacco warehouse, the side of which forms the boundary wall of the dock, and one side of Broad-street—the place Dyke describes is near the boundary wall—I went on to the roof, and noticed one of the sashes of the lantern-light, next to Broad-street, open—I had a light—I saw marks of a person having come out of that window, and there were finger marks on the slates leading form the window to the gutter—there was a timber partition in that warehouse—any person could have got from the warehouse to the lantern-light by means of the tobacco hogsheads—they had the bond mark, and were under the Queen's lock, being in the Custom's possession—there were 16,000 hogsheads there—two of them had been broken open in No. 1 division, about thirty yards from the light, which was fastened with a cord inside—a person in the warehouse could have opened it by untying the cord—it had been untied—on a pile of hogsheads immediately under the light, I found part of a trowsere brace, a brace button, a piece of soda biscuit, and a rope long enough to reach from the roof to the hogsheads and haul up a package—I found on the Monday another hogshead had been opened—about 90lbs. of tobacco had been taken from one, and from the three hogsheads about 4cwt.—I after wards saw the prisoner in charge—I asked his name—he said, "James Ryan"—I asked why he was in the warehouse—he said he came to sleep—no person had a right to be there—he was not known as a labourer there—I examined him in the warehouse—he wore braces corresponding with this piece; there was a button off the front of his trowsers, the other buttons corresponded with this—I asked where he got the soda biscuits which were in his waistcoat pocket—he said they were ill the pocket when he put it on the night before—he did not say how he came to put on other colthes—he showed me a hole, through which he said he got into the warehouse, near which were some boxes of soda biscuits—one of them had been broken open and was deficient—the sample of tobacco found agrees with that in the hogsheads—I said to the prisoner, "There was a robbery committed in the warehouse this day fortnight, and you ware seen coming out of the warehouse on the Monday morning, as soon as it was opened, you were spoken to, and asked if you worked there, and you said you did"—he made no answer—in going to the east quay to get his own clothes which he had left there, I said to him, "You are know here;</p>

               <p>Loe. No, my lord; I ask'd him if Mr. Richardson had been here for the money; he said no: on Sunday morning I came down stairs,

             was gone to his guardian at Camberwell, I saw the drawer open, I turn'd the key and put it in my pocket, and did not look in the drawer; in the afternoon, when I was gone out, the Prisoner went out and took his cloaths with him, he did not come in at supper; I ask'd the maid what he had took, she said nothing but a bundle of his linen; at length my apprentice

             came in, I gave him the key, he ran and opened the drawer, and there was a 36 shilling piece and half a guinea and no more: Richard said, he hoped I had a better opinion of him than to think he took it. I went to the Prisoner's mother's, she went with me to a house in Shoreditch, the Pyde-horse, there was the Prisoner; I ask'd him for my money; he told me he had it not; thus he persisted till about one or two o'clock in the morning: I sent for an officer and strip'd him, and found to the amount of 17 l. 6 s. with the half-guinea and 36 s. piece, a watch and a pistol; the money found upon him was 14 l. 19 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this is your watch?</p>
               <p>Loe. I never minded the maker's name, but I know it by the size and the crack in the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the pistol?</p>
               <p>Loe. That I know to be mine, I have had it a considerable time.</p>

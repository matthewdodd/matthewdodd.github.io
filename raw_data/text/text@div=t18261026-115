I saw all these articles safe in the larder on the 23d of September, at a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, and about eight o'clock one of the maids told me the larder was robbed; I went there and missed every thing - I went to the office and saw the articles, which appeared to me to be the same - I saw no difference in their appearance, except that the cheese was broken into pieces.</p>

On the morning of Sunday, the 24th of September, at a quarter-past five o'clock, I was in Upper Berkley-street, I heard the rattles spring; I ran and met the prisoner, whom I stopped; there was no one following him then, but I saw a person picking up the articles, which he had dropped; he asked me what I wanted with him; I said when he came back to the place where he had dropped the bag, he would know - he said if we had been as much in want as he had, we should have done the same.</p>

On the morning of the 24th of September I saw the prisoner in Sovereign-street, about three hundred yards from Bryanston-square, with a bag on his shoulder; I arose up from the step of a door - the prisoner turned round, and spoke, but I could not see any one there but him; I went after him - he saw me, and made the best haste he could; I desired him to stop; he asked what for; I said I wanted to know what he had got in his bag - he then dropped the bag, and ran away - I sprung the rattle, and took up the bag; it contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

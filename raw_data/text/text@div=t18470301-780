                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper at the City Arms. On the 15th of Feb. I heard of the fight, went into the yard, and saw Fullerton lying down—Whorewood was standing by him upright—somebody helped Fullerton up—he ran towards Whorewood and struck him, and Whorewood knocked him down again—Andrews held her foot up, and said she would kick him, but I do not know whether she did or not—there were persons about—one of them took Fullarton to the water, and washed his face—I heard him say</p>

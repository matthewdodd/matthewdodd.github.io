               <p>DAVID NESBITT sworn. - I am serjeant in the Coldstream regiment of guards; I came to the Tower gate about five o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoner partly asleep in one of the sentry boxes, with a sack of fowls by him; I asked him what he had got in that bag, upon which he informed me, poultry; he asked me if I would have one for my dinner? I told him, no; I had some suspicion of him, and instantly sent him prisoner into the guard-room; after he was confined in the guard-room, it was judged necessary to examine the bag; I opened the bag, and there were six fowls, six ducks, five geese, and one cock; we sent to the place where he was last quartered, and there we learned that they belonged to Mr. Allanson.</p>

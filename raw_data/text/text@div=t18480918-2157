I was at Camden-station gate—I know Edwards very well—I saw him come out of the gate that night, about a quarter or twenty minutes past ten o'clock—that is near the Railway bridge, and about two hundred yards from Mr. Mills's office—I asked if he was going to supper—he said, "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London and North-Western Railway. On 17th Aug. I found Norman in the kitchen of 3 house in Augusta-street, which leads out of the Hampstead-road—I said, "Tow, I suppose you know what I want you for?"—he said, "Yes"—I brought him</p>

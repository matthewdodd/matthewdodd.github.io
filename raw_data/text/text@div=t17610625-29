               <p>Q. How came you to find it upon him?</p>
               <p>Lucas. His pocket stood out bigger than ordinary; then I said, John, you have something in your pocket that does not belong to you: he said he had nothing but his tobacco-box; I bid him pull it out, he did, and said he had nothing else. I put my hand into his pocket, and found a quantity of tea loose in his pocket; then I got Mr. Harrison to turn out his pocket, and I smelt at it, and said it was our 16 shillings tea. I went to that cannister, and by it I found some tea spilt, which is very seldom the case: then he owned it came out of that cannister. I had a seal put on it immediately, and took him before my Lord-mayor, and he was sent to the Compter. I got a search-warrant, and went to his house, and in a drawer I found about thirty different articles, all in the grocery way. He confessed to the other things also, and owned the same before my Lord Mayor, and offered to go for a soldier, to serve the India company. [The tea produced in Court.]</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a chandler's-shop in Devonshire-road, Chiswick. On 24th Sept. I fastened up my house—the parlour window was fastened with a catch—it is above a garden at the back of my house—it had been mended with putty, the removal of which would enable a person to open the catch—I found it open next morning, about half-past six, and I missed from my till about thirty-rive shillings—there were half-crowns, and about five shillings worth of pence and halfpence—a ladder was put against the back fence, which was not its place—I saw the policeman compare some boots with some marks in the mould—they were put down by the side of the marks and made the same marks exactly—a piece of candle was thrown in the garden amongst some shrubs.</p>

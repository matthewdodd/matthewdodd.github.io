                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of 6 Great Tower-street. On Sunday evening, 20th June, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and turned into Primrose-street—a female followed me, caught hold of my arm, and walked alongside of me—she asked me where I was going, and asked me to go with her—I refused to do so, and told her to go about her business; and as I was walking along with her, the prisoner came behind me, caught hold of my throat, and held me tight—while he was holding me, the woman went back to Bishopsgate-street—I had not seen the prisoner then—I felt he had got hold of me, and another one came behind him, and plucked at my guard that was attached to my watch, and fastened through a button-hole—he carried part of the guard away—finding what they were after, I put my hand to secure my watch—the other man kept rifling me about—the prisoner held me fast by the neck till I got into the middle of the street—he then knocked my hat off, and left hold of me—the man who snatched at my watch was then running off—the prisoner saw him leave me; he then let go and followed him, and as soon as I got my breath I hallooed "Murder!" as load as I could, and kept alongside of him till he was in custody—he ran down Primrose-street into Bishopsgate-street, and the policeman met him just round the corner—I do not know what had become of the female—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man, I never lost sight of him—at the time he was holding me I could not speak—I had never seen him or the other man before, that I am aware of—about half my chain was taken away—there was no violence used, except his holding me; he did not strike me at all—the chain would cost 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to replace—I had a gold watch in my pocket.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185207050037"></xptr>
               <p>2, I had been walking about with friends—one of their names is White-house—I merely met him in the street and passed him, that was all—I walked a few steps with him—I turned up Primrose-street to ease myself—I was going towards home before I turned up there—I went between thirty and forty yards up Primrose-street—I did not do what I wanted to do, because the young woman came alongside of me, and did not leave me till the prisoner got hold of me—I walked with the female about thirty yards, and then some one came behind me, hut I did not see it was the prisoner till he let go of me—I never saw the woman after the prisoner caught hold of me—I recovered my breath, and hallooed "Murder!" directly the roan ran away—I was not long recovering ray breath—I cannot say which way the other man went; I kept sight of the prisoner—they both ran towards Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner went to the right—I should not know the other man again, or the woman—I never lost sight of the prisoner—I had had a glass or two of bitter ale, and a small glass of gin-and-water; I had that in Fleet-street, at a public-house—I was in two public-houses; the other was in East-cheap—I had not taken anything at ray friend's—it was Saturday night, and a busy night, and I was out more on business than anything—I wanted a walk—I was not incapable of taking care of myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-'policeman</hi> 623). On Sunday morning, 20th June, I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street—about 2 o'clock I heard cries of "Murder!" and shortly after I saw the prisoner running, closely pursued by the pro<lb></lb>secutor—he was not above four or five yards from him—I ran and took the prisoner into custody; the prosecutor came up immediately, I may say as soon as myself—he said, "That is the man that seized me by the neck, and held me while another man attempted to take ray watch"—the prisoner said, "I think you are quite mistaken"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on his person 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two small keys—the prosecutor was not quite sober, but he had all his faculties about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would a person coming into Bishopsgate-street out of Primrose-street have found you on the right or left hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the right; I had not been there above two or three minutes, before I heard the cries of "Murder!"—I did not observe any one running out of Primrose-street except the prisoner and prosecutor—there were others running after them in Bishopsgate-street—I could see that the prosecutor had been drinking; I think he said something about not being so drunk as anybody might imagine, that he knew what he was about—some prostitutes came up about a minute or two after I had got the prisoner in custody; I noticed one woman in particular, they told me she was a prostitute, and that she had been fre<lb></lb>quently convicted of felony—the women did not say there were some men and women running across Bishopsgate-street, and that the prisoner was not the party—they said there were some people running down Shoreditch—they did not say the prisoner was not the party—I paid no attention to what they said—I had got the prisoner in custody then—I had previously seen the prisoner in their company on several occasions—the prisoner turned to the right upon coming out of Primrose-street—the prosecutor was two or three paces after him, close behind him—there were no persons near them.</p>

               <p>I have seen them frequently as his companions, in public-houses and out—they are his regular companions and associates; I have seen them together perhaps nine or ten times a week—I do not recollect having seen them together that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Christian—we live at Bayswater. About a quarter before ten o'clock on the evening of the 26th of June, I had come from Gravesend by the steamer, and on coining up the steps of the wharf, I felt a tug at my gown—I did not know what it was—I thought it was one of my own children—when I got to the top of the stairs, the policeman touched me, and told me a man had picked my pocket—he took me to the station, and asked me to search my pocket—I had had a half-sovereign and some silver in my pocket, and I missed it.</p>

I came from Gravesend as a passenger that night—I saw the prisoner touch Mrs. Christian outside her dress—that induced me to follow him—there is a flight of steps there, and I saw him lift Mrs. Christian's dress up, and put his hand into her pocket—I then took him, and found a half-sovereign, four shillings, two sixpences, and one halfpenny in his hand.</p>

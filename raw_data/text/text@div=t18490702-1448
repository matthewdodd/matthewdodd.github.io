                  </hi>. I am clerk to George Leese, a shipbroker, of Crutched—friars. On 16th April, between twelve and one in the day, the prisoner came—I had never seen him before—he said, "I am Captain Brandt, of the <hi rend="italic">Russia</hi>;" that she was a <hi rend="italic">bran</hi> new vessel belonging to Russia; that he had left her a short distance below Gravesend; that he had on previous occasions employed Messrs. Sach, Bremer, and Co.; also Messrs. Capperdike and Schleudau, but was dissatisfied with the manner in which they transacted his business, and therefore this time intended to employ Mr. Leese as his broker, and that he was not anxious to report his vessel that day; indeed he could I not, as he had not got the certificate with him; that his object in leaving the ship below Gravesend was that he would first come to London and place his papers in our hands; that he was going to Bristol to visit a young lady there, to whom he was on the point of being married; and he would return next day about twelve o'clock to report his vessel—he produced bills of lading, and a manifest of the cargo on board—he produced this bill of lading, and parti<lb></lb>cularly drew my attention to an indorsement on it in German—I believe this to be a correct translation—(<hi rend="italic">this was signed C. Brandt, acknowledging the receipt of</hi> 1200 <hi rend="italic">quarters of wheat, dated</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st Feb.</hi>, 1849, <hi rend="italic">and was endorsed, "Should the captain on arrival find no order, he is bound to sell the wheat for my account at the best possible price, for which he is to receive</hi> 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">per cent, commission and freight, and remit me the proceeds, 5s. per quarter. W. Cruzinski."</hi>)—this is the manifest he handed me, containing the whole of the cargo—he said perhaps there might be letters for him at Messrs. Sach, Bremer, and Co.'s, and in my presence wrote an order requesting them to deliver to the bearer any letters they might have for him—I sent one of our young men with it, and he brought back two letters, which the prisoner read, and put into his pocket—he asked whether we could recommend him to a respectable man to copper his vessel—we told him we could—he requested our advice as to which dock he should put her into on her coming up, which he expected would be the day following—the West India and Commercial Docks were named, but nothing was set—tied—he expressed his intention to start for Bristol as soon as possible to see the lady, and asked when the next train would go—we sent for "Bradshaw's Guide," and found it would be two o'clock—he then said, "J want a little money"—I asked how much he would require—he said 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we are in the habit of making advances to captains—I gave him twenty-five sovereigns, the</p>

               <p>bills of lading and manifest remaining with me, I should not have thought of parting with them—I wrote this receipt, and he signed it, and told me to debit his account with the "Bradsbaw's Guide"—he shook hands with me and said "God bless you"—I never saw him again till he was in custody, about the 15th or 16th of May—I have searched the official list at the Custom House, and find no such vessel as the <hi rend="italic">Russia</hi> was at Gravesend during the whole of April.</p>

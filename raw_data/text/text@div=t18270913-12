               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You prepare yours by a particular process? A. We believe so - I do not know how others prepare it, but we always know our own when we see it in the market with other lots; we prepare all ours by the same mode - it differs principally in two respects - there is a better state of colour on it, a better face, and it is lighter in hand, as we call it - it has a different feel. I think I could tell one lot of our preparation from another, but not by candle light - by referring to my book I could see what quality was prepared at one time from another. I saw this cochineal in its first state, and followed it through all its different processes, and know it to have been prepared at a particular time, for a particular market, and from particular samples; the preparation is the same, but the qualities selected are different in the first instance.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where was this prepared for? A. For Chinn. I am certain that this was prepared only a few days previous to the 28th of July.</p>

            . I am a boot-closer, and know Chick - he is a shoemaker. On the evenings of the 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th of July, I was at his house, and part of the day time. I went there to ask him to recommend me to work. I had come from Portsmouth, and had seen him before - I slept in his house all those nights, in the next room to him; nobody could come out of his room without going through the one I was in, nor without disturbing me - I generally got there about half-past nine or ten o'clock, and I, in a measure, spent an hour or two with him every evening; he generally got up at six o'clock in the morning - he never left the house on those nights, or I must have heard him - he had more work than common at this time, and I assisted him; I was there occasionally for three weeks after, or nearly four weeks, going to assist him; I was there on the Wednesday before he was taken; and towards the close of the evening I saw a man bring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130021"></xptr>a bag - it was Wednesday, to the best of my remembrance - it might be about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man say any thing? A. The only words I heard him mention was, "Let this remain here for a few minutes;" he might have said more, but I am rather hard of hearing - he might have said the number of minutes - the bag was left in the outer room. I went away about half-past seven o'clock - he had not come for it then - I never saw him before. I did not see the bag afterwards; it appeared to be made of strong brown linen, which I call Russia sheeting.</p>

               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where do you live? A. In Bell-alley, Goswell-street. I had no residence when I slept at Chick's - I had just come to town; the rooms are very small, and only a thin partition between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there two beds? A. Why, it cannot be called a bed - it was a make-shift, to save me from a lodging - he must pass very lightly through my room not to awake me - I am very wakeful - a person might perhaps go through the room without his shoes. Chick wished the man to take the bag away - he did not open it, nor ask what it was, nor did I. Nobody could go out and come in again without my hearing them.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. I thought you said your hearing was bad? A. Sometimes it is. I lodge in Bell-alley, on the first floor. I left Chick's house at eight o'clock on Sunday morning, and returned about half-past six or seven o'clock- I was absent all day; I think I can say I did not return later than seven; I keep no watch, and there is no clock, but I know the people were not out of church.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of what church? A. Out of the churches which I passed; I went up Windmill-street, and passed the Tabernacle; the people were in there - I suppose that is over about eight o'clock, but I cannot say when. I will swear I got to Chick's before eight, for after I got there I heard the people passing by, say it was eight; I was then indoors. The footpath is close to the door; I heard the parents call their children in, who were playing there, and say it was gone eight. I was talking to Chick and his wife at the time. I went to bed on Saturday about eleven o'clock - the bag was left at his house on a Wednesday, about five weeks ago - I think it was about the 8th of August - I am confident it was Wednesday; I was not there when the officers came - whether they look the same bag away I cannot say; it was left by a stout man in a jacket, but what his jacket was made of I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he wear a cocked hat, or a round one? A. Oh, it was not a cocked hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a good round hat, or a shabby one? A. That I cannot answer - he was at the door so short a time I could not observe; he put it in, and went away after saying what he did. I cannot say whether his hat was shabby or not - I do not think it was very shabby; I cannot say what his hat was, whether it was new or old; to the best of my remembrance he had a hat on, but of what sort it was I do not know - he had the bag on his shoulder - I think it was large, but what the size was I cannot say - I should think it would hold about two bushels; I do not know what cochineal is; he left it between five and six o'clock - he put it just within the door; the prisoner said,"You must not leave that here," or words to that effect; he did not throw it out of doors after him - I did not run after the man; we did not go to inform a constable; Worship-street is about half a mile off. I was there about two hours and a half that day - I went to see about some work which he had promised me, but there was none - I staid, as I had nothing to do; I made no inquiry whether such property had been lost. The man did not run away that I know of - he went away; we did not call him back. I told the prisoner's father of this on the day he was committed from the Mansion-house, as I was there; I was not inside the office. I cannot say that the prisoner ever examined the bag. When I left the house it was on the same spot as the man left it; I have not seen it since.</p>

             re-examined. I cannot be certain whether the prisoner or his wife told me when it was left; the prisoner was present at the time - they were close together.</p>

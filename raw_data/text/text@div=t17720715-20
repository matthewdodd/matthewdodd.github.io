I was up first next morning; I found the back door open; there is no lock to it, there is a bolt withinside; I bolted it as soon as it was dark; there is a hole cut in the door about eight inches square, with bars to it, to let light into the cellar; I found one of the bars was loose; he might put that aside, and so put his hand in, and turn back the bolt; I never observed the bars were loose before. I got up about a quarter before four that morning; it was done after three-quarters after eleven, and before four in the morning. I saw the pork the day before that; there was about 30 lb. of it; some workmen told me, when I got up, that the prisoner was gone away heavy loaded.</p>

The prisoner lived in my service three weeks all but two days; she left my house on Sunday morning, the 9th of August, about half after six in the morning, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know, before hand, of her intention of going - A. She had been insolent some days before, and on the Friday, I told her she should go when her month was up. I did not know of her going on that day. I missed her on the 9th of August, about half past seven; and about 11 o'clock the same day, I missed a ten pound note, and I think three one pound notes, from the cabinet in the parlour, out of my pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your pocket-book gone, or only the notes - A. Only the notes; the cabinet was usually kept locked; I had unlocked it two or three times in the morning, before I missed it. After I missed the notes, I saw some little splinters; then I saw that the lock had been forced, and shoved back again. I went for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards take the prisoner - A. I did. I found her on the top of the coach at Aldgate; she was going into the country, I told her that she must come down. She delivered up to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18120916-26-person285">Jackson</persName>
             the two broaches and the ring. I asked her for the notes; she delivered me a one pound note; she said she had not got the ten pound note; she had not taken the ten pound note, it was a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any five pound note in your pocketbook - A. No. I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen that property - A.Between four and six o'clock on the Saturday. We got a coach and took her to Bow-street. I asked her how she came to do it; she said she did not know. She said she had laid out four pounds, and had got one-pound out of the five pound note, at Monmouth-street; she passed it for a five pound note. That person is not here.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160017"></xptr> The broach and ring were in the cabinet. I had not seen them for a week or ten days. I am not positive of seeing them in the course of the week.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, whether they were in the cabinet on the Saturday night, or whether they had been taken before, you cannot say - A. I cannot, and the great coat was certainly taken before the Saturday; she had a great coat, and this umbrella was with her on the coach. I had seen the umbrella on the Saturday night. I have got the broach and ring here, the ring is marked S. M. that is my wife's initials. I know the broach and ring to be my wife's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JACKSON. I was with Mr. Masson, I asked the prisoner about the broach and how she came to take them; she said she did not know; she said she got the place open with an old knife. She gave up to me the broach and the ring and a one pound note; she said she had not a ten pound note, it was a five, she gave it to a woman in Monmouth-street that she had bought some gowns of.</p>

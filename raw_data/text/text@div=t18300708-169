On the 22nd of June, about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock at night, my husband was gone to bed ill, and the prisoner came into the house with two more, one of whom, named McKenley, I knew, and that man was rather intoxicated; he asked me to draw a pot of beer - I said he had had plenty, and advised him to go home; he asked me to draw a pot for these young men - I said, "If I do, will you promise to drink it at the bar without going into the room;" they promised they would, and I drew it -McKenley then said, "Mrs. Cross, what do I owe you?" I said, "Never mind that to night, come in the morning, I do not want to be bindered;" he said, "I had rather pay when I have money" - I went to the slate, and said it was 6s. 3 1/2d; he pulled some money from his waistcoat pocket, and said that was not enough, then opened his pocket-book, and pulled out half a crown - as he was chinking the money at the bottom of his pocket-book I thought I heard a chinking at the bar; I turned round, and saw the prisoner as busy as he could be at the table in my private room, taking the money that lay on the table - he had got as much up in his hands as he possibly could; I caught hold of him, and said, "What are you doing here? what do you mean?" he said, "I want something to drink" - he had gone round the bar into the room; I called for assistance, wrenched his hand open, and held him till he was secured - I cannot say exactly how much money he had hold of, but there were six half-crowns, forty shillings, and a great many sixpences; he had taken them off a newspaper on the table.</p>

               <p>Sullivan's Defence. His coat was not wet at all - he took it off, and offered it for sale to another man, and then to me; I had not enough to purchase it, and he said if I would sell it he would stand something to drink.</p>
               <p>Corcoran's Defence. He put the coat on Sullivan's back, and he went out with it - I went in about ten minutes, and met Sullivan very much intoxicated.</p>

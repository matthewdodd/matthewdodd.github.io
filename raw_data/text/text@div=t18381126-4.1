               <p>I put down a fare at the Woolpack, Kingsland-road—the gentleman wanted change for a sovereign—he asked me to step into the house—I saw the prisoner coming by, and asked him to mind my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> while I went, and he did so—I said I would give him a penny—I was in the house ten minutes—I went out twice to see if my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was safe, and directly I came out the second time, the prisoner came to me, and said, "I cannot stop longer, I have got to go on an errand"—I said "Very well-come and bring me the whip, and I will give you the penny," which I did—I got change for sixpence, and gave him the penny—I followed him out about three minutes afterwards, and met a young man who asked me if I had lost any thing—I looked, and my great-coat, which I had left on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, was gone—the witness said, "Look down Thomas-street, and you will see him"—I looked, but I could not see him—I pursued him, and then saw another person had the coat—I do not know that the prisoner was following the man who had the coat—I saw him running down in the same direction with the other man who had the coat, and another person—the prisoner saw me, and then then all parted, and ran in different parts of the street.</p>

I am a carpenter, and live in Westmoreland-street, Hackney-road—on the afternoon of the 24th of October, I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of the Woolpack, handing the coat round to another person—there were three of them—it was a kind of surtout, or great-coat—it was similar to this one—the other two ran down Thomas-street—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was not two yards from the public-house—I looked into the public-house for the driver, and met him coming out—he went in pursuit of them, and I minded the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>.</p>

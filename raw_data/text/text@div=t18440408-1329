                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live in Newcastle-court, Strand. On the night of the 20th Feb., about half-past one o'clock I went over to No. 15, and saw the three prisoners there, Dutton and Davis were with them—I went and slept with Baker at that place—in the morning I saw he had a great deal of money—I did not see Bassett or Grant with any.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant</hi>). On Tuesday, the 20th Feb., I went to Mr. Lindsey's—I found the sky-light removed—in consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I went after the prisoners—I had seen them all three on Monday night, the 19th, about half-past ten o'clock, at the Riding-circus, Greenwich, about half a mile from the prosecutor's. On Tuesday evening, about eight, I went to the Lord Nelson, in Dock-street, they were not there then—I saw Mrs. Hogg, she showed me sixteen farthings, and among them a counterfeit shilling—she marked them—I afterwards received them from her—they have been produced. On the 26th I found Grant at the station, and said to him, "Well, John, I was pretty close to you yesterday, in Whitechapel, here you are"—he said he knew I was, and said he had been to my house to give himself up to me, and that he had nothing to do with the robbery—I had not said anything to him about the robbery—I had said, "I understand you were all down at Lewisham on Saturday"—he said, "Yes, I was"—he said they came down after the silver spoons that were hid in the Roe<lb></lb>buck tea-gardens—that Baker got them out and sold them for 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked what he had done with the notes—he said he never saw them—he had on a new cap and pair of shoes—he said Baker bought them for him in Rosemary-lane.</p>

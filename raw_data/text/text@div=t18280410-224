I lost a time-piece from my mantel-shelf, on the 14th of March; I was in my shop, and my daughter was serving a man some with Spanish juice - my daughter ran out, and the man said "She has run up Pye-street."

               <p>SUSAN FISHER. I am the prosecutor's daughter. On the 14th of March, I was in the shop, serving, and I saw the prisoner in the parlour; I went to ask him what he wanted, and I saw he had the time-piece in his hand - he ran out, and I pursued him; he gave the time-piece to another boy in Pye-street - they went up the street together, and I lost sight of them - I saw the prisoner in custody on the Friday night.</p>

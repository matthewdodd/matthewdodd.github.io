            : I went in a hackney-coach from the Strand about eight o'clock on the 6th of this month; we gave the coachman charge of a large box that was put into the boot; I saw it put in; we went to Newgate street, and staid there about half an hour: when we came out the coachman informed us the box was missing, the things in the coach were safe. About eleven o'clock the owner of the coach gave us intelligence that the things were at the rotation office in Whitechapel; I went there and saw the box and the things at the office. (The box and the contents produced and deposed to.) I packed up the box myself.</p>

            . I am a labouring man; I saw Craven bring the box that has been produced into Marlborough court, Petticoat-lane; about ten o'clock at night on Thursday the 6th of May; I saw him go into a house and up stairs with it; Benjamin and Abrahams were with him; one Gekee Boo keeps that house, he is a Jew. I went into the next entry and peeped through a crevice in the next house to see what was in this box, because I thought they did not come honestly by it; I saw the box on a chair, it was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see distinctly?</p>
               <p>Wilcox. Yes; I could see all the prisoners but one, he was sitting down; they were examining the things, there was a gown, a silk sack, and a gause apron I think it was; I went and fetched Simmons and Files and we went into the room; the things were then lying on the ground; and there was a man I believe buying of them; the prisoners were all in the room. and the man looking at them; we secured Craven and Benjamin, the other man got up the chimney; I told Simmons there was one up the Chimney, he looked, and pulled him down by the leg; then we carried them all to Whitechapel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177306260022"></xptr> watch-house; the next day I went before the justice and they were committed.</p>

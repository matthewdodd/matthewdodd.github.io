             I am a pawnbroker, and live in Fox-court; on Monday morning the 7th of July, the prisoner brought this watch to me; I asked him if it was his own property, and by his behaviour I had no reason to doubt it; I lent him two guineas upon it; after that I read the Advertiser, the advertisement mentioned a green ribbon, but this is a white one, every thing else answers; I immediately went with it to Justice Fielding, and told him of it; he asked me if I knew the man, or if I had ever dealt with him before; I said I had not, but I should know him again: he was taken, and I saw him before Justice Girdler, and knew him again (the watch produced in court and deposed to by prosecutor.) When he brought it, I asked him where he lived; he said in Gray's-inn-lane; I mentioned that to Sir John, and I was told he was taken at the Queen's-head, very near Gray's-inn-lane.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>This watch I bought of a man at the Castle in Castle-yard, Holbourn, on Sunday evening between six and seven o'clock, the 6th of July; he said he was an ostler, and his father or mother was sick, and he was going down into the country, and must dispose of it for want of money; there was an acquaintance of mine in the room, he looked at it, and asked what the man asked for it; he said three guineas and an half; I had two guineas and an half of my own, and a guinea I borrowed of a friend; he wanting his guinea, I pawned it on the Monday morning for two guineas, in order to pay him again; I have my father's maid here, to prove I was in bed in my own house, I keep a house at the back of Baldwin's-gardens.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mary Green. The prisoner is a <rs id="t17660903-42-deflabel229" type="occupation">shoemaker</rs>

I am his mother's servant, she lives in Church-entry, Harp alley, by Fleet-ditch; I carried a bundle of linen to his house on Sunday the sixth of July, at near eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in bed; I waited for his going with me; he went with me to his father's betwixt one and two, so that I saw him that day from eleven o'clock till after one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burch. What day was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Burch. He was taken up the 9th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. to Green. When did you hear of his being taken up?</p>
               <p>M. Green. I heard of his being taken up on the Thursday; I saw his mother in great grief before, and she would not tell me what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sent for to Justice Girdler's?</p>
               <p>M. Green. I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Justice that you saw him in bed the Sunday before at eleven o'clock?</p>
               <p>M. Green. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to the Justice's at all?</p>
               <p>M. Green. No answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the Justice's house?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - I can't tell the exact spot of ground where his house is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever at his house?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you tell me what you have now?</p>
               <p>M. Green. No answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Justice this story?</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you lived with the prisoner's mother?</p>
               <p>M. Green. About two years.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account did you go to the prisoner's house?</p>

               <p>M. Green. We washed the prisoner's cloaths, by reason the washerwoman was taken sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a married man?</p>

               <p>Court. Now you can answer these two or three last questions, the jury cannot but take notice of your behaviour on some former questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner dine that Sunday at his father's?</p>
               <p>M. Green. He did; I don't know but he drank tea, for I was out at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me again whether you know Justice Girdler?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - I cannot say whether I rightly know the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do, or do you not know him?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - I can't say I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever sent for to go to him?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - His mother did not send for me till she could not help it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she break it out to you?</p>
               <p>M. Green. I believe that was on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me, and tell me the truth, did you ever go to Justice Girdler?</p>
               <p>M. Green. I never did. - I went before a parcel of gentlemen, but I don't know whether it was Justice Girdler.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - It was on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. To what place?</p>

            . I am a writer to Mr. Parkinson, for attornies; I was in company with the prisoner that Sunday evening, I believe it was between seven and eight o'clock; I met him in Holbourn, and we went to drink together at the Castle in Castle-yard; we had been some time in the house, and there came in a young-fellow and sat down in the same box; after some time, he told us he had spent some money that he ought not to have done; he shewed me a letter, he was going to his father in the country, his father was sick; he shewed us a watch, and Mr. Angess looked at it, the young man offered it to sell; Mr. Angess asked him what the watch cost him; he said it cost five guineas, but he would sell it for four: Mr. Angess bid him three and a half; he put his hand in his pocket, and had but two guineas and a half; he asked me to lend him a guinea; I said I could, but I should want it again; I lent it him: he said there was some money owing him, and he would pay me the guinea on the Monday morning. I called upon him on the Monday morning, I believe about seven or eight o'clock; he was then in bed; he told me to call in about a couple of hours, and he would let me have the guinea; I called again about nine, or between nine and ten, and he gave me the guinea; he said he had pawned the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he pawned it?</p>
               <p>Murry. No, he did not. (A messenger is sent for Mr. Parkinson.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Roberts. I am a shoemaker; I have known the prisoner about five or six years, he worked at his business for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he has followed his business?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I know before he married he did; I do not know that he does since; I heard he married a woman with some substance.</p>

             came into court and was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Parkinson. A circumstance in the prisoner's defence made it necessary to send for you. Do you know

            , he says he writes for you?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. He does.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. I have known him going on two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in your service about the 6th of July last?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was he in a situation in life to lend a sum of money?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. I have no reason to believe he was; he might have money other ways for what I know; I allowed him a shilling a day, or four or five shillings on a Saturday night; that was a dead time of the year, when he was not in full employ; of ten or a dozen men, some I pay weekly, those that were economists; those that were not, had their money by the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you use to pay Mr. Murry?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. He used to spend his money; it struck me in that light to allow him his by the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any knowledge of his connections?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. I am totally unacquainted with his connections.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any substantial relations or friends?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. I can't recollect ever hearing him say he has any.</p>

            . I live next door to Henderson. The prisoner goes about buying old rags and iron; he came and asked if they had any thing to sell; they said some horse-hair; he took it out of the old tick, and put it into the new one; he weighed it, and called me in; he then took it on his shoulder, and went away with it; we thought he was going to put it into his bag, but he was gone.</p>

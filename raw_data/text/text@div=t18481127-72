The prisoner Bailey was introduced to me by a lady who came to lodge in my house, and was employed by me on loth, 16th, and 17th of Aug. at needlework—she used to work in the front attic—I had a writing-desk in that room—I last saw it safe on the loth Aug., when I dusted it—I had in it two silver watches, two silver pen-knives, two pair of silver scissors, a valuable pearl snuff-box, a smelling-bottle, and various other things, and 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—there were seven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes which I hid received from Major Angelo—Bailey had com<lb></lb>plained of the state of her health several times on the 16th and 17th—she said she had the toothache—on the 16th she said she had the <hi rend="italic">mumps</hi>—on the evening of the 16th I said it was dark, we could not see to work—she said she could, and I went down, and left her in the room alone—she came down in about ten minutes—she then went upstairs with a candle, to fetch her clothes, and said she would come again at seven o'clock in the morning—she came down, and her candle was out—she put it down in an agitated way, and ran upstairs very quickly, and shut the door after her—I did not see the bundle that she brought down—she was in the dark—I had no suspicion of her, but she went out in great haste—I missed my desk on Thursday the 17th—she had been to work that day—I had before told her that if I lost that desk I was ruined, for everything I possessed was in it, and on the Tuesday she asked me if I had paid my rent and taxes—I said, "No; I had been so ill, and it had been so wet I had not gone out."</p>

                  </hi>. I have lodged at Mrs. Norcroft's since June, 1847—in May last 1 received from Glyn's fifty 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, numbered consecutively from No. 15051 to 15100—I spent them as I required them—I did not take the numbers regularly till I came to 15073—I had spent the numbers before 13073 before June—I paid Mrs. Norcroft ten, the notes from No. 15075 to 15085.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potman, in York-street, next door to Mrs. Norcraft. I saw Hornett at the corner of the mews, with his hands on the post, in the after part of the day—he was looking up to the top of the house—after he had been looking a little time, a female looked out of the attic window—it was Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, I am not certain which—I think I heard of the robbery on Friday; it was in that week—I did not know which house Hornett was looking at, till I saw the female look out at 22—that female resembled the female prisoner—Hornett left where he was standing, went to the door, and placed his hand to the bell—I was not close enough to hear whether he pulled it—I was on the opposite side of the street—I cannot tell whether he pulled it or not—he stood back against the partition-board, as if he did not want to be seen—I did not stop to see whether he went in, as I was on my business.</p>

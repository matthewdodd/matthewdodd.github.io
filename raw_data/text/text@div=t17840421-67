               <p>I live opposite Mr. Hussey; on Saturday afternoon, about a quarter to five the two prisoners came up to his door, and looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270112"></xptr> at his goods, they were under the shop board, they pulled at them, but they were tied, and they went away, my man in the shop told me of it, I told him I saw it myself, and in about five minutes after they returned, the man in the jacket, Stevens, took out a knife and cut the string, they were gone some time, I am almost positive they went to buy a knife, I am a cutler by trade, and I am sure they went to buy a knife, for the knife found on them never had been used before; when they had cut the string, the milk woman came to the prosecutor's door, and prevented them carrying them off then; while they were gone I called out to my opposite neighbour, and told him to be upon his guard, for they would certainly be there again presently, as they had been once and tried the goods, and a second time, and cut the string, in about three or four minutes they passed the door, and came where the goods were; they went up close to the goods, and Stevens took the goods from the bulk, and put them into the apron of the other, and walked off with them; this I saw. The prosecutor and his servants went out when they heard the cry of stop thief, the prisoners run down a little alley, and I pursued Stevens, and Mr. Hussey pursued the other; in a few minutes the mob brought the other man to the door; I am sure to both the prisoners, positively so, I saw them four times in the whole.</p>

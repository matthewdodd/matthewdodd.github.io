               <p>John Laws. Near 11 at Night, going by the Lock and Key, in Smithfield, the Prisoner catc'd hold of me, and ask'd me to give her a D am I went with her to a Brandy-shop in <placeName id="t17340710-12-crimeloc44">Duck Lane</placeName>

I was a little Suspicious, and therefore felt several times for my Watch, and still found it in my Pocket. But by and by, she suddenly call'd the Woman of the House, and gave her the Money for the Brandy, at which I was a little Surpriz'd, and feeling again for my Watch, I miss'd it. I held fast hold of the Prisoner, and call'd for a Constable, upon which two Men, who were in the Foreroom, for she and I were in a private Room backwards, came and hussled me about, and one of them pretended to be a Constable, and order'd me to quit her, but however I would not let her go, but carry'd her to the Watch-house in Cloth-Fair, and the Constable committed us both to the Compter - Next Day she offer'd to return the Watch for 2 Guineas, and afterwards the Man at the Brandy-shop promis'd to help me to it for a Guinea and a Half. <rs id="t17340710-12-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>I am a butcher, and live near Sturminster Newton, in Dorsetshire. I am in the habit of sending up meat for sale to Mr. Dowding, of Newgate-market—on the 7th of May I sent two hampers of meat up—one was lost—it contained five sides of veal, 2 pigs with</p>

               <p>their heads on, and three calves' heads—I always place the cauls of the calves in the kidneys—I did so on that occasion—that is the usual course with butchers in our county—we always do it—the largest pig weighed ten stone four pounds, and the smallest seven stone four pounds—a cloth was wrapped round each side of veal, and a cloth round each pig—that would make seven cloths—I sent the hampers up by the Southampton railway—Dawes, the wagoner, contracts to bring them to London for me.</p>

Mr. Crouch, a tradesman at Sloughton, three miles from me—he sends to London the same as I do—I left them in his care, and he sent them—I saw them go away from his yard in a caravan—one of his carters drove it—a great quantity of provisions comes from our county by the railroad—a great deal of meat is sent—I directed the hampers to Mr. Dowding—I had no mark on the veal or pigs—I could not have sworn to them myself if I had seen them in Newgate-market—there are a great many butchers in our part, and they all send the meat up in the same way—hundreds and thousands of sides of veal come up with the cauls in the kidneys—Mr. Dawes's name was on the cloths—I had no mark on them myself.</p>

                  </hi>I am clerk to Mr. Dibdin, of Gerard's-hall, Basing<lb></lb>hall-lane—he is agent to Dawes, the wagoner. On Saturday, the 9th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was attending the unloading of one of Dawes's wagons at Newgate-market—there were some hampers in it with directions on them, and one without a direction—I helped to throw that one out of the wagon on to the ground near Blake's stand—two of Mr. Robin<lb></lb>son's men assisted me—in consequence of there being no direction on it, it was opened, to see if there was any note inside—I saw some sides of veal in it, I cannot say how many, two pigs, and three calves' heads—I know Austin—he was employed that morning in pitching from that wagon—I left the hamper at the side of Blake's stand, not knowing who it belonged to—I had some weigh-bills to make out, and another wagon was coming in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Recollect what you have said before—did you not see some knuckles of veal hanging out? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>.

Six altogether, on a Saturday—I could not name all the persons that sent meat that Saturday—Smith is not a common name—I cannot swear that many persons named Smith send meat to the Rose Inn—the five other men received things that came by the wagon as well as me—three carriers came to my master's that day—I cannot tell the names of the persons who sent goods by them—there may have been a person named Smith who sent things by these carriers.</p>

                  </hi>I am in the habit of transacting business for Mr. Osmond, and sell his meat most weeks. On Saturday, the 9th of May, I expected two hampers of meat, and one flat of offal—I only received one hamper and one flat of offal—I have no memorandum with me of the con<lb></lb>tents of the hamper which I did not receive—I had received a letter, but I cannot find it—I have looked for it, but I suppose it is mislaid, if Mr. Humphreys has not got it—he asked me for it a few days ago, and I told him if he had not got it I had lost it—I am not certain whether or not I put it on my file—I looked there, but could not find it—I searched in my desk and everywhere—I was told in the letter that I was to receive five sides of veal, two pigs, and three calves' heads—that is what I expected to receive.</p>

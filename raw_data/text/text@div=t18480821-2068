On 1st Aug., at half-past six o'clock, I saw my sacks in the shop—I went out, came back at ten, and missed five coke-sacks—next evening I received information from Shaw, and went to 93, East-street, Lambeth, and saw Eliza Delay and another female, and next morning, about seven o'clock, four small sacks were brought to me, which I refused to accept—if they were mine they had been cut up, or tarred over afresh—on the 5th William Betts was brought by Webber—I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a servant to these gentlemen. I was coming at the back part of our warehouse, at a little before ten in the morning, and saw the back door open, and I was a little surprised at not seeing any one there. I went forward, and saw a man going along with the goods on his shoulder. I missed the cotton from the bail, and suspected he had taken it, and I called somebody out of the cellar and then went after him, and met an officer bringing him in custody with the cotton, in St. Paul's Church Yard; I believe

            . I am a City officer. The prisoners both walked up a little way together, until they came to Palmer and Lawson's: Roberts went in, but came out again in a moment, and joined company with the other. They then walked up and down a little time, and then Roberts went in again, and come out again but did not bring anything then. He joined company with Atkinson, and in a few minutes went in again. While he was in, Atkinson walked past the door; and then I saw Roberts bring these printed goods out. I kept in the court, until their backs were turned, for fear they should see my face; and as soon as they got into St. Paul's Church Yard, I went after them, and took them both into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, my wife's name is Mary. My daughter, Sarah Frances Johnson, is two years and six months old—my house is near the Turnpike-gate, in Mile-end-road—the child was in the habit of playing about the door—on the 19th of June neither I now my wife were at home—I came home and found the child missing—I went down the road and found her at the station-house—I had seen the prisoner about three o'clock, walking past the house—here is my child—she had the bonnet and other things on which are stated.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Silver-street, Stepney, about three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutor. I saw the child—the prisoner was leading it by the hand—she appeared intoxicated—the respectable appear<lb></lb>ance of the child led me to suspect it was not right—I followed and watched her—the child went very quickly with her—I watched them to the middle of a small field at the back of my house, and there stopped her, and asked her where she got the child from—she said it was her own—I said it was false, it was not—then she said it was her sister's—I then followed her out of the field, and overtook Mrs. Ellis, and told her my suspicious—she went to her, and she told her it was her brother-in-law's who lived at No.23, Wellington-street—I still followed—she went round the corner, to<lb></lb>wards Whitechapel-road—I took Mrs. Ellis my suspicions were confirmed, and she went and took the child from her—I took it to the station-house—before I got there the parents came and took it—the prisoner could walk and could answer very well.</p>

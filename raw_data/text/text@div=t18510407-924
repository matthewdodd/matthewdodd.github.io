                  </hi>. On 4th April I went to dine with a friend, and stopped till about one o'clock in the morning—I received there thirty-six sovereigns, twenty-five half-sovereigns, seventeen shillings, and one half-crown, which I put into my purse, and put my purse into my left-hand trowsers pocket—I was going home, but do not recollect being in Hoi born, and any woman accosting me—this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine; I have had it twelve months—the money is right, except 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which the Magistrate allowed me to have.</p>

On the morning of 5th April, between two and three o'clock, I met the last witness walking with the prisoner in Holborn; they turned up Featherstone-buildings, towards Bedford-row, walking arm-in-arm—I hid myself in Jockey's-fields, which lay by Gray's-inn-walk, and saw the prisoner turn the gentleman's pocket out and run away suddenly—I stopped her at the corner of Ann-court, and asked what she had done with the gentleman—she said she left him in Jockey's-fields; that she ran away because he offered her 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she showed me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her left hand—I asked what she had in the other hand; she said "Nothing"—I laid hold of it and found this purse—I saw a man near, who ran away directly I took the prisoner—I took her back to the gentleman, and found him with another policeman—he was not sober, and complained of having lost between 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I showed him the purse, and he claimed it—at the station I found it contained thirty-six sovereigns, twenty-five half-sovereigns, seventeen shillings, and one half-crown—there was other money found on the prisoner.</p>

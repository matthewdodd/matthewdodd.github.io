            ; it is his house. On the 2nd of June I was at work in the house, and the prisoner applied to me to have the stone of a seal engraved - he left it, and was to call in the evening to say if he would have it done; he came at seven o'clock - I was in the shop, and had a watch on the bench, near me; he stood there about five minutes, and left the stone to be engraved; he was to call on Monday for it, but I never saw him again till the 16th, when I gave him in charge; I missed the watch two minutes after he left - I had seen it there while he was in the room; it was a duplex escapement silver watch, with a seal to it, and worth 12l. - my brother Edward and my father were also in the room when the prisoner came; I have not seen it since.</p>

            . I was with my brother in the evening when the prisoner called - I saw the watch on my brother's workboard two minutes before he came, and missed it about two minutes after he left; my father was at the same workbench with me, and did not leave it before the watch was missing; we were on one side of the room, and the prisoner on the other.</p>


               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prisoner near the watch? A. Not while speaking to my brother, but he saw a roasting-jack on the other side of the room, and went to look at it - he asked if my father repaired such things; he went close against the bench where the watch was, and must have taken it then.</p>

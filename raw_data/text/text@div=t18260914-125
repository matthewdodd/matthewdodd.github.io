            . I sell shell-fish, and live in Baldwin's-gardens. I saw the prosecutor struggling with the two prisoners - he had hold of them, and asked them for his watch; he held them till the watchman came up - I got a light and found the watch opposite to where he was, by the side of a board fence, where the buildings had been taken down; I had heard the chain rattle when he called for the watchman; the prisoners were near enough to the boards to place the watch there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the two prisoners at the watch-house, and received this watch from Scriven.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. We met this gentleman, who was very much intoxicated; we went into the house, and had something to drink - when we came out he said "Good God, I have lost my watch;" he then seized us both - I said "Don't pull us so, you had better call the watchman," which he did.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOSEPH DURWAND. Q. When the prisoner came to the watch-house did he appear to be drunk? A. No - he swore so hard and fast to them that we were forced to lock them up, though it was not till after they were locked up that the man came in, and said he had found the watch - we had searched them before, and found nothing on them.</p>

I felt him draw my watch out, and immediately secured him; the others closed upon me. I took the watch from him. The gang demanded of me to let him go. I refused and held him fast. I had another person with me, or they would have rescued him. They wanted me to take him into a house to search him. I held him about ten minutes, when Limbrick and Read came and took him. I never let him go.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK. I am an officer. Read and I were going by, and took the prisoner in charge from the prosecutor.</p>

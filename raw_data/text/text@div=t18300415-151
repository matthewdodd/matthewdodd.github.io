            . I am a butcher. I have known the prisoner better than two years; she had been in town before, and my mother knew her; on the 15th of February, between one and two o'clock she came and took me to Smithfield with her - she asked for two boxes; one was standing against the door, and the other on the rails; she did not pay for them - she said she would pay when she came for the others; she said they belonged to her - I took them to my mother's house in Carlisle-place; the prisoner had got a situation at No. 23, Portland-place, and I thought it was her property - she sent me to pawn the articles produced, and I gave her the money and duplicates.</p>

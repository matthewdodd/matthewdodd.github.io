                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Sutton—we live in Richmond-terrace, Dalston in the parish of St. John, Hackney. The prisoner came on 5th May, and took a lodging for eight weeks—I was to board him—he gave the name of Parry, said he was a merchant just come from Bourdeaux, and lad a great many goods at the Custom-house—he showed me several samples—on the next Wednesday he borrowed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of me, and afterwards got 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, to make up some money to pay the Custom-house duty—he said he bad 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay, and would I lend him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make it up—when he had got the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he left the house—I received a note the same evening, not in his writing, but the signature to it was his—I did not see him again till I saw him at Worship-street—I did not miss anything on the day he left, but the nest day I missed a gold watch and chain, and pocket-book—he had seen me put the watch and chain into my writing-desk on the sideboard, on the Wednesday evening—the watch was out of repair—it wanted something, which the prisoner said he could do—he had done something to a kitchen clock, and put, that to rights—I never saw the watch again till I was at Worship-street—I went with my husband and a gentleman to the Custom-house—we made inquiries, but there were no goods, and no such person known—we gave information to the police.</p>

            . I have known Dancer, the prosecutor, many years; he was arrested and in confinement some time. On the 4th of January last he came to my house, and said he had heard of the woman that swore the debt against him, and asked me to go with him to see after her; we went to the Hercules eating house, where we heard she opened oysters; we went in there, and waited for her coming; when she came we bid her open sixpennyworth of oysters, and asked her to drink some beer; she chose some gin; I asked her if her name was Todd; she said, yes; I told her I understood she had done a job for a friend of mine, Mr. Mitchel, and had three guineas for it; she said, yes; I said I believe you swore a debt against one Dancer; she said, yes, she did, and she believed he was in the Marshalsea some time; I said did you ever see Dancer; she said, no; I then said I want you to do a job for me; she said it was worth five guineas, that she would not do it under, and would not swear against any man again without seeing him first; I then told her that was Dancer; then she called us a couple of rascals, said she would have nothing to say to us, and bid us go out of the house.</p>

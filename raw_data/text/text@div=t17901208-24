I said no; and my grandmother in the back parlour called out, who is that? and he stepped into the back parlour; he said, is the landlady at home, I have a nice leg of pork for her; my grandmother said no; she is not; he had nothing in his hand, he came out and went to the door, and came in again, and went into the back parlour again, and asked when she would come in; and he comes into the front parlour to me, and said, go and tell your mammy that Mr. Jones wants you; I said I cannot leave the parlour, nor I shall not for you; then he pushed me from the table and said, tell your mammy I will call in half an hour; I saw no more of him, till he was taken, about ten the same morning.</p>

               <p>Did you observe him take any thing? - No, I did not see him take it, but it was on the saucer when he came into the room;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080029"></xptr>my mother came in and missed it; I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a Jew; on Friday morning, I do not remember the day of the month, it was this day five weeks (5th of November) the prisoner called clothes, and he went into a house for a minute or two, and he came out again, and said come this way; I went to him, and he asked me to do him a favour; I said I would if I could; he asked me to go to No. 38, Portland-place, that he was going for a soldier, and was to have five guineas; I shewed him the way, and going along he pulled out a tea-spoon, and asked me two shillings; I felt the weight of it, and offered him one shilling and three pence for it; I bought it of him, and gave it to Mr. Raw the prosecutor; he found me with the prisoner at No. 38, he bid me wait for him, to sell me some more old clothes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What house did I go into? - I do not know, I went in no house with him but a public-house before we got to Portland-place.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found the prisoner and this witness in Portland-place; I took the child with me, and when she saw the Jew standing at the door, she said, daddy, that is one of the men: the prisoner was in the gentleman's house at that time; the child pointed to the Jew, who stood at the door; as soon as the prisoner came out I seized him at the door; the child said that was the man, she knew them both.</p>
               <p>Court to the little girl. You said nothing about the Jew man? - No, Sir, the Jew stood over the way, right opposite our house, at No. 4, during the time the other man came in; they both went together, I am sure of the Jew man.</p>

               <p>Raw. He delivered it me, I have it now; (Produced, marked M. P. and deposed to.) my wife bought it at a pawnbroker's; I had no more so marked.</p>

            . I am a cabriolet-driver - on the morning of the 12th of November I was hired by one man in Tottenham-court-road, and he ordered me to go into the New-road, we went and had something to drink; and while we waited in the New-road, two or three men came to me, and several things were brought and put into the cab- among other things, they brought a looking-glass - where it came from, I don't know - they ordered me to drive to Islington - when I got there, they told me to go on, and at last I went to the corner of Brewer-street, in Rawstone-street; and there two or three men came and took the things out of the cab, and went down Brewer-street with them, into a house a very few doors down the street - I don't exactly know whose house it was - it was near six o'clock in the morning by the time I got there - I did not see the prisoner to know whether he was one of the men or not - it was very dark - I could not distinguish the men - I have given evidence against Coverdale and Foster before - Coverdale was the person who hired me, and I believe Foster is the man who rode with me up to Brewer-street - I have no reason to suppose the prisoner was either of the others.</p>

            . I am a constable - I went with a search-warrant to Stringer's premises on the 17th of December - he showed me all he had got - he produced the parts of a looking-glass frame - these are them.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON DARKIN CAMPBELL. I received from Mrs. Keyser a carved leaf, and produce it.</p>
               <p>HARRIETT KEYSER re-examined. This leaf fits the frame, which enables me to swear it is part of my looking-glass - I am sure this formed part of my looking-glass-frame - they have been fixed to the place at home where the glass had been fixed; and I know them by a mark here, and the leaf fits one of the pillars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are there no frames like that? A. I cannot swear that - this mark was caused by a liquor-frame being placed against it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If that is Mr. Keyser's, it was sold to Stringer before the robbery, which you will find by Stringer's evidence - I did not know till one o'clock, I should be tried before next week - last session I was admitted here as evidence against the men who did the robbery - if I had anything to have done with the frame, depend on it I certainly should have mentioned it - I was taken up for the robbery myself, and admitted as evidence at Hatton Garden- If I had known about the glass I certainly should have spoken about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you think at the time that it was a push to take your attention off - A. Yes, that he might take my watch, not with intent to do me any personal injury.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say who it was that did it - A. I have not a doubt of the prisoner. When I felt the watch go out of my pocket I said I had lost my watch; up came three or four jew men, and said what is the matter; I said, why do you ask, you know well enough; Mr. Pegg that was with me followed a little way, but did not get hold of him. On the Tuesday evening afterwards I saw the prisoner in custody at Lambeth street office, he was with other persons; directly I saw him, I said I would fetch the witnesses, they said it was too late. I saw him again on the Wednesday I was quite sure then that he was the person that struck me and took my watch away. On Tuesday, when I saw him there, it was dark, and on Wednesday it was day light, I was quite sure he was the man. I saw him by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this, the 9th of June - A. It was quite moon light. I was quite sober. I have never seen my watch again. It was worth seven pounds.</p>

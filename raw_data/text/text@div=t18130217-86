I saw the prisoner rolling this cask out of the gate, and I saw him rolling it down Drury-lane. He rolled it into the coal-yard, and he placed it behind a cart. I then watched him. He went to the top of the coal-yard and looked about, as if he was watching somebody. I and my partner took him to the watchhouse.

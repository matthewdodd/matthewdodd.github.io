            . I belong to the day-patrol, near the Mansion-house. On Sunday morning the 30th of July, about a quarter past six o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Aldersgate-street with a basket, and asked what he had got - he said it was a piece of beef - I removed the cloth which covered it, and found it was a loaf of sugar. I asked where he brought it from - he said from Messrs. Eagletons' in Newgate-street - he wished me to let him go and keep the sugar myself. I took him to Eagletons', rang the bell - nobody answered. He then said he bought it of a man at the corner of Butcherhall-lane. Mr. Smith claimed it - it weighed 20 lbs. I found more at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. I believe he keeps a small chandler's-shop - A. Yes, he has a very few things there. I had a man named Corney in custody for this felony.</p>

            . On Wednesday morning I examined my stock; on the 26th of July, I had received from Messrs Rhodes and Co. Leman-street, one hundred and eleven loaves, they weighed 20 cwt. 2 qrs. and 25 lbs. On the 27th I sent thirty-two to the Albion, which would leave seventy-nine, we sold no more afterwards, but on Wednesday I found only seventy-seven loaves remaining, they were all marked No. 23 - there were two produced bearing that mark - I have no doubt but they are mine - it is a particularly fine sugar, and they were put in a particular paper, and remained in the same paper when found upon the prisoner.</p>

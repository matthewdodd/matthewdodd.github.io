               <p>I am a patrol; on the 17th of March, it might be half past eight, I met the prisoner in Fleet-street; I asked him what he had? he would not tell me; I took him to the watch-house; he was very unwilling, but begged for mercy very much; when I got him to the watch-house, I asked him a great many questions, how he came by this lead? he said, he found it in Chancery-lane; I had seen the prisoner at work at Mr. Lumley's; then he told me, he found it in Fleet-street, just by where I took him; I went in the morning to Mr. Lumley's, and found the lead was gone.</p>
               <p>Did you compare that lead with what was taken from the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you, Mr. Lumley? - Yes; I know both one and the other; one is a new piece, and the other is an old one; I went upon the roof of the privy, where it was taken from, and looked at it, and found it fitted.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many more guinea fowls had you? A. None; I did not tell the Magistrate I could not swear to them - I never saw the legs and wings till this morning; I do not know when they were found - I believe it was the next day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you see him again? A. On the 15th he came to me in Fleet-market, about two o'clock: he came to me on the Monday to return a coat I had lent him - I have known him five or six months; he lodged at a public-house.</p>

            . I live at Watlington, and follow the plough; I have known White ever since I can remember any thing; I saw him at Watlington on the night of the 14th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, in Cushion-street, opposite Mr. Ives' - I did not speak to him, but I am sure it was him: there were two men with him whom I did not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you speak to him? A. No: he almost touched me as he passed - it was a moonlight night, but there was no gas-light; he was no acquaintance of mine - I had seen him before, and spoken to him, but did not on that night; I heard of the loss of these fowls soon after, but I did not tell Mr. Wiggins, or any body else of it nor go before any Magistrate; I was found at a public-house on Whit-Monday - I was quite sober; I am sure it was the night of the 14th, because my master had ordered me to get up that night to draw into Reading: I told this story when they came to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often in the course of your life had you seen White? A.Almost every day when he was at Watlington.</p>
               <p>HENRY HODGES. I am servant to Mr. Stone. I know White well. On the morning of the 14th of April, I saw him and two other men in a cart, about half-past ten o'clock - they were about eighteen miles from Watlington, and going towards it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. I went before the Grand Jury yesterday, and before a Magistrate; I have known White three months by sight; I cannot say how many times I had seen him; I did not speak to him that morning - I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. On the night of the 15th of April I went to the Admiral Benbow public-house, in Golden-lane; I found the two prisoners and two other persons there; Warren seemed as if he had been fighting - he came out of the parlour, and said he wanted to give charge of a man who had been beating him; I saw Harrington, who was with me, take up this bag - he said to Warren, "What is in this bag, and whose is it?" Warren said, "It is mine, and there are four guinea fowls in it:" they were looked at - they were then dead: I said to Warren, "Who did you get them from?" he said, "That person in the parlour," and pointed out White, and said he gave 8s. or 9s. for them; White denied it - we did not take the fowls away that night, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110014"></xptr>next morning I went with Buckle to the Benbow - Warren had left the bag there, and Buckle took it; the prisoners were taken, and conveyed to Worship-street, with a man named Pettit: as they were going along, I heard White say to Pettit, "If he can keep his tongue, it will be all right enough;" he was alluding to Warren, who was walking first with the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the prisoners that first night? A. No; I left them and the fowls there that night - they knew I was an officer; I heard that there were some pheasants lost as well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You say there was a quarrel? A.There had been a quarrel, and the inspector of the watch called me in; they were tipsy - the bag was there the next morning; White said if he would keep his tongue it would be all right - he pointed to Warren, but did not mention his name.</p>
               <p>- I am inspector of the watch. I went to the house, and found the bag, which the landlord gave to Warren when he asked for it; White came out of the parlour, and said, "That is my bag," and he took it from him; I opened the bag, and took out one or two fowls, and left them there.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I went and got the bag, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I then took Warren, and told him I apprehended the fowls were stolen - he said, "I thought so too;" I asked who he bought them of: he said of a man named White, who would be there presently - White then came, and I took him; I wrote down to the constable of Watlington, and kept the fowls as long as I could - I then cut off the heads, pinions, and legs; the heads were offensive, and I could not keep them - these are the legs and pinions; one of the feet has a nail off one of the toes - this is it; I took it off one of the dark fowls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Where did you find Mr. Wall? A. At his residence in Fleet-market; I believe it was after the first examination - I did not take the plough-boy; he was subpoened here - I did not go on the night before; I heard of it in the morning, and followed Warren and Pettit into the Benbow: White came in in a quarter of an hour; I had not heard of 50l. being offered for some pheasants till the second examination.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did hear of the reward? A. I heard there was a reward of 20l. for any burglary in that parish, and an extra 5l. from a gentleman who had lost some pheasants.</p>
               <p>MRS. WIGGINS. I believe they are the legs of my fowls - I never had the lame fowl in my hand while it was alive, but I will swear that was the leg of it; I have seen it many times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say two were light, and two were dark? A. Yes; light guinea fowls are rather singular.</p>
               <p>WHITE'S Defence. I had the fowls delivered to me from a coach-office in Fleet-market. I asked where they came from, but they did not give me any information on that subject.</p>

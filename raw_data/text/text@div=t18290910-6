The prisoner was in my service at Midsummer last, and on taking stock I missed 200l. in money; in consequence of suspicion I went to the prisoner's room, with Sweetland, my brother-in-law; her box was searched in her presence - we first searched her drawers: she said they were my drawers, but the box was hers; she did not allow us to search the box willingly at first, but I said I would have it opened, and went out; I told her I was going for an officer; she then consented to have it opened; and Sweetland found, in my presence, sixty-seven sovereigns, and nineteen half-sovereigns - I made her no promise or threat: as soon as Sweetland took hold of the property, which was tied in a piece of rag, he said, "This feels heavy, like sovereigns; Whose are these?" she came and caught hold of me by the hand, and said it was my property - I asked how she came by it; she said she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100010"></xptr>taken them out of my bureau, which was down stairs in the parlour; she said the key was in it: I asked her several times how she got them before she told me, but said nothing to induce her; Sweetland said I need not ask her any more - that no threat or promise had been held out and if she chose to tell, it was of no consequence. I put the money into my iron chest, and sent for Valentine; she had lived about nine months with me: I kept money in my bureau, but never missed any till I took stock - it could not have been taken all at once, or I should have known it: I go to my bureau thirty or forty times every day - at times there is not 20l. there, and at other times 200l. or 300l.</p>

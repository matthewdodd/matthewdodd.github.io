The prisoner was formerly in our service, and last Christmas he wrote to us, saying, he wished to commence business for himself, but had rather got his hand out, and wished to be with us a short time without a salary, to make himself more acquainted with the trade. I afterwards saw him, and he came into our employ. A communication was made to me by Mr. Duthoit, a lace merchant, last February, and, on the 24th, I went to the prisoner's lodgings in Old Cavendish-street; he was then taken into custody; we searched his rooms, and found a variety of my articles, which I gave to Schofield - they were in a trunk under the bed - Mr. Duthoit gave me a piece of lace.</p>

            . I am a lace manufacturer, and live in Bow-church-yard; I sell goods to the prosecutors. In February I attended a sale at Mr. Bailey's, and observing some goods which I had sold, I bought two pieces of lace, which I am certain I sold the prosecutors; the prisoner was bidding at the sale, and the very article he bid for, I bought at the next day sale.</p>

               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. He was constantly in your house? A. Yes, from Christmas up to the time he was apprehended; he might have taken the goods separately.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You paid him no wages? A. No, he boarded with us, and was our servant; I took him as a shopman, and boarded him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the contract you made with him? A. That he was to have his board, and to be with us till August or September, when he was going into business - he perfectly understood that his board was a remuneration for his services.</p>

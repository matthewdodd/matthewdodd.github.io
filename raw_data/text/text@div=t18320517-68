               <p>WILLIAM EVANS. I am a Policeman. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running - I pursued; he was stopped by some gentlemen who were coming in an opposite direction - I took hold of him: Watts came up, and said, "That is the man who robbed me of my pocket-book;" the prisoner made no remark whatever - I found nothing on him; his waistcoat was unbuttoned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing Tower-hill, and saw a crowd; directly I got up to it this man took hold of me, and said I had his pocket-book; I said I had not - several people ran; I ran also - the Lord Mayor asked the Policeman why he took me more than another; he said he took the first that came to his hand.</p>

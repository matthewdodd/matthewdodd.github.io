                  </hi>. I am a grocer's assistant. Between twelve and one o'clock on the morning of 26th April I was in Jamaica-row, Bermondsey, with a friend—the prisoner came and asked us to go home with her, and we both went to a house in Rose and Rummer-lane—my friend went with another female we saw there, and I went with the prisoner—when I got into the room I was alone with her—I took out my purse, and saw I had four sovereigns and about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I was quite sober—I gave her some money, and put my purse into my left-hand trowsers-pocket—I kept my trowsers on—I afterwards left the room, went into another room, found my friend and the other woman there; and in consequence of what my friend said,</p>

               <p>I took out my purse—directly the prisoner saw that, she came behind me, pushed me into the room I had been in, shut the door, and said she was going for some beer, and went into the street—I looked at my purse, and missed four sovereigns; and the ring was slipped to the middle of it—I went after the prisoner, and could not find her—I then went to the station, got a policeman, and found her in a public-house in King-street, Borough.</p>

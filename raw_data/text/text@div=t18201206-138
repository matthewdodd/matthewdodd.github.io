I saw them hustling a gentleman, and observed Wright lay hold of the gentleman's watch-ribbon, it broke off; I immediately collared him and called for assistance - as I held him he threw it away. Lambert and another constable came up and secured him. I saw a person pick up the ribbon, who gave it to me. Siddell was in his company, and assisted in hustling the gentleman - I saw them together all the way. I could not find the gentleman. It was opposite the Spotted Dog. Several of the gang struck me, and called out Rescue!</p>

            . I was in the Strand with several other constables, and saw the prisoners attempt several persons' pockets, and opposite the Spotted Dog I saw Wright run against a gentleman and try at his watch; the ribbon broke, he got the seal and key, and part of the swivel of the watch. I secured Siddell - he said,</p>
               <p>"You b - g - r, let me go, or I'll blow your bl - dy head off!" - we secured them.</p>

I went up and collared him, he struck me several times, and said he would give me a ***. I drew my staff out and struck him, he was secured. The prisoners were both together.</p>

            . I was in the Strand - a gang of about thirty kept the pavement to themselves; the prisoners were among them. They tried several gentlemens' pockets, but, seeing so many officers, one of them said,</p>
               <p>"Let us turn and beat them out of the street." They made a stand, I thought they were going to fight us - we stopped abreast of them, and they walked on. A gentleman was hustled near the Spotted Dog. I saw fifteen or sixteen officers trying to get the prisoners from the others. With difficulty we got them into the Spotted Dog. When I was searching Wright he said he would split my bl - dy nose. The seal and key were given to me.</p>

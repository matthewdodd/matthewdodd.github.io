My daughter told me Mr. Powle's closet door was open, and that the pad-lock was taken off. I went to pull the door too as it stood a-jar, and the prisoner from within started against me, and cry'd bo ! I scream'd out, he had something white hung under his arm, upon which he jump'd down stairs directly. I was much affrighted, and in about a quarter of an hour went down, and saw him in custody there.</p>

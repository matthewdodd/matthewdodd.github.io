On Saturday evening, the 3rd of November, about eleven o'clock, I went into the Wellington, public-house, Cannon-street, and had a pint of beer, the prisoner came before me, and called me his father, and said, would I have some liquor, or beer, I said, "No;" I asked him to drink with me, I paid one shilling, and received nine-pence change for it. I went home, and he walked with me, arm in arm, and kept me in conversation. Another man walked about six yards before me, and at the top of the street, the other man made a full stop, the prisoner immediately put his hand to my pocket, and ran off. I felt, and found he had turned it inside out; I pursued him, calling Stop thief! The office stopped him. I know him to be the man, he ran very quick, and I kept close to him all the way. I lost 10 s 9 1/2 d. from my pocket.</p>

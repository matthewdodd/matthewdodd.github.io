               <p>The prosecutor is my nephew, and keeps a shop in High-street, Shadwell—the prisoners were in his service—on Saturday the 4th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was driving my cart down Ratcliffe Highway, to<lb></lb>wards my nephew's, and saw the two prisoners together, coming from my nephew's, and going towards Rosemary-lane—Westlake had a basket on his shoulder—I went on to my nephew's and spoke to him—I then went after them—when I got to a print shop, I saw them sitting on this sack, with about 100lbs. weight of flour in it—I said, "You are pretty sort of fellows, this is the way you rob your master is it?"—I said, "You had better put it in the cart"—I took them and the flour back to my nephew's—I said to the prisoners, "You deserve transporta<lb></lb>tion for this"—Westlake said, "I do, if you follow the law I shall be trans<lb></lb>ported"—I said, "How did you get it out? in small quantities?"—M'La<lb></lb>gan said, "We took it all out, the whole <hi rend="italic">cotch,</hi> this morning"—they offered to give 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece for it, but my nephew would take no money.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a baker's shop in High-street, Shadwell. My uncle took it for me—the rent has not become due yet—I have only been there three months—there has only been one rate due, and that I paid—I have no partner—my uncle is not entitled to any share of my profits—the prisoners were in my service—I paid them their wages—on the 4th of May my uncle told me something, he went rafter the pri<lb></lb>soners, and brought them back with the basket and this sack of flour—I had thirty such sacks as this, and this is one I believe—and this flour is the same quality—when my uncle brought the prisoners in, he said, "I have brought back your two men, and they have been robbing you"—M'Lagan said they took it out at the back gate on that Saturday morning, and West-lake said the same—they offered me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

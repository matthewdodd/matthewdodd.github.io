               <p>Mrs. Leake. I was going by the Stage-coach into Norfolk, on June 5, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and took a hackney-coach; I took a parcel of boxes and other things in the coach with me, the box containing the things mentioned in the indictment, I had packed up myself, and afterwards sowed it up in a wrapper. I had given it to my maid to put into the coach, after I understood from my maid that she had put it into the coach, I saw it in the boot; in order to be more certain about it, I spoke to the coachman to know if he was sure he had the box; he said he had, and gave me the dimensions of it with his whip, to assure me he had it; at the very instant almost he turned round and swore that the box was gone. I know nothing of the persons who took it.</p>

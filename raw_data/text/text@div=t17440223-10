               <p>Mrs. Burroughs. I saw the Prisoner come into the shop, and take away a bladder of hogs lard. I stood at the end of the counter, while he was in the shop, but was very much frightened, because I had no body in the house but mysel f. He looked me full in the face, and went out with it. It was near a quarter of an hour afterwards before I could send for my husband: I described the Prisoner to him, and he was taken up about nine o'clock at night; I am positive he is the man, because I have known him some years; he looked like a guilty person.</p>

            . My wife sent for me home, and described the Prisoner's person and clothes to me: I got a constable, and he informed me, if I would go into Black Boy Alley, we might probably find him; we went there, and found five or six of them scolding and fighting together: when they saw the constable, three of them run away, and we took the Prisoner and another; when my wife saw him, she said, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was then in Chick-Lane, hearing some girls singing of ballads; I believe they will come to my character, and prove where I was at that time.</p>
               <p>The balled-singers were called, but did not come to the character of the Prisoner. <rs id="t17440223-10-verdict54" type="verdictDescription">

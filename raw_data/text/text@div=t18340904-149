Yes; that is the proper name of the coin - the prisoner was apprehended on the 26th of August in London, at the Blossoms Inn, and brought to me - I missed to the value of 40l. in French coin, and two sovereigns in English coin - there might be franc pieces and half-francs - they were kept in my trunk in France - I did not go before the authorities there about it - I came to town to overtake the prisoner - I employed Parish, the policeman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the prisoner, "If you will confess the robbery and restore the money, no more shall be done to you?" A. No - I said, "Sam, what do you mean by robbing me?" - he said, "I don't know" - I did not offer him pardon or forgiveness, or any thing to that effect - he delivered a bag of forty-one sovereigns to the officer - the officer did not tell him he would forgive him if he would restore the money, in my presence - he was unwilling to give it up - he gave it up for fear of being punished, I suppose - I said nothing to him about being punished - I left it all to the officer - he said, "I must search you" - he seemed unwilling to be searched, and moved about and pulled out the silk purse - the canvass bag was found about his watch fob - after some altercation he produced it - I have got back 41 sovereigns and 15s. from him - I lost 40l. - after the money was produced, I said he might go back with me and work with me again, and save his character - he had restored the money to the officer then - I did not say if he wished to remain in London a few days I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040078"></xptr>remain with him - I said I would not mind giving him 2l. 10s. if he wanted to go any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the policeman you did not wish to proceed further against him? A. Not to my knowledge - I might have said such a thing at the moment - I am not willing to receive him into my service now.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 26th of August, in consequence of information, I went to the Blossoms Inn, and found a name booked for Nottingham, but the person's box had been sent to Maidstone by mistake - I waited till the box was returned, and waited to see if the prisoner came for the box - he did not, and next day at one o'clock I went there, and saw him with another person near the window - from the description I had received, I believed him to be the man - I saw him go into the office, and ask if his box had come - he was told "Yes" - I then asked if he was going to Nottingham - I took him to a house where the prosecutor was, and told him I apprehended him for robbing him - he said, "What I have done, I have done in France - I am not in France now, and am not amenable" - I said, "You will find the difference" - I took him to another house, and told him I must search him - he said he would not be searched - I took him into a corner, and he let me search him - I took a purse from his left hand pocket, which the prosecutor identified - I afterwards went to his other pocket, but I could not get my hand to the bottom - I found a garter strap had been put round it to confine it - I took out 41 sovereigns - I afterwards went with him to get his box, and in that I found a hat-cover, which the prosecutor claimed - I said to the prisoner,"How is this? these are sovereigns" - he said, "O yes, I changed the silver for sovereigns" - he desired the prosecutor to forgive him, and said he had behaved very kind to him, and he had done very wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that all that passed? A. As far as I recollect - the prosecutor did not say if he would confess the robbery, and restore the money, he would forgive him, nor any thing of the kind - he did not tell him in my presence that as he had restored the money, he should return to France and continue in his situation - he said to me at the door, "I would not mind giving the poor fellow a sovereign to start him on the road, though he has used me so" - he did not say if he chose to go to Nottingham, he would give him 2l. 10s. to pay his expenses, in my hearing: but he had an opportunity of saying it in my absence, as I went to Guildhall to ask if it could be entered into in this country - the prosecutor never asked me for the money - he said before the magistrate, that he did not wish to prosecute, and he might have said so to me, but I think he did not - I am certain he never asked for the money - I never refused to give it up, because I was not asked - the magistrate would not allow me - I do not recollect his saying he was willing to take him back to his service.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said if I wished to return to France, he would take me again into his employ, and that he would give me 50s. to go home to Nottingham.</p>
               <p>MR. DODSWORTH re-examined. I received no character with him - he came to France, and asked me for a job of work - this is my hat-cover and purse.</p>

            . I am an officer. A young man came to me in Golden-lane, and said a man had been robbed of his watch; I went to the Crown and Sceptre to ask what sort of girl it was - she had left her bonnet there; by her bonnet I thought I knew her, and I went and found the prisoner in Golden-lane - she at first denied having any watch: I took her into a house, and found it in her bosom.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I can be upon my Sacrament oath, that I never denied having the watch. Witness. Yes, you did, and in going along, she said, "For God's sake don't tell the man; you may keep the watch;" the prosecutor appeared to have his faculties about him.</p>
               <p> - BABY. I was at the public-house, and saw the prosecutor there - he was a little in liquor; he said,"Take this watch, and get a pot of beer;" the prisoner took it, and went away - he did not give it her; she went out without her bonnet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell my friends that you saw the man give me the watch? A. No, I never said a word about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever tell that girl, or any of her friends, that the prosecutor gave her the watch? A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was with him almost two hours, and had three pots of beer; he wanted the fourth - the landlady brought it, and he had no money; he then took his watch out of his pocket, and said, "Here, my wench, take this:" that is the truth, so help me God.</p>

            . I live at No. 77, Gower-street, Bedford-square. On Monday, the 8th of February, about noon, I was in <placeName id="t18300218-16-crimeloc93">Skinner-street</placeName>

               <p>"So it is;" a constable happened to be in the way - he got away from me; the constable followed - I lost sight of him, but saw him again in five minutes, and am quite certain of him.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TURNBULL. I am a constable. I was walking up Skinner-street, and saw Mr. Gordon laying hold of the prisoner's collar; I cannot say whether he had any companions - Mr. Gordon accused him of taking his handkerchief; he denied it - I saw Mr. Gordon take it from his pocket; he twisted himself out of his hands -I followed, and secured him without losing sight of him; the handkerchief was delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Skinner-street; the handkerchief was taken out of the gentleman's pocket, and thrown at my feet - I took it up, and put it into my pocket - he turned round, and charged me with it; I gave it to him.</p>

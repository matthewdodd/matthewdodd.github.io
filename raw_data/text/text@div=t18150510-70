               <p>Q. When did you loose your copper - A. On the 2nd of May, it was fixed in the washhouse; it was taken about five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse the prisoner - A. A young woman who lives a few doors from me, came and called me, by knocking at my room door, and asked me if I had my copper; I told her, yes. She said, I had better get up, for there was two men gone up the passage with a copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the washhouse a part of your dwelling - A. Yes. I got out of bed, and put part of my clothes on therein, and pursued them into Newstone-square, on to Tavistock-square, into Russell-square, and stept up to Conner, I caught hold of him with the copper on his head; he threw the copper of his head; I secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the copper - A. This is the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. He had it on his head - A. Yes, and Jones run away.</p>
               <p>- . On the 2nd of May, a few minutes before five, as I was going to work, I saw two men, the prisoners at the bar, looking at the door; I stood three doors from Pancras-street; Conner was standing in Little Pancras-street, and then he crossed over, and presently I saw him with the copper on his head; I called Mr. Pearce, and asked him if he had the copper in his washhouse, for I was afraid it was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. Q. Did you see me speak to Conner - A. I did not.</p>

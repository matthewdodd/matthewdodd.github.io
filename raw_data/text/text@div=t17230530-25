That he this Evidence said, that if they did get it, he did not know where to sell it; but Nan Gill took that upon her. That Garraway, Sly, and himself, went together about 9 a Clock at Night to the Prosecutor's House, and Garraway bid them go in and cheapen a pair of Gold Scales, telling them there was a Key that went into a Pin in such a Place of a Cellar-door, bidding them take an Opportunity to pull it out: That they did go in, but could not get an Opportunity to pull it out; and coming out and telling him so, he swore they were a couple of Fools . That then Garraway went in himself, and supp'd with his Cousins, and when he came out told them he had pull'd the Key out of the Pin, and made all things ready to get in. That then he went in again, and said about half an Hour; that then they went into Moorfields, and walk'd about till after 11 a Clock, and came to the House again at almost 12, but Sly espying a Light in the House, they walk'd about till almost one a Clock; and supposing all then to be fast asleep, Sly pull'd out the Pin, took out the Bar and Garraway went in, and in half an Hour brought out the Plate, and gave the Tankard and Salver to Sly, and that the Plate being dispos'd to each of them some, they would have gone out at Cripplegate, but did not dare to adventure, because of the Watch; that then going to Moorgate, where there was but one Watchman, there Sly went through first, and in about half a quarter of an Hour Garraway and he this Evidence went through into Moorfields, and thence to Nan Gill's where being let in, they set the Plate down on the Table, and Nan Gill poising it in her Hand, said it was but light, and so would not fetch a great deal, but as she judg'd about 7 l. s but telling them she would sell it for them, and would not wrong them of a half Peny, that she did go to sell the Plate, but he saw her no more till she was secured.

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid at the Phoenix public-house, in Norton Falgate, kept by Mr. Samuel Scrivener. On the morning of the 14th of July I was in the bar-parlour—I had only left the bar a few minutes—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 14th of July I went to the door of the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner leaning over the coun<lb></lb>ter, with his hand in the till—I saw him take a half-crown from the till and put it into his mouth—he leaped from the counter, and was coming out, but seeing me at the door, he turned round again and said, "Half a pint of beer"—I took him into custody, and charged him with the offence—I called Spinks, who came out—I asked the prisoner for the half-crown—he denied having it—I took hold of him by the throat, and he put his hand to his mouth—he then put his hand into his pocket, and took out the half-crown, as if from his pocket, and gave it me.</p>

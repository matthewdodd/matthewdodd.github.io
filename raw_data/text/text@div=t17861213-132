               <p>On Saturday, the 11th of November, I had occasion to go out; I expected a draft from Doncaster; I put into a bag a thirty pounds note, eight guineas and a half, and one shilling and sixpence; six of the guineas were very bright; the money and the note were in the bag; I gave it to my son about ten; says I, George, there is the money; I returned home in about an hour; my son told me that his wife and his sister wished to go and see the Princess Amelia lay in state; he asked me to let him go with them, I did; when he was gone, I searched for the bag; I looked for the money; I did not find that he had left it; and while I was seeking for the money the banker's clerk brought in the draft; I had sufficient in the house, and I discharged it; I was rather unhappy concerning him, and was very impatient for his return; and about one he and his sister returned but not his wife; and I said as soon as ever he returned, George, you have made me uneasy, did you take the money with you to pay the draft; yes, says he, I did; he clapped his hands to his pockets, oh, good God! I have been robbed, what shall I do; I took out my pocket book, and took out my memorandum, and sent him to stop the bank note at the Bank, and he went.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the number? - 8641, the 8th of October 1786.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you any note of whom it was signed by? - I will shew you my memorandum. (Looks at it and at the indictment.) After he was gone, I went to Westminster, where his wife and sister were, and told them what had happened; his wife returned back with me; I had not been home an hour before I heard somebody was taken up, and in consequence of that I went to Bow-street, and asked if there was any pick-pocket taken up; and they said, yes; I asked if there was any bank note; and they said, yes; he asked me the number of the note, I told him; he looked in the book, and said, your note is very safe, you must attend at six in the evening; I attended there on Tuesday following; then the prisoners were committed; I never saw the prisoners till I saw them before the Magistrates; I swore to my note; there is a mark on the back of the note of my own hand writing; I received it at the Bank, and I put a B upon it for Bank.</p>
               <p>Did you see the bag? - The bag was never produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Of course all that you say is, that you had such a note, and that you gave it to your son, and that that is the note you lost? - Yes.</p>

I then took this bank note from between his legs: I then said to Macmanus, says I, let us take them into a public house, and search them all three directly; we took them into the back room of a public house close to the spot, and they were searched there; and Macmanus will tell you what money was found; this note has never been out of my custody since.</p>

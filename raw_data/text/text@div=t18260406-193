            . I am a little more than nine years of age - I know I must speak the truth. I received the counterpane from Mrs. Dow one Tuesday - the prisoner took it from under my arm, and gave it to two others - I had known him before, and am quite sure he is the boy; I cried Stop thief! and some persons took him, in my presence - the others got away with the counterpane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me give it to anybody? A. Yes. I told the Magistrate he gave it to the others.</p>

I was coming down Chelsea-common, and saw a crowd - this little boy was in the midst of it; he said he had lost a counterpane; I walked away; when I got half way down the crescent this gentleman came, took me into his cart, and said I should go with him - he said he would give me 5s. to tell him who took it, and where it was, but I could not.</p>

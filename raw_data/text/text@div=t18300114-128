               <p>GEORGE CULHAM. I saw the prisoner on the 19th of December, in Osborne-street, Whitechapel: she invited me to go with her, but I refused, and kept straight on - when we got to <placeName id="t18300114-128-crimeloc691">Wentworth-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.What time was this? A. A few minutes after four o'clock in the afternoon on the Saturday, and she was taken on the Sunday; the two others were not in her company till I attempted to run, then they caught hold of my coat, and detained me - I felt a hand in my pocket; I had an umbrella in one of my hands - I called out that I was robbed, and Stop thief! and the other girls seized me: it had been in my right-hand pocket, and my right hand was at liberty; the prisoner was on my right side, and the other two behind- I had no opportunity of seizing her, but I felt the money rattle in my right-hand pocket; I had no thought I was going to be robbed, but I put my hand down, and found my pocket turned inside out - I certainly felt her hand in my pocket; I have never found my purse - I will not swear whether the prisoner went into the public-house or down an alley; I lost sight of her: there were 16s. or 18s.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140066"></xptr>in it; I had had it out at Mr. Ceal's, to pay for some tobacco; I had 24s. or 25s. when I was there - I had I lb. of tobacco, and had 16s. or 18s. left; I had not known the prisoner before - I was perfectly sober.</p>

            . I took the prisoner from information given at the office on Saturday night, by the prosecutor - I found her walking with two other girls, at half-past five o'clock the next evening; the prosecutor was with me, and immediately the prisoner saw him she turned her head - I took no notice of that, but brought all the three girls to the gas-light; the prosecutor pointed out the prisoner - she denied all knowledge of him or the robbery. <rs id="t18300114-128-verdict692" type="verdictDescription">

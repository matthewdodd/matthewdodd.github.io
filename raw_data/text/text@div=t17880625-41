               <p>I am a waggoner, I drive the waggon of Mr. Birch, I know the prisoner from the time of the robbery, when I first saw him which was the 23d of May, as I was going up <placeName id="t17880625-41-crimeloc185">Oxford-road</placeName>

               <p>Had he any hat on? - No, he had not any hat on in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Had he any hat on when you first saw him? - I do not recollect as he had, to the best of my remembrance he had not; he struggled to get away, and I got him down as soon as I could and called for assistance, and the watchman came, and we took him to the watch-house; it was very well I happened to take him, if I had not, this truss of cloth would have been lost; my master might have thought ill of me, and I might have lost my place and my character as long as I live afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether this truss would not move by jolting on the stones? - I am very sure it did not, because it was so closely stoved in, I am sure it could not.</p>
               <p>Court. What distance might it be moved? - A yard and half.</p>
               <p>Was it tied in any way? - No, but it was packed in as close as could be, no shaking would ever have moved it.</p>
               <p>Do you know what was in it? - It is here, here is the man that sent it into our inn.</p>
               <p>Court. The yard and half that it was moved was backwards, towards the end of the waggon? - It was moved backwards as close as it could be, except it had been put out.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; as I was coming down between Orchard-street and Duke-street, I saw the waggon stop, and I saw the prisoner and the waggoner have a great struggle; I went immediately to assist, and asked the waggoner what was the matter, he said the prisoner had been robbing his waggon, I took him into custody with the assistance of the other watchman; the prisoner had no hat.</p>

               <p>I was going to Richmond to take a job at the Duke of Queensborough's, going up Oxford Road, I met a young fellow that I used to work with; he chuck'd my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250040"></xptr>hat into the waggon in a frolic; not having the presence of mind to ask the waggoner, I acknowledge I got into the waggon, then the waggoner up't with his whip and knocked me down; the watchman came up and I was taken to the office, this gentleman swore that nothing was moved and nothing lost; Mr. Robinson came and said, your prosecutor has swore different to what he did before, and you are to be tried at the Old Bailey; I have no friends, I know I am here by myself; he said before that nothing was moved.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was it he said nothing was moved? - At the office in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Who was there at the time? - I do not know whether any of the runners belonging to the said office is here; I was to have been tried at Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Jury to the waggoner. Did you see any person near him? - None till the watchmen came.</p>

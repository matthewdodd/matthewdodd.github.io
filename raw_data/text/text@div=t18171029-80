            . I am a constable. On the 28th of September, about three o'clock in the morning, I went to the house at the corner of French-alley, and found the water-pipe gone, and the water flowing about the cellar; I went to Rowley's house - They would not let us in; the watchman and I got down through the cellar-window, and found part of the pipe in the middle of the cellar, and the rest at the back; it measured fifty-six feet, and corresponded within one foot, with the place where it had been taken from-it was rolled up. I could not see the full extent of it. While I was in the cellar, I saw the prisoner, Richardson, go across the yard - I got out of the front window and went into the shop, after forcing the door, and found a good fire in the shop; I went into the yard and found Richardson in custody - He was dressed; I found eight tin canisters in the yard, and returned to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290030"></xptr>the shop and found the prisoner, Rowley, in the shop, in her shift, and the prisoner, Wright, in a room adjoining, in her hed, with his clothes on-his shoes were muddy; I found two tin canisters in the shop, covered over with a sack, under the counter, and seven lids of the canisters near a chair by the fire; there was a great deal of water in the pipe. We took them into custody-the next morning I went to the premises and found the lock had been forced; I found another canister-lid and a crow-bar at Rowley's house, which fitted the marks made in the door.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and live in the prisoner, Rowley's, second floor.

The prisoner then took me down to the dust-hole, and told me the duplicates were there; he had told me a good many lies, and I said he had better tell the truth; he then made a statement, and took me to the dust-hole, where I found the duplicates of the silver spoons; after that he took us to the rag-hole, and in a bag under the rags were two pieces<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290008"></xptr>of linen and a pair of shoes, which were mine; I saw the officer find this memorandum upon him, he told me I should find part of my property at Loyne's in Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square; I went there with Lincoln and found in his shop some blue Artillery cloth - we are contractors for the Artillery corps, and nobody but ourselves have occasion for that cloth; it is made purposely for us - I also found some bone buttons, some hooks and eyes, two pairs of trousers, one pair of which he had made up for himself - I knew the cloth. Lincoln found a duplicate of some scarlet cloth which I believe was ours; a pair of our shears were also found - the goods were all found in the shop - Loynes came in just as we entered; he is a small tailor or piece-broker; Lincoln said he had a search-warrant - he made no reply to that; when we found the things, he said he had bought them of the boy - we had not mentioned any boy; he said the boy's father had been there that morning asking for work: I laid hold of a superfine coat in the shop; he said "That don't belong to you" but when I laid hold of the shears he seemed to nod assent to their being mine; whenever I touched anything that was not mine, he said"That don't belong to you." I had not mentioned my name, or even the boy's name; we only said we had a search-warrant - about thirteen gross of buttons were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had Brennock been with you? A. He came about March last. When I sent for him he cried, and said he hoped I would not prosecute him; I said I would make no promise, but he had better tell the truth, because he was telling a parcel of lies; he cried and said he wanted to see his father.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not offer to take your oath that you would not prosecute him? A. No; I certainly said nothing about my oath - I said he might see his father, but did not say I would send for his father if he would give up the duplicates, or anything of the sort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you know his father? A. Yes; he is a tailor and had worked for me many years; Loynes keeps an open shop - he made no objection to my searching; I found some of the things on the top of a cupboard.</p>

            . I an an officer. I went to Mr. Dolan's on the 30th of April, and saw Brennock; I asked if he knew anything of the silver spoons; he took Mr. Dolan to the dust-hole and they brought four duplicates; I found a memorandum on him - after Mr. Dolan had said he had better speak the truth I went with him to the rag-hole, he pointed out a bag containing two pieces of linen and a pair of shoes; he said he had taken a great quantity of things and disposed of them to Loynes in Cleveland-street - I went there with a search-warrant, Loynes came in at the same time with us; I told him I had a warrant to search for cloth and other things, and that there was a boy in custody - I did not mention either the boy's name or Mr. Dolan's. Mr. Dolan's evidence is correct; I got on a stool, and found the shears on the top of a cupboard - the boy said he had sold them to him for 4s. - Mr. Dolan said the blue cloth was made expressly to his order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you present when Mr. Dolan was speaking to the boy? A. Not all the time; I heard something about his father - as near as I can recollect, the boy said if he would send for his father he might say something; Mr. Dolan said nothing about taking his oath; or that he would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You told Loynes a boy was in custody? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to you. - A. Yes, on the 15th of February, near two o'clock in the day, she told me she came by the order of Miss Sarah Lisley, of High Wickham, Buckinghamshire; she was to look out some handkerchiefs and lace; about two years since I had seen the prisoner at Miss Lisley's. I had no doubt but what it was right, she said she wanted them on Miss Lisley's account; I shewed her some silk handkerchiefs. I gave full credit to her story.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was Miss Lisley a customer of yours. - A. She was, and is now. She looked at eight pieces of bandana silk handkerchiefs, six pair of silk stockings, and some lace.</p>
               <p>Q. How many silk handkerchiefs altogether. - 
               <persName id="t18080406-102-person965">A. </persName>
            Seventy five silk handkerchiefs that together with the silk stockings is of the value of twenty three pounds nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards of lace. - A. One hundred and nine value thirty five pound, six shillings and one penny. After they was looked out, she told me she must take them with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060068"></xptr>her, to go down by the coach that runs through High Wickham, as some officers who were customers of Miss Lisley would be disappointed if Miss Lisley had not the handkerchiefs after the parcel was entered and tied up; I went down to the Bull and Mouth, put the parcel into the seat of the coach, and assisted the prisoner to get into the coach, then I parted with her. I made Miss Lisley debtor for it in my books.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see miss Bumstead. - A. She ordered a piece of black silk handkerchief to be sent down to Miss Lisley; that is the way I discovered the fraud.</p>
               <p>Q. When afterwards did you see these goods. - A. Not till I saw them at Guildhall.</p>

On the 17th of September, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and asked to see a pair of black worsted stockings. I took a pair down from the door and gave them to her, she said she would not have them, but would have a pair out of a bundle; the bundle was reached down and opened - she looked at them a long time, and I saw her slip a pair down on the floor. I stood at her side. After looking at them some time she stooped down and put her hand into her pocket-hole, and drew them up under her clothes into her pocket - the bundle got lose, and I thought she had taken another pair. I said "Do you intend to have a pair?" she then offered me 15 d. for a pair, but I refused them for less than 18 d. She walked to the door. I followed, tapped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240033"></xptr>her on the shoulder, and said</p>
               <p>"Give me the stockings you have taken." She said she had none, and presently put her hand down and dropped them down the same way she had drawn them up; she put them on the counter; and said there is your stockings. She only returned one pair. She was going away, I said, "I rather think you have another pair, and I will send for an officer." She said she had no more. I sent for an officer. We found three pair on her, one of them was ours. She had only 11 1/2 d. in her pocket. We live in Whitechapel-road.</p>

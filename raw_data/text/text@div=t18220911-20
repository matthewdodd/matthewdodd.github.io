I felt my watch drawn from my fob, and found three of my waistcoat buttons unbuttoned. I looked round immediately, and saw it in the prisoner's hand - he put it in the flap of his trowsers. I took hold of his arm, and asked for it - he said he would not deliver it. He ran against another man, took it out, and it fell on the ground. I picked it up, and called Stop thief! he then hit me in the eye, and made off, but was stopped going over the wharf. He was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You say he said he would not deliver it - A. Yes. He did not say he had not got it; but that he would not deliver it. I did not strike him. I cannot be mistaken in him.</p>

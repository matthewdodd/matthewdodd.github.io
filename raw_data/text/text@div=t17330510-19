It was broke open on the 10th of September in the Night I lost 31 Suits of lac'd Headcloths, they were taken out of the 31 small Boxes that stood by the Window, but the Boxes were left behind; 7 Ounces of narrow open silver Lace, 12 Yards of broad silver Lace, and 5 Yards of narrow silver Lace, 3 Yards of black Velvet cut out for a Scarfe, and a red silk Lining for it; 18 Pair of Manteel Tassels, a sattin Gown, a Shift, an Apron, a Point-lace Neckcloth and Ruffles; 17 back Heads with Lace, 14 Suits of Nightclothes, and other Things. On the 25th of April, this back Head - 'tis new Brussels Lace, and cost me 20 Guineas - was brought to my Shop to be sold by Eliz. Eager: I presently knew it to be one of those that I had lost, and therefore enquir'd how she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100013"></xptr> came by it: She said she had it from Mrs. Broadhurst in Monmonth-street. Upon farther Enquiry, I found that Mrs. Broadhurst had it from Mrs. Slurrow in Westminster ; Mrs. Slurrow from Mrs. Sanders, and she from the Prisoner. I obtain'd a search Warrant from my Lord Mayor, and went with Mrs. Sanders and others to the Prisoner's House in Pye-Corner. In the Table Drawer below Stairs I found this Pair of minteel red Tassels with white Bugles; I can safely swear to 'em, for I know 'em from a thousand; I had 'em made on Purpose to suit the Fancy of a particular Lady. My Wife and Brother, and the Constable, went up Stairs with the Prisoner, and brought down with them these 12 pair of black manteel Tassels, which I verily believe are part of those I lost. Then the Prisoner himself put his Hand behind some Pewter on a Shelf, and took out these two Brussels Lace Suits, and gave them to my Brother. We ask'd the Prisoner how he came by these Goods; he said he bought a Handkercherful of these and other things of a Woman in Rag-Fair. - At first he said for 3 Guineas, but afterward for 3 l. 8 s. And he said he believ'd he cou'd find the Person out if he might have his Liberty to look for her. We did not care to trust him alone, but went with him; he carried us into a House where a large Company of Men were sitting round a Table: He call'd to one of them, and said, Hark ye, Are not you the Man I bought the Lace of? - I the Man! says the other, No; I know nothing of it. Why then I am mistaken, says the Prisoner. By his asking a Man this Question when he had told us but a little before that he had them from a Woman, we found he was only shuffling with us, and so we carried him before a Magistrate, and then he said he had all the Things from Mrs. Sanders.</p>
               <p>Court. What Business did the Prisoner follow?</p>
               <p>Lear. I suppose he <rs id="t17330510-19-deflabel107" type="occupation">dealt in old Cloaths</rs>

               <p>Mrs. Lear. On the 10th of December, between 10 and 11 at Night, we left the Shop all fast and went to Bed, and between 5 and 6 in the morning we were call'd up, and round we had been robb'd; several Holes had been bored in the Pannel of the outer Window Shutter, and then the Pannel was slit down and so taken out: A Piece of Woollen of the Colour of the Shutters was nail'd over the Hole and daub'd with Clay. Thro' this Hole they had push'd back the inner Shutters, and so taken the Goods off of two Shelves next the Window. without getting quite into the House. Behind the Counter lay the 31 empty Boxes and a Parcel of Cloaths that had been push'd down. - This Head I took out of the Prisoner's Pocket. - I'll tell ye the whole Tale presently. - I can swear to all these Goods, and to this red and white Tasse particularly.</p>
               <p>Juryman. I think you said it was in December that your Shop was broke open.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lear. December, did I say? - Then I mistook. - It was in September. - On the 25th of April,

Why says she, he has often told me that he liv'd in Peter's-Street; but I sent my Maid one Day to watch him, and so I found that he liv'd in Pye Corner. So we got a Warrant and went thither, and ask'd him if he had given that Head to Mrs. Sanders. He deny'd it at first, but afterwards own'd it. Have you got any more such in the House? says I; no, says He; I had indeed more of this old fashion'd Lace, but I have sold it all. And where did you get it? says I. Why, says he, I bought it of a Gentlewoman in Rag-fair, over against the dead Wall; I had a Handkercherful of it for three Guineas. Three Guineas? says I. No, says he, now I remember, it was 3 l. 8 s. We found this pair of red Tassels in a Drawer below, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100014"></xptr> then my Brother and I and the Constable went up and found 12 pair of bugle Tassels. There was a Coat hanging up; I ask'd the Prisoner if it was his, and he said, Yes. I search'd the Pockets and took out this lac'd Head. Now, says I, this is plain Proof against you, and therefore you may as well confess. Why then, says he, there's more below. So he went down with us, and took these two Heads from behind some Pewter, and gave them to my Brother. And now, says he, if you'll let me have my Liberty, I'll find the Woman I bought 'em of. And so you'll run away, says I. No, says he, I'll give my Bond that I won't. Your Bond? says I, that would be a fine Security indeed! No, we'll call a Coach and go together. And so away we went, and he carried us to a House where there was a Parcel of Thieves sitting round a Table, and he beckon'd to one of them, and said,

            . I keep a Chandler's Shop in Great St. Anne's-Lane, Westminster; my Husband is a House-Painter. The Prisoner has known me from a Child, for my Father was a Serjeant in the Guards, and the Prisoner was then a Soldier: And so he came to see me about 3 or 4 Weeks before last Christmas. He brought a blue Bag with him, but there was nothing in it then, and he only ask'd me how I did, and the like, and so went away again. But the next time he came, he brought 9 Ells of Linnen in the Bag to sell. He ask'd 13 d. a Yard; I bid him 11 d. and at last we agreed for 9 s. 6 d for the whole. He came again a Week after with the same blue Bag, and ask'd me if I knew any Body that would buy a Suit of lac'd Headclothes. I told him I did not want myself, but I would enquire among my Acquaintance He said the Price was 18 s. and so he left 'em with me, and I afterwards sold 'em to Eliz. Grindley, a very honest Woman. She was acquainted with Houses of Fashion, and knew where to dispose of such Things, and I had no Suspicion of the Prisoner, for I knew he dealt in old Clothes, and always took him for a very honest Man. On the Friday before the 25th of April he came and told me his two Daughters were going to be pass'd to another Parish, and then he shew'd me this lac'd Head, which he said he bought of the Duchess of Richmond's Gentlewoman, and he desir'd me to dispose of it for him. He bid me ask eight Guineas. I carry'd it to Mrs. Slurrow's (while he staid in my Shop) and she bid me six Guineas. I came back to tell him, and he bid me take the Money. I went again, but she had not the Money ready, and so I laid down four Guineas and a half, which my Maid paid him before two Witnesses, and he was to call next Day for the rest of the Money; he accordingly came, but she had not paid me; he came again next Tuesday, but the Money was not ready then neither; so that he never had it, for the Affair was discover'd presently after. Mrs. Slurrow brought Mrs. Lear to me, and said, she would have the Head if she could be sure that it was honestly come by. To satisfy them, I went with them to the Prisoner's House. He was not at home, but we staid till he came in. How do you do, Mr. Adley? says I. This Gentlewoman would buy the Head you left with me to dispose of, but she's scrupulous about its being honestly come by. Who are you ? says he, I don't know you, I never saw you in my Life before. I was surpris'd at this, but when they told him they had got a Search-warrant, he own'd that he gave me a Head, but he said he did not know it again. However, at last he confess'd, that that was the very Head he had left with me. This other lac'd Head I had got

Now, you must know, that now and then I happen to get a little merry, as any other Body may do, and then I say any thing that comes uppermost; so coming into Mrs. Sanders's House in one of these merry Fits, there was she and the Prisoner, a sitting by the Fire; and says Mrs Sanders to me, This is the old Man that I have had all the lac'd Heads from. Ay, says I, and pray, old Gentleman, how do you come by such Things? Why, I'll tell you, says he, my Daughter lives with a Woman that is kept by a Jew in the Minories, and this Jew gives his Mistress these Things for Pocket Money, and she sends them to me by my Daughter to sell for her, and so I bring them to Mrs. Sanders. And so Mrs. Sanders gave 'em to me to dispose of 'em as well as I could; and this Head I sold to Madam Dell, a Town Lady, for three Guineas, and this to Mrs. Martin, who keeps Martin's Coffee-house at Charing-Cross. I was bid to ask six Guineas for it. Mrs. Clapham, at the Golden-Anchor, bid me two Guineas; I try'd at some other Shops, and at last I let Mrs. Martin have it for three Guineas and a half. I sold her another Head afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lear. And that, Mrs. Martin sold again to a Jew; but we cannot yet produce it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin. I bought two Heads of Mrs. Grindley, one of them I sold * to Mr. Bray, a young Gentleman, who said he bought it for a Present. - This is very like it.</p>
               <p>* For Twelve Guineas.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lear. Like it? Why, is it not the very same? Did not he make a Present of it to Mrs. Murray ? and did not I find it upon Mrs. Murray ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Grindley. Did you never say that you sold those two Heads at a Brandy Shop? now you swear you sold 'em at a Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100016"></xptr>Grindley. What if I did? Mrs. Martin keeps a Coffee-house over a Brandy-shop.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin. I let the lower Floor of my House for 25 l. a Year, to Mr. Capstick, a Distiller. Mrs. Grindley, it seems, brought this Head to Mrs. Capstick, who shew'd it to me, and ask'd my Advice about it, whether it would make a Suit of Head-clothes for her. It was cut and mangled, and very dirty. I told her there would be many Joinings in it, and therefore I thought it was fitter for a Back-head than a Suit [for a Suit has four Lappets, and a Back-head but two.] Then she said she would not buy it, and ask'd me if I thought I could dispose of it for an Acquaintance of hers. What is she? says I. A very honest Woman, says Mrs. Capstick; I know her very well, her Husband runs Goods. This Woman (which was Mrs. Grindley ) came in, and I ask'd her whose Head it was? and she said it belong'd to a Cap woman who had it from her Cull. How came it to be cut so? says I. Why, says she again, she's a very maggotly Creature, and she cut it when she was drunk. I bid Money for it then, but she refus'd it and went away. She came three or four times afterwards, and at last I bought it, and some Time after, I bought another of her; she came at several other Times with other Heads, but I did not buy any more than those two.</p>

            . I lodge in Mrs. Sanders's House. I was sitting in her Shop about Christmas last, when the Prisoner came in with a Bag under his Arm. He pull'd a Band-box out of his Bag and unty'd it, and shew'd Mrs. Sanders a Parcel of Tassels, and said to her, I have got these Tassels to sell, do you know any Body that will buy them? No, says she, except this young Woman, (meaning me) for she has liv'd with an Old-Clothes Woman, and may know how to dispose of them. Then he told me he'd give me 6 d. to sell 'em for him. I took them from him, and he bid me ask 2 s. a Pair for the large, and 18 d. for the small ones. These are the same, I can swear.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lear. And these mourning Tassels I found in the Prisoner's Drawer.</p>
               <p>A Wilden. I went to the Gentlewoman's House, where I had been a Servant, and she said they were a perfect Drug, and that she would not give 2 s. for 'em all. I have seen the Prisoner several times at Mrs. Sander's House, and have seen her give him Money, both Gold and Silver. I have known her from a Child; she's as honest a Woman as ever liv'd, and her Husband bears a very good Character.</p>

The Prisoner came into my Mistress's Shop, and sat down in the great Chair and pull'd out some Head-clothes, and ask'd her if she could not be so good as to sell them for him. My Mistress would have had me to have gone, but he desir'd her to go herself; for he said it was a lac'd Suit that he had from the Duchess of Richmond's, and would have her ask eight Guineas for it. I have seen my Mistress pay him Money several times, and once she gave me in the Yard four Guineas and a half for him, and I carry'd it in and paid it to him.</p>

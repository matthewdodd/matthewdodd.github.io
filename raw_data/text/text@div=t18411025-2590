                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Horwood; we live in Star-court, Southwark. On Friday, the 13th of August, I and my hus<lb></lb>band were in Farringdon-street—the prisoner, whom I did not know, came and asked if I could tell her where she could get a lodging—I said no, I was a stranger—she said she was a servant, and had had a few words with her mistress, had just left her place, she had no friends in London, and if she was in the street all night she should die—I told my husband—he said</p>

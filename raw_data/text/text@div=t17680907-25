               <p>Q. Was any thing said to him to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Rayner. He was desired to tell what else he had done, which would be the only way to save himself; he confessed he had concealed a bag of tobacco in the stable; we went there and found a box and a bag, with each tobacco in them; the box weighed nine pounds, and the bag seventy-four pounds.</p>

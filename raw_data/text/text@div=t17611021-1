               <p>Smith. It is what they make trimmings for womens cardinals of; it is in the weaving way.</p>

               <p>Smith. I have known him 20 years, but never employed him.</p>

            . On the 26th of September the prisoner came into my master (Mr. Smith's) dye-house, to ask for work; I said my master was not at home; he staid in the dye-house about 10 minutes, and took his leave of me; and instead of going out at the door, he went up-stairs. I followed him, and saw his pocket stand out. I charged him with having some silk in his pocket. He immediately pulled out some knitting silk, and begged of me to excuse it, and say nothing about it. [Produced in court by the constable.] This is it, it was delivered into the constable's hands when he was charged with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that silk?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the property of a person I do business for; I had the charge of it, and it was under my care, with five or 600 weight more.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176110210003"></xptr>Q. from Prisoner. Whether when he came upstairs after me, he did not say, What have you in your pocket? I said, nothing, and he went into the chimney, and picked up this silk.</p>
               <p>Pratten. When I charged him with having something in his pocket, he took this silk out of his pocket, and threw it into the chimney, and I took it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had no thoughts of touching the silk, I went to ask for work, being out of business; I saw only that young man; I imagined Mr. Smith might have more men at work, and it is customary to ask them all to drink a draught of beer. I went up to see if there were any men at work above; he, seeing me go up stairs, followed me; I was turning down again; he said, I had taken something.</p>

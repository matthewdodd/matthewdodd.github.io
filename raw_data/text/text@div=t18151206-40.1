            . I am a City constable. I saw the three prisoners at the bar, on the 9th of November; they were pointed out to me by Johnson; they were in <placeName id="t18151206-40-crimeloc220">Bridge-street, Blackfriars</placeName>

We saw them attempting gentlemen's pockets; they hurstled a gentleman, and I saw Collins take a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket; I was within half a yard of them; they were all three together. I then lost both them and the gentleman. The next time I saw the prisoners, was on the return of the procession; I then observed them at the corner of King street, Cheapside; they were attempting to pick pockets then. We watched them until the procession had nearly got in; they then went down Trump street, King street, into Lawrance lane, and took handkerchiefs out of their pockets, and put them round their necks; I saw Allsop in particular; I found three round his neck, and three in his pocket. I then saw Collins had one, and a pair of gloves, in his pocket. The other prisoner had nothing upon him. (Produces the handkerchiefs.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. I had known Thompson before; the others were strangers. My attention was drawn to them, by Johnson. I could not take them in Bridge street, although I was so near to them.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Bolland. As soon as I had sufficient assistance, and an opportunity, I took them.</p>

            . My attention was draw to the prisoners at about half past one, or nearly two, after the procession had taken water; they were round the Lord Mayor's carriage; there was a great mob, and the three prisoners were very active in picking pockets; they were all three together. I observed them during nearly three quarters of an hour. I saw them put their hands into many pockets round the carriage. I was obliged to go after some others. I saw them again when the procession came from Westminster, between three and four; they were then altogether, and hustling. I left them, whilst I went to apprehend some others.</p>

            . I am a constable, but was not on duty. I observed all three of the prisoners; I first saw them at the corner of King-street; they were then attempting gentlemen's pockets; I watched them for nearly an hour. They turned down Trump-street, into Lawrence lane, and there I saw the shortest, Allsop, putting something round his neck. We then followed them to the gate of Guildhall yard, and then we took Allsop at the corner of Cateaton street; he said, he had no handkerchiefs, and we found three round his neck, and three in his pocket. I was present when Thompson was apprehended, and one was round his neck. I am certain the three prisoners are the men.</p>

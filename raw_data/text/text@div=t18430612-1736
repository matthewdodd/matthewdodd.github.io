                  </hi>. I am master of the school of the West London Union, for the education of the children of the poor—the school-house is in Meeting-house-lane, Edmonton—the house and property are in my charge—I reside there—the servants there are paupers, receiving parish relief, and doing the work for that relief—they are entirely under my control—I have the entire management of the house—on the night of the 31st of May, I saw all the premises fastened up at eleven o'clock, every part of them, and between two and three o'clock in the morning I was alarmed by the house-dog bark<lb></lb>ing—I went down stairs about half-past two, listened tome minutes, heard nothing, and finding things as I had left them, went up again—I was alarmed again in about half an hour, by the dog barking—I went down, and heard a rustling noise in the house—I went up, dressed myself, came down, and found the scullery-door open, which had been fastened the night before—I proceeded to examine the window, and found three wooden bars were removed from the pantry-window, which window is outside, in the yard—the yard is between the house and the road—there is a store-room at the back of the house, quite distinct from the pantry—it appeared to me that an iron bar had been forced out of its place at the store-room window—the store-room and pantry are all under the same roof—the scullery it between them—an entry appeared to have been effected into the store-room, by removing on iron bar from the out-side—a person could not get from the store-room to the pantry, as the store-room was locked—I found foot-marks of mud in the store-room, but nothing gone from there—that window is at the back of the house, but the pantry window at the side—I missed from the pantry a loaf of bread, the remains of a loin of lamb, and some butter—that is the property of the guardians of the West London Union—a person could get into the pantry, by breaking the wooden bars down—I afterwards found the prisoners together in a water-closed by the store-room window outside the building—I saw some crumbs of bread on the seat of the privy, and some small pieces of fat, similar to mutton fat—some butter rolled in a handkerchief, and part of a rushlight—it appeared somebody had been eat<lb></lb>ing, and dropped the crumbs on the seat—I believe the butter had come form the pantry, as about that quantity was missing—I weigh it out for the inmates—we had rushlights of a similar description in the pantry—I collared the pri<lb></lb>soners, and said, "You vagabonds, what business have you here?" they said they came for a night's lodging—I said, "Who broke down the bars of the pantry-window?"—they said, "Some of your boys might have done it; "but all our boys were up in bed, and it was not done when I went to bed at night—I held them till I gave them in charge.</p>

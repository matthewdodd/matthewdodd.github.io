                  </hi>. I reside at No. 68, Pall Mall, in the pa<lb></lb>rish of St. James, Westminster. I am a watch and clock maker, em<lb></lb>polyed by many of the government establishments—the prisoner was in my service in 1834, and had been so about seven years—I believed him, up to that time, to be an honest man—I should not have kept him if I had not—on the 23d of June he ceased coming to my house, with<lb></lb>out any apparent cause—I made enquiries and could not discover him—I made search about my premises, and missed four clocks—I have a very extension stock, so that it would be difficult to miss any—with<lb></lb>out my attention being called to it, I was not likely to discover it for some time—I had bills printed, and took every means to find the prisoner—in January last, in consequence of some information, I processed to Bir<lb></lb>mingham, and took a Birmingham policeman, and found the prisoner at work at a clock-maker's—I instantly took him on this charge, and went immediately to his lodgings—I made use of no promise or threat to induce him to make any statement to me—the prisoner said precisely this, "It is now all over; I may as well tell you where the four clocks are that I took"—he then described where he pawned them all four, describing the streets accurately, but he could not remember the names of the pawnbrokers—he gave me the name of Eaton-street, Pimlico; a pawnbroker's, in Prince-street; opposite Gerard-street; a pawnbroker's in Green-street, Leicester-square; and a pawnbroker's in Westminster-road, a little way on the left hand</p>

               <p>side—he further told me he had pawned one clock in Eaton-street, in his own name; and the other three clocks in the name of Charles Johnson—I went to the three pawnbrokers he described, but found the three clocks had been all sold, being out of time—I found one at Eaton-street—we searched his drawers, in which he kept his tools, as soon as we ascertained he had run away, and found a clock-winder, which winds this clock.</p>

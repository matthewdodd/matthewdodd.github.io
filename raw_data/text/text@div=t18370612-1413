                  </hi> I live in New Bridge-street, Blackfriars. On the 24th of May I lost some Tuscan straw-plait—this is it—I have seen the prisoner, Pearson, repeatedly in my warehouse, and Sawyer many times, coming to buy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Briggs, of Blue Boar-court, Friday-street. About five o'clock in the evening on the 25th of May, I saw the three prisoners at the corner of Bridge-street, Blackfriars—I did not know them before—they formed themselves into a triangle position—I saw Smith pull up her clothes, and take some plait from under her gown—she drew it under her shawl—I saw two policemen near, and told them—as soon as they saw the policemen, Smith gave the plait to Sawyer, and she retreated back again—I was not near enough to tell the policemen—I took hold of her, and said, "What have you got here?—you did not come by this rightly"—I took it from her, and held it up to the policemen—I told them to take the other two, and said where I thought they had got it from—they were not more than twenty yards from the prosecutor's shop—we took them into the shop, and there was a box of the same sort stand<lb></lb>ing on the end of the counter—I did not see them walking from the shop—they might have met each other near the shop.</p>

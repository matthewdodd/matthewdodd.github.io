            . I am a gardener, and live at Kensington-gravel-pits. On the 23d of April, about ten o'clock, the prisoner and another ran past me; the other had a basket under his arm - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw Mr. Brand running after them - I ran and overtook them in Elms-lane - I detained the prisoner till Mr. Brand came up; a witness said they had thrown the things over a hedge - I went and got them, and gave them to Mr. Brand; there was a tea-pot a spoon, and a basket with some sharings over them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you see any one else? A. Yes, another man close by him; they were walking when they passed by me, and then they set off running, when they got about two hundred yards. - The prisoner did not try to make his escape; I held him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner and another man in company together; the other had a basket - they were both running. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw Evans stop the prisoner, who said he had done nothing. I saw the other man throw a basket away, just as he got by me. I heard the prisoner tell him to do so twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure you heard that? A. Yes - they were not more than three yards from me; I was in the road - they had turned a corner, and were running towards me, as I was delivering some beer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. I was coming towards my own gate, and saw the other come out, and the prisoner waiting there; I do not know whether the prisoner touched the basket; there were some shavings in the basket.</p>

            . I was upon Tower-hill at the same time; Mr. Fowler said to me, he thought them three or four chaps (of whom the prisoner was one) were pickpockets; we took notice of them; as soon as Mr. Kingham came, they had their eyes upon him; as he was going up to the ring, they followed him directly, and I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of Mr. Kingham's pocket; then Mr. Fowler took hold of the prisoner's wrist, and took the handkerchief from him, and we secured him.</p>

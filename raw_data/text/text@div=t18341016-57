            . I am a policeman. On the morning in question, I was on duty about half-past two o'clock - there was a cry of police - I ran towards the alarm, and saw Harris standing at the shop-door in his shirt - he gave me information, and I saw the shop-window broken open, and the shutters on one side - he said three men had run down Dock-street - I followed down the street, and into two dark places, and at the bottom of the street I looked to my right up East Smithfield - I saw Trower and Cummings, two policemen - I came up to the three prisoners in a dark corner in Cooper's-court, Blue-anchor-yard, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's - they were in the corner of the court - it is a large wide court - I took Smith who had a glazed hat on - I brought him outside, and sprung my rattle - two other constables came down, and we went in search of the sugar, and found it inside a door where they were standing - the other two prisoners were taken - I showed the loaf of sugar to Harris as I passed the shop with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether any people lived in the house in which you found the sugar? A. There were some people up the stairs - they were in bed - I went up stairs and searched the whole house - the sugar was in an empty room on the ground-floor - the prisoner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160041"></xptr>were in a dark corner of the court close to the door of the house - when I put my hand on Smith he was about a yard from the door - the door of the house was closed - one of the constables gave it a gentle push, and it opened - if it was fastened it was very slightly done - we went in, and in the empty room we found the sugar in the middle of the floor.</p>
               <p>JESSE TROWER. I am a policeman. I was on duty - directly the alarm was given I went into White's-yard and into Blue-anchor-yard - I was in company with the sailor Evans- Clay came to my assistance - I was with him when the prisoners were found - I did not see the sugar found - I found the prisoners in the corner of Cooper's-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the court from Crook's? A. It might be four or five hundred yards - about a quarter of a mile, but I cannot say exactly - I opened one or two doors in the house, but my prisoner was rather restive, and I proceeded to the station-house - I did not open the door of the house the sugar was in - Cummings was with us.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which prisoner had you in charge? A. Maney - when I first took him I went into one house, and when I came out he tried to make his escape - I called the sailor to go with me to the station-house, and as we went along Maney said, if he was as big as I was he would see me *** before I should take him, using a bad word.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who opened the door where the sugar was found? A. I do not know; I did not see it found - the prosecutor's house is between four and five hundred yards from the court, I imagine.</p>

               <p>Maney's Defence.

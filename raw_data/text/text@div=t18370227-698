                  </hi>. I am the landlord of this house. I let Taylor and Rugg live in it rent free, as Taylor was of service to me, being an ingenious man—they lived in the kitchen—they are poor—he never ac<lb></lb>counted to me for two sovereigns from my tenants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Edith Taylor's Defence.</hi> On Sunday, about a quarter past six o'clock, Mrs. Hill, the prisoner, came down to me, and asked me whether I would come up stairs, as the prosecutor was gone to chapel; and would I come of and assist her—my old man said, "For God's sake, Do not"—I went out, and got two pennyworth of coals; and then she came down, and said, "I am all right; pray come up, and hold me a candle"—which I did—the staple was drawn, and the door open—I took the candle into the room, and on the table there was a watch and some silver, but what I do not know—she said, "I will not be satisfied with this, I will have more, as I know he has got more"—she put her hand on the box—she came down stairs and brought the candle, and put it on the table, to give her husband when he came in—she beckoned me out, and I went with her to Brown's tide door—we had a quartern of gin—she went to pay a shilling, but instead of a shilling it was a sovereign—she asked me, in the morning, whether I would take the key up—next morning she came down, and knocked at our door—the old man got up, but I went to sleep, and do not know what passed—when I got up he was out—in the course of the morning Mrs. Hill was in ray room, quite angry because he was out drinking—in the evening he came home, and she took turn out into the passage—on the Tuesday morning she came down, and asked me to bring that bag along, but not to go the road she did—I looked into the bag, and there were twelve sovereigns—I gave them to her, and she said, "Now I will go, and they may take me up, for they shall never find it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">John Taylor's Defence.</hi> I have heard several times from Mrs. Hill that she would open the door, and get the money out which the prosecutor had—we had heard he had money, and she intended to leave her husband—I did not hear any thing of it; but in the course of the Friday before (I am in he habit of fitting different keys to locks) she brought down a small key—was doing a padlock for a person—she said she had a key that would fit it—I had the key nearly finished for the padlock—I hung it on a nail when finished, and there it remained—I never looked to see if the key was gone out of it till I saw it in the possession of Murray.</p>

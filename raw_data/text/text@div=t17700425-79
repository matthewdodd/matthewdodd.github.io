On the 18th of this month, there was a large piece of beef dressed on account of Mr. Alderman Wilkes's enlargement. I saw the prisoner in the kitchen about eight; he was helping Mrs. Hatton and the maid to spit the meat. He had had a quarrel with his uncle, who is of the same employ as I am. I indulged him to let him lie in my bed for three or four nights, and I lay out of it myself. I had lent him a cane the Sunday fortnight before: when I saw him below, I asked him for it; he said he would go and get it: he went out; I saw no more of him that day. I went out, and returned about eight at night. I asked if they had seen the prisoner: I was told he had been there, but was suddenly missed. I went to bed, and the next morning I awaked about six. I missed my watch, my money out of my left-hand breeches pocket, a quarter guinea and ten shillings: my keys were gone, and my drawers open; my silver buckle out of my shoes. I alarmed Mrs. Hatton: she and her sister got up; we went down stairs, and found the door was left upon the slip-lock; three bolts were left undone. I had heard a bad character of the prisoner; I suspected him. I went in search of him, and found him in a boat along-side a vessel, about eight o'clock that morning. I took him, and brought him home, and sent for an officer, and brought him before my lord mayor. I found one buckle, one seal, and the knife upon him there. He confessed my watch was on board the Nelly,

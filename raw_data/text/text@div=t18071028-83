               <p>Q. Did you lose a silver watch at any time. - A. Yes, on the 5th of July; I was outside of the door talking to the prisoner; I went into my lodging and then I found that my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it. - A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had your watch in your pocket before this man came up to speak to you. - A. I only came out of the public house, he called and spoke to me, and when I went in my own house, I found he had robbed me of my watch; I had my watch when I was at the public house I was tipsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked at your watch to see what time it was when you were in the public house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner assist you to get you home. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280062"></xptr>Yes, he saw me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any one with you besides the prisoner. - A. No one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before. - A. I saw him only once before. After I got in doors I missed my watch; I went out of doors in about two or three minutes to try to overtake the man; I found the outside case where we were standing; the outside case was loose. Before the next morning I sent to the prisoner to ask him if he knew any thing about my watch; he said he would go the next Sunday and swear to the clergyman that he knew nothing about my watch, but he did not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch again. - A. Yes, I saw it at the pawnbrokers, a great while after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know your watch again when you saw it. - A. Yes, if I do not know that watch among a hundred watches, I will take all the blame to myself and stand in his shoes. I sold the outside case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He is swearing to what is not fair, he swears that there was nobody with him but me; there was a young man with us, he is gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was a young man near a hundred yards off; there was no man at the door, he was waiting for him.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker at Poplar; I know the prisoner perfectly well, he pawned a silver watch, on Monday the 6th of July, in the forepart of the day; it wanted an outside case. I advanced him eight shillings on it.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEE. I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner on the 15th of August; I took him to Shadwell office. Mr. Rogers searched him, and found this duplicate of the silver watch upon him.</p>
               <p>Lloyd. That is the same duplicate I gave the prisoner upon his pawning the watch.</p>

He asked me to go and drink with his friend, we went to several public houses, he had his watch out; when we were all drinking together, he then took me home to shew me where he lived, to come and see him on the next Sunday; there was a young man, and two more with us when we parted, but they are in the country to work.</p>

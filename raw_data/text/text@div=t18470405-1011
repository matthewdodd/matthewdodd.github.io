                  </hi> I am a private watchman in Wellington-street, Upper-street, Islington. On the 22d of March, at twenty minutes to four o'clock in the morning, I was on duty there, and saw the prisoner Stevens—I asked him his business—he said he wished to go to the Angel at Islington—he trembled very much, and seemed distressed for breath—one of his coat pockets looked rather bulky—I asked him what he had got about him, and said I should like to search him—he said I might if I thought proper—I did so and took two table and three tea-spoons out of his pocket, wrapped in a hand<lb></lb>kerchief—they were silver—I asked where he got them—he said he picked them up in the street just before he came there—I took him to the station—he was searched, and two salt-spoons and other property found on him—he had a pair of boots on—he was asked by Inspector Thatcher whether he found the boots as well as the other property—he said, no, they were his own, that he bought them with his own money.</p>

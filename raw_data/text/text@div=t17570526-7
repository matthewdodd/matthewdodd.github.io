               <p>Q Do you sell such hats and pumps in your shop?</p>
               <p>Nowling. I do not; I had them for my own wear.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular goods that you deal in did you lose out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Nowling. I deal in every thing else but the hats; pumps and candles. I inquired if any body had laid my hats and pumps out of the way, and particularly I asked the prisoner at the bar, who said he knew nothing of them. Some time afterwards he asked me if I had found them, adding that the plaisterers and bricklayers were sad chaps, thereby giving me to understand that it was probable some of them had taken them. On the 29th of April,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260007"></xptr> in the morning, the maid complain'd she had lost a handkerchief, which she had hung before the fire when she went to bed. Then I began to think it time to be as industrious as I could in finding out the thief, and decared I would find it out. I then went to Mr. Nixon, the master whom I employ'd to do the work, and told him the affair, and we agreed to take out a search warrant. The master, not knowing where the prisoner lived, dodged him home, and afterwards we went with the warrant and searched his lodgings, but found nothing. Then the constable advised me to take all the workmen up, to try who would confess; so I took out a warrant, but suspecting the prisoner only, I told the others my intention. I found he had left his work, but going to his lodging again I met with him, and gave the constable charge of him. In going down stairs he got the start of us and ran away, but we retook him, and carry'd him to justice St. Lawrance. There I said, Saunders, if you'll confess where the things are, so that I can get them again, I'll be favourable to you. He then beg'd I would talk to him by himself, so we went together, and he told me I should have all my things again. He said he knew of but one hat, and that was at a pawnbroker's in West-Street, Seven-Dials. His wife said she would go and fetch me the other hat and pumps. I asked her where they were. She said they were in the apartment of one

               <p>Q. Were the things open before him when he confess'd that?</p>

               <p>Q. Are these all goods that you bought to sell again in your shop?</p>
               <p>Nowling. They are all except one ribbon, which is my maid's. I ask'd him yesterday (because I would not have any one wrongfully accused) whether any body was concern'd with him. He own'd he took them himself, and nobody was privy to it.</p>

            . I am clerk to Charles Burrows, No. 12 Wharf, Regent's-canal - I was present when Mr. Burrows bought the barge "Emma" - the two prisoners were engaged for two or three days in getting the coals out - I saw John Willshaw take a chain out of the barge which had all the appearance of this, and throw it into the water - that was about the 23d of December - I asked him what it meant, and he said it was all right - James Willshaw was just by and must have heard it - I remember John Willshaw coming to me with an officer about the 6th of June - I was having my breakfast in the counting-house at the time - he said to me, "Do you wish to hang me, or have me transported; what is it about?" - I said it was about a chain that he threw into the water from the "Emma" barge - he said, "The chain I threw there lays there now, for so help me God, I never touched it; it is under the machine" - he pointed out the spot, and I, with the assistance of a man, raked there for nearly an hour - we found a small chain, but not the one he threw over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. This was so long ago as the 23d of December? A. Yes - it was not dark - we do not work in the dark - there were four persons at work there - no one saw him throw it over - I think he did not try to throw it on shore, it was too far for him - I am son-in-law to Mr. Burrows - I have had no quarrel with these men, nor has Mr. Burrows - one of them borrowed a shovel, and Mr. Burrows took him before a magistrate, and the charge was dismissed - I recollect walking on the side of a barge, and to save myself I took my hand out of my pocket and drew out half-a-crown, which the prisoners talked of looking for - I do not know whether they did or not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen that chain under the stern sheets? A. Yes, about five days before, when the barge went away from Chelsea before it was loaded - I know it is the same chain by a particular marked link in it, which I had marked by a blacksmith - you do not see one in five years marked like it.(

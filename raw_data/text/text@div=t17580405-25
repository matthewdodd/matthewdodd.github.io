            . I live at Wrexham in Denbighshire. On the 14th of December last, I wrote to Mr. Greenwoller's, in York-street, Covent-Garden, in which letter I inclosed a bill of 24 l. 10 s. and another of 10 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper.</p>
               <p>Pain. This is the very identical bill of 24 l. 10 s. I sealed the letter, but whether I or my servant carried it to the Post-Office, I am not certain; but this I am certain of, that I never send any to town with a bill in it, but that either I carry it to the office myself, or send him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>

               <p>Lankford. It is either his business or mine: all are put in either by himself or me if bills are in them.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Pyke. About a year and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. About the 14th of December, the letters that were put into the office, what care did you take of them ?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. I take particular care of all letters put into my office.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say any thing as to this particular letter now in question ?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. I remember there was a letter directed to Mr. Greenwollers's, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with those letters, at that time ?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. I put them in the London bag, and sent them as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go safe to town?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. There was no stay, or hindrance of it, as I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual when you send up letters to put in a bill of them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. It is, but we don't name the franks.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember this in particular ?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. Mr. Pain came to my house a post or two afterwards, and told me he had sent a letter, at that time, which he had had no answer to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this letter from your own knowledge, or from his telling you there was such a one?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. His telling me gave me some uneasiness, and upon my recollecting, I remembered particularly there was such a letter in the office, directed to Mr. Greenwollers's.</p>

            . I belong to the Post-Office. I remember the Chester mail did come in on the 16th of December last, containing all the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Wrexham bag in that Chester bag?</p>
               <p>Ravenhead. It was.</p>

               <p>Ravenhead. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened the Chester bag?</p>
               <p>Ravenhead. Mr. Baker did.</p>
               <p>Q. What day does the Chester mail come out from thence to arrive here on the 16th?</p>
               <p>Ravenhead. They are dispatched on the 14th from thence.</p>
               <p>Q. What day is the bill of the Wrexham bag dated?</p>
               <p>Ravenhead. That is dated the 14th.</p>
               <p>Q. to Baker. Do you remember the Chester mail coming to your office on the 16th of December?</p>
               <p>Baker. At this length of time I cannot tell, but if the post-master's bill was produced I could tell. (It is produced, he takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Baker. These are undoubtedly my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the meaning of these Bills?</p>
               <p>Baker. Mrs. Pyke has already declared, this is the account of what letters she sent that day. It appears what number there were, and when they came.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Pyke. Look on that paper, and give an account what it is?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pyke. This is the account of what letters came from Wrexham, on the 14th, my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Baker. These were received on the 16th, here is my own writing, we sign our names to them; they are part printed, and filled up by the postmasters in the country; and on their arrival we sign our names to them. I certainly received these, or I could not have signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the bag came in, was it sealed as usual?</p>
               <p>Baker. To the best of my remembrance it was, we always look at those things then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Potts. I am comptroller of the General Post Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar employed at the Post-Office, about the 16th of December last.</p>
               <p>Potts. He was employed as letter carrier, at that time, about Bloomsbury-square, to carry out for a man that was sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any concern with the letters sent to York-street, Covent-Garden?</p>
               <p>Potts. It appears this letter, now in question, was a frank letter. York-street is not in his walk, but it is in the same division; there are four of those letter carriers, and he used to be remarkably assiduous to fetch the frank letters; those<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050015"></xptr> four men take the letters and sort them, and any one may have those frank letters in his custody.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Pain. Was the letter you sent in a frank?</p>
               <p>Pain. It was a frank by Sir Lynch Cotton.</p>
               <p>Potts. I apprehend, when the prisoner thought this was for his purpose, he put it in his pocket, as one of them; fetches the letters for the whole seat, into the letter carrier's office, if there are six or seven carriers. I only prove the general course of the office, to shew that this letter directed to York-street, might come into the hands of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Potts. He was taken up about a fortnight or three weeks after, and I was with him before justice Fielding; he was there charged with taking this letter. At first he told an odd story, and would not own any thing; Mr. Fielding said to me, as you are his principal officer, may be he will say something to you. I said to the prisoner, have you a mind to say any thing to me, he said, sir, I should be glad to speak with you alone. We went together into a closet; the moment we were in the room, he dropped down on his knees, and with a flood of tears, said he was guilty; for he took the bill out of the letter; I said, is any other letter carrier, in our office, concerned with you in it? he said no, sir, not any body, he had ruined and undone himself; for he, himself, took it out of the letter, and there was nobody but a gentleman's servant, that was out of place, that persuaded him to the commission of the fact. When we came out of the room he repeated the same he had done there.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before the time of his confession tell him he should have mercy if he would tell the whole?</p>
               <p>Baker. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you make use of any threats in order thereto.</p>
               <p>Baker. No; not in the least.</p>

            . I have correspondence with Mr. Pain of Wrexham, in Denbighshire: I received a letter from him on the 30th of December last; the contents were that he had sent two bills in a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that letter you received?</p>
               <p>Greenwollers. That letter I have lost: I sent him a letter the post following, that no such letter came to hand. On the 6th of January I received another from him, with a copy of the bill for 24 l. 10 s. 2 d. I carried it to Mr. Tosier, in order to stop the payment; it being directed to Mr.

            . Mr. Greenwollers brought a copy of a draught to us; saying he had received advice of a draught being sent him from the country, that he had never received; and desired we would stop payment of it. We told him it had been brought to us, and we had accepted it. He said when it became due, he desired I would let him know; and about three weeks after that, it was brought to us by Mr. Griffith for payment, but I did not pay it; I am ready to pay it now.</p>

            . I keep a linen-draper's shop in Clare-market. Some time before Christmas, the prisoner came to my shop, and said he wanted a piece of cloth of about 2 s. per yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect the exact time.</p>
               <p>Griffith. As near as I can recollect, it was about the 23d of December; I looked him out a piece, he bought it, and three yards of Muslin for Neck-cloths, and two pocket handkerchiefs. The bill came to 3 l. 6 s. 6 d. he shewed me a bill of exchange, accepted by

               <p>Q. Look at this bill.</p>
               <p>Griffith. This is the same bill. I said pray where does this gentleman live; he told me. It was for 24 l. 10 s. I gave him full change, and deducted the 3 l. 6 s. 6 d. for my goods. When the bill became due, I went to his house in Billiter-square, to receive the money, and Mr. Tosier told me the money was ordered to be stopped.</p>

               <p>When I was before justice Fielding, I saw Mr. Potts there, he said, Martendale, you have been guilty of a very bad thing I believe. I said I had not. He said I had better confess it; and if I would, he would recommend me to the postmaster-general.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Potts. Did you say to him as he has mentioned ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Potts. No, I did not; all I said was, if there was any body belonging to the office guilty; with him, it might be of use to him to make a discovery. (The jury look at the bill, &amp;c.)</p>

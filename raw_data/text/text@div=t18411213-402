On the night of the 3rd of December my house was entered, and I lost the articles stated—one boot of a pair was left behind—this is it—the other boot was taken away—this now produced is it—the two form a pair—they are numbered—they were manufactured at Northampton—I got up at about half-past six, or a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant of the prosecutor's. I fastened up the house on the night of the 3rd of December—the back-door was bolted top and bottom inside—I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—the staircase-window was then close down—I came down a little before six in the morning—the nurse came down with me—the staircase-window was then a great way open, and the door from the passage to the shop stood wide open—the hasp was broken off—it had the appearance of having been forced open—the bolt was not pushed back—the back-door was open, and was kept open by the mat—I missed a quantity of boots and shoes from the shop, four spoons, an ironing-blanket which had been in the dresser-drawer, and a shawl of mine—some high steps were taken from the pas<lb></lb>sage and put to the yard-wall outside—they would be able to get out by standing on these steps and getting over the wall—they would then be in the highway.</p>

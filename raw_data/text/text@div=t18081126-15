            . I live at 34, Bevidere place, in the Borough. On Monday evening, the 17th of October, I was in the one shilling gallery of <placeName id="t18081126-15-crimeloc79">Drury lane theatre</placeName>

He pushed very much against me; I felt his hand against my waistcoat, he unbuttoned it all the way down; then after that I went and sat in the window in the passage. I sat there for almost an hour, then I went in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say any thing to him for feeling your waistcoat - A. No; I went out then to avoid him, then I went in again.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you sit down there that time - A. Why, the house was very full, I was very hot; then I went in again. Then he asked me what o'clock it was, he pushed very much against me again; I said I did not know rightly, I believed it was about ten; he says I want to know very particular, for I left my watch at home; then he pushed very much against me, as if in the crowd; I found his hand in my right hand breeches pocket; he pulled his hand out, jumped down, and said let be come by, I want to go out; he pushed by me. I found he had turned my pocket inside out; I jumped down after him, he run down stairs, I halloed out stop stief; they shut the check door and stopped him, I followed him instantly; the check keeper stopped him; they got Tredway the officer, he laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say what money you had in your pocket - A. Yes, I had three guineas in gold, two seven shilling pieces and some silver; I could not say exactly how much, it was in my right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you known that money was in your pocket - A. About two minutes before I left him pushing and feeling about me; I felt my money in my pocket after I came from sitting in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you by chance speak to any of that money - A. I spoke to the officer what there was; there were three guineas, two seven shilling pieces and some silver shewed me; I had mentioned to the officer what money I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the money shewn you was there any piece that you could identify - A. Yes, a seven shilling piece.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. What part of the gallery was you sitting - A. We were standing, there was no room to sit; it was very full where I was standing.</p>

               <p>Q. Others pushed as well as the man at the bar - A. The others pushed, but not like him.</p>

               <p>Q. Probably if they pushed they might move him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he opened your waistcoat how came it you did not speak to him - A. I went out and told a young man at the window, there was a parcel of Jews there; I did not like to say any thing to them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the window to return to the gallery, how came you to go to the spot where he was - A. I could not get to any other place to see.</p>

            , Church lane, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Drury lane theatre on Monday the 17th of this month - A. Yes, I was up in the one shilling gallery; I could not see, it was full; I was going down to go home.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were going down the one shilling gallery what did you hear - A. I heard the cry of stop thief; the voice was from above; I was were the check taker was; when I heard the cry of stop thief, I stopped and turned round my head, and saw that there man at the bar chuck some money in a corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he chucked it - A. He was upon the flight of stairs above the check taker; he threw it into one of the corners of the seat of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was money at that time - A. I heard it rattle like money.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him after he chucked the money as you described it - A. He walked down the other flight of stairs to where the check taker was, and the gate was fast. The officer was sent for and he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told any body the place where you saw him chuck the money - A. Yes, I told the money taker I saw him chuck something like money, it rattled; I told him where he had chucked it, and I told Mr. Tredway; he took up the money from the same place where the prisoner had chucked it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that the prisoner is the person that you saw chuck that money - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>HENRY TREDWAY. I am a constable of Bow street I attend Drury lane playhouse, I was there on Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260012"></xptr>the 17th of this month; the prisoner was given into my charge.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information you received from the witness Saunders, did you look for any money - A. I did; I searched the prisoner first, and then I took up the lamp and went up with the boy to the window, there I found the money; I found three guineas, two seven shilling pieces, five shillings and a six pence; I have kept the money ever since. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the seven shilling piece; I know it by being a crooked one.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say positively that this is your seven shilling piece, only that one of your seven shilling pieces was crooked - A. Yes, but I had the same number of guineas, three guineas and two seven shilling pieces and some loose silver; I cannot exactly say how much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - with respect to the charge that is now preferred against me, I am totally ignorant and innocent of the circumstances altogether; and however plausible the story may be, I feel inward satisfaction that my fate is to be decided by a British jury; I shall now therefore throw myself on the mercy of the court.</p>

            . About half an hour after two o'clock that morning, the woman that the prisoner lives with, came to the watch-house, and said, Lucas, for God's sake come up to my house, for that rogue Ned will go to Newgate again, for he has robbed a poor man, and Biddy King and another girl were concerned with him; I went up; there was the prosecutor very much in liquor in bed; said she, get him out, for they will steal his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that woman here?</p>
               <p>Scriplin. She is not; after we took up the prisoner, he said Biddy King had the man's handkerchief about her neck; and Biddy King she said had the watch in her hand, but it was then spoiled.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner told us if we went with him he would get us the watch, and said Biddy King had that and my handkerchief, but we could not find her; she is taken up since for another robbery.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Clark. I live facing the prisoner's house; about one or two o'clock that night, the noise began between the woman of the house and two other women; the prisoner was not in the house; I was standing at my window, and saw the two women run out; then the old woman called the prosecutor very bad names; she said, get up, you are robbed, where is your watch; under my head, said he; look you thief, said she, come along with me to look for the women; the prosecutor had been very troublesome and riotous, and had broke a great many things.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see them?</p>
               <p>E. Clark. I could, my window is up one pair of stairs; they had a light in the room, and their windows are all broke to pieces; I stood there till four in the morning; it is as wicked a house as any in the kingdom; the prisoner had been away from that woman five or six weeks; he had come home that night, and she would not let him come in but beat him away; she desired the watchman to get the prosecutor out of the house. Man, get up, said the watchman, and go about your business; you may be very proud you go off with your cloaths, what have you lost, the man said he had lost his watch; with great persuasions he got him up to go along with him, and they went away to the sign of the Swan about four o'clock.</p>

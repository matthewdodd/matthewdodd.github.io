               <p>I am a watchman; on Tuesday evening a man passed by my box, and told me of the ladder at this window, and that he suspected all was not right there; and so I went up and alarmed the house, I went and saw the ladder, and the window up; I went up stairs, being let in, I turned into this room that the ladder was to, and found nobody was in it; there was some clothes laid pulled off the line and some strings up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of that room open? - It was as they told me, I saw it open; I went up stairs and found the prisoner at the bar lying on the stairs, just about half a pair higher than the one pair of stairs room, on the second pair of stairs, I brought him down, I searched him and found nothing on him, but his knife; I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q You searched him every part? - I felt him about.</p>

               <p>Q. If he had committed a robbery it was likely he should be staying there, lying on the stairs, was not it? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken to the justice that there woman that stands there, for the things that they had lost, wanted my mother to make a recompence for them, and my mother being a poor woman, and I innocent of the fact, told my mother to do no such thing; and they said they would go as far as the law would go; it is a bad house for all sorts of bad women, they have not lived in it so much as a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever tell them you would make it up? - His father and mother came to my husband and said they would make a recompence; they came to make me the offer, I told them it would not lay in my power.</p>

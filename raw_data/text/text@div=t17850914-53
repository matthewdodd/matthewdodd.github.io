               <p>When you first saw him on the footpath was he walking or running? - He was walking very fast, but not running; in consequence of my crying stop thief he was taken; he was out of my sight before he was taken; I saw him again in ten minutes in custody of Mr. Chambers; the shoes and buckles were found behind some sugar casks; when he first came to enquire for the Doctor he had a handkerchief tied down one side of his face, and one of his shoes down at heel; and when I saw him in custody of Mr. Chambers he was in the same dress then; I took notice of him the first time because he came to ask for a Doctor.</p>

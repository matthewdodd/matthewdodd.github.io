I did not perceive the pocket-book taken from me. I first missed them about five o'clock; a Bow-street officer came to me and said, have you lost any thing; I felt instantly, and said, I have lost two pocket-books. The officer then laid hold the prisoner, and said this man has got them. I saw the prisoner drop one pocket-book, the other was taken out of his breeches; the one that he had in his breeches contained the two-pound note. I was quite sure the pocket-books were mine when I saw them. My name is in both of them.</p>

            . I was at Tothill-fair. I there saw the prisoner close behind the prosecutor, and from the prisoner's appearance I thought he was doing that which was not right, which induced me to watch him: I did not see him take the books; I stood at a little distance that he should not see me; I saw him so near the prosecutor's clothes as to suspect he was doing it; there was no one behind the prosecutor, but the prisoner. I saw him move a little way of one side; I thought he had something. I found he was going to leave the prosecutor; I tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and said; have you lost any thing, sir. The prosecutor said, a pocket-book. I then laid hold of the prisoner, and saw his hand throw something; I did not exactly see the book. I saw the book picked up; the prosecutor claimed that book. I searched him. I unbuttoned the flap of his breeches. I found the other pocket-book in his breeches. On examining it I found a two-pound note in it. I have kept the pocket-books ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure they are my pocket-books.</p>

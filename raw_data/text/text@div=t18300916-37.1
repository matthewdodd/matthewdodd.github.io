            . On the 12th of August I lost a ball of twist from a drawer - when I took the drawer down it was at the top of the drawer, and no one was there but the prisoner; he came to get some twist to match a bit of cloth - he had matched his cloth, and I was cutting off the twist he wanted, when he ran out of the shop; I pursued him, and he was taken before I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the man who stopped him here? A. No; the prisoner did turn a corner- I might lose sight of him; I was but three or four yards from him - I ran pretty fast - I was on the opposite side of the way; I could see round the corner; the ball of twist was given up to me - he begged me to let him go, as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160029"></xptr>was a poor fellow; I put the ball into a drawer, with forty or fifty others - it was black, and there was no other black ball in the drawer but that.</p>

            . On the 12th of August I was coming home, and heard there was a thief in Broad-street; I took off my cocked hat, and went up - there were forty or fifty people; they pointed to a public house, in which the prisoner was - a woman said, "Don't take him, poor fellow;" I gave him 2d. to get a pint of beer - he begged me to let him go; I found 1 1/2d. on him, this skeleton-key, this bit of cloth, and the twist which I gave the prosecutrix.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went for a yard of twist - I felt for an article I had purchased before - I missed it, and said I would go and look for that; when I got near the corner of the street I heard some one cry "Stop him!" - I went on, and turned another corner; I saw several persons run- I got near two hundred yards down the turning, when a man stopped me; the prosecutrix came in about a minute and a half - I said I had no twist; a number of persons collected, and some one said, "Here is a ball of twist, is this your's?" - she took it; I went on to have a pint of of porter - a man came and took me; some person said,"Let the man go, it is not worth 1 1/2d."</p>

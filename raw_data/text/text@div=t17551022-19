After she was come, she told me her shifts were in pawn; I lent her money to fetch them out. In about a fortnight or three weeks after she was there, I missed some of my things, but I did not part with her till she had been with me two or three months before, which time I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment, and more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these things at home before you took the prisoner in?</p>
               <p>Burton. They were all of them in the room where my wife and she were. I took he r up and charg'd her with taking the things, and she own'd that she had taken and pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them again?</p>
               <p>Burton. Some of them I have, but they are most of them in pawn still. I have seen some of them at a pawnbroker's in Bride-lane; she told me where they were; she had pawn'd them in her own name.</p>

            . I am a bill-broker at 'Change-alley, and live at Mile-end. I was walking by the prosecutor's side - he turned suddenly round, and seized the prisoner by the collar, at the same time took a handkerchief from his hand; he charged him with stealing it - the prisoner said he had picked it up; I observed several persons about, but do not know that they were in his company - several low characters followed him to the watch-house, but did not interfere.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PLAISTOW. I am an officer of Aldgate ward. I went into the watch-house after the prisoner was there; he said he picked the handkerchief up - I searched him, and found two other handkerchiefs in his hat, and a piece of silk tied loosely round his neck.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

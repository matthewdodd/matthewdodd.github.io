            . When the prisoner was brought back into my brother's shop, I saw one parcel of handkerchiefs drop out of his lap as he stood in the middle of the shop; his apron was tuck'd up; after that I saw another parcel in his apron, which was searched. The handkerchiefs laid quite in view. I took them out of his apron. I suppose the other parcels had dropt before.</p>

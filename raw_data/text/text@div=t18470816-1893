It is wrong of you to allow him to act as he does.

He does not in the least suspect you of acting in this way, like a common girl of the town; indeed you in some respects are worse, for they do not often take up with married men if they know it. Now, Miss, I shall write to your brother and explain all to him, and write to your family and explain all to them, unless you do one thing, and that only shall save you. I know of a very poor family who is in the greatest distress, brought on by the bad conduct of the father, who died six months age all through his extravagant ways, by keeping another woman, and suffering his <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> wife and family to want. Now if you will enclose a five pound note, or as much near that sum as you can conveniently <hi rend="italic">spair</hi>, and leave it at the little box close to the iron gate as you enter to go to the reading-rooms—leave it either with the old man at that box, or with the young man that is there during the day of wednesday the 11th of August, or Thursday the 12th, and direct it to Mr. J.

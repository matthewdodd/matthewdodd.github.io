I took the prisoner on the 8th of May, in Windmill-street, from information I received from a person named Hawkins: he said he knew nothing about it - I took him to Marlborough-street - he said in going along, "It is a d - d good job you took me to-night, you would not have had me to-morrow; I was going in the country on a tramp;" the Magistrate sent him to Worship-street, and in going along I asked him who the person was who had been robbed - he said,"Ripp, No. 2, Chester-place, Bethnal-green;" I did not then know who it was.</p>

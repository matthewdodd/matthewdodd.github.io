            . I live in Union-court, Holbourn; the prisoner and two other girls came into my room last Monday in the afternoon, and begged liberty of my wife to let them have a little water to make some tea; they asked me whether I could be of service to a friend of theirs, to pawn a watch; one of the other women produced it to me; I took it, and said I must have a good account of it before I parted with it I delivered it to the constable, and went with him to Justice Welch; I never saw the other two women before, but I have known the prisoner some time in the market.</p>

            . On Tuesday was se'nnight the prisoner came into my shop with one silver buckle, I am a silver-smith, and live in Long-acre (produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) She first asked me whether it was silver; I said it was; she held up her hands, and said, Thank God; I had not a halfpenny to buy me victuals, till providence threw this in my way. I gave her 3 s. 6 d. for it.</p>

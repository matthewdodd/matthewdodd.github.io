The value of the silver I missed was 20l. or 25l. - some of it was old silver - Adlam said they were washing in the washhouse when they heard some silver rattling - they were both together, and both said the same thing, but not together - Adlam said while she was washing she heard a noise in the servant's-hall, and that they took a light and went to see who was there, or what was the matter, and they saw the sash down, the window broken, and the silver taken away - I went to bed, and between eight and nine o'clock Pugh came up to me, with five tea-spoons in her hand, which she gave me - Adlam was not there- when I was disturbed in the morning, I went round to the doors and found them all locked, and the windows fast except that one - I had not been in the servants'-hall the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your groom here? A. No - he is a grown-up man - his name is Edward - the prisoner had a little black box - it was large enough to hold the spoons - I did not search her box at any time, because the spoons were found between three and four o'clock in the afternoon - Mead, the constable, brought them to me.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was there a lock on the drawer the plate was kept in? A. There was on the cupboard in which the drawers are - there is not a lock on the drawers, because the cupboard-door locks them in.</p>

            . I have lived in the prosecutrix's service five months last January - on the morning of the 8th of January, I was called up by the prisoner - I have the care of the plate - I put it into the drawer in the butler's pantry the night before, and shut the drawer - the windows were shut and the shutters, but the screws were not put in - I locked the door of the room the night before, and left the key outside, and went to bed - I sleep in the adjoining room, three or four yards from the place - I was awoke in the morning - I do not know what awoke me - I got up at a quarter past four o'clock - I was awoke about three quarters of an hour before that, and did not go to sleep again - I heard the rattling of silver in the hall (which is a room next to mine, and the room in which the plate was kept) - and I heard it in the kitchen next - and I heard footsteps and talking in the kitchen, and silver rattling - I heard the rattling of the silver first, and then the talking - I heard nothing else - there were about two persons talking - I did not understand their voices - I could not tell who they were by their voices - it seemed like the housemaid's voice - I looked at the clock when I got up - it was just twenty-five minutes past four o'clock - I went into the kitchen and saw both the prisoners - Adlam left the kitchen about a quarter to five o'clock - I saw her come back - she brought in five tea-spoons with her and gave them to me - they were wet and muddy - she said she had picked them up on the green - it was about five o'clock - she had been out about a quarter of an hour - it was quite dark then - I do not recollect whether she took a lanthorn out - we were burning candles in the house - there is a lanthorn generally kept in the kitchen - I do not remember seeing it there when she was absent - it might have been there without my seeing it - I wiped the spoons, and put them into the drawer where the plate was kept - I did not give them to the other prisoner - this was after mistress had been down stairs.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you shut up the drawer after putting the spoons into it? A. Yes - I did not lock the cupboard - the housemaid came into the hall and took the five spoons up to mistress - they are the spoons Adlam said she had found, and gave to me - she might have had the lanthorn out and I not perceive it - I was a little frightened - the housemaid's was the only voice I could recognise - Edward was the groom - he was nothing else - he did not live in the house - he was an ordinary labouring man, who came and acted as groom - by pushing the shutter down a person outside could open it - Edward was discharged before this - I am sure of that - he had no right to come to the house - he did not come after he was turned away - he came one night - how often he might have come without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200011"></xptr>my knowledge I cannot say - I do not recollect whether there had been rain the night before, nor whether the lawn was wet or dry - I do not know how far Edward lived from mistress - Adlam has lived there since October - I do not know how many trunks she had.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Before you went to bed, had you locked the cupboard where the plate was kept? A. Yes, and left the key in it - I do not know whether the window was broken or not the night before - I had not looked at it - I had seen it at seven o'clock that night, and am sure it was not broken then - the shutters are inside the window - the shutters were put up, but not screwed - I do not know where the screws were.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were there any fastenings to the windows? A. Yes, a latch inside - it is a sash window - it was the bottom pane of the upper sash that was broken, just over the latch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What night was it that Edward came there? A. I think it is on the 7th, the day before this happened - I do not know at what time of night he came - he did not stay all night - it was either Monday or Tuesday, I cannot say which - this happened on Wednesday morning - I think it was on Tuesday he came - I am not quite sure of it - he went away soon after he came - he came about seven or eight o'clock at night - he did not see my mistress - he stayed a short time, and went away soon after.</p>

            . I am gardener to the prosecutrix - I do not sleep in the house - on the morning of the 8th of January, I went to work about seven o'clock - I went first up to the stable, and saw the new groom, (not Edward) - I went to work after this, and afterwards went to the house - I examined the premises where the window was broken - there were no footsteps outside, either on the green or the gravel walk - there is a gravel walk immediately under the window - I tried to lift up the window, but could not, because the bottom sash was pressed down so hard - the broken pane was in the top sash, which was down below, and the bottom sash above - they stuck fast and could not be moved - I and a carpenter afterwards tried to move them, but could not - the carpenter was obliged to get tools to do it - it had been wet that night, and there had been a great deal of wet before - the paths outside the window were soft - I could not see one footmark there - I did not leave any footsteps there in walking particularly - about the middle of the day I went into the house, I looked on the floor by the window, I saw no footmark there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you outside the window on the gravel walk; a good while, I suppose, trying to lift it up? A. Yes; we left footmarks then, but not when I went to look at first.</p>

            . I lived with Mrs. Williams at the time. On the 13th of February last I was at work behind the counter, when two men came in, a tall one and a short one. [Note, The prisoner and the evidence were such, the prisoner the tallest.] I believe the prisoner is the man that asked me to shew him some ribband. I arose up from behind the counter to shew him some. They bought none, but assoon as they were gone out of the shop I missed a piece of sattin, of about 10 yards, which when they came in lay on the counter before me. I acquainted the prosecutrix's brother of it, and what sort of men had been there, but we never heard any more of it.</p>

            . I can only say there were two such men came into the shop, to buy ribbands, on the 13th of February, and that the prisoner at the bar was one of them, for he looked earnestly at me, and I particularly observed him, and also saw the sattin on the counter a very little time before they came in, but I went out of the shop before they did.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. What was the reason she would not swear to me before the justice?</p>
               <p>S. Monkford. It was Sarah Creamer that would not swear to him, I did.</p>

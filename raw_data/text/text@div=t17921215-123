            , and that he lived at an oyster shop some where in Chancery-lane; the Lord Mayor asked him what apartment; he said, a front room and a chamber, he paid 15 l. a year for it, at last he said, that the woman's husband threw the letter after her, that he, the prisoner, had taken it up and given it to her and came to shew her where to come.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe the letter is not directed to any particular place but only Mr. Horne, Stock-broker; I suppose in your advertisement you had stated where you did your business? - Yes, he was then asked again about his profession and what he was; he said, he was a gentleman; he asked him what he had to live upon; he said 50 l. a year, which was remitted from his father in Ireland; the Lord Mayor then asked him, whether it was remitted in bills or Bank notes; he said, in Bank bills; then he was asked whether he had not a great many of those covers by him; he said, he certainly had; he was asked whether he had any of those about him; he said, no, he was very glad he had not, because he did not choose they should be exhibited to every body; he was then asked about the letter, and then he said, he did give it to the woman, and a woman in the street gave it to him; then the Lord Mayor said, it is very extraordinary that he should bring a letter and take a letter from a stranger; have not you been at Tothill-fields Bridewell? he said, no, he had never been there, and then he said at last, he had been there that very morning; he did not say that he had the letter from thence, but he seemed to imply it; then he was asked again if he knew the contents of the letter; he said, no; then he was asked if he was the writer; he said, he could not write; then he was asked if he knew either of the parties who signed the letter; he said, he believed he might know them by sight; then he was asked whether he was not a member of this club in question, at last he acknowledged that he had been there some time and that he knew the man at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him in any examinations whether he could write? - The Lord Mayor on Monday desired him to write, and he took a pen and made a scrawl; the Lord Mayor's clerk asked him if he had not been there charging a man with robbing him of money and signed his name; he said, if he had signed it was very badly wrote; the Lord Mayor asked him if that robbery had been tried; he said, no, the grand jury threw out the bill. On Monday he said, that every thing that he said on Saturday was wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire to see whether he lived at the oyster shop? - They neither of them lived where they said. I went to Tothill-fields Bridewell; I saw Brown there; I never saw him before, and he acknowledged he never saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Horne I will put a question to you though it has not any thing to do in the subject; was there the smallest truths in these insinuations? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Horne I am extremely sorry they have been thrown out. I can assure you that in my brief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150184"></xptr>there is not a tittle suggested to your prejudice, and God forbid I should throw any imputation.</p>

               <p>The letter read by the clerk, as follows:</p>
               <p>Saturday morning, sir, I am sorry to inform you, that I have been unfortunate with the rest on Monday last, in Clement's-lane, as I suppose you must have seen in the papers, and have been in prison ever since, not being able to get bail as some have done, I have been solicited to say who supported me in the least, which I would not do, till I sent to you and another friend likewise, who I believe is out of town; I believe, I could get bail, if I could but make up 10 l. which would settle every thing intirely, for it is very hard, as you know, and as I know, you are a considerate man, for me to lay in prison six months, in a starving condition, therefore I hope you will send me the assistance by the bearer, &amp;c.</p>

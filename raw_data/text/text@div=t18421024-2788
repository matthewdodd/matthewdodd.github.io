                  </hi>. I lodge at the King's Head, King-street, Park-lane, and am a servant out of place. On the 14th of August, at near ten o'clock, I was going through the Green Park, towards the Duke of Wel<lb></lb>lington's—I passed three men, two together, and one a little a-head of them—after passing a few yards in advance of them, I received a severs blow on the back of my head, sufficient to throw me on the ground—I was going the nearest way to Constitution Hill, in a direction from the Duke of Sutherland's—when I fell, one immediately knelt on my chest, and held me so tight by the throat, I was nearly strangled, while the other two robbed me of my watch, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—there were three of them engaged about me—my trowsers were rent to get at the pocket where my money was—after receiving the ill usage I was left senseless on the ground till near one o'clock—I suppose they all left me together—I met the pri<lb></lb>soner about a fortnight after in the Strand—he immediately turned round and ran away from me—I knew him, as I saw his features distinctly by the light of the moon, while being robbed—I received the blow before I was robbed, but one held me so tight by the neck I could not halloo out, as I wished to do—I could well see the prisoner—he was dressed the same as when apprehended, in a green coat, yellow buttons, and light hair, rather curled—I saw him again on the 6th of October, in Bond-street—the moment he saw me he made a dead stop—I looked at him—he turned round and immediately ran away into Burlington-gardens and Cork-street—he was stopped by a young gentleman, who he broke from, and was stopped again at the corner—I said to him, "You are the man who stole my watch—he said he was going to an hotel in Bond-street to take up a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that was waiting for him there, and he would present me with that, and take me to some friends of his who had several duplicates of gold watches (I had not mentioned that mine was a gold one, but it was so) and he had no doubt but mine was one of the number—he said they were friends of his, and a person named Stringer, who was already transported, and Fitz<lb></lb>gerald, for assaulting a person in Hyde Park—he said if I insisted on giving him into custody, I should never get my watch, but if I would for<lb></lb>give him I should have the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and eventually get my watch, as the</p>

               <p>in September, 1841, I took him into my service—I took some shooting in Essex, and took him as a general servant to clean shoes, and so on—he remained in my service till the end of November, or beginning of December, till the season was over—I came to town, and had no further occasion for him—I have employed him occasionally to fetch luggage or any thing—in August last he lodged at No. 4, Queen's-court, in Holborn with a woman named Pitts—on the day previous to the 14th of August I bad entered into fresh apartments, in the neighbourhood of Soho<lb></lb>square—it was Saturday the 13th—I had called at his place, but not finding him, the day following, which was Sunday the 14th, in the even<lb></lb>ing, accompanied by a friend, Mr. Lenton, I went down again to send him for some luggage I wanted, which had been left—having come to town it was left at the inn at Charing Cross—it came from Cambridge—I had come from there—I have connexions down there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you recollect that Saturday, the 13th, was the day you moved into Bateman's-buildings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the previous day I had left Newport from my uncle's, and my agreement with the party at Bateman's-buildings was on Saturday, the 13th of August—I am positive it must have been the 14th—I came to town on the 13th by the Cambridge fly, about half-past two or three o'clock, to the George and Blue Boar—I went from thence with a friend—I got to Bateman's-buildings about five—it is a furnished house—my servant had come by an early coach—I found her at the place—I had directed her to remain with Mrs. Butcher, at her sis<lb></lb>ter's, in Circus-road, Regent's-park—after taking the lodging I took the servant, with what luggage was necessary, in a coach, and afterwards came with Mrs. Butcher, and took possession—I think I had seen the prisoner about a month previous, when I had been in town—he can write, but not a good hand—I do not know a person named Elvin or Hand—I never heard their names, nor the name of Stringer, until he was apprehended, and then, of course, almost every person heard of it—I never knew that the prisoner was acquainted with Stringer—I heard, through the medium of the public papers, that letters had been found on him, addressed to a Mr. Elvin, to the care of Mr. Stringer—I have no idea why I should re<lb></lb>collect the 14th of August particularly, only coupled with the fact that I went to Mrs. Pitts that day—I am sure of the day, from the day I entered into my apartments—I staid in the apartments about six weeks—I think I said two months just now, I beg to correct myself—I know it was the the 14th of August, simply from the fact of coming to town that day—I came by coach—I do not know whether my name was in the way-bill—most likely Mr. Mitchell, of the Red Lion, did put in my name—I have occasionally seen the prisoner between November, 1841, and the summer of 1842—I am on visiting terms with Mr. Lenton, and I have frequently seen the prisoner employed by him for various matters about the estab<lb></lb>lishment in the shop, and so forth—I do not think the prisoner was regu<lb></lb>larly apprenticed to Mr. Lenton—I think Mr. Lenton took him from kindly feelings towards his friends, that he knows better than I do—</p>

               <p>I am living on my means, I was educated at St. John's, and studied a short time for the bar, but having married a wife with property, and having other property, I live near town—I do not follow any pursuit—in fat my health is very bad, I am totally unable to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could you follow shooting and sporting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only thing recommended to me by my medical man, to prevent incipient decline—the prisoner came next day, fetched the luggage, and remained with me up to three or four o'clock, I think—I asked him why he wore that cap, and told him it was a very objectionable thing to wear—he said he had no money—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to buy a hat, and paid him for his work, and gave him a pair of trowsers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to go to him at ten o'clock at night, about going for a gun to Westminster on Sunday, and on Monday for luggage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not have got the gun home without a messenger—I am not accus<lb></lb>tomed to go a long distance after dinner myself, and it was not a very re<lb></lb>putable part of Westminster—my object was, I would rather employ him than a strange porter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this your luggage from Cambridge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the Cambridge coach goes to Charing-cross—it depends on what time of day you are coming—the coach I came by stopped at the George and Blue Boar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not you rather nearer when you passed the Blue Boar than going to Charing-cross? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not go to Charing-cross, the luggage came by another coach—I stopped midway with an uncle of mine, a clergyman, near Newport—the luggage had arrived before me, and Mrs. Butcher also—I did not arrive in town till late in the day, and was then occupied in obtaining lodgings—I was accompanied to Bateman's-build<lb></lb>ings by Mr. Lenton—I called on him when I came to town—I came to Mr. Lenton's from the inn—he lives in Leicester-square—and then, by mere chance, walking about for lodgings, he said, "I know a very re<lb></lb>spectable erson in Bateman's-buildings; if he has apartments I think they will suit you"—Lenton's shop is at the comer of Leicester-square.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your name Joseph? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I never bore the name of Joseph Taddy Butcher—oh, yes, certainly—I scarcely ever give that name—I have no reason for not giving it—I know Willam Archibald Campbell—I am not joined with him in any charge here, and never was—I was a witness for a gentleman named Rhodes, who prosecuted Campbell—I gave evidence before the Grand Jury—I was not joined with him in the indictment—I am now to appear as a witness in the case next term—Mr. Thomas Rhodes is the prosecutor—he was solicitor to the late Duke of Bedford—I am quite sure I am not one of the defendants in the conspiracy, on the contrary, was Mr. Rhodes's evidence—I cannot recollect whether Campbell was charged alone, I should say not—it was removed by the prosecutor—I really cannot say when—I know I gave evidence before the Grand Jury, and am now about to give evidence against the gentleman who is now in the Queen's Bench.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever act as clerk to an attorney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was during some time</p>

               <p>with Mr. Rhodes preparatory to being articled to him—nobody but Camp<lb></lb>bell was included in the indictment, to my recollection—he was held under recognizances to appear at Marlborough-street—be did not do so, but ab<lb></lb>sconded, and remained abroad from about the period 1838, I believe, since which time a process of outlawry has been taken out against him, and by some means he is in the Queen's Bench, Mr. Rhodes having removed the main charge from this Court by <hi rend="italic">certiorari</hi>—I was backward and forward with Rhodes a long time—Campbell was a surgeon—I ceased to act for Rhodes before 1838—I acted as his clerk three or four years; that is what I mean by studying the law—I intended to go to the bar, but my health was so very bad I was obliged to give it up—I have lived in London since the latter end of August or middle of September this year—I have been living in Cambridge a very long period.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Perhaps you will explain why you did not have the prisoner to help you move, as you wished to employ him from charity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I did employ him on one or two occasions, but Mr. Lenton had employed him more frequently than I had, and I believe Lenton at that time was re<lb></lb>moving part of his stock from one shop to another—I do not know where the prisoner went to live when he left Mrs. Pitts.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 33, Leicester-square—I know the prisoner—be was in my service about fifteen months since, he then left—he had been in my service about two years—I have known him ten or twelve years, when he was scarcely higher than my knee—I employed him—he was connected with Cambridge people, friends of mine—I employed him and another male servant at the time, and he brushed the boots and things then, but he was employed more with a view of learning my business, but I joined a chemist in Leicester-square, and had no further call for his services—since then I have employed him in collecting debts, and paid him some pounds—up to within the last month I have occasionally employed him—he collected a debt in Fetter-lane a month ago and gave me the money—his conduct was strictly honest, or I should not have employed him—I know Mr. Butcher perfectly well—I believe he lodged in Holborn in August—I did not know the name of the person—I went there on one occasion—I was dining with Mr. Butcher—he said he wanted the services of this young man the next day for some pur<lb></lb>pose, to go for some boxes or something, and asked me if I would walk down with him late in the evening, and somewhere about ten o'clock I ac<lb></lb>companied Mr. Butcher to a court in Holborn, very nearly opposite Day and Martin's—I do not know the name of the place nor of the party who kept the house—he was not at home—the person in the house said there were two Robert's lodged there, and wished to know which I required, they said one was a groom—I said, "No, I want Robert Flet<lb></lb>cher"—the woman said, "Oh, he is just gone out"—she is the woman who kept the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any thing occur to the watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is so long since I forget—he was talking to the prisoner—I was standing on one side—I do not know whether he said he broke any thing—I cannot swear—I will tell you candidly, I was walking to other parts of the court—there are six or seven houses in the court, and having failed in inquiring at two or three houses, being late at night, we could not find the house—a little boy directed us to the wrong house—while I was inquiring there, he went away, and whether any thing occurred I do not know at that time—we came away together—I did not meet any body in Holborn—I parted with Mr. Butcher at Turnstile, and did not see any body join Butcher.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you left to go home, and returned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that was after dinner—I cannot say what hour it was—I went to Bateman's-build<lb></lb>ings again and had tea—my visits were so frequent at Butcher's, I called al<lb></lb>most every day for several years, and he at my place, so that I called at no particular hour—it is no uncommon circumstance even as late as twelve o'clock at night—I believe I was welcome—I lived with Mr. Butcher three or four years before—I do not know how long he lived at Bateman's-buildings—not very long before I dined with him—I really cannot say how often I had seen him there before that day—I might have seen him perhaps fifty times there.</p>

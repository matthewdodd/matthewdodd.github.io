I have an interest in goods sold - the warehouse is fastened by a patent Bramah's lock; also, a padlock and staple. You pass the warehouse door to go to Mr. Stock's. An outer door incloses the passage, and is always shut on Sundays. On Monday, the 23d of October, I missed a piece of diaper, and on the 25th I missed another piece, and discovered, we had lost seven pieces of linen, and six of diaper. On Monday, the 6th of November, the prisoner Barrett was apprehended - some goods were produced by Mills, the pawnbroker - she was brought there, and stated, that as she stood in the court idly one day, a tall dark woman accosted her, and employed her to pledge them - that she had no knowledge of her, but expected to see her again that week, as she promised her another job. I asked, if she had a father or mother, she said, she believed she had, but had not seen them for two years. I found two remnants of lawn of four yards and a half each, and one piece of eight-quarter diaper. I can swear I never sold them. On the same evening we went to Barrett's lodgings, and found

The officer asked who she was - she said, the young people had got in trouble; and after a good deal of evasion, she said, her name was Webb - he insisted on going home with her - she pulled out a marriage certificate, by which it appeared her name was Wright, she took us to her lodgings, No. 2, New Cut, Hollywell-lane, Shoreditch, and in a housewife we found a small slip of three-quarter diaper - she said, Mr. Stocks had given it her among other remnants - we enquired for her husband - she said, he had not been home since the night before, when he went to sleep at Mr. Stocks. I searched different pawnbrokers, and found part of the property. I was with the officer when the man was taken. He had been employed to sleep at Mr. Stocks's at night. I fitted the key of Mr. Stocks's dining-room with the warehouse lock, it opened it easily; the padlock staple had been loosened to take out; the key was always left in the dining-room door. Some time elapsed before Wright was taken - we could not find him.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBERT STOCKS. I have the premises in Lawrence-lane. I had employed Wright for many years as a confidential servant to sleep there at night to guard the premises, he was sometimes there by day, painting. Mrs. Gavin was the housekeeper. They were the only persons in the house. I did not discharge him - he left me abruptly, without giving me any notice.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Letslaw, pawnbroker, in Shoreditch. We have a remnant of lawn, pledged on the 16th of October - but I do not know by whom.</p>

               <p>WRIGHT'S Defence. I went to Greenwich on Monday, with a shipmate, when I returned it was too late to go home. I went again next day, and did not return till three o'clock in the morning - my wife said the officer had been after me. I said I was ready if they wanted me. I did not abscond.</p>

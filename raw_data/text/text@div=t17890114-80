             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant to Mr. George. I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him in your master's shop? - No, Sir; as I was putting up the shutters, the prisoner asked me the way to London bridge; I directed him; he stood some time talking with me; and as I was turning to shut up the shutters, I saw the prisoner with the goods under his arm.</p>
               <p>What goods were they? - They were stuff and camblet. I do not know the things; my master put them into the window himself.</p>
               <p>Whereabout were these things? - They were in the window.</p>
               <p>Could he get these things without coming into the shop for them? - No.</p>
               <p>Were the windows broke? - No. He was taken up in less than two minutes.</p>
               <p>With the things upon him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue him? - Yes. When we came to the top of Hollowell-street, the prisoner struck the other witness right across the thigh; he said, what business had he with him, and he threatened to strike him again; other people came to assist, and he was taken. I did not see the goods after. I do not know what he did with them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see the prisoner take the goods? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. What time of night was this? - Between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What month? - The 28th of October.</p>
               <p>It was darkish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>And you saw a man pass you with a bundle? - Yes. I knew them to be the things out of our window.</p>
               <p>How was it packed? - He had them under his arm.</p>
               <p>What covering were they in? - There were the wrappers round them that were taken in the shop; the papers were doubled back to shew the goods in the window.</p>
               <p>Were they carried openly? - They were under the prisoner's arm.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was busy shutting up your shop? - Yes. It was in whitish paper.</p>
               <p>Did you see this man apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way was he coming? - Up the street.</p>
               <p>Towards your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So this man, in two minutes after, was coming towards your shop, and in his way to your shop, was apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was nobody else taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Nobody stopped? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that? Did not you first of all stop any body else?</p>
               <p>Mr. George. I desire to speak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. I desire you will not. I desire Mr. George to go out. This young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140110"></xptr>man is under your influence. Young man, you must speak the whole truth, upon your oath. Was not there somebody else stopped? - Yes; there was a shortish man stopped.</p>
               <p>Why could not you say that when your master was here? - I did not think of it; The two men were both together.</p>
               <p>Was not the other man stopped on the other side of the way now? - They were both together.</p>
               <p>Answer me; was not the other young man stopped on the other side of the way? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>And after some scuffle let go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not that in Newcastle-street? - Yes; opposite the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>That man was going from your house, was not he? - They were both returning to our house. They were both arm in arm, and they had two long sticks; and as we were coming up to them, they struck the other witness.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that these two people, when they were stopped, were arm in arm. Who has told you to say all this? - Nobody told me any thing.</p>
               <p>You say there were two men stopped, arm in arm? - They were arm in arm when they were coming down the street.</p>
               <p>Jury. Speak the truth, and do not be confused.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Do not fear any body; I do not want to puzzle you. You stopped one man first? - Yes. That man made his escape.</p>
               <p>That man was afterwards taken into custody? - Yes; he was taken into the oil-shop, next to the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>That man was going from your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That man was afterwards let go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man, after he was discharged, was stopped coming towards your shop? - They were both taken into custody together. When we first came to Newcastle-street, I saw them both, with two large sticks in their hand; and they struck the other witness across the thigh. He ran into the coffee-house. More people came to our assistance, and they were both taken into the oil-shop together.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say you saw the prisoner with the bundles under his arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue the prisoner without losing sight of him? - No. They were both taken up to Bow-street; and by some means the other man went out of the door. He was let go from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the other man with him at the time he enquired the way to London-bridge? - No, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say it was this man that enquired his way to London-bridge? - No, it was not this man; it was somebody else.</p>
               <p>Who that man was, you do not know. I understood you to say, that it was the prisoner who enquired his way to London bridge? - No, it was not the prisoner. I have not seen the man that enquired the way to London-bridge since.</p>
               <p>Then you informed a man, and had some conversation with him, and was shutting up your shop; and then you saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you know the bundle contained the things your master spoke of? - I am sure they were my master's goods.</p>
               <p>How far was the man from the shop-door when you saw him with the bundle of goods under his arm? - Not two yards off. I ran into the shop, and I saw the goods were gone; and the other witness came up to me, and asked me if I had lost any thing; I said yes; and we went up to Newcastle-street, and met the prisoner and another man. They had returned again.</p>
               <p>When you came out of the shop, had you lost sight of the man that had the goods? - Yes. I did not see him after he came to the top of Newcastle-street.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the goods again? - No, they were never found.</p>
               <p>When you saw the man again, did you know that was the man that went into the shop? - Yes. It was the prisoner I saw with the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140111"></xptr>Had the man that you saw with the bundle, by the shop, a stick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you say, both the prisoner and the other man had sticks at the time they were taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And they struck the other witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you, from that very transient view that you had, positively swear that the prisoner is the very same man that you saw with the bundle by the shop-door? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you go with the last witness in pursuit of him? - No. There is another witness which I think is proper to be examined before me. On the 28th of November, between six and seven, I had occasion to leave the shop; in the space of two or three minutes, I was informed the shop had been robbed; I instantly came down stairs; the lad that had been in the shop, was gone in pursuit of the person. I was directed to the west end of the street. I pursued, and met one lad turning back. I made up as soon as I could, and saw a man running into Newcastle coffee-house. I suspected him, and laid hold of him; I said, are you one of the villains; no, says he, this is not the man; but pointed to the prisoner, and said, that is the man; I immediately laid hold of the person, and took the men both together into an oil-shop just by; the boy said again, he was clear he was the man; the other person, the witness, could not swear to him, therefore he went off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. When did the other man go off? - Before he went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You did not see the other man go to Bow-street at all? - No; there was only this one man taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>It was a dark night? - It was about seven in the evening. It must be dark.</p>
               <p>Jury. The person that told you the prisoner was the man, is the boy that has been examined? - No; it was the witness that is now coming in.</p>

               <p>As I was coming along Hollowell-street, Mr. George's boy was shutting in the shop. I met the prisoner in the street, walking carelessly along, in a slovenly sort of a manner. I saw two men stand on the contrary side of the way. I went on a little before. I stopped, and heard them asking Mr. George's boy the way somewhere; he said, right down there, that is the way; I turned my head, and saw the prisoner come along with the bundle of things under his arm, and two more, one on each side of him; and they passed me; then I ran back to the boy, and said to him, have not you lost something out of your shop; he said yes; I said follow me; and turning up Newcastle-street, I met the prisoner, and the other that was on the left side of him, turning back again.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner a bundle at that time? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - I am sure he is the man that I saw in the street before he had the bundle; I am sure he is the man that passed me with the bundle under his arm. The little man I saw with them before, had left them; as I went past them, one of them struck me very sharp on the thigh; they said not a word; I gave them the pavement. I could not then see which it was. I went to the end of the street, and looked all the three ways; one went to Clare-market, and the other went to Butcher-row, the other to Drury-lane.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the prisoner's parents? A. When she had been with me about a fortnight, I found her parents, and sent her home - she has been at my house occasionally since I knew her parents, but never stopped; she came on the 5th of October and stopped two nights, because her father and mother would not take her in - I went to their house, and they positively refused it; I never gave her any encouragement, but always urged her to go to a situation, and said while she acted well I would always befriend her.</p>

            . I remember the prisoner coming to the prosecutor's, about half-past four o'clock on the 19th of January; Mrs. Ralph was out - the prisoner staid three-quarters of an hour; I then desired her to go out of my house before I went out - she said, "I am going out," but whether she went out or not I do not know, but that night the robbery took place; I missed a great many things, but I cannot say what - the house was all in a muddle.</p>
               <p>MRS. RALPH re-examined. Q. Was it on the 19th of January? A. Yes, it was; my box was broken open by force, with a large carving-fork; these articles are all mine, and a great many more were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever been in the habit of sending the prisoner to pawn any thing? A. No.</p>

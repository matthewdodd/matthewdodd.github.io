On the Monday, following she had leave to go out for two hours, and never returned; she had previously conveyed away her box; About seven o'clock, on the Tuesday evening, she came very drunk, to demand her wages, and said she was going to follow the guards to Ireland, and had taken her place in the Paddington boat, paid her fare, and wanted her wages directly; I paid her, but she behaved so insolently, I got Pepper, the constable, to take her away. About an and a half afterwards, I was fetched to the watch-house, and found her there; the constable produced two duplicates of four spoons, pawned in the name of Cuthbert.</p>

I then searched her; I saw her put her hand behind her with a handkerchief in it; I seized her hand, she resisted very much; and in the handkerchief, I found 17 s. 1 d., and the duplicate of a spoon, pawned for 9 s., at Mr. Stone's, in Oxford-street; she begged of me to destroy it; I said I would do my duty. I also found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050078"></xptr>on her another duplicate of a silver spoon, pawned for 9 s. at Mr. Temple's; I sent for Cuthbert, and examined her trunk in her presence, and found a salt spoon and two window curtains.</p>

On the 4th of September, Pepper and I were going our rounds; Cuthbert told me to take her away; she said she would go back, and break every window in his house, and we thought it fit to see her a good way from the house; she was disputing with Phipps about 2 s.; and Phipps said, "I know she can pay me, for I saw her pawn a spoon for 9 s." We went with her to her master's, where she left an empty box, and brought away a full one. We took her to the watch-house with it, and found two duplicates on her of the spoons.</p>

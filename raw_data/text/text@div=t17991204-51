               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time of day was this? - A.Between seven and eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.There was a great light in your yard? - A. Yes, there was a light at the coach-office.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had meant to steal the key, you know it would have been much better to have locked you in, and then you could not have pursued him? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, before the Magistrate, that you saw him drop it? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>

             of it; he instantly ran out; I went out with him, and saw the prisoner; I asked him what he took the key out of the door for; he said he had not got it; I told him he had; upon that he turned himself round, put his hand against the door, and dropped it down; I saw him put his hand behind him and I heard it fall; I told him so when he dropped it; he said he had not; I stooped down to pick it up, and he turned round and said, there laid the key; it was squeezed up in a paper, all but just the ring of it; then we sent for a constable, and he was secured. I delivered the key to the officer.</p>

               <p>Have you had the things in your possession ever since? - The handkerchief contained the shoes and buckles, the breeches, and the cork screw; the other things were sold.</p>

               <p>The handkerchief belonged to my master; they acknowledged they took the things, before the justice; no promise was made to them; they gave up every thing they had; they said they had sold two waistcoats, and a shirt; and bought themselves two jackets, and trowsers, and came down in different dresses.</p>

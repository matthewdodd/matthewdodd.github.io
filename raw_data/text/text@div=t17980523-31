On the 23d of April, I hired the prisoner Smith to shew me about London, being a stranger, I had come to town the night before; I gave him half-a-crown for his day's work, and every thing to eat and drink that he liked; we then came home to the Three Kings public-house, in Piccadilly, where I lodged, between one and two o'clock; there we eat our dinners, and Wild and Robinson were drinking there; Smith took me into their company to drink with them; after we had dined, we all went out to take a walk, between three and four o'clock, they took me to shew me a little about London; and then we went to the <placeName id="t17980523-31-crimeloc162">George in the Hay-market</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure there were two guineas in it after you had said the other guinea down upon the table? - A. Yes; I said to Smith, now I have got you, you have robbed me, and I will have you confined, and then Robinson ran away immediately; I took Smith back to the George, where we had been drinking before, and sent for a constable; the patrol and constable came, their names are Woodley and Evans, I gave them charge of Smith, and he was taken to St. James's watch-house, and the next morning to the Magistrate; I gave a description of the other two, and they have been taken since; I knew them again perfectly well.</p>

After Smith was taken to the watch-house, I went in quest of them, with the countryman, on Tuesday afternoon, to several places, to see if I could find them; I went to several public-houses, but could not find them that day; I could not find them on the Wednesday; the Monday following after that, I saw them both at the watch-house, Woodley, the constable, had got them as his prisoners; I asked him, what have you got these two men for, I wanted them myself; why, says he, for robbing a man of a pocket-book and two five puonds notes; says I, what are you going to do with them; he said, to take them to the Magistrate's; says I, do you think they will go with you quietly alone without their hands being tied; and he said, I believe they are; their hands were tied, and they were taken before Mr. Conant, at Marlborough-street and as soon as the countryman saw them, he said they were the men.</p>

               <p>Smith's defence. I attend the mails; this countryman came up with the Oxford mail, very much in liquor, on the 21st of April; he was so much in liquor that he fell off the top of the coach; I went and got him a bed at the request of the coachman; he laid a bed till ten o'clock, he got up, and said he was very well, he should have some breakfast; and he wanted to go to different parts of the town, to buy an organ, and I shewed him into Cheapside and Holborn; he could not find one for his price; we came back to th Three Kings, and there was Robinson, and a man they call Fred, and the countryman, all playing at cards, and drinking and tossing; he went away after that, with a strange man, a barber, to see for an organ, for an hour and a quarter; then they agreed to go to the George, in the Haymarket; what I had I paid for myself; the countryman pulled out a guinea, and Fred. the man that is not here, that Wild is here for, went out to get change; I never saw Robinson before in my life; I had seen Fred. twice before; then he said, he would go and look for his guinea, he pulled out his purse, and stood by the door sometime with his purse in his hand; Robinson and he went to see after the guinea, and I followed them behind, I am lame; I heard them talking about his having lsot his purse. Just as we got to the corner of Orange-street, there was a light in a shop window, and there was the purse on the ground, I showed it to him, and then he said, there was a guinea gone out of it, and Robinson ran away, and he took hold of me, and said, he would have me.</p>
               <p>Robinson's defence. I was drinking along with Fred. at the Three Kings. and we were drinking and playing at cards, and tossing, when the countryman and Smith came in; he lost five shillings at cards, and then he took us to the Geroge where we got drinking again; and he took out a guinea to pay for what we had had, and Fred. ran away with it.(One of the Jury said, be was a near neighbour, and that the George was an in famous house)</p>

I let the prisoner a room about May last ready furnished, and she has from time to time taken away the goods mentioned in the indictment, and I was informed she had pawned them in divers places, so I took her up on New-Year's-Day, and she begged forgiveness, and said she would fetch them again as soon as she could; she told me the bed was at Mr. Peacock's.</p>

On the 4th of June I lost a van, and on the 8th of June, in consequence of information, I went to John-street, Bethnal-green, where I found it taken to pieces - I knew every bit of it; I saw the prisoner there, and asked him whether the carriages, wheels, shafts, and van, which were laying about, belonged to him - he said Yes, the whole of them; I said,"I am very much mistaken if this don't belong to me;" he never opened his lips again - my name had been on the front and the off-side of the van, painted in yellow letters on a red ground; I had seen it safe at ten o'clock on the Saturday night, and on the Wednesday I saw it in John-street - I had received information on the Sunday; the van was worth 20l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Where did you see the van on Saturday night? A. At my door, in Chandos-street - I took Christie with me to the Magistrate, but not to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you find the van? A. It had been taken to pieces, and the body was on another carriage - I think it was better as I had it; it was in good order for work.</p>

On Sunday, the 5th of June, the prisoner came, and hired a stand in my yard, at 2s. a week, and on the Tuesday he brought a van, drawn by a large brown horse - the body of the van was yellow, and he took off the lower part of it; the next day he painted the body slate colour - there was no name on it when he brought it to me; the day following some person came, and took the prisoner away with it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had your master his name on the van? A. Yes, on the red head-board, and the letters were shaded with black - the board was there; the van had been taken off the wheels, and the wheels and springs put to another body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was nothing done to it that prevented your knowing it again? A. No - I had no watch when I was at the stable; I had four horses to attend to - I had been to Sydenham, and did not get home till then; I heard the clock strike eleven when I got up to the Strand.</p>

            . I am a sack-maker, and live at No. 1, Adelphi-under-the-Terrace. On Saturday night, the 4th of June, I went to the pump for some water, about a quarter or twenty minutes before twelve o'clock; I saw the prisoner there, and a man in a smock-frock, leading a horse in the shafts of Mr. Randall's van - they appeared to be in company, and were talking together; the horse was a high brown horse - I had seen the prisoner before three or four times, but never at the Adelphi- he passed close by me that night, and I am certain he is the man; I informed the prosecutor next morning of what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What are you? A. A coal sackmaker - I live with my father; I knew the prisoner before, but never spoke to him - I should not think I saw him above five minutes that night - this did not strike me as a suspicious circumstance; I should not know the other man, who was on the off side of the horse - I did not know at the time that it was Mr. Randall's van, but I heard the next morning that his van was lost; there was nobody with me - some of the people in the neighbourhood were up; it would be a dark place if there were no lamps, but there were lamps, and I stood right under one of them; I swear I had seen the prisoner before two or three times, but I cannot tell any one place, or when, I had seen him - I see a great many people about the street; I never said I could not swear to a person in such a dark place, and that it would be difficult enough to do it in daylight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where Mr. Randall kept his van? A. Yes, close to the stable door, not twenty yards from where I saw the prisoner.</p>

               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A.Six years; he lodged with me about eighteen months - a man might walk from there to the Adelphi in three quarters of an hour; he is a carman.</p>

On Saturday night, the 4th of June, I remember his coming to my shop for a truss of hay, about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock - he ordered it to be sent to his yard, at the Green Dragon, Worship-street; I objected to fetching it down that night, as I did not like to go up with a candle - he stopped till about twenty minutes or a quarter to twelve, as he remained to hear a woman singing; I can positively swear he was in my shop about that time - I live full two miles from the Adelphi.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What induced you to notice the time he stopped? A.Because I had just then given my man orders to shut up the shop; I am certain I am correct within five minutes.</p>

            . I was examined on the part of this prosecutor, but was not before the Grand Jury; I am a carman, and live at No. 2, King's-road, Hoxton. I know the prisoner very well - I was with him on Saturday night, the 4th of June; I met him near twelve o'clock, about half way up Worship-street, and just before we got to the Baker and Basket, I saw two men with a horse and van - one was talking to the other about buying the van, but he went away just as we came up, and the prisoner asked the man what he wanted for it - I think he said 13l. or 14l.; the man who went away had a short smockfrock and trousers - the other had a smock-frock and white stockings; the man said he wanted to sell the van, and he had just parted with that man, as they could not deal - that he did not dare to take it home, fearing to have it seized for rent on the Monday morning; the prisoner ultimately agreed to purchase it for 10l.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What did you hear the man say? A. He said he had a van to sell; I had never seen him before - they were both strangers; there was no name on the head of the van - I did not go to the off-side of it; I left them there dealing, within one hundred yards of the prisoner's yard - I told the prisoner, if I was him, I would not pay all the money till day-light; I saw no money paid - I left them walking towards his yard; there was a brown thick-looking horse in the van.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They were strangers to you? A. Yes; I was talking to Goddard and three or four men when they came up - I have known the prisoner five or six years; he has a stable in Worship-street, and lives at the corner of Finsbury-market - I was at Worship-street, and told young Armstrong what I had seen; he sent me into the office - I would not give more than 7l. or 8l. for the van; it was a light colour, the axletree and carriage was dark; the body was a lightish colour - not yellow nor white; it might have been yellow once, but was worn - it was a lightish yellow; I have seen a van here, but it is new done over now - I did not see the prisoner that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is Brick-lane in the way from the Adelphi to Worship-street? A. I do not think it is the shortest way; it is out of the road - one of the men had a short frock, and long brown trousers; the other had white stockings, and high shoes - he was a stout man; there was a name on the cart, but I cannot read.</p>

A.Because I took home bills for my work; I am not certain it was not eleven o'clock - I did not see the prisoner that night; I have known him about five or six years - there was a short punchey horse in the van, short and thick - I am sure it was not a white horse; I cannot say whether it was black - they asked him if he knew who wanted a van; he said he did not - that he had only a sovereign, if that would buy it, he had no objection; the man said he would not take less than 12l. or 14l. - I cannot read properly; I did not notice the colour of the van - it might have been black for what I know; it was not very close to me - I did not see Wise examine it much, for I was talking to Mr. Bedell, a builder, who I work for; I give receipts for money.</p>
               <p>Q. If you cannot read, how do you know the date by your bills? The man who keeps my book tells me the dates - his name is Taylor; I can tell figures - I delivered a bill to Mr. Bedell that day; I did not observe any figures on the van - I heard nothing of this till Thursday, (a month ago to-morrow,) when the gate-keeper at the gas-works said Whiting was taken up for buying a van; I said there was a van offered for sale on Saturday night - he said that was the time he bought it; I do not know that I have ever spoken to the prisoner - I was never in his house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How far do you live from Old-street? A.About three hundred yards - I cannot say at what time I got home; I stopped and drank with Bedell and Wise, and then Wise went home - we were not many minutes at the public-house; I had been to Burke, in Cooper's-court, for some money.</p>

            . I live at No, 18, Crown-street, Soho, and keep a horse and cart; I heard Christie say he did not think it was any body who worked about the premises, or he should have known him again.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to Christie? A. No; I went to my stable about six o'clock in the morning, and saw him - I never told his father he should have 4l., 5l., or 6l., if he kept his son out of the way, nor any thing of the kind - I move furniture with my cart.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.How far is your stable from where the van is kept? A. About the length of this Court - I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Christie's father? A. Because some word was uttered under the place that was false - the prisoner's wife sent to me; I went up with them, and they told me what the business was.</p>
               <p>- CHRISTIE, SEN. I am Christie's step-father. I would not believe Isaacs on his oath; what he has stated is all false - I know his character.</p>

They asked me if I would go with them to Covent Garden Theatre; Harding paid for all three, and when we were in the Theatre, Harding took out a one-pound note from her pocket, and gave it to me to take care off; Mrs. Brewer told her I should keep it safer than she, and she had it the next morning. On the Tuesday morning, they had both gone out in a coach together, and had taken a very large bundle, and a pelisse; that pelisse was a cloth one, and Ann Harding took it across her arm; it was a light brown one; I did not see what the other things were that they took in the bundle; they returned together to the house; but I can't exactly say at what time; they did not bring any of the things back with them; I did not see that pelisse afterwards. When we were going to the Theatre, I asked Harding where she had taken her things, and she said to her cousin's in St. Paul's-church-yard, where she was going again; she said she was going to live there; she sold me two silver salt spoons, and half a silk handkerchief; that was on the Tuesday that she sold the salt spoons, and on the Wednesday the silk handkerchief. On the Thursday I had some black lace, and she said she should like it, and would exchange a gold ring for it, which she did. I returned her the things on the Friday night; I did not return her the ring, because it was in pledge; I have since redeemed it, and have it now; I understood that this ring which I have on my finger is Mrs. Campbell's. My husband took Harding up at the play; Brewer was not with her then. The trunk was at my longings; Plank took it away on the Saturday morning; that was the trunk that

            . I am a wheelwright. The prisoner worked for me some time before the 23d of April. I missed some saws, planes, and other things on a Saturday evening, and on the following Monday the prisoner was taken to the watch-house - I asked him what he had done with the tools; he said he had not seen any - the watchman said, "How can you say so, when I saw you come out with a basket of tools at half-past four o'clock on Saturday morning;" he then began to cry, and said he had taken them, and sold them on the road.</p>

            . On Saturday morning, the 23d of April, I saw the prisoner come out of the premises at half-past four o'clock, with a basket of tools - he said he was going to a job of work in the brick fields, to cut up some planks - that it was his master's job, and not his own. On the Monday, when Mr. Brown told me he was in the watch-house, I found him there, and said to him, "You rogue, if I had known you to be a thief, I would have taken you" - he made no reply.</p>

I asked the prisoner on Tuesday morning what he had done with the tools, as I heard he had informed his master he had taken them - he said he had sold them to some people on the road, that he did not know the names of the places, but would shew me; I went with him, and found the whole of these tools.</p>

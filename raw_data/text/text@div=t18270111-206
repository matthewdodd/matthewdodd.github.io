I was in St. Paul's Church-yard, and saw the prisoners together- I watched them for an hour and a half; I saw them shove up against Mr. Gutteridge, and Garratt took the watch; Osborn then gave Mr. Gutteridge a shove, and they ran down a turning - I saw them stopped.</p>

            . I was in the Old 'Change between seven and eight o'clock, and saw the two prisoners there; I heard the cry of Stop thief! the prisoners were coming along, both crying Stop thief! but nobody was before them - the prosecutor was following them up; I stood by at the corner of a lane, and when they came up I sprang out, and grasped both of them in my arms; they said twice, "Where are the thieves?" I said, "I am afraid you are them." I secured Osborn - Garratt got from me, but Lyon took him.</p>

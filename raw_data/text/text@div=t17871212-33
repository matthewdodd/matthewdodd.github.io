               <p>I am servant to Mr. Matthews; my fellow-servant and I were with the cart; I gave five pieces to Bateman to carry to Mr. Anderson's; I then had three pieces left in the cart, and set myself down in the cart, and saw the prisoner take one piece away.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man come up to the cart? - I did not; he made a second attempt, I clapped my hand upon it, and then he saw me and slipped under the horse's head.</p>
               <p>Did you see what he did with the piece? - No, I did not, nor did I see anybody near him.</p>
               <p>Now you saw the man come again; what did he do? - He came round by the horse's head upon the pavement, and I challenged him; he said he had never touched a piece, and walked away; I called my fellow servant, who pursued him and took him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan, prisoner's counsel. Was it a covered cart or an open cart? - It was an open cart.</p>
               <p>Was you watching the pieces in the cart? - I was: when he attempted to take the second piece, I called to my fellow-servant.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Matthews. Did you see the cart that day? - I did.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any cloth was lost that day? - There was one piece lost.</p>
               <p>Was the cart book at home that day? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120052"></xptr>It was; when I looked it over, there was one piece lost, which appeared by the book, it was all signed by the parties who received the goods, except the piece that was lost.</p>

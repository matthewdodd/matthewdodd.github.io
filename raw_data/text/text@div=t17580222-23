            . I rented a room of the prisoner Watson. Some time in September last I missed a large silver spoon, two pair of laced ruffles, one pair of plain, two silk handkerchiefs, one remnant of Irish cloth, one apron, a yard of lace, and a body of a shift, from out of my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your room door lock'd ?</p>
               <p>Constantine. It was. I had no reason to suspect either of the prisoners till Duncan came on the 24th of January and told me of it. She said she had taken the goods, and would tell me where they were. She went with me to a silversmith just by Wapping Chapel, where I found the silver spoon; and then to a pawnbroker's in Nightingale-Lane, St. John's, Wapping; where she said she had pawn'd the laced ruffles for two shillings, but the pownbroker denied them. I found an apron and the yard of lace in Watson's house, upon the information of Duncan.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house did you find them ?</p>
               <p>Constantine. Mrs. Watson gave me them out of her own hands. I took her before the justice, and she own'd the taking of all the things; and they both told me they had each of them had a cap made of the Irish linen, and the muslin ruffles served for borders to the caps.</p>

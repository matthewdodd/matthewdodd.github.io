On the morning of Christmas Day I saw a dog cart—a person was driving it backwards and forwards by my window—it was about half past 10 o'clock—I think Wilson was the driver, but I am not prepared to swear it—soon after the people had gone to Church I saw the cart coming back facing me, and I saw three men, Jones and two others—the cart was then coming back in the direction of the prosecutor's house, and the three men were coming from the house to meet the cart—they were coming from the direction of the house—they were all dressed very respectably, in black—there is a shut up house with two entrances, and Jones placed his back against that door which was facing me—he was talking to the others—they all stopped facing my window, as they seemed to come in a direction from Mr. Faulkner's—I was shaving myself at my window opposite—the dog cart came to them, and they had further conversation for ten minutes—there were then four men—the width of the street from my window is about twenty-five yards—the three men went towards the prosecutor's house—the dog cart waited a little time, and then it went in the same direction, and I saw no more—I went to the Thames police station, to recognise Jones—I think that was on the Monday, five or six days after.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Claremont-cottage, exactly opposite Mr. Faulkner. On the morning of Christmas Day I saw a dog cart opposite Mr. Faulkner's house—it was drawn up close to the kerb stone—it was about half past 11 o'clock when I first saw it—there was one man sitting in it, holding the reins and whip—I cannot tell who it was, I did not see him face—I have no belief as to who it was—I saw Jones standing by the shaft of the cart, with his face towards the horse—I had an opportunity of seeing him for the half hour they were there—I saw one man in the garden just by the side of the gate—when I first saw him, he was going towards the kitchen window—I did not see anything particular after that till they opened the street door, and came out, bringing a chest—two men did that, one had got one handle, and the other the other—it appeared to be an iron chest—they placed it in the dog cart—one of them then returned up the steps, and pulled the door just to—they then all four stood by the cart, with their faces towards the cart—the man that had been in the cart had got out when they brought the chest outside the gate—they put the chest into the cart, and then put themselves to rights, and got into the cart—the man who had been in the cart, holding the reins and whip, got up behind, and to the best of my belief it was Jones drove the cart away towards the Holloway road—I have since seen a cart at Hoxton, and I should say that was decidedly the same cart that I saw on Christmas Day, and I have every reason to believe the horse I saw was the same, but he was in a different condition—he was very dark, I should say nearly black—I do not recognise either of the other prisoners, except that the back and shoulders of Wilson look like the man that sat in the cart—I said so at the police court.</p>

               <p>11 and 12 o'clock, I passed Mr. Faulkner's—I saw a dog cart standing at his door, and Wilson was in it—I noticed him, because he resembles a person I know very well, I at first thought it was him—I saw a stout man at the head of the horse—I could not swear to the face of that man, but I can to his figure—I had to wait at the corner of Cornwall-place for an omnibus—while I was standing there the dog cart passed me, and there were then four men in it—I have seen the same dog cart since, and the horse.</p>

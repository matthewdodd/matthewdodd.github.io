               <p>Q. That you swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been at these Sessions before? - A. No; I am to appear in another trial; I am come to speak the truth.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Hatton Garden: In consequence of information I received from Armfield, on the 4th of February, I went to Dealy's apartments in Newton-street, Holborn, and found this box, a dark lantern, a number of picklock keys, a small crow, and a pocket-book. (Producing them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner (Dealy.) It is not my room.</p>
               <p>Inwards. They told me it was, and his wife was in it, he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (Dealy.) It is not mine.</p>
               <p>Inwards. Smith and I went then to Harrison's in Baldwin's Gardens, where we found him in bed with Bullock, but we found no part of the property; Dealy hearing we had been after him, sent for me, and surrendered; I found the ribbon on Bullock's head; Davis's lodgings were searched, and only a gold epaulet found; I went to Jones's, but found nothing there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Montague Q. Where was Armfield when you went to Harrison - was he in custody? - A. He never was kept in custody; the story he told the Magistrate was satisfactory, and he took my word for his appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his information, did you go to Harrison's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he apply to you voluntarily? - A. Yes, he did. (The box identified.)</p>
               <p>Harrison's defence. I leave my case to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Dealy's defence. The box was not found in my room.</p>
               <p>Davis's defence. I never saw the evidence in all the days of my life.</p>
               <p>Jones's defence. I never had any dealings with the evidence at all, in any form whatever.</p>
               <p>Harrison called three, Dealy two, Jones six, and Davis one, witness, who gave them good characters.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner, Harrison.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where do you live? - A. I live in Long-lane, and am a steel-worker, and make fancy ornaments; Armfield and Harrison have worked for me, and Armfield often persuaded Harrison to go ut at nights with him, and leave his work; I suspected that Armfield had robbed me, which I told him, and he left his work in consequence of it, for fear I should prosecute him; he did not come for three months after; he sent persons to me to beg me to take him in again, as he was leading a bad course of life.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you accuse him with taking of? - A. Combs, and different things; he came to me again, in consequence of his friends saying they would be bound for him, and was with me about three months, during which time I gave him some little gold to melt, but when it came to be worked, it turned black, as though he had put brass in it; and I had bought a handkerchief, which he wished to have, and said, he would pay me for it; I said, no, but he went down stairs, and told my wife that I said he might have it, and took it away; he worked for me sixteen months in the whole, but I never knew of his being examined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170066"></xptr>before a Magistrate; I have heard him talk about stealing dead bodies, and selling them for two guineas a-piece, and that it was better to do that than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of him, is he a man you would believe on his oath? - A. No, he is not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman living in Wales, at New-house, near Cardiff. On the 28th of Nov. I was in town, staying at the Trafalgar Hotel, Charing-cross—Messrs.

Bank notes—I put the notes I received into my pocket at the banker's, and when I got to the hotel I put them out of my pocket-book into my portmanteau, which was in my bed-room—that was, as near as I can judge, about four o'clock in the afternoon, or a little before—I locked the portmanteau and then went out to take a walk, and was out till nearly six o'clock—at near ten o'clock, when I went to bed, I opened my portmanteau, to see if the notes were safe—I had some difficulty in opening the lock, but I did open it, and found the notes gone—I had been out from four to six o'clock, and was in my sitting-room at the hotel from that time till I went to bed—part of my family were with me, and we had a sitting-room to ourselves—I made no alarm that night—the female servant came into the room early in the morning to light the fire—I told her I had lost 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and that they would be of no use to anybody, as I had the numbers—I saw the head waiter soon after—I went to Glyn's, I got there before the banking-house was open in the morning, and gave them in<lb></lb>formation—I remember Lake at the hotel—he waited upon me—I did not observe Bowen there.</p>

Bowen had wished me to employ a person named Dancock as an extra waiter—I knew Dancock's father, but not the son—Bowen recommended the son to me—I knew his father as waiter at the Adelaide hotel—I have known him many years—he is a man of respectable character—I objected to employ the son, and did not, having heard he was a wild gay character—I did not usually sleep in the hotel myself, but I did on the night of the 28th, as my mother, who had come from the country, slept with my wife—I heard of the loss of the notes between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—about half-past eight—I saw Lake first, and Bowen directly after—Lake mentioned the robbery to me as I walked into the house, in the hall—I walked into the coffee-room and saw Bowen, who said, "Did you hear of Mr. Lewis having lost 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—of course I was astonished at the news—I said, "Why Charles, you have been out last night by the look of you"—he said, "No, I have not, but I am very unwell"—my master was informed of what occurred, and the police were called in—I was in communication from time to time with the inspector—on Sunday, the 14th of Dec., Ottway, the inspector, made a communication to me about the notes—that brought to my recollection the appli<lb></lb>cation which had been made to me to employ Dancock—Bowen was taken into custody in the course of that morning—I was not present when he was taken—after he was taken from the house I went on attending to the business of the hotel—it was not a busy day, but rather dull—Lake was still there—it was his business to assist me—Lake came to me and reported that Bowen had been taken into custody, and expressed himself in that sorrowful way that I took notice of it, and made the remark, "Well, I am innocent, I hope you are, George?"—he answered, "Yes, I am"—I said in a sharp manner," And I do hope if he is guilty he will be transported"—I then found Lake quite incapable of doing his business—he was the hotel waiter, that is, the private sitting-room waiter—we had a little dinner up stairs—I found he did not know how to get the tray ready—he was in such a confused state he did not know what he was about—at last finding him perfectly insane, not capable of doing his business, I said, "The fact is, George, you are concerned in the rob<lb></lb>bery yourself," to which he said, yes, he was—he then said, "I was driven into it by Charles or Charley," (meaning Bowen)—he told me Bowen had formed a plan to rob the Rev. Mr. Lewis, that he had obtained a key to fit Mr. Lewis's portmanteau, that having done so he brought the key to Lake and said to him, and "I have tried this little gentleman, (holding the key in his hands,) I find it just fits the portmanteau"—that from that time to the time of the robbery Bowen was in Mr. Lewis's room every day during Mr. Lewis's absence—that on the 28th of Nov., Bowen went into Mr. Lewis's room, between four and five o'clock, he first saw Lake, and said to him, (after having been in Mr. Lewis's room, and opened the portmanteau, and seen the notes,) "Wait till Talbot goes down to tea, and then you go in and get the notes, they are in such, a part of the portmanteau, and they are perfectly safe"—that as soon as they saw me go down to tea, both went up stairs together, Bowen gave Lake instructions to go into the room and stop up the key-hole, and should there be any noise to go out at the window and along the balcony into another room, that Lake, after taking the notes out of the portmanteau, according to Bowen's instructions, was half inclined to go out at the balcony, but thought the neighbours might see him, and he retreated from the balcony, opened the room-door, and came out the same way he went in—that Bowen was at the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you previously given him anything to drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the first occasion, when he told me he was unwell and nervous, I said, "Take a drop of brandy in a little cold water, and see what that will do," not then supposing he was implicated in the affair—I swear he was perfectly sober,—finding he was not quite so well in the morning as he should be, I said, "The fact is, George, you were out last night"—he said, "No, I was not, indeed"—I may have said to you in the morning that he had been out, finding him unwell, and incapable of doing his business—I did not tell you he was intoxicated—I suppose this confession occupied more than two hours, because the business of the house called each of us away occasionally—it commenced about seven o'clock, and did not end till near nine, and at that moment Charles Wood and little <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> happened to call, and I, having received a full description of them, thought it my duty to give them into custody—they inquired for you, nobody else—I believe I waited on Mr. Lewis a little every day, not much, but I always saw him—I may have waited in the room while Lake went down stairs—I went into Mr. Lewis's bed-room early in that day, not in the even<lb></lb>ing—it was to take Mr. Lewis a basin of mutton broth—that was about two o'clock—I do not know that I ever saw you or any one else in Mr. Lewis's bed-room, except Lake—I never heard any one say you were in there—I have heard persons say the door was fastened on several occasions, and they were surprised Mr. Lewis should lock his door, and Lake afterwards told me that was the time you were in the room, and that it was your practice to stop up the key-hole—I think it quite possible for you to have locked and unlocked the door without being heard—I never tried to entrap Lake—I have frequently told him I would get rid of him—he was always careless, and never did his work as he ought, and I gave him the advice of a brother—I liked him—I considered him an inexperienced young man, and never carried my threat into execution, or told Mr. Barrack—I gave him good advice, thinking he would improve—we were not at all busy in the coffee-room that day—we had about eight or ten dinners—we had the extra waiter, because we had more sitting-room dinners than usual—you were in the coffee-room and had nothing to do with the hotel business—Lake told me that you instructed him if there was not the means of coming out unseen at the door, he was to leave by the balcony and get into another room called the Nelson, which was un<lb></lb>occupied at that time, but, even if it was occupied, a gentleman would not be in his room at four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>(James Thompson, of No. 7, Newcastle-street, Strand; and Thomas Payne, a licensed victualler, White Horse-street, Drury-lane, gave Lake a good cha<lb></lb>racter; and Charles Aistrop, of No. 58, Lower Thames-street, gave Dancock a good character.</p>

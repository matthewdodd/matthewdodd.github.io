I told them I would not have any thing to say to them - they then asked me to give them some gin; I said, I did not know that I should; but if gin would do them any good they should have it. I went into a shop with them - I am certain when I went in that my watch was in my fob; they called for three glasses of gin, and handed me one; I put it to my lips but did not drink it. I gave the landlord a shilling to pay for it; he gave me the change, and I put the halfpence in my left hand pocket. I staid there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes looking about, and thought it was a curious place; the girls wanted more gin, which I refused - but I gave them the halfpence. I went out as far as Windsor's the coachmakers' shop, about ten yards from the gin shop.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you sober - A. Yes; I never was drunk but twice in my life. I went that evening to the Coachmaker's Arm's public-house about eleven o'clock, and stopped there about three quarters of an hour. I had one glass of rum and water there; before that I had been at Mr. Gibbs's and had three-penny worth of oysters, one drink of porter - that might be about half-past ten; I had been before that in a public-house, in Brewer-street, Golden-square - I went there about twenty minutes past nine, and left at ten. I had 6 d. worth of rum and water before that; I have a tap at home, but I do not know whether I had tasted any that night - I had been at work till five or six o'clock, and to the best of my knowledge I did not eat or drink till nine o'clock - I was not at all in liquor. I was not going with them, nor bargaining with them - this girl had her hand in my breeches pocket, they then both ran away. I do not know how long it was before I took the prisoner into custody, it might be an hour; the robbery was committed upon Mr. Windsor's grating, there is a light there; I was rather in a flurry, and hurt to think that I had been robbed. I am certain I could not have mistaken one person for another; when I came back from the watch-house, this girl was a hundred and fifty yards from the spot - she said I was mistaken in the person.</p>

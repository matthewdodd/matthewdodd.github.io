When the woman was gone for the bread a shipmate of mine called me out to some more of my old shipmates; we stopped at a public-house till nine or ten o'clock, and as I was going home I met a man with a bed, who said he was very much fatigued, and asked me to carry it; I said I was in a hurry, and at the time the watchman came up, and took us all to the watchhouse; I have served with Lord Nelson and Sir John Borlase Warren in all their actions this was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Enfield, and live close by Moses. His little boy called me up about three o'clock that morning—I went to his house, and found the bag containing a lot of harness—I have a brother named Jasper, we went on the road towards London, and overtook a wagon near Tottenham High Cross—James Skipp was driving it—I saw, in the tail of the wagon, a large bag, which I considered was harness—I got out of the cart to see what it was—I found it contained harness, and Catling was lying on the top of it—I told him he was the person I was looking for—he said he knew nothing about that har<lb></lb>ness—I called the wagon boy, he took up Catling with that bag of harness at Enfield Wash bridge, and another man was with him at the time—I put Catling into the cart I had got, and went on in pursuit of another—as we were going along, Catling said we should overtake the other man at the White Hart, Kingsland-road—as we were going along, I asked different persons if they had seen a man on the road with a black and white dog—I still went on in pursuit of another man—I went to the White Hart, Kingsland-road—I there asked Catling the man's name—he said he did not know his name, but he knew him personally—Catling said, "Go up Old-street-road"—I did—when I got up there, he said, 'Go into Smithfield"—when there, he said, Go down Cock-lane, and from there into Farringdon-street"—I said I would not go any farther, unless he told me who I was going after—when I got to Farringdon-street, he told me to go Fleet-street, and stop at Lombard-court—I went down there—he told me to knock at No. 10—I knocked at the door twice,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183609190157"></xptr>
               <p>and waited a few minutes, and then knocked against; but, before I went down, I asked Catling who I was to ask for—he said he did not know his name, but he gave a description of his dress, and told me to go and ask for a person that had brought in a black and white dog—I did so—a man poked his head out of the door—I had some conversation with him about a dog (Catling was in Fleet-street, in the cart)—I went in at last, and there saw the prisoner Cook—he was in the act of undoing his shoes, as if un<lb></lb>dressing himself—I asked him where he had been—he said in the country—he said he knew nothing about any dog—I put the hand-cuffs on him, put him into the cart, and took him before the Magistrate, at Enfield—I found a crow-bar upon him, also this knife, this phosphorus box, this watch, and an empty box; and on Catling, I found nine skeleton keys, a knife, a cord and a string, by which you might lead a dog—some salve on silk, to tame dogs, and four duplicates—there is a smell about the salve that is particular—the box I took from Cook has just the same smell—any of these keys will open Mr. Stephens's stable door.</p>

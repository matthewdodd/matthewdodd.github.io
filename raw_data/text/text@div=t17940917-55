I went to the butcher's the the corner of Farthing-fields, to buy a piece of meat for me and my child, and a good woman asked me if I would go of an errand for her? it was to pawn that thing for her; I asked her what it was? she said it was this cloak, and I willingly did it for the sake of a few halfpence, says she, do you know that pawnbroker, and does he know you? yes, says I, then says she, put it in your own name as long as I have the duplicate it will be no object; I went and asked the pawnbroker half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170132"></xptr>crown, I carried it to the woman, and she asked me whether I would have a quartern with her or the halfpence? I said the halfpence would be of most service to me, and if my prosecutor can swear that I stole the property, I am very willing to suffer what the laws of God and my country can instict. I never saw the woman before.</p>

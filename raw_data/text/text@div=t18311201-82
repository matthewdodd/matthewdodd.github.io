On the 4th of November, about half-past four o'clock, I was going to Cheapside - I used my handkerchief in St. Paul's church-yard, and about two minutes after, I felt a motion at my coat; Mr. Stabb, who was with me, asked if I had lost my handkerchief - I said Yes; I turned round, and seized the prisoner, he being nearest to me: I found the handkerchief put up behind him, between his coat and waistcoat - I have not a doubt of its being mine; he at first said he had not got it, and then that he had picked it up - I could not have dropped it; I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. Is your pocket in the skirt of your coat? A. Yes - I am sure I put it into my pocket, and felt it there a moment before; I am in the habit of walking a good deal with my hand in my pocket.</p>

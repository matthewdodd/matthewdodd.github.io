            . Last Tuesday was three Weeks, the Child came into my Yard, and said, that a Woman who was running up the Road had robbed her. We pursued her, and she mended her pace, and ran half way up the Road, till she came to a green Meadow which is paled in, and then I saw her throw something over the pals. I did not stay to see what it was, but continued the pursuit, and just as she got to the Turnpike which leads to Pimlico, she was taken .</p>

             . I was in the same Yard, when the Child came in crying, and said she was robbed. We all ran out, and saw that there was no person in the Road but the Prisoner, and I saw that the thing which she flung into the Meadow was green. We did not stay to take it up, but I laid hold of the Prisoner, and carried her into a House, and soon afterwards the Child's Coat was brought in, and I believe it to be the very same which I saw the Prisoner throw out of her Hand .</p>
               <p>Jury . Have you ever seen the Child wear that Coat?</p>
               <p>Edmonds . Yes, several Times, and she was without it when she came into the Yard.</p>
               <p>Jury . Do you believe that was the Thing which the Prisoner threw from her?</p>
               <p>Edmonds . Yes, I am sure it is the Child's petticoat, and I saw it taken out of the Meadow by a little Boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the Two-penny Post-office, Charing Cross, branch-office; the prisoner was also a letter-carrier in the same office. On the evening of the 22nd of April, I was employed in sorting letters at the office, and so was he—he is a sorter when he is in the office—he sorts for the South Western division—he was sorting there that evening, and I observed when he came to one letter he took particular notice of it—he felt it, and did not place it in the box before him—(there were seven boxes before him for the different divisions)—instead of placing it in one of them, he placed it underneath the other letters—he then sorted into the different boxes till he got to that letter again, and then he took up other letters and placed on the top of it a second time—when he had sorted them into the different walks, he took this letter to his own desk—I had suspicion that the letter did not belong to his walk, and I informed Mr. Gapes, the Inspector—he went to him in a short time, when he was about to leave the office, and asked him for his bag and letters—he took his bag and letters, and out of his bag Mr. Gapes took two letters and an ac<lb></lb>count-book—one letter was much less than the other—I should know the letters which were taken out of the bag—I should not be able to recognize the letter he took to his own desk—not by the direction—I noticed the two letters that were taken out of the bag, and read the address of one—it was, "Mr. Seymour, gold-beater, Long Acre"—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is it, and I believe it to be the letter which he put behind the others—MR. Gapes only took two letters out of the bag—there were no more in the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of the letter-carriers at the Branch-office, Charing Cross. On the evening of the 22nd of April, Abbott gave me information, and I examined the prisoner's bag—I found there two let<lb></lb>ters, and a small memorandum-book, in which they keep their accounts—I asked him how they came there—he at first said he did not know, and then that somebody must have put them there—I said he had placed him-self in an awkward situation, and sent for an officer—he had been employed that evening in sorting paid letters—this is one of the letters I found in his bag—it is directed to Mr. Seymour, gold-beater, No. 38, Long Acre, London—this is a paid letter—the prisoner is a letter-carrier as well as a sorter—that letter was not in his walk—he had no right with that letter in his possession at that time—it bears three stamps—one Reading, the paid stamp of the General Post-office in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and the date stamp of the Two-penny Post-office, St. Martin's-le-Grand, 8 night, April 22—that would not be in the office as a dead letter—it was sealed when I found it—the prisoner at that time had a bundle of letters pre<lb></lb>pared for delivery—it was not among them—they were not in the bag.</p>

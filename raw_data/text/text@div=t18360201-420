                  </hi>. I live in Bishopsgate-street Without, and am a stay<lb></lb>maker. On Friday, the 8th of January, I had to send a truss containing eleven dozen pairs of stays to Liverpool—I sent for Thomas Sullivan, who is watchman of the Ward, and also employed by me as porter, and desired him to take this truss to Pickford's, in Wood-street—he is not here—he went away about six o'clock in the evening—he only went over the way, he was not gone two minutes, when he brought the prisoner to assist him back with it, as he was in liquor and could not carry it—the prisoner asked me to let him have the job, he would do it for the same money—I did not know him before, but the other lending him his hat and knot, put me quite off my guard; and he said to the prisoner. "When you come back, bring the knot to me"—I then gave it him—he carried it some dis<lb></lb>tance, and then said it was too heavy, he had not been used to carry with a knot, but he would get a truck and take it for the same money—he came with the truck, and asked which way he was to go—I told him—I was going with him, but in an instant he was gone and the truck also—I had only stopped to get a paper to carry into the City—the parcel has never been seen since—it was worth 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not the least doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

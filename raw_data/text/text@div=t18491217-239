I am an officer attached to the Trade Protection Society—I received instructions, and inquired after the firm of Barclay and Co.—on the 25th Aug., I saw Mr. Cetta in Mr. Barclay's warehouse in Maiden-lane—I was there, and when Mr. Cetta came out I had some con<lb></lb>versation with him—the next morning I went to Mr. Cetta's place—I returned to Maiden-lane, and watched there about a quarter of an hour—I saw the warehouseman come out with a looking-glass and barometer, wrapped up in a shawl—I had been watching the premises three or four</p>

I glass and the barometer—I there saw about two dozen glasses and a lot of chain, I which I had seen in Mr. Barclay's—I have been looking for Mr. Crowther, I do not know where he is—the place in Maiden-lane was first designated I as Barclay and Co's., about June, 1848, and it continued rather better than two months before it was shut up—Crowther's place was closed a few days afterwards.</p>

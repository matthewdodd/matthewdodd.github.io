               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me touch your watch-chain? A. I saw your right hand go against it - I felt the watch move immediately - I then caught hold of you, and had you taken - my wife called the policeman - I do not know what you did with the chain and seals - when you came up facing me, I took a step to the right - you stepped the same way, and snatched my chain and seals.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you quite positive it was the prisoner's hand that went to your chain? A. Yes; the prisoner had a smock frock on; but the other had a coat on - I should not know the other man again.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you husband caught hold of me, did I not deny it? A. Yes: I did not see you speak to the other man; but you had your arms linked together - we could not get by you - there was room to have passed, if you would have let us.</p>

On the 6th of May, I killed five of them - I saw the others safe between four and five o'clock that afternoon. The next morning, at eight o'clock, I missed them. My house is at Upper Islington. I have some pens at the back of my house. If I wanted to go from the Pied Bull to Cross-street, the nearest way would be to pass the front of my house; there is another way by the back road. When I lost the sheep, I sent for Beasley; the next morning he made a communication, which made me suspect the prisoner Harvey. At eleven o'clock the next morning, I went with a constable to Castle-street, Clerkenwell, and took him up-we found him bed. I believe he said he had been to Portsmouth. I next went with Beasley, French, and Lack, to the house of the prisoner, Parrott, in Blue-gate-fields, Shadwell. I found her at home, sitting in the shop, which was fitted up like a butcher's shop; there were a few hooks in the window, and two knuckles of mutton laying on the window. I found a neck of mutton laying on the board, with the lamb, exposed for sale. I searched further, and found a shoulder of mutton behind a great coat in the shop. The constable opened a cupboard, and found two pair of hind-quarters of mutton hanging up, covered with a dirty cloth; the cupboard was in the shop, the door was not locked. The constable went up stairs, and brought down a pair of fore-quarters and a brisket, with a cloth over them; they were fat mutton, and answered to one of the hind quarters; all the joints corresponded, and were fat mutton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I do not know whether Parrott has a husband. The fore-quarters were cut up by a butcher; the hind-quarters were together. The cupboard was a very improper place to keep meat; it should be hung in an open place.</p>
               <p>JOHR BEASLEY. I am a drover. The last witness gave me orders to drive seven fat sheep to his house at Islington. I marked them on the back, and along the off hip; they had an O branded round the tail. I took them to his house. On Monday, the 26th of May, I was sitting on the bench at the Thatched-house, Lower Islington, just at the bottom of Cross-street, about a quarter before five o'clock; I saw a young man named French, drive two sheep down by Paradise-place, by the mad-house - They were fat sheep. I asked him where he was going with them? he said he found them in the back road, and did not know where he was going with them. I saw the O on them, but did not observe the other marks-the O was just above the tail - They were just turning the corner. I told Mr. Sanders, and afterwards took French to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. There are a number of sheep marked with an O on them.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FRENCH. I know the prisoner, Harvey, and re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020031"></xptr>member seeing him last Whit Monday just by Smithfield-bars; he said he would give me a job to drive two sheep. I went to the Pied Bull, at Islington, with him; when he got there, he told me to go round by the back road to the Rainbow public-house, and stay there till he came to me. I went, and very soon afterwards he came to me - He came out of the pens by the Pied Bull - He was driving two sheep through the palings. He brought them to me, and told me to drive them and follow him. I went round to Upper-street, Islington, and down a street. I saw Beasley at the Thatched-house - He asked me whose sheep they were? I told him I found them in the back road, and did not know whose they were; upon which the prisoner (who was just by me), ran down by the river. I drove them on, and saw him again soon after - I saw him just by Shoreditch Church turnpike, turning down to Bethnal-green; he went on before me, into the Commercial-road, and left the sheep at the prisoner's, Parrott, house. Harvey went on there before me, and I drove the sheep in. He told her to give me 2s. I went to the house and saw her there; I did not stay five minutes - I heard him tell her to give me 2s., which she did. The sheep were put into a little bit of a shed, like a small slaughter-house. I went away. They were marked on the back, and down the off side, with ochre, and an O put at the back of the tail, branded with tar. Beasley came to me on the Monday morning, and I afterwards went to the prisoner, Harvey's house. He told me, if any person stopped me, I was to say I found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Parrott's house is a butcher's shop; it was market-day at Smithfield. Harvey used to be a master-drover.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LACK. I am an officer. On the 28th of May I went to Harvey's house and found him in bed. I told him I came about two sheep which belonged to Mr. Sanders - He said he knew nothing about them. I took him to Hatton-garden, and then went to Parrott's shop-her shop looks more like a cat's-meat shop than a butcher's. I asked her if she knew a man of the name of Harvey-she said, No. I asked her if she knew that boy (I had French with me), she hesitated, and then said she had seen him before, she did not say when. I asked her what she had done with those sheep which the boy had brought there? she gave me no answer. I asked her if she should know the man that came with the boy; she said she should. After the meat was found, I asked her what became of the skins - She said the man who brought it there had taken them away. I had spoken to her of Harvey being the man, before I searched the house. A table stood before the cupboard door; I removed it, opened the door, and found the hind-quarters of two fat sheep. I went up into the bed-room, she remained below. I found a clothes-basket against the head of the bed, and two fore-quarters of fat mutton in it, covered over with a cloth; this was all I found there. I went back again the same day, as she told me I had not got all. I searched the same room, and found a fore-quarter of mutton hanging behind the door, covered over with a petticoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I believe there was some cat's-meat hanging up in the window. I do not know that she has a husband. I searched for sheep-skins, but could not find any.</p>

             re-examined. Lack brought the last fore-quarter to me-that, together with what had been previously found, made two whole sheep, except the offal. It appeared to be nearly fresh killed.</p>

               <p>Q. If you employ a drover to drive sheep, and he employs a boy, who pays the boy - A. He does. I have known Harvey fifteen or sixteen years - He is a drover. When a butcher buys sheep the skins belong to him.</p>
               <p>HARVEY'S Defence. The boy has spoken falsely. I was quite lame, and could not follow the sheep.</p>
               <p>PARROTT'S Defence. I have a lawful husband. I did not know but what he had bought them; he is a butcher. I have often paid the drovers for bringing the sheep home.</p>
               <p>Jury to FRENCH. Q. You say, when Beasley spoke to you the prisoner ran away, and you did not see him again till you got to Shoreditch turnpike - A. He had told me to go to the Commercial-road when he first spoke to me. I knew the road very well.</p>

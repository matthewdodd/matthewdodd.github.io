On the 19th of September, I was officer of the night at Coleman-street watchhouse; I was sent for about half past twelve at night, to Swan-alley, there Mr. Morgan said he had been robbed, he gave charge of Mrs. Thomas; there was a man in bed, I supposed it was her husband. I asked him if he would give me leave to search the room, he said, by all means; on looking under the bed, I found a sack, I laid the contents on the floor; I asked Mr. Morgan if any thing there was his: he said, I want my coat, waistcoat and breeches; I searched the room, I could not find any thing of the kind; I put the things in the sack under the bedstead, where I found them. I took the prisoner to the Compter. On Sunday morning, about nine o'clock, Morgan came to me; he said he understood there was some of his property in the room, what I had pulled out of the sack. About eleven o'clock on Sunday I found Thomas at home; I laid the contents of the sack on the floor again, and Mrs. Morgan said they were all her property, she would swear to it. On Monday morning we went to Mr. Smith's in Wood-street, we found part of the property, which Mr. Morgan said he would swear to be his property. The pawnbroker resigned the property up to me; I told him he must come up to the mansion house. I have got the whole of the property here that I took, and some of the burnt things.</p>

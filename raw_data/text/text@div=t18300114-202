               <p>CHARLES GREEN. I live in Union-street, Middlesex Hospital. I met the prisoners on the 11th of December, at ten minutes after five o'clock; I watched them - they attempted several shops; I saw them go to Mr. William Williams' - Wright took a pair of stays down, and gave them to Hawkes; he then came back, and took another pair; I took Wright, and the officer took Hawkes,</p>
               <p>JAMES AUSTICE. I am an errand-boy. On the 11th of December I was coming down Tottenham-court-road, and saw Wright take a pair of stays, and give them to Hawkes; he then took another pair, went over the way to a public-house, and was taken there.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILSON. I am the officer. I took Wright, then went, and took Hawkes with the two pairs of stays.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Wright's Defence. I was in the public-house, and the officer came and took me; a person said the other prisoner had got them - he let me go, and took him.</p>

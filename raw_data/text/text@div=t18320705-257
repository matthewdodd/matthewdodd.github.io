On the 20th of June, I had been up all night, but was sober; I was looking after a sister of mine, and met the prisoners about half-past three o'clock in the morning: I do not know in what street I first saw Harding - she asked me to have something to drink; I said it was too soon: there was another girl with her, but Wicks was not there then - they then asked me to have some coffee and bread and butter, which we did; I was coming away, but they followed, and took me into a private room - I staid there an hour and a half, but had nothing to do with any of them; Harding then went out, and brought in Wicks: Harding said she was her sister, and asked if I did not fancy her - I said No, I did not fancy either of them; I got up and went out - the prisoner's followed me to a public-house, where Wicks took my purse out of my pocket - Harding was close to her at the time; I had seventeen sovereigns in my purse: Wicks ran off with it - I followed, and Harding stopped me, and said she would come back, that she was sky-larking - I have never got the purse since; the officer took Harding; Wicks was taken three days after.</p>

               <p>Harding put in a written Defence, stating that she had left the prosecutor for some time, and after she returned he complained of being robbed, but being innocent, she did not attempt to escape.</p>

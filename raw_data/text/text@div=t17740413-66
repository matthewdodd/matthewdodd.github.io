On the 9th of March last the father of the boy came into the shop, and asked to look at some black stockings; the boy was with him: he produced a bill of an advertizing hosier, and wanted to know if they could not be sold as cheap as that; at last he said he could not deal at all, he would talk to his wife and send her about it; just as he was saying this the little boy went out of the shop; I thought it a suspicious circumstance; I followed him to see if he had got any thing; at the next door I overtook him, and found this large bundle of stockings tucked under his coat, and he was going away; I brought him home; he began crying and begged forgiveness; I charged the father as thinking him accessary with the son; I took them before a Justice, and they were carried before an Alderman; they said little in their own excuse there.</p>

               <p>I was going to Newgate-Market; I went up Snow-hill; I live just by; I went into the shop thinking to buy a pair or two of stockings; this gentleman shewed me a pair or two behind the counter; I never moved from the place; the child went in along with me; I asked him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130032"></xptr> price; he said four shillings, I said I believed I could buy them cheaper; my eyes were but indifferent; I said I would leave it till the afternoon; I was going to market to buy something for dinner, and would be back in an hour's time; the prosecutor went from behind the counter; there was nobody else in the shop, and left me for about a minute or two; he came back again and brought this poor unfortunate child of mine with a bundle he had under his arm; he was not gone a minute; he came in crying; I said what is the matter? the gentleman said he had got a bundle of stockings; the child is but eleven years old.</p>
               <p>The Boy's defence.</p>
               <p>I took them out of the shop; I did not think they were stockings; I thought they were not worth much; I thought them two or three bits of paper; I was making a lottery, and as I had no money to buy paper I thought to take them home to make up my lottery among my playfellows.</p>

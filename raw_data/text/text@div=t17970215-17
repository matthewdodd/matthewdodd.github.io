            : The prisoner was at our house on Wednesday the eight of this month, between two and three; she bought two articles; I did not attend her myself, but I received the money after the goods were put up; I understood that she had taken some lace, and I desired one of my young men, John Simmons, to follow her and see where she went; I presently received a message from him to come to Mr. Knapp's the pastry-cook in Fleet-street; I went there, and sent for Mr. March the Ward beadle, to search her; I there saw a card of black lace that had been taken from her; I saw the beadle search her, and take from her another card of black lace, which I know to be our own, I know it by my own hand-writing; I also saw him take from her another card, containing five sundry remnants, which are specified in the indictment, they were white thread edgings; and, in shaking her cloaths, a piece of narrow thread lace likewise sell from her, which appeared to have been held in the hand, by the form in which I took it up; it was done up in half-yard lengths; I then took her to the Compter; they had all my own marks, every one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing at the time? - A. Yes; she said, Pray let me go now, you have got your property; she begged again, and importuned me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who she was? - A. No; she would not say who she was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Your's is a very considerable haberdasher's-shop, as we all know, in Fleet-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe, as we go along, we see the names of Wells, Fisher, and Headeach? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever was? - A. Yes; but Mr. Fisher has been from the house four or five years; and Mr. Headeach thirteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Their names are still upon the shop-bills? - A. Mr. Headeach's, not Mr. Fisher's.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons are there in your shop? - A. I must begin to count them.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought so; nine or ten, perhaps? - A. I believe there may.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not all here? - A. Only the young woman that attended her, and the young man that I sent out.</p>
               <p>A. The rest are at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated something that she said; had you said any thing to her first? - A. I had accused her of stealing the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell her it would be better for her if she told you what became of the lace? -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That cannot affect the evidence that he has given, for she only said, now you have got your property back. - You had a number of people in your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN SIMMONS sworn. - I am articled to the house of Wells and Company; at the request of Mr. Gilchrist I followed the prisoner down the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150036"></xptr>street upon the other side of the way, and observed her till the moment she went into Mr. Knapp's, the pastry-cook's-shop; I did not see her go in at the door; supposing she might have gone into the shop, I went opposite the shop, and perceived the same coloured ribbons she had on in the shop; I immediately crossed over the way, and went up to Mr. Knapp's door, and at the moment I got to the door, I saw her take a card of lace from the bottom of her gown, it was pinned up; I immediately went into the shop, and put my hand upon the piece of lace, which was covered up with a handkerchief, and begged to look at it; the handkerchief was before lying upon the counter, and she put it into the handkerchief and turned the ends over it; I looked at the card, and saw it had our private mark; I sent immediately for Mr. Gilchrist, and Mr. March; Mr. March searched her, and he took another card of black lace out of the same place where she took this out; I saw him take it out; I likewise saw him take out the card of remnants, Mr. Gilchrist mentioned, out of her pocket, the right-hand side; I know nothing of the lengths of the lace, any more than seeing them upon the counter; I did not see him take them from her, and I went with Mr. Gilchrist with her to the Compter; I understood her to say, take your property and set me at liberty; I did not hear her say who she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the shop at the time the prisoner was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take any thing? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. At this time a number of persons were serving in this shop? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am shop-woman to Wells and Company; the prisoner came into the shop on the 8th of this month, to look at some black lace, which I shewed her; she wanted to match some, she brought a small piece with her, she looked at some, but we did not agree about the price; she wished to look at some white thread lace, I shewed her some, which was a box of remnants; she bought one at three shillings, there were two yards and a quarter of it; afterwards she wished to look at some other of different prices, from three shillings to six shillings; she took two pieces of white lace into her muff, I saw her draw them and I took them from her; she asked for some blue pealing satin; I was so much agitated at taking the lace from her that I called to one of the young girls behind the counter, and she called to one of the shop-men to serve her, his name is Grieve, he is not here; he cut off a yard of pealing satin.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were serving her, were those cards of black lace open so that she could take them? - A. Yes; I opened the box myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the remnants in the same box? - A. No; they were all in separate boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you opened the other boxes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the remnants since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the same box? - A. Yes; I saw the card of lace at the time I was serving her that had the remnants upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw this card of lace in the box? - A. There was a box of white lace, a box of black lace, and a box of remnants.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons might be near you at the time? - A. There might be three, or there might be four; one person might be within two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that person here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A lady or gentleman? - A. A gentleman.</p>

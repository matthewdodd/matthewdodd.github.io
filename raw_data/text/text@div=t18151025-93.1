I became acquainted with the prisoner at the bar, about two years ago; he first paid his address to me by letter. I married him on the 7th of May last, at St. George's Hanover square; he lived with me ten weeks, when he was apprehended for another crime. He had about four hundred pounds with me; the savings of my wages during the whole of my life, and I am now so reduced as to be obliged to go to service. He represented himself as a widower, and as having considerable property. He told me he had lost his wife some years by hard drinking.</p>

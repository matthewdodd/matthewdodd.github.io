                  </hi>. I am superintending president of the London district post-office. The prisoner has been about three years employed as an auxiliary letter-carrier under the Stratford post-office, and was so in Sept. last—he applied to me, and in consequence of his father's services he was appointed—he was paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I think his duty commenced about seven in the morning, and he finished about twelve or half-past at noon—on 18th Sept. I received by post a letter, containing some pieces of paper, amongst them were the two letters to Miss Moffatt and Miss Kydd—this is the cover—it was posted in East Smithfield—there is a great deal of pencil writing upon the papers—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "I broke the key, <hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi>; I thought it was gold when I opened the letter; I have been in the office some years, and was honest a long time, but I shall not be so <hi rend="italic">no</hi> more for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. shillings a week.

               <p>that auxiliaries want more money. I am short of money this week; I roust have some too, Sir. This is one of my complaints; fire tells no tales"—on 28th Nov. I received another letter by the post, enclosing the fragments of five envelopes of post letters—the addresses were cut out—this was amongst them (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "If you remember I sent you a polite note some time ago about a latter direçted 'Walthamitow,' which was mis-sent to me, <hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi>, and now I have sent two, Mr. Smith.

Signed "Calcraft"—I did not know what a <hi rend="italic">coutre</hi> was till I received this, and then I was informed it meant a sovereign—among the papers in the last enclosure there was a portion of an official paper used by the charge-takers at the Stratford office—I knew the figures on it to be the charge-takers' of the office to which the prisoner was attached, and that directed my attention to him, and I had him taken into custody—the envelope of the mis-sent letter to Stratford bears the inland office stamp of I think, 9th Sept.—it bears a second stamp of the 18th, ten o'clock, forenoon,</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer attached to the post-office. On 6th Sept. I took the prisoner into custody—I searched him, and found a door<lb></lb>key on him—I asked him several times where he lived, and he said he would not tell me—I went to 20, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, to the back room, first floor, and with the key which I had found on the prisoner I opened the door—there was nobody in the room—I searched, and found some letters and papers, two buttons, and a seal, which I produce—I have applied the button to the seal of the letter addressed to Mrs. Girt, and it corresponds—I afterwards told the prisoner that I had been to 20, Lambeth-street, to the first floor back room—he said that was his lodging—I took him to Bow-street station, and told him I charged him with stealing a letter containing a key, and he would be charged with stealing other letters—he said he knew nothing about the letter containing the key, or the other letters, but the letter I found at his house he could not deny—I showed him the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The whole is a vile, abominable conspiracy, and the parties implicated in it have done it from feelings of envy and malice; I was appointed between two and three years ago to assist a letter-carrier named Keasley, on the East Ham Branch; on 1st. Sept. I went to the office, as usual, and found a small parcel; I opened it; it contained three pieces of paper, which they said belonged to a Miss Coutts; one said something about getting 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, and the other said something about "I will not deliver this letter;" I placed it in my pocket, and at once concluded it was a mean retaliation from some one at the office owing me a spite; after finishing my delivery, I went to the Green Man public-house, to get my breakfast, and waited there till the next delivery of letters was brought to me there; after finishing them, I went home; I placed the papers under the bed, intending to take them with me next morning, to find out who sent it, but next day I was taken into custody; I did not tell the officer where I lived, because the street was not very respectable: they took me in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Stratford Post<lb></lb>office, and the officers had some communication with the letter-carriers, and, after leaving, one of the officers asked if I was not a Chartist; I said I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184901290022"></xptr>
               <p>not; he asked if I had not been to the meeting at Kennington-common; I said I had, but only out of curiosity; I was taken to the Post-office, and Mr. Smith charged me with sending him two anonymous letters with covers, and parts of other letters; I told him I knew nothing of them; some gentlemen in the office asked if I did not live in Lambeth-street; in about three quarters of an hour the officer came into the office, and showed Mr. Smith a note which he said he had found in my place; and he said the two batches of sealing-wax corresponded with the letter Mr. Smith had received; I at once perceived that the whole was a conspiracy; my brother and a witness named Harris swore to my handwriting before the Magistrate; I never wrote to my brother in my life, and he has never seen me write since I left school, eleven years ago, and Harris never saw me write; these letters have been written through spite; Craddock and the other auxiliaries have frequently wanted me to change walks with them, and I would not, and they charged me with stealing a letter that was mis-sent; but it was impossible for me to have got it, for I was always last there of a morning, and never opened the bags, and the first man opens the bags and sorts the letters, and if a letter is mis-sent, he sends it away; it is not the first time I have been robbed of my letters; not long ago a man stole a money-letter belonging to my walk, and was found coming out of the office with it in his possession, and if he had not been taken I should have been charged with it.</p>

               <p>Prisoners' Defence. I found the purse on Lady-day as I was going to my mother's; there was 8l. 7s. in it -I gave my mother 7l. 2s. and kept 25s., and bought some new things; on the 17th of April my master said I had torn a shirt - I asked if he could prove his words; he asked if I could prove how I came by my new clothes -I told him I found that money; my mother asked if he had lost any thing - he said No, that he had suspicion of my being dishonest; I left the place as mistress was always throwing this in my face - I asked master to search my box, he would not, and said he would give me a character, - on Wednesday he had me apprehended; I can prove he said he did not know whether he had lost any money or not - the people would come forward if they knew when I was to be tried; a letter was sent abroad to a gentleman who had lost some money, and master said if he could not hurt me for that, he would for damage I had done, that he had not lost money but would swear he had for spite - he takes in tramps of all sorts to lodge there, and his keys are always about.</p>

In the course of the day the other man came in several times, and said, Mr. Smith, you are wanted; after he had been there some time, the prisoner said, go to my shop, and get some chops; they had some chops dressed, and about two o'clock they went away; the prisoner came in again about four o'clock without his hat, when I was very busy, he called me into the parlour, seemingly in a great hurry, and said, can you lend me three or four pounds for five minutes, my friend Meyrick is gone out, and my mistress is not at home; I said, I am very sorry Mr. Smith I cannot oblige you, I have nothing less than a five pound note; he took the five pound note out of my hand, and said, that will do, I will bring it you back in less than five minutes; I saw no more of him till I saw him at Hatton-garden.</p>

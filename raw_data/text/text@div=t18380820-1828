                  </hi>, senior. I am a lieutenant in the Militia, on half-pay, and live in Norland-place, near Nottinghill, Kensington. On Saturday, the 21st of July, I went out to take a walk with two of my children, a little girl rather more than nine, and a boy rather more than ten-as I returned, I came down a lane at the back of Lord Holland's park—on coming to a turning leading into Camden-road, I saw a man sitting on a basket—he could look down the lane, and see into the Camden-road—after passing him, I got to a bend in the lane, some distance further up—I was conversing with the little girl on my right, and on raising my head, I first saw the prisoner close to me, standing with his face to me-his hands were apparently down—I did not notice any thing in his hand at the moment—the moment he discovered that I saw him, he placed himself before me, and said, "Your money, sir"—he had two pistols, one in each hand—I was fearful, if he fired, he might kill the children, and said, "Money! no, indeed!"—I pushed the children away on one side, and sprang forward and tried to disarm him-and he fired the pistol in his left hand-as I sprang at him I felt the ball strike me a tremendous blow, and felt I was wounded before I reached his right hand, and grasped the other pistol—I was wounded in the upper part of the right thigh—I still went towards him, and succeeded in getting the other pistol from his right hand—I presented it at his head, and then he tore from me—we had rather a sharp struggle, and on my putting the pistol to his head, he ran away directly towards where the man was sitting—I called out, "Stop him"—the man took up his basket, and ran away in the same direction as the prisoner did—I saw the prisoner in custody in about ten minutes after, and identified him immediately—I am certain it was him—I attempted to discharge the pistol I took from him as he was running off, but it missed fire—I after<lb></lb>wards looked at the part of my dress where the ball struck, and found my trowsers were cut—I had sovereigns in one pocket of my purse, and silver in the other—my pocket was cut at the part where the ball was received, and the money protruded—my purse was cut, and a bruise caused by the blow, a very severe one—I was present when the prisoner was searched, and saw taken from him some bullets, two charges of powder, and some powder in a phial, some pawnbroker's duplicates, and a bludgeon from his right-hand pocket—he was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

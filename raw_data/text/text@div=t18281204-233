               <p>JOHN HOLLAND. On the 27th of November, I met with eight or ten friends - we dined together; I took rather too much wine; I had to go home, about a mile from town, and between ten and eleven o'clock, I was so unwell that I was glad to sit down, in <placeName id="t18281204-233-crimeloc1231">Penton-street</placeName>

            . On the 27th of November, between eleven and half-past eleven o'clock, I apprehended the prisoner, in St. John's-street-road; she threw down this purse in the watch-house, and the watch-house-keeper took this watch from her bosom, in my presence; I heard a sovereign slip from her - and on the road to the watch-house a sovereign fell from her, which my fellow-watchman took up; a dirty white pocket-handkerchief was found on her, with a bad shilling in the corner of it.</p>

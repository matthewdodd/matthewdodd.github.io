I went after Dennis—we traced him to a place, and went into the house, and as soon as we got to the bottom of the stairs, we saw Dennis making his exit from another room—I called him by name, and he answered me—I told him we were officers, and we must speak with him—we told him we came to take him for being concerned with a person named Beard, now awaiting his trial at the Central Criminal Court, for stealing elephants' tusks—I said, "You need not answer any questions that I put to you, unless you think well: Do you know Beard?"—he hesitated a while, and said that he did not; but after a while he said that he did—I said, "You went with him to hire a cart of a person named Coster"—he said, "I know nothing about the cart; I know nothing about the transaction"—he after<lb></lb>wards said, Well, I did hire a cart, and Beard went with me"—when we got to the station, he said, "I have been <hi rend="italic">sold</hi>, and I will <hi rend="italic">split</hi> on the whole b—lot"—he said, before he got to the station, "A man named Jones hired me to hire the cart"—I saw the cart, it had on it, "William Mundy, Bethnal Green Road"—I have looked at the other teeth that I had when Pickard was in custody, and these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), have the same marks—Pickard was tried on 2nd Feb.—he had been in custody some time before that.</p>

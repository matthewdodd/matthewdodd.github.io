She bid me take the things if they were mine, I desir'd they would let them be there, and keep the prisoner till I came back, but when I came back they had let her go, because I had not charg'd a constable with her. I then went back to Mr. Warring's, and when I came there he said where is the silver spoons, I said, Lord have mercy upon me, I don't know; then I run after her again, and when I got to the distiller's she was brought back, and there she was search'd, and we found the spoons in her bosom; the man that took them out said what mark has your spoons got, he said if they are mine they are mark'd P.

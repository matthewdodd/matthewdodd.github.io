On Monday the 20th of March, I went to bed about twenty minutes after nine, by my watch, and hung it up by my bed-side; my brother lay along with me. He got up before me, and said, William, where did you hang your watch last night? I looked and missed it. I never fasten my door. I found the prisoner, who lodged in the room under mine, did not lie in the house that night: he had a key to let himself in and out of the house. I took him up on suspicion.

I advised him, as he was in liquor, not to go to work, but go home and lie down. He left the five guineas and watch with me. About four in the afternoon he called on me again; he did not appear to be sober then. He desired me to keep the watch a little time, saying, he was afraid the fellow he bought it of had stole it; for he gave but a guinea for it. The next morning, between eleven and twelve, I heard he was taken up for stealing a watch. Then I went to Sir

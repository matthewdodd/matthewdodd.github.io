             (police-sergeant, G 145). On the 29th of April, about seven o'clock, I was in a court in the Curtain-road with Johnson; we were watching a house which we suspected of being a receptacle for stolen goods - the two prisoners came to the house, Coxhead knocked and went in with a bundle, which I supposed to be a coat as I saw part of it - soon afterwards they came out and Ross had a basket, which they had not when they went in- we took them, and found this coat in the basket.</p>

             (police-constable, G 175). I was watching the house, but did not see the prisoners go in - when they came out I followed them, and took Coxhead who had the basket then - I asked what he had got, he said a coat of his father's which he was going to pawn - I took them; and on the way to the station I asked Coxhead who his father was, and where he lived; he then said it was not his father's, but a man gave it him to pawn, and said he would give him a penny.</p>

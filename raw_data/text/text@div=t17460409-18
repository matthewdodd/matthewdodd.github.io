               <p>Swannick. I went over-night, and Mrs. O Marsh came to the Door, and told me they had got 9 d. upon the Apron in pawn.</p>
               <p>Court. Then they came to your Master's in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Swannick. Yes. The first Time they came I gave them an Apron.</p>
               <p>Court. You gave the two Boys an Apron?</p>

               <p>Q. You gave them that Apron; they carried it away; What then?</p>
               <p>Swannick. I went the Night following, and they said they had 9 d. upon the Apron, in pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say more how you came to give them this Apron?</p>
               <p>Swannick. The Boy told me his Mother was in want: When I went first into the Place, that Woman ask'd me if I could get any Thing of my Master to make her amends for lying in their House, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Then old O Marsh, the Man, knew nothing of that?</p>
               <p>Swannick. No, my Lord: Two Days following the two Boys came again, and I gave them a Towel and two Clouts; then they came about Twelve o'Clock the next Day and I got a Guinea of my Master's Money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by that?</p>

My eldest Son said, that Jack had got something in his Apron; they were the Things he had from Mr. Shaffeild: I sent for Mrs. Sheffeild; but she said my eldest Boy was the Thief. They serv'd a Warrant upon us for receiving them. As to the Things I never saw them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Mrs. Eliza Brook» a widow, who has a farm at Friern Barnett. I saw her lambs safe about ten o'clock in the morning, on Friday, the 13th of December, and on Saturday afternoon, the 14th, I sent a boy to count them, and he told me they were all right—on Sunday morning, I went to give them some hay, and I missed one lamb—I searched to see if I could find it, as I thought it was hung in the bushes, but could not—I then searched for footsteps, but could not find any till I came to a gap in the hedge, and there I saw the marks of the feet of the lamb over the gap—I then traced it across three or four fields, and up to the prisoner's door—there are no other inmates in his house but his wife and family—his eldest son is seven or eight years old—I went to the policeman—we went to the house and found the lamb, the skin,</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Thomas Searles, a boot aod shoemaker in Whitechapel. At half-past nine o'clock at night, on the 23rd of September, the prisoner came to our shop with a little boy abort eleven years old—I told the lad to serve her—he put one pair on the pri<lb></lb>soner's boy's feet—they were too large—during that time my boy turned his head, and saw a pair of boots hanging on the prisoner's arm—he said, "What are this pair?"—she said, "They are his father's, bought at an<lb></lb>other shop"—the boy said, "What did you give for them?"—she made no answer—he took hold of the other boot, that was under her cloak, and seeing our private mark, he called out, "They are T. C. H."—I asked what it was—the prisoner rose from her seat, and was about going toward the door—I said, "What is it?"—the boy said, "She has got these on her arm"—I endeavoured to stop her—she would not be stopped—she pressed by me, saying, "They are his father's, bought at another shop"—she went out of the shop, leaving the boots in my hand—I went after her, and asked her to come back—she refused—I insisted on her coming back—she then returned—I called in an officer, and gave her in charge—these boots are my master's.</p>

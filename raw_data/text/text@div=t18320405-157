On the 24th of February, the prisoner came to their warehouse; I served him in the morning with two pieces of thread web, and in the afternoon, with a gross of cannadine laces - I did not serve him with any thread or silk; in leaving the warehouse he had to ascend some stairs - I saw him stoop and open his bag: I then followed him up - I heard something fall; I still followed him, and when I saw him again, he was taking a parcel off a pile of thread on the stairs, and putting it into his bag; I asked him what he was going to do with it - he said he had picked it up on the stairs - I told him to come down, and called one of our young men; in the mean time he opened his bag, pulled out half a dozen of thread, and said he had picked it up - that was not the half-dozen which he had when I spoke to him; he must have had them before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you given the same account as you did before the Magistrate? A.

            . I had marked this parcel of thread, and had been serving some of this silk before he came - he was swinging his bag over his arm when he came in, and it appeared to be empty; this silk was found in his pocket at the watch-house - he said he had bought it of a Jew in Petticoat-lane, but he could not tell his name; this piece of web was found in his bag - I had not sold it to him; I know it by my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written,) My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. - On the 24th of February, I went to the prosecutor's ware-house, and bought a few articles, which I took with me in my bag; as I was coming out of the warehouse, I took up the half-dozen of thread, which I am now charged with stealing, as is customary with every person that goes into a wholesale warehouse to buy goods, if they see an article they think will suit them; knowing the witness Matthews was behind me, I was in the act of turning round to ask him the price - to my great surprise, he then charged me with the intention of stealing it, which, I most solemnly declare, I had not the slightest intention of doing; the witness Matthews also swears I had the half-dozen threads in my bag, which is a direct falsehood, as the bag was never off my arm. and as he was walking behind me all the way, it was impossible I could have put it in without his knowledge.</p>

            . I am a wine-merchant. On the 23d of June, the prisoner came into my house with some tools and melted lead at his back; he put them down. There is a bottle-rack at the cellar-door. I had an idea that the prisoner robbed his master. The bottles rattled; I said, do not break the bottles. He came away, and came to the bar, and had a glass of liquor, and said, I do not pay you new. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to the shop, having a glass of liquor, and then saying, I will leave a tool; instead of that, he left solder; they were two bars joined together. About a month before, this man had done the same. This is the solder. I am sure when he left the solder, there was no solder there until he left it.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Glossip. On the morning the prisoner left the article, I was out of the way. As soon as I came in, Mr. Glossip asked me to go to the bottle-rack, and see what he had left; I with some difficulty, found it behind the bottle-rack. I took it over to Mr. Priest, and weighed it; it weighed sixteen pounds. This is the solder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lucas. It is like Mr. Preist's solder.</p>

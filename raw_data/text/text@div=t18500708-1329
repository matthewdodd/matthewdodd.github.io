On Sunday, 9th June, I left my house, with my wife, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—my servant had gone out about two hours before—I went out at the private door, and shut it after me—the shop door was fast—I left no one in the house—I left in a cash-box, in my iron chest, four 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and seven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—the chest was locked, and the key of it was locked up in a drawer up-stairs—that drawer was broken open, and the chest had been unlocked with the key of it—the drawer had been opened with a chisel; there were the marks of it—I got home about half-past nine—I missed all the property I have men<lb></lb>tioned—my wife missed some spoons and some coral beads—I lost a watch, some rings, a pearl brooch, a great-coat, and other things—the value of the whole was perhaps 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these are the beads (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was no clasp to them; they were just in the state they are now.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had your watch again?</p>
               <p>Jones. The keeper of the Gatehouse has the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find out the Prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Jones. I took her in a moment's time. I sent down for a quartern of brandy, and she run down stairs with my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop is it?</p>
               <p>Jones. It is a chandler's shop , and they sell liquors.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you into her company?</p>
               <p>Jones. I was going by, and she was standing at the door, and asked me to give her a dram; I went up stairs with her, and in five minutes time my watch was gone; she took it out of my Fob. The Prisoner offered the watch to the woman of the house, and the woman told her she had robbed the young man of the watch [meaning the Prosecutor]; the Prisoner came up stairs again, and the watch were sent for, and she was carried to the Gatehouse; and after she was committed, the constable and beadle said they believed it was in her stocking, for they thought they saw something stick out: The constable said to her, be so good as to deliver the watch, and she said she would not; afterwards she told the constable he should have the watch, if he would let her have it again, and the keeper of the Gatehouse was forced to take the watch from her, for she would not give it to him.</p>
               <p>The keeper of the Gatehouse's man produced the watch, which was sworn to by the Prosecutor.</p>

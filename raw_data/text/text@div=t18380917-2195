                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Hounslow with my mother, who takes in washing. I was at Brentford fair on the 12th of September, about eleven o'clock in the evening—I was going into the parlour of the Pigeons public-house—some persons hustled me very much, and some one took my shawl, and went away with it—I do not know who took it—the crowd was so great I could not turn round—I do not know the prisoner—I have not found my shawl.</p>

               <p>Q. That is where you and your husband live? - A. Yes, my husband is agent to their manufactory: On the 23d of June, some time in the forenoon, the prisoner came with two or three yards of carpet under his arm, and asked me whether that was our pattern; I told him no, it was not; he said he came from Mr. Hall, in Moorfields, he produced the order out of his pocket; I have got the order in my hand.</p>

               <p>"Please to let the bearer have two pieces of body to match, or as near as possible, for Hall and Co. Moorfields." - I gave him the order; I knew Mr. Godwin was in the neighbourhood, and I sent him to him; he went out, but never went to him; he came back, and told me he was not there; I went up into the upper warehouse and picked out the two pieces of carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did they contain? - A. One was twenty-eight yards and a half, and the other was twenty-four; he asked me to be particular to find two pieces of this colour, for the ladies were waiting to choose them.</p>
               <p>Q. And you, upon the delivery of this order, delivered to him the two pieces of carpet? - A. I did.</p>

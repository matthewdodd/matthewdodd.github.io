             sworn. - I live in Church-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290017"></xptr>Shoreditch: On Friday, the 10th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, a man brought a chair to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man at the bar? - A. Yes, I think he looks like the man; he was dressed different.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be the man? - A. Yes; I keep a broker's shop, he brought a chair, and asked my man whether he would buy it of him; my man called me out, and he offered the chair to me; I told him I did not buy chairs in the shop without I knew the people; he told me I need not fear buying it, it was his own, his father had left him two chairs a year and a half ago, he would wish to keep one, and the other he had no use for, he wished to sell that; I asked him where he lived; he said he lived at No. 6, Brick-lane; I told him one of my men should go to Brick-lane, and if he lived there I would buy it of him; he asked five shillings for the chair, and said the man might go with him; and going out of the door, he said, it was not his chair, it was his brother's, and he lived in Drury-lane, his brother lived in Brick-lane; I said I would have nothing to do with it; I told him it would be doing him justice to send for an officer; I sent for an officer, and Vickery came and took charge of him.</p>
               <p>- VICKERY sworn. - I am an officer of Worship-street; I was coming past at the time they called me in; I asked him where he lived, and he told me, in Hartshorn-court, Golden-lane; I asked him where he got this chair from, and he told me that his father left him two chairs, and his father formerly lived in Drury-lane; I then took him to the Office, and found he was a soldier in the East-London Militia; the next day the chair was seen by the prosecutor, and he identified it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the day this affair happened, I was on duty on the morning; I went home to dinner, and coming along Brick-lane I met a man with a chair on his head; he asked me to buy the chair; he said he had been moving, and he had half-a-crown given him, and that chair being an odd one, he said I should have it for three shillings; I bid him half-a-crown and a glass of gin; he took it; I offered it for sale to get my money back; I asked her five shillings for it, I told her I bought it of a person in Brick-lane, I told her my father was dead, and my brother had a chair like it, and I lived in Hartshorn-court.</p>
               <p>(The chair produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

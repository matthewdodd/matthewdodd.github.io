               <p>WILLIAM DAVIS. I am beadle of St. Giles's. On Sunday the 8th of May last, I was attending St. Giles's church; just as the people were coming out of the church there was a great crowd; some person called out there is a thief; I saw the prosecutor with the prisoner in his hand; I went up to them; I took a silk handkerchief out of the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming by the church, I saw the handkerchief lay on the ground; I picked it up; I never offered to move from the spot. The gentleman turned round and said it was his; he has false sworn to say I took it out of his pocket. I did not.</p>

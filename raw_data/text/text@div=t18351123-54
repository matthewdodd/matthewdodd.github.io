On the 14th of November, I was at my brother's shop—he is a watch-maker—between five and half-past five o'clock I heard a noise in the shop—It was dark, and the gas was lighted—I am sure it was after five o'clock—I heard the glass break in the outer window of the shop—I ran out into street, and saw the prisoner who had been stopped by two men, returning to the shop—he was brought back to the shop—I called a policeman, and then waited outside to keep the crowd from the shop—I found a silver watch gone, which had been hanging in the window before—It had been between the outer and inner window of the shop, just opposite the pane of glass which was broken, within an inch of the again—I had seen it that morning.</p>

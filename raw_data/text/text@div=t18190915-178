            . I was employed to take care of some cows at Tottenham, near Steel's house. On the 31st of August, about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoners Crawley and Amos, a third person was looking out on the watch about a field off. They asked me if the people were gone out? I said No (though they were out), as I thought they were after no good. They said, if I told such a lie as that they would beat me. They then went and looked in my tent, there was nothing there but an old coat - Crawley said that was not worth taking. They knocked my tent down, then went towards the house, and I lost sight of them. I afterwards saw them in custody.</p>

            . I am beadle of Tottenham. Amos and Clark were given into my custody. I took them before the magistrate. Next morning Crawley was taken and delivered to me. As I took him to the House of Correction, I told him Amos had a waistcoat on, which he said he had from him in exchange for a black one. Crawley said,</p>
               <p>"He is a fool for putting on that waistcoat, for he was sure to be known. Amos said he would put a pair of sleeves in it, and then nobody will know it - but since they have gone so far as that against me, have you examined Clark's trowsers?" I said I had not. He said,</p>
               <p>"He has now got on part of the stolen property, and the coats and breeches are pawned at Islington." I found them at a pawnbroker's at Islington. I went and found the trowsers on Clark.</p>

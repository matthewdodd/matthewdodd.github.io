             . On the 9th of May, about one o'clock , the Prisoner came into my master's shop to buy a silver stock-buckle; I shewed him some plain ones, and then he wanted a wrought one; I shewed him some, and asked him 9 s. 6 d. he would not give it, and was going away; I charged him with it, and said there is one of the buckler missing .</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know there was one missing ?</p>
               <p>Newman. I told them as I shewed them him, and I told eighteen of them, and there were but seventeen when I charged him with it: he denied it, and I said I would search him, and I took him into the back room and searched him; I felt in all his pockets , and could not find it .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes, I felt round his breeches , and felt it between the lining and the outside covering, and my master ripped it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the buckle.</p>
               <p>Newman. This is the buckle I found upon him.</p>

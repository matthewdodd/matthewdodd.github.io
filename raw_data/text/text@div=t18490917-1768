On Saturday night, 8th Sept., I was at the Green Man, Whetstone, from ten to half-past, with George King and Francis Sivill—the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, came in with a fiddle—the fiddler asked him for it—he gave it him, and then he asked for the fiddle-bag—the pri<lb></lb>soner said he gave it him outside—he denied it, and the prisoner said some one in the room must have got it, as he had lost it in the room—I said I was certain none of us had got such a paltry thing, for it was of no use to us—he said he was certain it was lost in the room, and some of the company must bave got it—he was making-a deal of noise—I asked the landlord to draw us a pint of beer—he said he should not draw any more while that noisy man was in the house—I said it was of no use to stop there, and went out of doors with my friends—when I had got about ten yards from the doors, I felt a blow on my right side—I turned round, and the prisoner was running away, but was close to me—when he had gone another yard or two, I put my hand to my side, and felt blood; my hand was covered with blood—we went to the Blue Anchor, and the landlord washed my side with brandy, and bound it up—I went with a policeman to a house where the prisoner's partner said he dwelt, and found the prisoner there, lying by the side of the gate—I gave him in charge—nothing had passed between us but what I have stated—I did not strike him at all. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> 1 did not strike you; you followed me out, knocked me down,</p>

I found Lamb in bed, with a simple incised wound on his right side, such as might have been made with this knife—it was half an inch deep, and an inch or a little less in length—the rib prevented it going deeper, or it might have injured the lungs and proved fatal—it injured the rib.</p>

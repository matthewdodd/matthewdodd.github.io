            . I am a pawn-broker, and live in Holborn. I stopt this watch about two months ago; I cannot tell the day of the month exactly, it was about nine o'clock at night; the prisoner offered to pawn it; he wanted a guinea and a half upon it. I asked him if it was gold or metal; he said metal. I tried it, and found it was gold. I asked him where he bought it; he said he did not buy it, but won it at a raffle. I told him I should stop the watch till I found the person he won it of; he said he would bring the person in an hour and a half. He did not come again. The next day I advertised it. The prisoner said his name was Brown, and that he lived in a court, in Castle street. I went and enquired for a person of that name, on describing his person at an alehouse, they said they was sure it was

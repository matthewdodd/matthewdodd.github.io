            . I am a watchman. Between twelve and one o'clock I saw the prisoner go into Portugal-street, at a quick pace, with something under his arm; I followed, and asked what it was; he said it was his coach-glass - I asked his number, which he mentioned, but I do not recollect it; he said he was going to Mount pleasant, and that his coach was broken down; I asked why he saved only one; he said this was a plate-glass, and the other was a common one; he wished me to go to Mount-pleasant with him, but I took him to the watch-house - he was quite sober.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

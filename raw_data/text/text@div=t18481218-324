                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 84). I was with two other officers on 18th Oct., and saw the prisoners at Charlton fair—I watched them twenty minutes or half an hour, and saw them go behind several ladies—Brown was pushed in between the other two, and attempted to pick their pockets—Gower was by Brown's side, and Cole behind him, so as to cover him—I saw them go to Mrs. Crawford in the same manner—Brown lifted up her dress with his left hand, and I saw him put his right into his own pocket with the purse in it—my brother-officer took him, and the purse was identified by the lady.</p>

I was on duty at Charlton fair. I saw the three prisoners together; I watched them nearly half an hour. J saw all three go to the farthest end of the field, talking together; they then returned into the fair, and stood in front of a show. I saw the prisoner Cole take the boy Brown, and place him between the prisoner Gower and himself, by the side of a lady. I saw him repeat the same thing, and afterwards stand by the side of the last witness (Mrs. Crawford). Gower stood a little in front of her, and Cole put the boy Brown between Gower and himself. I saw the boy put his hand into the pocket of the last witness, and take out a purse; he then showed it to the prisoner Cole, who turned his head, and seeing me look at him he gave the boy a nudge, and the boy put the purse into his pocket. I then caught hold of the two arms of the boy, and took the pri<lb></lb>soner Cole, when White, the constable, came to my assistance. I searched the boy, and found on him the purse produced, which contained five sixpenny-pieces.' ")</p>

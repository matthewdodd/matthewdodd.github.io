            . I am in Mr. Higgins' service. On Thursday, the 26th of June, the prisoner was sent to make a list from the book, of the money he had to collect, and from that list he was to receive the account; he left the warehouse on Friday morning before I got there; he was expected home as usual about half-past seven o'clock, but did not come, and next morning I received this letter, which is in his hand-writing; the very moment Mr. Higgins, Jun. came to the warehouse I gave him the letter - Todd and Ludgate are customers of ours.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you any reason to doubt my integrity while in the empoy? A. I had better not answer the question, as I am on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you to answer it? A. Then I had reason.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110079"></xptr>(Letter Read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. HIGGINS, 28th of June.</p>
               <p>Sir - I have only time to say I have been robbed, and request you to ascertain instantly the banker's of Townsend and Co., and stop payment of their cheque for 12l. 12s.; also the number of a 10l. and 5l. note, paid me by Todd's, of Moorfields. You will hear from me again.</p>

            . I am a draper, and live in Carthusian-street. On the 27th of June the prisoner called for 2l. 18s. on Mr. Higgins' account - I paid it to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I freely admit having fallen into errors of losing property, but I do declare solemnly, as to secreting money for my own benefit, I have not done. On the day in question I had the east end of the town to collect from - two persons are generally sent there, and in order to make the best of my time, I hurried myself; it was very hot - I went without anything till four o'clock; I had then got all my accounts but two, and felt myself so extremely exhausted, I sat down, and suffered myself to be betrayed by drinking an extra pint of ale, which got the better of my nerves - I did not know what I was doing, nor do I at the present moment, if it is the last word I have to utter, know where I lost the property. I have been a tradesman in London sixteen years, and never had my character called in question: and am sorry I should fall into this error from my own weakness, but Mr. Higgins. Jun. knew if I drank too much what was the effect. I have a wife and five children, who I have brought up respectably.</p>
               <p>MR. HIGGINS. He was apprehended at Dover - he had no business there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My reason for leaving London was, my feelings were so overcome; I did not know what I was doing.</p>

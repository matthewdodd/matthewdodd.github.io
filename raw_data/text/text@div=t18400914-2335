                  </hi>. I am second kitchen-maid in the establishment of the Hon. Henry Cecil Lowther—he lives in Bruton-street. On September the 3rd, I went to the housekeeper's room about three mi<lb></lb>nutes before eight o'clock, to lay the cloth for breakfast, the door was partly closed—I rapped at the door, and received no answer—I went into the room, and there I saw a sweep standing—I did not know of any busi<lb></lb>ness that any sweep had there—the linen-press is kept in the housekeeper's room, close by where the sweep was standing—he had a bag with him—the mouth of it was in his hand, and the remainder of it on the floor—there was a sweep's brush on an arm-chair in the room—the prisoner is the man I saw there—I have not the least doubt about it—I asked how he came there—he said, "I have come to sweep a chimney "—I said, "What chimney?"—he said, "The housekeeper's room chimney"—I had not let him in, and do not know how he came there—I asked where he came from—he said, "From Wingall's"—he did not say Mrs. Wingall, (she is the person employed by Col. Lowther as a sweep,)—he said he had been told yesterday' to come—I told him I had heard nothing of it, and he could not sweep the chimney then, as I was going to bring in breakfast—he said, "Very well," and, as he turned his bag on one side, I perceived a hole in it, and something white shining through it—I asked what he had got in his bag—he said soot—I told him it was not soot, there was something white shining through a hole in the bag—he said sometimes pieces of white paper got in with the soot—he threw his bag over his shoulder—I per<lb></lb>ceived something more, shining white, and asked him again what he had got in his bag—he said, "If you think there is any thing wrong in my bag I will leave it"—I wished him to leave it—he was walking on all the time of this conversation, and I followed him through the servants' hall to the area—he told me he would leave the bag in the dust-hole—I followed him to the dust-hole—he left the bag there, went up the area steps, and went away with the sweep's brush in his hand—I then went to the bag, opened it, and took out a towel which laid on the op—it was marked "L. No. 24"—I knew it was my master's—finding my master's property was in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live at No. 14, Clark's-buildings, Broad-street, Bloomsbury. I know the prisoner—he is a sweep—I have known him eighteen months—I remember the night of Wednes<lb></lb>day, the 2nd of September—I was at the Mogul public-house, in Drury-lane—there was a concert there that evening—I was there with the pri<lb></lb>soner and a friend of the name of Owen—when we parted that night Owen said he had a two years' engagement at Manchester, and we should not see him for a good while, for if it suited him, he should stay there; and he said, "You may as well come to the Spread Eagle to-morrow morning, and see me off"—we went the next morning to the Spread Eagle, Gracechurch-street, a little after seven o'clock, and Owen went off by the conveyance to the railway about twenty minutes after seven o'clock—after he was gone we met Mr. Russell, who formerly kept the Antelope public-house—that was about half-past seven o'clock—he said, "There you are"—(he knew us from using his house)—he said, "It is a nasty morning, will you take a drop of any thing to drink?"—we said we did not mind—he said, "I have got a friend here not far off," and Mr. Rus<lb></lb>sell, the prisoner, and I all went to Mr. East's, at the White Hart tap,</p>

               <p>Liverpool-street, Bishopsgate—we had something to drink, and staid there, as near as I can guess, an hoar, or it might be above an hour, and it was half-past seven o'clock when we got there—the prisoner and I came out—we left Mr. Russell—the prisoner and I went on towards the west end—we had something to drink once or twice in going along—we went on to a coffee-shop, and there we had breakfast—I parted with the prisoner about ten o'clock—I went to the police-office, but Mr. Robinson said I should not be heard.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Lambert. These springs were safe about three o'clock - the men leave work at eight - the prisoner left about half-past seven o'clock; I followed, and an officer, who was waiting, stopped him six or seven yards from the premises - he had these steel springs in a basket, which was covered up; he said, at the watch-house, he had bought them, but I had seen him breaking them into old steel, after three o'clock, which made me send for the officer - he begged my master to be merciful.</p>

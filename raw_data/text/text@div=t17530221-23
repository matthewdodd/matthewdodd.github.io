               <p>Brian. I work for all of the trade.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is never a gun barrel maker in London, but Mr. Brian.</p>
               <p>Q. to Griffin . Where were these barrels taken from him?</p>
               <p>Griffin . They were kept in a closet with several others, but none of the length of one of these, that is the short one.</p>
               <p>Q. What are these two barrels worth?</p>
               <p>Griffin. They are worth 28 s.</p>

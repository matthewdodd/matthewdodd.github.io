Between twelve and one o'clock, as I was going to market, I went to call a man up, who said he had heard a noise by Mr. Richardson's. I went across the garden, and saw the prisoner and Bolton there - I knew them before; I saw them drop off Richardson's wall. As soon as Bolton dropped, I saw him pick up a sheet of copper, and run up my father's garden with it, (which joins Mr. Richardson's premises), and the prisoner went away with the ladder that they had used to get over the wall with, which is about fourteen feet high. I ran after him, but he dropped the ladder, and got from me - he had nothing but the ladder. I followed Bolton so close, that he dropped the copper, and got away. I continued watching, but saw no traces of them.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner near the Wheat Sheaf, public-house, Percey's-green, Walham-green, on the 23d of September; I had been informed of the robbery some time before, and looked after the prisoner. I endeavoured to find him at his parents' - he was coming from there when I took him. I asked him if his name was Dormer? He said it was not - he had some victuals in his apron. I asked him if he knew any thing of this concern? he denied it - Salter delivered me the copper. I had often passed his street - he was there. I cannot find Bolton.</p>

               <p>Mr. Smith. On Sunday in the Afternoon, as I was walking in <placeName id="t17330628-29-crimeloc125">Grays-Inn-Walks</placeName>

I presently step'd back, and bid the Door-keeper of the Walks let me know if he saw any suspicious Persons loitering about there: A Boy came and told me, that he saw two Men pick a Gentleman's Pocket in the dark Passage by the Bookseller's Shop. I went to the Passage, took hold of the Prisoner, and saw him throw down a silk Handkerchief. Sir, says I, you must go with me. Sir, says he, I am a Gentleman; what d'ye mean? I could find no Constable, and so I took him to my own House; he fell on his Knees, and made many Protestations of his Innocence, but upon searching him, I found my Handkerchief in his Bosom. Then he said, he was no Pick-pocket himself, but was only retain'd by them, and had 1 s. 6 d. a Day to attend on them, and take what they stole.</p>
               <p>Rich. Smith. When my Father had brought the Prisoner home, the Prisoner kneel'd down and call'd Christ to witness that he never pick'd a Pocket in all his Life, tho' at the same time I saw him pull a Handkerchief out of his Pocket and put it into his Bosom; but when he found that my Father was resolved to search him thoroughly, he took it out of his Bosom again, and gave it to my Father, who own'd it; and then the Prisoner said, If it's your's, I can expect no Mercy.</p>

            . I live at No. 196, Kingsland-road - I keep a clothes shop, and deal in every thing - it is not what they call a marine-store shop. I sold these books to Garrard on the 24th of January - I bought them of the prisoner the same day for 8s., and sold them for 12s.; I think there were thirty of them: the prisoner called first, and asked if I would buy them - I told him to call in an hour; I knew him before, he has bought shoes and other things of me; I then went to Garrard's, and asked if he would buy them - he said, Yes; I then bought them, and took them to him: I did not ask the prisoner where he got them - he said he was a carpenter; I did not think it odd that he should have thirty books for sale - I do not in general sell books; I had not seen them at the time - I went to Garrard's, and asked him if he would buy them of me, if I bought them of a man: the prisoner told me they were only school books, but I did not know of what description, and could not describe them; 8s. is not very cheap - some of them are no more than waste paper - nothing had been said about the price I was to give for them, before I went to Garrard; I then went and asked if he would buy them.</p>

On the 17th of December last I left my chest locked in Mr. Scott's shop; I am sure these two saws were then in my chest. My chest as well as two others were broke open in the night of that day; I lost several saws, particularly these two (looks at them). I am sure they are mine; one saw is one of the largest I ever saw.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cordee, a pawnbroker. On the 20th of December, about noon, the prisoner came to our shop, and brought the two saws; my master was not then in the shop; he asked ten shillings and sixpence for them; I asked him what one of the saws cost him; he said the tenant saw cost fourteen shillings; I knowing something of saws, suspected he did not know any thing of the value of them, therefore I thought he did not come honestly by them; on which I went to my master ; he said he bought them of one Mrs. Squires in the next street; I went with him, but he could not find out the house; upon that we secured him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, said he pawned the saws for one Barnsby.</p>
               <p>He called a witness who gave him a good character.</p>

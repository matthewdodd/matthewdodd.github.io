            . I am a clothes-salesman, and live at No. 66, Rosemary-lane. On one Sunday morning, I think six or seven weeks before the 29th of December, I was standing at my shop door, and saw Vinson with another man, but I could not swear the other was Andrews, though to the best of my belief, he is the man; they came into my shop and purchased two suits of clothes, a jacket, a linen shirt, and a pair of stockings, which came to about 7l. - Vinson went over his fob pocket, and pulled out a note, and gave it to the shopman Solomon Solomon, who is here - he gave it to me; I asked Vinson to put his name and place of abode on it - I saw him write upon it, but I can neither read nor write - I had not change about me; I went out and got change of Mr. Ruffell, he gave me change; when I had given change they went away; I afterwards saw Vinson in custody at the Police-office - I observed his trousers which he then had on, and I knew them by a mark that I had put on the fob, as I always do in trousers; I knew them to be the same I had sold - I have a strong belief that Andrews was the other man, but I would not swear it; he had a jacket on when he came in with the other prisoner - I heard him talk then, and heard him speak at the Police-office; I believed him to be the same man, and I believe so still - he appeared about the same height.</p>
               <p>Vinson. There are two letters of his name on the things. Witness - It is not proper writing, it is a mark that I have learned to make, to know my things again when they are given out to be repaird.</p>
               <p>Andrews. He says we both went out together, but Vinson went out first.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Lower Berners-street, Commercial-road. On the 28th of October Andrews took a room in my house - he furnished it himself; I suppose the value of the whole he put in might be about 7l., but he did not bring all his things in on the 28th of October - they were brought in in about a fortnight; he first came to live there on the 5th of November - he brought a female, who lived with him as his wife; on the 8th of November Vinson came to lodge in my house; I let him a bed, and he slept there - he took his meals with Andrews and the female; on the 14th of December I was at home, and Blyth, the officer, came and took Andrews and the young woman into custody - Vinson did not sleep in my house that night, but I saw him over the way the next morning; he came over to me when he found that I opened the door - I told him there was a charge against him, for which I had orders to take him into custody provided he came to the house; he said he wished to see the prisoners, who were then in custody - I took him to the Police-office.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-officer. On the evening of the 14th of December, I went to Hitchcock's house - I waited till Andrews came in; I searched a box, which Andrews said belonged to him - I found a pair of trousers and a blue waistcoat in it; these are them- I also found a linen shirt and a new hat in the room; Andrews said he bought the hat of a man in New Gravel-lane, and gave 9s. or 9s. 6d. for it, and the trousers and jacket he bought at Mr. Freeman's, in the Commercial-road - there were half a dozen chairs in the room, a bedstead, bed and bedding, a piece of new carpet, a new looking-glass, some waiters, and new cooking utensils; I should think the whole worth about 6l. or 7l. - he said his wife, as he called her, purchased the chairs and bedstead; Harris and his man were with me - the first examination was on the 15th of December; they were remanded till the 29th.</p>
               <p>WOLF HARRIS. This waistcoat and trousers have my mark; they are what I sold on that Sunday morning.</p>

            . I went to the house with the officer - I am shopman to Wolf Harris, and was so on the Sunday morning the two men came to the shop - the note was delivered to me; I know the two prisoners to be the men I sold the clothes to - I have no doubt at all of it; it was six or seven weeks before we went down to the Police-office the first time - we make no entries of the sale of any goods.</p>
               <p>Vinsons Defence. I was going past Harris' shop, and he asked if I wanted to buy any thing - I said No, but he forced me into his house; I said I did not want to buy any thing, but I would take the waistcoat - I then took out the note, and asked him for change; he said he had no change, but I had better buy something for Andrews, who was with me, and he should then be able to get change - he then had a suit of clothes also.</p>
               <p>WOLF HARRIS. I did not sell them at all; it was Solomon.</p>

               <p>Vinson. He treated us with rum, and asked if we had any thing to sell - we said No; he said if we had, to bring it at any time, and it should be all right.</p>

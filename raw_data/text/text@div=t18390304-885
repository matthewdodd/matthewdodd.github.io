                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live in Cross-lane, St. Mary-at-Hill. A little before three o'clock, on Friday afternoon, the 22nd of February, I was passing through Rood-lane, and missed my handker<lb></lb>chief—I perceived the prisoner close by me, on my left-hand side—I sus<lb></lb>pected him, but not liking to charge him with it immediately, I stepped aside, let him pass, and saw him endeavouring to get my handkerchief into his pocket—I made a spring at him, and he dropped it, and ran away—I pursued him, struck him with my umbrella, and knocked off his hat—I picked it up, and stuck it on the first post I came to—I cried, "Stop thief," but he turned the corner of Cross-lane, and I lost sight of him—there were one or two others with him—I cannot say whether they were accomplices.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 149.) I was on duty in Thames-street a few minutes before three o'clock on Friday, the 22nd of February, and heard, "Stop thief" cried—I ran in the—direction of the cry, and met the prisoner running without a hat, and four persons following him—I stopped him—he resisted very much, and struck me a severe blow—I was, obliged to send for further assistance before I could take him—a hat was brought by a man who said he took it off a post, and the prisoner owned it as his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant and live in Dublin. On the 25th of Aug. I was walking up Ludgate-hill, about half-past twelve o'clock at night—the prisoner ran up to me, and took hold of my arm—I pushed her off—she came up to me again in about a minute—I hit her in the face, or on the bonnet, with the back of my hand—she then came in front of me, and went before me up the hill, with her face towards me, and walking backwards—she then ran up to me, and took my diamond pin—I caught hold of her hand, and called, "Police"—two or three persons came up, and the police<lb></lb>man came up—I told him the pin could not be more than half a yard from the place where he was—this is the pin—I did not see it picked up, but I saw it after it was picked up—it is mine.</p>

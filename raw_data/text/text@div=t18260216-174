On the evening of the 14th of February, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a pair of shoes - he tried on a pair, and said they were too large; I shewed him another, and they were too small - he put on a third pair, and said they would do - he put his hand into his pocket, as if he was going to pay, and then said, "I think I will have the first pair" - as I turned round to get them he snatched the third pair off the board, and ran away; I ran after him into Broad-street - a patrol stopped him in a few minutes. He was quite a stranger, but I am certain of his person.</p>

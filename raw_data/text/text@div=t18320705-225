               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050100"></xptr>go to the house after Christmas? A. I went past it many times, but did not enter it till the 10th of May, when I went to take possession; my sister was going to remain there for the summer - I saw the curtains up at the window as I passed, but I did not go in - I never employed Potter or his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Hill's husband? A. No - I cannot find him; I have eight children - I have a son in trouble: he is the first person I went to when I lost the property; to the best of my knowledge, he is now in prison; I was told yesterday he had been convicted of an offence - he is twenty-two years old; he was at liberty from December to May, and certainly had access to the house; I saw him sometimes - he has been convicted before.</p>
               <p>MR. WALESBY. Q. Did you go by your house from time to time? A. Yes - I did not try the door; there are outer gates, which fasten as well - I found the curtains Iorn down on the 10th of May; I had seen them up about six weeks before.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and live at Godalming now. In December last I lived at Mr. Russen's, Enfield-highway - Evans' house is next door to his; I recollect being at work with John Potter, in Mr. Russen's garden, in March last, and we had occasion to go into Evans' garden: we went close by the house - Jackson, Comfort, and Potter were with me - we went up to the house, and looked in at the back window; we were taking night-soil from Russen's premises, and having some ale; I was leaning against the shutter, and took hold of the pin accidentally, and turned it round - to the best of my knowledge the inner pin fell out; I took out the bolt, opened the shutter half way, looked in, and saw some crockery-ware in the kitchen, and think I saw two gridirons, but it was dark in the kitchen; I saw Potter look in at the same time, but he said nothing - I left Mr. Russen on the 9th of April.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure there was an inner pin to fall out? A. Not certain. I put the bolt in as I found it; the window was not open.</p>

            . I live at Enfield-wash. In May last I went to Hill's house, and saw Mrs. Hill; she offered me some broken things in a basket, to throw away for her - I did not see them; I went again the same Sunday afternoon, the 20th of May, and saw a chair burning on her fire- I saw part of the leg, and the cane bottom; she told me she had burnt the greater part of the bed-furniture, and other things.</p>

These things are all mine; the property found at Potter's is worth more than 10l. - near 40l. worth was lost; I think the premises were entered from the back window, near Mr. Russen's privy - it was shut when I went there; I do not know whether it was fastened - the street door was on the latch, and the pin was out of the shutter; the property might be removed at different times.</p>

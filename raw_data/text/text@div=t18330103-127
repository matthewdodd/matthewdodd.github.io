I did, and I stood by his side while he sealed it; then I put it into the cocoanut again - I did not untie it on the 13th of December, and say it was so much trouble to do so - I had seen my watch safe half an hour before I went out; there was a lady there from ten to twelve o'clock, but she was gone before I lost the watch - no one but you could have taken it; the seal was tied to the watch.</p>

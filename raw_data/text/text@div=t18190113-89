On the 29th of December, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I sent the prisoner, who was plying as a porter, with a basket containing the articles stated in the indictment. I helped them on his head at Paul-street, Finsbury-square, where I work, and sent them to my wife, who is a laundress; I knew him well before. I went home at one o'clock, and found he had not been. I had given him a direction in writing, and he said he knew where it was. I gave information at Worship-street, and found part of them - he never brought any of them to my house. On the Thursday following he was taken.</p>

            . I am a clothes-salesman, and live in Cable-street, Whitechapel. On the 29th of December, in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, and offered to sell me three duplicates of the articles produced. I suspected him, and left him in the shop, under pretence of going to examine them, but I got an officer. When I got back he was gone. He returned in about ten minutes, and was secured.</p>

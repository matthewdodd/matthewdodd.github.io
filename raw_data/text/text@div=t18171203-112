            . I am an officer. On the 22d of November I was informed of the robbery, and that the prisoner, Jarman, had been detained for offering a 20l. note, in Oxford-street. I took him and Frith into custody; after that, I received information from Bluet, at Tothill-fields; I went to the watch-house to Jarman, and told him I understood he had a 20l. note about him, and asked him to give it to me. He said, he hoped G-d might strike him dead if he had. I said I was sure he had. He declared solemnly that he knew nothing of the 20l. note which was detained in Oxford-street, and that he went there with Bluet to buy a waistcoat accidentally. I found the 20l. concealed in the lining of his hat (No. 13,014). I asked him what he said now? he said he did not know how it came there. I told him I had information of another 20l. note, which was changed on Saturday morning, and asked him where he had changed it? he said he knew nothing of it, for he never received it. I found he had changed it at Mr. Emery's, the Coach and Horses, in Oxford-street - it was No. 13, 016.</p>

Bluet bought a silver watch for 2l. 16s. - Jarman approved of it. Bluet handed me a 20l. note. Jarman told him his father would be angry with him if he gave more than 3l., and said Bluet lived in the neighbourhood. I asked Bluet for his address, he gave me the name of"Burt, Swallow-street." He said he was the son of Mr. Burt, the builder. I pretended to go out for change, and went to Mr. Burt. I returned, and questioned him about it; he then said, he said Bird. I went to Bird in consequence of what he said, and detained him. The note was No. 13,015.</p>

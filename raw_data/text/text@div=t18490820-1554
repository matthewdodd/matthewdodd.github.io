                  </hi>. I am a police-officer attached to the Post-office. On Tuesday evening, 7th Aug., about eight o'clock, I was at the back part of the Post-office, standing behind a door which concealed roe from the persons coming up the steps until they got into the hall—whilst there I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner coming up the steps into the hall—as he came up to the door he threw down a piece or two pieces of paper; I could not see which—they fell near me—he turned round and saw me—he did not say anything to me—I did not appear to take any notice of him—he went across the hall towards the Alders-gate-street side—as soon as his eyes were off me I picked up the piece of paper—when he got near the entrance-door he stood behind a pillar—I then saw him tearing up some bits of paper and throwing them down—I then lost sight of him for about a moment—when I saw him again he was coming across the hall back again with a female—he came to the door where I was standing,</p>

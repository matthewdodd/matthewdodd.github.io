I found Sugar in his Apron, and in the Inside of his Cloaths, in his Bosom, besides what he had got in his Apron and Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had he no Pocket?</p>
               <p>Mascall. No, he had no Pocket at all; the Sugar would have fell through between his Coat and Waistcoat if he had gone far. When I laid hold of him he seemed to be in a Fit, or drunk, or not well, and was very rustical, and I was obliged to get a Cart to carry him. He would not acknowledge any thing till he found he was mastered, and I had got him into the Cart; and then he said he had got the Sugar under Botolph's-Wharf Gateway. - He is a Person that goes about the Keys to pilfer what he can.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Mascall. I know it very well, he was in the House of Correction two or three Days before that for the same Practices. - He owned he took it out of the Warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he an Opportunity of doing that?</p>
               <p>Mascall. The Cooper's Servants go into the Warehouses to draw the Casks for Samples for Sale; and I do apprehend they might leave the Doors open, and that he might get in that Way, - they are very apt to leave the Doors open. <rs id="t17430413-7-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

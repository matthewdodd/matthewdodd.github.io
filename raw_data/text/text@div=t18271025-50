I owed Engley 4s.6d. - I bought a chair of him, which the prisoner brought to me, with a bill, and also a bill for the 4s. 6d. - I asked if he had a receipt - he said No; I asked if he could write one - he said Yes; I immediately paid him 2l.2s.6d.; I wrote the receipt, and he put his mark to it. I said nothing about wishing to look into the 4s. 6d.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with Walters. I asked the prisoner what he had done with the 2l.2s.6d. which he had received for his master - he said he had paid 2s. 6d. for his dinner, and bought a pair of new boots; I said,"What have you done with the other?" he would not tell me, but on Monday he said he had lost a sovereign in the company he was in.(Bill and receipt read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The prosecutor sent me with these two bills, to receive the money; when I got to Red Lion-street no such person lived there; I then met one Hill with three young men; we went to have something to drink, and got quite intoxicated; they showed me where Howard lived; a woman opened the door, and told me to wait; I waited half an hour - at last the gentleman came out, went up stairs, and looked at the bills; he looked over all his books, and said he believed he had paid it; I returned and told master - he sent me to dinner; I went to the play, and these two gentlemen came and asked one where the brass was - they took me away, and asked where the money was; I said I knew nothing of it; they said, "Come, and we shall soon settle with your master;" I asked what they meant and they could not answer - Vann will swear any man's life away - it is known he has perjured himself before.</p>
               <p>MR. HOWARD. I am certain I paid the prisoner the money; I might have said I had no recollection of the 4s. 6d., but on referring to my book I saw I had not paid it. The prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

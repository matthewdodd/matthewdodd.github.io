About twenty-five minutes to eight o'clock in the morning, I came down stairs, and heard the street door gently shut, and about eight o'clock the servant said the silver sugar basin and sugar tongs were gone, which I had seen on the sideboard cupboard the day before. I found them at Bow-street that day, the tongs were then broken into three pieces. Mr. Trickey has had them sixteen years; the street door was locked; there was no keyhole outside.</p>

            . I am a carriage maker. On Saturday morning the 21st of September, about ten minutes to eight o'clock, I was coming down Charlotte-street, and saw the two prisoners in company, about two hundred yards from Mr. Trickey's house, nearer to George-street. Ingman had a parcel in a blue handkerchief; I followed them into Upper Rathbone-place, and there Ingman turned round and saw me looking at them; they both went into Newman's passage; he there gave the parcel to Russell, who put it in his hat. I immediately seized him, and a gentleman held him while I took Russell, and found the sugar basin in his hat, with sugar in it. I took them to the watch-house, and found two latch keys on Russell.</p>

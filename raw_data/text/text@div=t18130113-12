About two o'clock at, noon, on last Sunday, I heard a violent knocking at the house door. When I came down stairs I found the prisoner in the custody of the witness.</p>

About half past two at noon, on Sunday last, I saw the prisoner go up a gentleman's gateway; after being there about five or six minutes, he came out, and went up Mr. Ponder's gateway. After being there about five or six minutes, I shut him in. He was there about seven or eight minutes. He, by some means, got the gate open again; he came out with the great coat under his arm, and the hat and umbrella in his hand. I collared him, and took him up the gateway, to Mr. Ponder's private door. I knocked at the door, Mr. Ponder came down to the dour, and owned the property. This is the great coat, hat, and umbrella.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the hat, umbrella, and great coat.</p>

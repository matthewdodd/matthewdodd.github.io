            . I am going into eleven year of age. My mother takes in washing, she lives in Bolton-street. She sent me for this linen, and Mr. Palmer delivered the bundle to me in St. Paul's church-yard. I believe it is about a week ago. About eleven, or half an hour after, in the morning, I brought it as far as Middle-row, Holborn I was standing to look at an image, about as tall as myself, at a mug shop, and the prisoner asked me whether that was not a pretty image. She went on a little farther, and said she would give me a pear: she took one out, and gave it me. I went a little farther, and she was going to give me a penny, but she gave me but a halfpenny. When I came a little farther, she took hold of my bundle, and said, I'll carry your bundle a little way for you. I gave it to her. She carried it as far as Great Turnstile. She went through it, and said her father lived at that painted house. As she went on, she asked whether my mother took in washing. I said, Yes. She said my mother did not wash her linen well enough to please her, because she starched the things. She got as far as <placeName id="t17690906-87-crimeloc464">Lincoln's-Inn</placeName>

Then she gave me a penny, and sent me up to No. 10, to ask for Mr. Range. I went up and asked for Mr. Range. There was no such man there. When I came back again, she and the bundle was gone: I fell a crying, and people asked what I cried for; then they brought me home to my mother. I saw the prisoner after this in Bridewell. I knew her very well again.</p>

            . I was sent for by Mr. Clay, the high constable, and was told there was a person in his house taken upon suspicion of taking these things from a child. I took her to Bridewell. It was the prisoner. The bundle was delivered to me. (He mentioned the particulars, as in the indictment. Produced in court.) As soon as the mittimus was made out, the washer woman came and owned the bundle.</p>

I told her. Said she, Can't you go another way? I said Yes. I am going to another of my aunts in Westminster. Said she, I am going that way. Then she said, Go to the Golden Cross, and I shall be at your heels as soon as you. She desired me to carry this bundle. I was going with it, and facing the new church in the Strand, the woman was close to me, when a man came up and said, Whose bundle is this? I said, It is my own. He said, He believed it was not. Said I, There is the woman that gave it to me. She was gone away. The man said, If he had got hold of her first, I should have been cleared. He said, I do not care if the d - I gave them to you, I'll have it. He then took the bundle away, had me to Red-Lion-square, and called at many houses. Then he took me to Justice Girdler's, and he committed me.</p>

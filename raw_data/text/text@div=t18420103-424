                  </hi>. I live in New-street, Cloth Fair, on the first floor. On the 30th of December, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I was alarmed by a noise in the house—I went down into the passage, and found some gown pieces there—I turned them over, and the prisoner came to me to the door, <hi rend="italic">nudged</hi> me on my arm, and said, "It is all right" (the door bad been left open for us to come in and out) as he said it was all right, I took them up, and shut the door, shutting him out, and went next door, to inform my neighbour of it—when I went into the street again, the prisoner came and talked to me again—he said, "If you will let me have the things, we can make money of them; they are worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. t and you shall have a share of it"—he and a man named Williams were then secured.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Crawley, of New-street Between eight and nine o'clock, on the 30th of December, Cater came through a yard, and gave me information—I went out at the street-door round to his door, which was fast, and the prisoner and Williams were standing by the door—I asked what he wanted there—the prisoner took Cater by the collar, pulled him towards him, and whispered—I then heard him say, "You know what the things are, I will make it all right"—Cater replied, that he worked for his living—Cater walked away—the prisoner followed him, and said, "Will you do what I ask you? if not, you had better <hi rend="italic">start</hi> them out of your place"—I went for a policeman.</p>

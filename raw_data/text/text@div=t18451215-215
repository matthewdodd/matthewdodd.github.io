The prisoner lodged at my house for about seven weeks, and left on the 27th of Nov., about half-past four or twenty minutes to five o'clock—he told me he was going out to tea—he never came back—he owed me for his lodging and about three days' board—he did not give me any intimation that he was going away for good—after he had been out two or three hours I went into my room, to go to</p>

I know Mrs. Rod<lb></lb>way—I heard of her robbery, and on Monday, the 15th of Dec., I was in a milk-shop in Gouldenton-street, Somers-town, and saw the prisoner go by in the street—I went out directly, and followed him—he west about 100 yards, aod then turned back—I did not wish him to see me—I went into a shop to ask somebody to get a policeman, but he turned back, and I crossed to him on the other side of the road, and said to him, "Colonel"—that was the name I knew him by—I always called him Colonel, but he was generally called Ge<lb></lb>neral—I said, "Colonel, I shall take you in charge on suspicion of robbing the poor widow woman, Rodway, at the Lion"—he said, "Poh, poh, non<lb></lb>sense, don't do any such thing"—I said, "I will"—I took hold of his collar, and said, "I shall hold you till I have a policeman come to give you up to"—I held him till a policeman came, and gave him in charge—I went to the station, saw him searched, and twenty-four sovereigns and half sovereigns, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper found on him, and I saw taken from his pocket-book a check signed B.

Halfhide and Co., but I have no partner - my son manages the business, but has no share in it; I never allowed him to pawn any goods, but I have pardoned him for it, upon a promise that he would not do it again; I said before Mr. Metcalf that I was aware a fork had been pawned by the prisoner - he never left my employ; I took him from the board; I have heard that he has worked for Mr. Metcalf - I gave a seal to Mr. Metcalf to do, and he gave it to my own man to do it; I will not swear that Mr. Metcalf, Jun. did not tell me the prisoner worked for his father as well as for me, but I have no knowledge that he did - I do not know whether Mr. Metcalf is in business for himself or not - they are in opposition to Mr. Strongitharm, in Pall-mall; my house is at the other end of the street; I did not know the prisoner was working for Mr. Metcalf - he was to work for me only; I only knew it by seeing his book when he was taken up -I have no recollection of knowing it from Mr. Metcalf: the prisoner had lived with me about thirteen years - he was a good workman, and would have been of value to any one who employed him - the prisoner's uncle has been employed in my house for fifty years - I have given him seals to engrave, partly for amusement; he was principally supported by me - I was brought up with him, and had it not been so, I should not have taken the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did you ever commission him to pawn any thing? A. No; I had no communication with Mr. Metcalf till I found something out - I had no knowledge of his going into Mr. Metcalf's employ.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner as long as I can remember; he came to me some time ago, making a communication about some fancy stones - I think it was some time in October; he said he had a few fancies to sell - I said if they were worth any thing, I would buy them of him; he wanted 1l. or a guinea for them - I said I had no objection to give him that; he then brought six fancies - I just looked at them, but I can scarcely swear whether they had impressions with them or no - they were common place sort of things, but I bought them; I mentioned to him, that a year or two since, I was over at his house, and bought a book-case, and in the drawer were a number of what we call working impressions - I said, "They are of no use to you, will you let me have them;" he said"There is one I should not like to part with, the others you may have if you like," and I had them; there were three or four dozen of them - the stones I bought of the prisoner went out of my hands into the hand of Mr. Jones, Mr. Halfhide's jeweller; I have seen six stones, which I believe were the same I gave to be set; I gave them to the officer - to the best of my knowledge, they were the same I gave to be set; I gave an indefinite order to mount them in good mountings - they were of ideal value.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But you would not take upon yourself to swear to them, I should think? A. No; I should think no one could without a private mark - the prisoner has occasionally worked for me and my father; I never mentioned it, but either the prosecutor or his son, said, "I suppose it will be Brown from Halfhide's, and Metcalf from Strongitharm's" - the prosecutor and the officer were present at the time; my father and I are in opposition to Mr. Strongitharm - I remember the prosecutor speaking in reference to some spoons off which the crest had been removed; he said he had no objection to his pawning, so long as he brought things back - the prisoner has worked for my father for a number of years, to my knowledge; he has occasionally given him work to do - he has borne an honest character.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was this declaration respecting pawning, after the prisoner was in custody on this very charge? A. Yes, he was alluding to a spoon, and when he saw the crest was filed off, he said he could have no intention of returning that - and what he said about,"Brown from Halfnide's, and Metcalf from Strongitharm's," was said in my shop - the prisoner was employed at Mr. Halfhide's constantly, but at his leisure hours he might do a job occasionally; he might have done two arms in the course of last year for me - he did more for my father; I do not know how many - I know my father has often said, Brown has got so and so.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of October, I took the prisoner at the prosecutor's shop; I produced to him this card of impressions, and asked what he had done with the stones which made them; he said he had sold them to Mr. Metcalf a fortnight or three weeks before - I searched him in the shop, and found in his breeches pocket, a cornelian stone, with the figure of Hope on it; I had made him no threat or promise - I took him to the office, and then searched his lodging in Newman-street, in consequence of information I received from Mr. Halfhide - I found a woman who acknowledged herself to be his wife, but I had not seen them together; I found at his lodgings the duplicates of the property which has been produced, and some others.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find the duplicate of the tablefork? A. Yes, and of the seal-setting on the same duplicate, pawned for 1l. on the 4th of August, 1829; I also found the four duplicates of the articles pawned at Mr. Lawton's -I have the six seals and an eye-glass, which I received from Mr. Metcalf; these seals exactly correspond with these impressions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner told you at once he had sold these stones to Mr. Metcalf? A. Yes; I did not know Mr. Metcalf at that time - I never saw the prisoner at his lodgings, nor the woman and him together; I did not ask the prisoner whether he had engraven these things himself.</p>
               <p>MR. METCALF re-examined. These six seals are the same as I received from the jeweller to whom I gave the stones to set - and, to the best of my belief, these impressions correspond with these seals; they appear so to do, but I think some have been taken since they were mounted, and some before - these two seem to be taken before they were mounted, they appear to tally; two stones can be engraven so nearly alike, as to give the same impression - the impressions appear like these stones, but I could not say they came from them, unless I were to take an impression and examine them with an eye-glass, and then they might be so imitated that I could not tell - I have no reason to doubt that these are the stones I gave to be mounted, but I could not swear to these; they were away for a week or ten days - here are seven impressions on this card, and six of them correspond with these stones; I have known the prisoner many years - he lived in Castle-street, Leicester-square, and then he said he lived in Newman-street; I understood from himself that he was married; I do not know whether he had any children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not Newman-street a street in which a great many artists live? A. I do not know - there is nothing to prevent the jeweller who set these stones from being here; there was nothing clandestine in the prisoners dealing with me - I gave them to the same man to set who works for Mr. Halfhide; there are a great many of these impressions in the trade.</p>
               <p>MR. HALFHIDE. I sent the officer to his house in Newman-street - it is a house of my own, and he lived there; the woman was his wife - she had been a servant of mine, and married from my house; these are the impressions from the stones which were taken from me, and these are the stones - they are some very fine ones, which I bought a great many years ago; I have no doubt in the world of their being mine, no more than I have of being here - this seal ferrule is mine; I came to town, and charged the prisoner with stealing the stones - he denied it; I did not hold out any promise or threat to him - I told him I knew he had sold these stones, and where he had sold them; he then said he had taken them - this other seal was found in his pocket; this duplicate of the fork was found in an old pocket in the house in Newman-street - this silver lid is mine, and this book; I valued these stones at 6s. 6d. each, which is a low price; I never gave him any power, authority, or commission to pawn or sell any one of these things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is that spoon in the state in which it was? A. No; there was a crest on it and a coronet, but they are filed off - I had applied to a pawnbroker before, and they said they would not take in a spoon with a crest and coronet on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any one present when he told you about these stones? A. No, not at first, but he confessed it before the officer; the impressions on these stones are private-marks - they were done by the prisoner's uncle; it is so difficult a thing to do the same work on two stones, that I do not think it quite possible; there may be hundreds of impressions of a leaf similar to this, but not like it - there may be imitations, but not fac similes; I believe no man could imitate one of these, and place them before me, without my being able to see the difference - I differ from Mr. Metcalf in that respect; I do not know that he can see better than I, though he is a young man - his father has been a great many years in business; here is no private-mark on this seal but the work, and here is a bull's head on this one, which cannot be seen with the naked eye - I have no private-mark on any of them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you put a mark on a cornelian stone? A. Yes - there is a particular manner in which artists view seals, so as to know them; it is very difficult to do two things alike - I had a spoon-fork like this, with a crest on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence The spoon-fork and lid are not Mr. Halfhide's; they were given to me, and he was fully aware of what I had done with them twelve months ago- he said he would not have prosecuted me if he had not had a jealousy that I worked for others; I am indebted to him, and he stated a few weeks ago that he would either arrest or prosecute me - if he arrested me, he said he supposed I should take the benefit of the Act; these impressions have been in my possession for years - some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090082"></xptr>I had from Mr. Aspin's, and a brother of mine, who worked there, collected them; I have done some of them myself - I have done work at my own house, and sat up nights and nights together, and even worked on Sundays, that the prosecutor's work might be finished; I remember eighteen months ago a stone was broken, and I worked on the Sunday to do another, and went with him to take it home - it is through maliciousness that he has got up this prosecution, because I had worked for other people; my uncle worked at the same shop before he went apprentice, and for the last two years my uncle being infirm and hard of hearing, I have done work for him unknown to my employer; Mr. Halfhide has been in the habit of looking out little stones for my uncle to engrave - I have done dozens and dozens, which have gone to India.</p>

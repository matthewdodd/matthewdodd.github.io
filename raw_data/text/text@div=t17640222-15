On the 9th of January, between three and six in the afternoon, I turned round to take a piece of cloth, and a little girl told me a man had taken some handkerchiefs; she ran and called, Stop thief, and the prisoner was brought back and the piece of handkerchiefs; there were eleven of them that just before had been lying, so that they might be taken on the outside the shop.</p>

               <p>That morning I came from Hammersmith; my mother gave me six shillings to buy a pair of shoes, and a shilling to bear my expences.

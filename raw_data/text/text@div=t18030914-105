             Sworn. - I had the care of the house, and received two guns from the last witnes, about two hours afterwards, the prisoner came, and told my little boy, who opened the door to him, he came about two guns, one of which was left in mistake; I went into the hall myself, and he said he came from Mr. Parker, a gunsmith in Holborn, about a gun that belonged to Mr. Dorrington, in Devonshire-place, as that the man, who carried out the guns, had made a mistake, and placed Mr. Dorrington's gun with ours, and carried ours to Devonshire-place; he had untied the guns by the time I got into the hall; he then looked at one, and said, that was not the gun; he then looked at the other, and said, this is it, and took it away; I begged him to make haste with the other, for I should be uneasy till it came, as a cart was coming early in the morning to take them with other things into the country; I also asked him, why he had not brought our gun with him; he said, because our house was in his way, and he would call as he came back with it; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You thought the person to whom you gave the gun, was the person who brought it? - A. No, I did not; I delivered it in consequence of the pretence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dusk? - A. No, quite day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, you could not undertake to swear to the prisoner, and that you did not believe he was the man, but your boy should be sent for? - A. No, I did not; I was in hopes I should get the gun without.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate say, that unless your son could say something more than you did, he must discharge him? - A. No, not in my presence; I did not like to swear to him, because his cloathes were different.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you desired to bring your son, of ten years old, to swear to him, if you had no doubt? - A. I was told it was necessary.</p>
               <p>- WESTBROOK Sworn. - Q. How old are you? - A. Ten years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you go to school? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a good or a bad thing to tell a lie? - A. A bad thing; it is a public scandal in this world, and whoever swears false goes to the devil in the next.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the son of the last witness? - A. Yes; I was at home when the man came for the guns; I let him in, and saw him afterwards at Bow-street, and am sure the prisoner is the man; he asked me if there were not two guns left; I said, yes; he said, the man who brought them, had made a mistake, - that one was for Mr. Dorrington, of Devonshire-place; I stood sometime before I let him have it, and then my mother came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were not sworn at Bow-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You then said, you did not know the nature of an oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked whether you knew the prisoner, and did you not say, no? - A. I said I was not sure, because I was afraid he would be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother expected a good deal of anger for having lost the gun? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She often told you so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left Bow-street, your mother told you that was the man who took the gun? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She has often told you so - has she not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you knew it was a bad thing to tell a lie, you told a lie at Bow-street before the Justice - had you ever been before a Justice before? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. When your mother spoke to you about this business, did she not tell you, if you should be asked here the reason you did not speak to the man when you were at Bow-street, to say, it was because you were afraid he would be hanged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the fact is, you did not know the man when there, and only know him now in consequence of what your mother told you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it is the man, in consequence of your mother telling you to say he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She has since told you he was the man, and you believe it? - A. Yes; I saw nothing but his face when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you were at Bow-street, your mother told you it was the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she told you the nature of an oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You observed the face of the man who came for the guns? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - are you sure he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any doubt of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When? - A. I don't think I ever saw him before he came for the guns.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say you were not sure he was the man at Bow-street? - A. I was afraid to say it, for fear he should be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your mother told you any thing before you went to Bow-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say at Bow-street? - A. The gentleman asked me whether I remembered the man who came to our house; I said, yes; he said, look round, and point him out; I looked round, and pointed out the prisoner; he asked me if I was sure, and I said, no, for fear the should be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. You have called God to witness you will speak the truth, and if you swear what is false, you will not only be severely punished in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140081"></xptr>world, but the next; having called God to witness what you say, are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday, the 10th of December, at a brothel in George-court, Gray's-inn-lane—she was wearing this boa, this velvet bonnet, and fur cape—I found a purse in, a reticule, containing three sovereigns and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were five other girls there—she told them to keep away from her, or perhaps they might get into trouble as well as herself—I took her to the station—I told her what I took her for—she asked me if I thought she would get transported—I did not threaten her or make her any promise.</p>

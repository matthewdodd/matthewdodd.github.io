                  </hi>. I came from Hull, in Yorkshire—I was living at Peter's-hill, Doctors' Commons. On the 17th of April, I was going over Lon<lb></lb>don-bridge, I was spoken to by a person, and in consequence of what he said I went to a house in King-street, Southwark, No. 4, I think—I went up stairs with him—I saw the prisoner in the room up stairs—the prisoner introduced this piece of satin—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he asked me to purchase it—he said it was valued at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him I had not the money to purchase anything of the kind—he came down to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I purchased it, with the idea of clearing out of the house—while I was paying for it, this shawl (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) was introduced—the prisoner opened a chest in the room, and took it out—he said it was valued at 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I had not 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by me, I could not Purchase anything of the kind—he asked me if I would show him my watch—I pulled it out, and showed it him—after he saw that, I told him how much money I had—he would not believe me, so I pulled my money out, and showed it him—I had one half-sovereign and three sixpences—he took the half-sovereign out of my hand, and two of the sixpences, and left me one sixpence—he had put the shawl into my hat, and I had thrown it out two or three times, and put it on the table—he then unbuttoned a button of my waistcoat, and took my watch out, and while I was looking at it he slipped the guard over my neck.</p>

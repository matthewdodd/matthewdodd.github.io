               <p>WILLIAM DELABERTAUCHE. I went with my son, on Thursday, the 8th, and found the prisoner in a public-house- my son said that was the man; I took hold of him, and brought him out - he was nearly rescued from me, but I took him to the watch-house: a lady came up, and said he had stolen them, but she did not know whether they were pawned or sold.</p>

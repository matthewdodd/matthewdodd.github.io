On the 5th of November, several of my neighbours came and said four men were lurking about my shop, and I took my coats in which hung at the door. I went to the door afterwards, and saw them still in the street. I went out, informed my neighbours, and saw the prisoner standing at the window of Mr. Layton, the <rs id="t18191201-123-viclabel722" type="occupation">pawnbroker</rs>

I went into his shop, and told the young man that two of them stood at his window. He turned round, and said they had cut the window, and had almost got a seal - this was between twelve and one o'clock in the day; the other young man said he had got it. I opened the door, ran out, and secured the prisoner about four yards from the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo! my lad, you have got a seal." He said he had got no seal, and then dropped it behind him. I took him back to the shop.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Layton. On the 6th of November, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, Valentine came into the shop - we keep two shops. I went into the next shop, saw the window broken at the corner of the pane, and a lad standing by the side; in a few minutes the prisoner came and put his finger through the broken pane, and took the seal out - I told Valentine, and he ran out. I followed, and saw the seal drop from the prisoner's hand.</p>

I had a book in my left-hand coat pocket, and my handkerchief in the other. The prisoner attempted to take the book out but did not succeed. I felt him, and turned round immediately. Upon my looking at him he came round to my face, and asked me what I wanted? I told him I wanted nothing, for I was aware of his object. He immediately came behind me, between me and the houses, and snatched my handkerchief out - I felt him take it, and looked round; he ran across the street with it in his hand. I followed him through a court - He was stopped at the top; a large crowd came round us. The handkerchief was not found on him. I had seen it in his hand.</p>

            . I am the last witness's brother. I was walking down Fleet-street with him - We were followed by a crowd, which I suspected to be pickpockets. I looked round-the prisoner passed before us, and asked us what we wanted? we said we wanted nothing. He turned round between my brother and the wall-my brother said he had picked his pocket - He ran off. I turned round, and saw his hand up to his coat. I did not see the handkerchief.</p>

            . I live in Pemberton-row. I heard the cry, ran out, and saw the prisoner - Mr. Ellis said he had robbed him; we took him to the Compter. He wanted to go through several bye places. At the corner of Newgate-street he kept looking behind; he then said,"I will not go." The gang came up, and tried to rescue him-Reeve was knocked down. We got him to the Compter with difficulty. I was struck.</p>

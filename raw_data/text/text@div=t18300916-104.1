I do not know - the broker refused to take it; Wilson then looked at henson, told him to go up stairs, and he would find two half-sovereigns under a pot - he went and brought down a purse, (not mine) and was going to take the money out; I did not see the money, for I entreated the brokers not to take it, as it was my money, and I had been robbed of it - the broker did not take it; King went out with him to give the money - I asked the broker if he was an officer to protect me; he said he was not, and went out, promising to send me an officer - I went to Gibbons' house, right opposite, to wash myself: my face was at this time bleeding profusely, and my ear, my neck, and back were bleeding - while I was washing King came to the window, and when she saw the door open she came in, and said, "Now, Miss Elliss, do you say I gave you that black eye?" I said," You and the rest of them" - my eye and ear were bleeding then; she then came in and struck me in the mouth, and my mouth burst out bleeding - Mrs. Gibbons and every body saw her do that; three officers came, and I was taken in a coach to the station.</p>

             Ellis is your real name? A. That is my real name - I never went by any other names in my life; I never went by the name of Rebecca French - I was never called or known by that name, or any other than I have given; I am a housekeeper, and am partly under the protection of a gentleman who was in Switzerland at the time - he wrote to me from there on the 21st of June; he left town sixteen or eighteen days before this - I occasionally see other gentlemen; I had never been to this house before - I went there to see Wilson, having heard she was ill, and I had previously known her- I did not find it to be a "company house;" I was on good terms with Wilson - I left home about a quarter or half-past ten o'clock; I called on Mr. Buchanan, my doctor, and on Mrs. Buckmaster, a dress-maker, to know where Wilson lived; I called no where else, and drank nothing before I got to Wilson's - I usually drink wine, but sometimes take none all day; Wilson asked if I would take any thing - I said I did not care, and asked what she would have - she said gin, and gin was sent for; I took part of a glass - three quarterns were sent for while I was there; a dirty little girl was sent for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear eleven quarterns were not sent for before you went into the yard? A. I swear it was not so, and that I was sober - I felt a sensation after taking the coffee which I never felt before - it was not through the gin; two hours nearly elapsed between my taking the coffee and the gin - I did not go to sleep on the sofa; I felt faint after taking the coffee, for eight or ten minutes; they were all in the room then - I had seen Murray several times before; she is a woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you join the party she was in? A. The truth is, I was ashamed she should see me there, and turned my head when she entered, and she wished to avoid me - we were obliged to recognize each other; before I sat on the sofa, some triffling dispute arose about the French polish on my table - Wilson was speaking of her table being polished; I told her I had spoiled mine with French polish, and should not have been out, but I was going to my cabinet-maker's to send to do it again; we had a little dispute about it, but not a quarrel - I was not sick at all there; I went into the yard, complaining of faintness - when I left home I had four half-sovereigns, two sovereigns, and 5s. 6d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160054"></xptr>which my servant put into my purse; I paid 6d. for an omnibus to Mr. Buchanan's, in Finsbury-terrace, and 5s. I paid away - I swear I was perfectly sober - the chains and eye-glass were taken from me after I was struck; when I entered the house again, Murray told me King had taken a pair of ear-rings and handed them to somebody - they hung in my ears in two holes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to the room, and charged the persons with stealing your money, did they not one and all become indignant at it? A. Only Wilson - King said nothing till she offered to be searched, but she had been out of the room several hours; we all nearly stripped - they did not say any of the money had fallen from me when on the sofa - it might have gone down some cracks; the carpet was taken up after the table was thrown over, but no money found; I took up one sovereign before the carpet was taken up - it was not taken up till after I returned to the room; it was kicked along the edges, but not taken up and folded - I observed no hole in the yard; when I returned to the room I found a pipe with a piece broken off it; I did not fight with King - I defended myself as well as I could; she was dreadfully abusive, but I could not contend with her - my ear-rings were not torn out in the scuffle; I was upon my feet when they were torn from me - they were then trying to eject me from the house; the officer has my ear-rings and chains - I still miss a brooch; a comb which was in my hair has been found since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state at the Police-office, that you believed they did not intend to rob you? A. I said I was extremely ill-used - I was cross-examined, and Mr. Platt all but urged it on me; he told me to remember the prisoners, and said, "Don't you think it possible they tore the things from you with a view to disfigure you and injure you?" and at last I said (by his persuasion) possibly it might be so, but that was not the statement I gave before Mr. Broughton - I said I thought it very impossible, and next to impossible that my purse could have fallen out of my bosom; I had a high neck dress on, fastened behind - I put my purse inside.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you at any time tell 
               <persName id="t18300916-104-person957">

            , that you did not believe Henson had robbed you? A. Never - she is my washerwoman; I never told her so - she begged me to be merciful to Henson, and to spare him, but she wished the women might be punished; I said I would not more than I could help, but I must speak the truth, and I believed it was him received the money from King - I never asked Murray if Henson had any property, or that I had inquired and found he had- I never inquired about it; I do not know Howarth - I was fainting in the street, and had a glass of water, but from whom I do not know - I was never in Howarth's house; I swear I was sober - the child only fetched three half-quarterns of liquor while I was in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often do you think King left the room before she offered to be searched? A. I think three times, but will swear to two - I did not find either of my half-sovereigns; I only went there to see Wilson - she had previously told me how very badly she was off, and had neither money nor clothes; when I got there she told me she was ill, she had not been out for a week, and had no clothes to come out in; I went to relieve her - my ears are now so sore, the rings are fastened to them with loops.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said at the examination you did not think the chains and ear-rings were taken to rob, but to injure you? A. Yes - I am perfectly satisfied if they could have taken them they would.</p>

            . I live at No. 42, James-street, Hoxton. On the 7th of August I was at Wilson's house in Francis-street; I found the prosecutrix, Henson, and Wilson there when I entered - King came in in about a quarter of an hour: Elliss was sitting down in a chair when I went in; after having some gin she took some coffee, and sat on the sofa - King sat on the foot of the sofa: about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after taking the coffee she said she felt rather faint; (she was not sick) - Wilson and I accompanied her into the yard; a pipe of tobacco was thrown down, and Wilson said, "You have dropped your purse, mind your purse, for there are holes in the yard;" she missed her purse - we returned to the room, and she found her purse on the sofa, opened it, and accused them of robbing her of three half-sovereigns; she took off the best part of her things, because they supposed she had the money about her - no half-sovereigns were found: she then opened her purse, and put out two sovereigns and some silver on the table - the table was upset; I do not know how - Elliss did not do it; the three prisoners were in the room - Elliss picked up a sovereign, and some silver was found; Elliss said one of the sovereigns she had put on the table was gone - King said, "You may think yourself lucky you have got that, for there are cracks in the boards;" the carpet was moved to search - I remember King pulling off her clothes; nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand there was an outrage, and the brokers came in - in what state was Elliss' face and ears at that time? A. Bleeding, and she was without her chains and ear-rings - she complained that her property was in the house; the brokers demand 22s. - some money was offered them; Elliss said, "Don't take it, it is my money - I am robbed;" some officers came; I went with her to the station-house: she was very faint then - she had washed before that; Wilson said to Henson, "Go up stairs, and you will find the money to pay the brokers;" I got the chains and things afterwards, and handed them to the constable; the half-sovereigns and sovereign were never found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You and Ellis are in the same kind of life? A. Yes, and the female prisoners also; I got to the house about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock in the morning; there was some gin in a decanter on the table - there appeared very little, and in about five minutes, 
               <persName id="t18300916-104-person959">

            , the little girl, came, when Wilson called her to fetch an errand, which was more gin; I think it was about a pint decanter - I will not swear it would not hold a quart; I swear Howard did not go for gin above three times - I did not notice whether she took the decanter; none of us got drunk: gin was only fetched three times, and it was only 6d. worth each time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the girl did not go nine times, and that there was not as many as eleven quarterns and a half of gin? A. Yes: I have had no conversation with Elliss about Henson having property, not a word; she did not ask if he had property, or say she had made inquiry, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160055"></xptr>found he had; I did not strip. King did: Elliss charged them all with the robbery; King took off her stays and flannel petticoat - we were not all almost naked together in the room; only King and the prosecutrix stripped: when the quarrel began King fought nearly naked; Elliss' clothes were on; she did not fight: I heard Wilson say she had bit her on the ground, but I did not see her bite or fight: she tried to defend herself, not by striking, but by begging of them for mercy; she was not drunk at any part of the transaction: I was at Gibbons', she was not drunk there - I had about three glasses; I suppose we were drinking from half-past eleven or twelve to one o'clock: something was said about French polish, but the quarrel did not begin till Elliss accused them of robbing her; violence followed that, and I begged of them not to ill-use her: I cannot tell who upset the table; the carpet was over the middle of the room: no cracks were pointed out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you in the habit of taking gin so early? A. No; I was not the least in liquor; there was no quarrel about the French polish, nor any altercation - I picked up one chain, and King the quizzing-glass, and gave it to me to give Elliss; I had not known Elliss long - when the broker came Wilson said the money was up stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any quarrel or dispute about the French polish? A. No; Elliss did not appear faint or ill till after she had had the coffee.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where you at the table all the time the gin was there? A. Yes; Elliss partook of part of what was sent for - she had about three glasses.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live at Eastrow. On the 2nd of August I went to this house for 22s. - I waited for the door to be opened; the warrant was signed against Wilson - Henson is not master of the house; I saw the prisoners there, and saw Elliss in the act of putting her petticoats on - she had a blow on one eye, which bled profusely; I did not observe her ears - she seemed particularly agitated, and said she had been robbed - all the prisoners were there; Henson offered me 11s., which I refused - some person said, "Go up stairs and fetch the money;" I cannot swear which it was, but I think it was Wilson - some money was brought down, which Henson offered me; I did not see whether it was gold or silver, for Elliss immediately caught hold of my hands to prevent my taking it, saying she had been robbed of it; she certainly knew what she was doing, though agitated; Henson said if she had been robbed to seek her redress - I afterwards went into the next house, which was empty; King came in after me, and I received from her two half-sovereigns and 2s. - she said if the prosecutrix had been robbed it served her right, for she had robbed hundreds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This is a house where girls of the town live? A. I presume so; I certainly took the prosecutrix to be the worse for liquor, but still to know what she was about; Murray seemed the most collected - I did not notice any being the worse for liquor but the prosecutrix; I did not know this house before, nor the prosecutrix, though it seems she had seen me; the landlord-had informed me he wished to get rid of the party because it was a had house; Henson did not offer to send for a Policeman in my hearing; I was not above ten minutes settling my business - Elliss said, "For God's sake, if you are an officer, protect me, for I have been ill-used and robbed."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You found you had seen Elliss before? A. She bought an article at my shop two months before, and I took it home; her name is on the door, on a brass plate.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Murray appear perfectly capable of observing what occurred, and understanding it? A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say whether Elliss' appearance arose from agitation or intoxication? A. No; I cannot say that she appeared particularly agitated.</p>

            , of East-row, coal-merchant. I was at work next door to Wilson's house, heard a disturbance, and saw Elliss; she complained of being robbed - I know Henson very well; I saw him go up stairs in the house and fetch a purse down - I saw him take two sovereigns out of it and offer to King - she took it, and went into the next house with Mr. Pickford; Elliss said, "It is my money, I have been robbed, do not take it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Elliss drunk or sober? A. She was not tipsy; I cannot say she was right, because she had three glasses of gin, for I saw it fetched - I was at work, painting, next door; I do not know how many houses of ill-fame there are in the street; I do not live in the neighbourhood - I went into the house to assist the broker; I did not see Elliss drink the gin, but speak from what she said at Worship-street; I saw the little girl go out with a basket, but only once - I was there from ten o'clock to five; I heard a noise in the house between two and three, and between three and four I went with the broker to distrain - it was about four; I saw the little girl go out with a basket - I did not see the bottle; I saw the bottle on the table when the door was open - it was a green bottle, not a decanter; I did not go in then, for the warrant was not signed - the bottle held about half a pint - it was not so large as a wine or porter bottle; it was a green bottle - I do not know whether it was a decanter; I saw no gin in it; it was just as I passed the door to go to work - the door opens directly into the room; when I heard Elliss say, "I have lost my money," they instantly shut the door - the broker had not come; I went to look for him; he came down with me, and we waited outside about a quarter of an hour till Henson opened the door; it was not open when we got there - I cannot say Elliss was tipsy, she was not right down sober; Murray was, and so was Henson.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Murray was able to attend to what was going on, and to give a correct account? A. She was.</p>

            , a watch spring-maker, and live at No. 16, Francis-street. Wilson's house is No. 7. On the 2nd of August I heard a screaming there, and a voice exclaiming, "You have robbed me; give me my money, I will have my money;" about a quarter of an hour after that, I saw King come out and go to No. 18, next door but one to me, where she lodged - when she got into the street I heard her say, "I have done her, and I am the one that can do her; I will give her a b-y good hiding, and b-r her" - she came out of that house in about ten minutes, and went into Wilson's house again; after that I heard several voices, but my attention was most particularly drawn to the voice, saying, "Give me my money," which I heard repeatedly - King came out of the house again in the same bouncing manner as before, using much the same expressions; she went back again, and every time she went back the noise was greater - I saw the door open, Henson was on the side of the prosecutrix, and Wilson with her hands up, as if she had hold of the prosecutrix; Henson was in a stooping position, and so was the prosecutrix, with her leg turned up behind - I only saw the back part of her leg; I did not see Henson do any thing then; I afterwards saw him strike the prosecutrix; I was then standing opposite their door - the door was shut too; after that I heard screams of Murder! and saw the prosecutrix violently shoved out of the house; she knocked for admittance, and her bonnet was thrown out to her - her face was bleeding; she said, "I have been robbed in that house, and cruelly beat," and desired me to send for a Policeman, which I did - I took her into my house to wash her, and she was in a dreadful state; the blood poured from both her ears, and she had a dreadful black eye - her senses were quite correct when she spoke to me, but she had not been many minutes in my house before she fainted; she fainted three times; after this King came into my house - the prosecutrix was bleeding at the time; King said to her, "Do you say I robbed you, do you say I gave you that black eye," and immediately struck her in the face, and made her mouth bleed - it had not bled before; the prosecutirx could not answer her - she had just recovered from a fainting fit; one of her ears was torn right through the flesh - she did not appear to me to be intoxicated, she spoke so collected; she was very much exhausted indeed - I had no doubt she had been drinking.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Why have you no doubt of that? A. Because I saw liquor go into the house once or twice; I did not think her intoxicated, I swear; I thought her sober, quite so - my son and husband came in and saw her; there are a great many had houses in that street - this is one, and No. 18 also, which

            . I am a Policeman. I went to Mrs. Gibbons' house about five o'clock, and saw Elliss all over blood, bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears; the blood was running down profusely - she appeared agitated and very weak from the loss of blood; in consequence of what I heard I went to No. 7. Francis-street, tried to open the door, and found it locked - I heard either a lock or window fastened while I was attempting to get in; I staid there a quarter of an hour - other constables came, and it was opened; I had required that it should be opened when I first went but it was not - I found the prisoners there, and took them into custody; they said they were innocent.</p>
               <p>Henson's Defence. I called at Wilson's that morning, and had not been there long before Ellis came in; I did not know her before, and went into the kitchen - she persuaded me to come into the parlour, and sent for half a pint of gin- Murray came in, and she sent for another half pint; there were four half pints sent for - that is all I know.</p>
               <p>MARY GIBBS. I live in Shepherd's-walk, City-road, and am a laundress. I have known Elliss about eight months, and wash for her; she told me she was very sorry for Henson, and she hoped it would be favourable with him - she did not say who robbed her; I once asked if it was Henson had robbed her; she certainly said she thought he never did rob her - I have seen Murray twice since this- she asked me if Henson had property, and said she had made inquiry, and was told he had; I said he was a hardworking man, and what he got was by industry; I have known him sixteen years - his father is a gingerbread baker, next door to me; he always bore an honest character.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever know he was master of the house in Francis-street? A. No, he was not - he lived at his father's; I heard of his being taken on the Wednesday or Thursday as this happened on Monday - I went to Elliss, and begged her to be as favourable as she could to him, and she said she did not wish to hurt him, but she must tell the truth - she said she had been robbed, but could not tell where the money went, or which of them had robbed her; I saw a mark on her face, and she had a black eye.</p>
               <p>ELIZA HOWARD. I am ten years old, and live at No. 3, Francis-street. I remember the disturbance at No. 7 - Miss Elliss sent me to fetch the best gin that day about ten o'clock - I got sixpenny worth at a time, that is a quartern and a half - she gave Wilson the money for it, and Wilson gave it to me with a decanter to get it in, not a green bottle; I got it from Shepherd's public-house, in Old-street-road - I went for gin ten or eleven times for her; I received the money from Wilson, and once from King - Elliss gave it to King to give me; I am almost sure it was eleven times - it was ten or eleven; I changed half a sovereign in the morning the first time, and paid 6d. each time - Elliss gave the money for it each time; I got the same quantity each time - the last was about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you happen to go to the house? A. Wilson called me - I did not know her before- she did not pay me for going; when she wanted gin she called me from her mother's, from her own door - we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160057"></xptr>live four houses from Wilson's - my mother was next door- I could hear Wilson call me; she said, "Betsey, will you fetch me an errand?" she said so each time - she called loud enough for my mother to hear; I had spoken to Wilson before - Wilson called me, and Elliss gave me the half-sovereign - the solicitor has been talking to me about the evidence I was to give; he was not half an hour talking to me - he did not tell me I must have gone ten or eleven times for the gin; he said, "Well, my little maid, how much gin did you fetch?" I told him eleven times - he did not ask me any thing more; my mother and Mr. Howarth were present - he gave me 1s. with a piece of paper; I never saw Ellis at the house before - a girl at the public-house gave me change for the half-sovereign - she has gone away not; the public-house is about ten minutes' walk from Francis-street; I never changed half a sovereign before, only for my mother - I had 9s. 6d. out of I - if 1s. was taken out of the half-sovereign, there would be 8s. 6d. left; if I had had 2s. worth of gin I should have had 7s. change - if 3s. were taken from a half-sovereign there would be 6s. left.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many shillings does half a sovereign amount to? A. Ten - if I take 3s. from 10s. there would be 6s. left; if I took 6d. from half a sovereign there would be 8s. 6d. left - I got 8s. 6d. change out of the half-sovereign, not 9s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you ever been to the public-house before for the people at No. 7? A. Three or four times - I went eleven times that day for Elliss; my mother knew I went once or twice; she scolded me once for it, when I had been about nine times.</p>
               <p>ELIZA HOWARD. I am this child's mother. On the day in question I was washing next door but one, round the corner; I left my daughter at home - I went about seven o'clock, and returned about twelve; I scolded my daughter for fetching gin for Miss Wilson, King, and the rest - I knew she had fetched it, because I saw her pass the house I was working at - I saw her pass I should think eight or nine times before twelve o'clock - I chided her for going so often, and said she should not go there so much; she did not tell me how often she had been, but I could see every time she went - I called her in once, and told her if she went again I should be very angry, and after that I saw her go again - I should think the last time I saw her go must have been between three and four o'clock - I should think she went ten or twelve times in all.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Of course you never knew of her taking gin to a brothel before? A. Yes; children were in the habit of running on errands for the neighbours - I never knew of her fetching gin for that house before; she passed at least eight or nine times before twelve o'clock - she might have fetched gin for Wilson before Elliss arrived - Elliss was there before twelve o'clock; I am sure the child fetched gin at least eight or nine times before twelve - the public-house is not more than two minutes' walk; I should think it is about one hundred yards - I have sent her out to change as much as half a crown at times, but never sent her with any gold - she never had any gold to my knowledge, till she changed this half-sovereign for Wilson; it was about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock when I called her in, and scolded her - she had gone eight or mine times then; she went backwards and forwards as fast as she could - I saw her every time she went; I chastised her three or four different times - being a poor woman, if a child can earn a halfpenny I am glad of it, and I suppose in the course of this day she might have received 3d. or 4d. for going for the gin.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did she show you any thing she had for going? A. Yes. 3d. or 4d.; when she had the money, she gave it to me to keep.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your saw 3d. or 4d. which she had? A. Yes. Wilson keeps the house; I have seen Henson passing several times - his father keeps a shop in the City-road - every time my child had a half-penny she brought it to me, and it amounted to 3d. or 4d.; a halfpenny at a time.</p>

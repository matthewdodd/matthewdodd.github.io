                  </hi>. I am a horse-dealer, and live at Harefield, in Middlesex. In December last, I had a gelding in a field belonging to me at Harefield, adjoining the road—I had turned it out on Sunday the 17th of December last year—I went on the Monday morning, the 18th, about seven o'clock, and it was gone—I saw it again eight days afterwards—it was sent to me by the witness Townsend, who found it in London—I had seen the prisoner at my house on the Saturday evening—he worked, I understand, at a farm adjoining my field—he said when he came into my house, "Lake, do you turn your horse out now?"—I said, "Some<lb></lb>times I do."</p>

                  </hi>. On the Monday before last Christmas, I purchased a black gelding of the prisoner for 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. It was facing the Rose-inn, Smithfield—it was claimed on the Friday following, and given up to Townsend.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He said at Uxbridge he would not swear to me, for it was a man a head and shoulders taller—the prosecutor said, if he did not, he should be prosecuted himself; and then he turned round, and directly said it was me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He had a great-eoat on when I bought the horse—I said at first that the man was half a head taller—I am certain it was the prisoner—I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and ran home all the way to the Bird-cage, to fetch the other money, as I had not got it about me—I was gone about three-quarters of an hour.</p>

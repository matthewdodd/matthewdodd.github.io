On the 2d of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some seals; he took up several, asked the price, and I put them down one by one as he looked at them - He asked the price of one, which I told him was 15s. When he put it down again there was a vacant place. I told him he had one in his hand, he said he had not; I said I was sure he had - He shook his handkerchief over the tray, and the seal fell out. I told him to go about his business, as I was sure he only came to thieve. My husband came out of the parlour, and told the prisoner he should be satisfied if he shewed him the money he had to buy the seal with. We sent for an officer, who searched him, and found only 3d. in his pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it possible for the seal to have got into the handkerchief - A. I do not think it was. He shook his handkerchief two or three times before it fell out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. The tray contained several valuable seals-this was worth 12s.</p>

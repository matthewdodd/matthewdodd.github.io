I was returning home about twelve o'clock at night on the 3rd of July; I met the prisoner in <placeName id="t18300708-118-crimeloc671">Hammersmith</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Where had you been? A.With a friend; we had drank a quart or three pints of beer after dinner, and at dinner I had about half a pint of porter - I was perfectly sober: there were no lamps - it was not very dark; my breeches were not down, but they were unbuttoned - I gave charge of the prisoner directly; I did not say that I had lost 5s., then 7s. 6d., then 10s., and then 14s. 6d. - I think the prisoner had 1l. 1s. 8d. on her in all, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>MARK KING. I heard the alarm - I went up, and saw some men near the prisoner; she was running - the men followed me up the lane, but when I took the prisoner I lost sight of them; the prosecutor accused her of robbing him; he seemed to me to be sober - she denied it at first, but in going along she said she would undo her pocket, and give it me - there was 1l. 1s. 2d. in it; in going to the watch-house she said she would give him the money if he would say nothing about it: I found five half-crowns on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was there not some conversation about taking the money, and she said rather than have any piece of work she would give him the money? A. No - I think it was twenty minutes before I offered to search the prisoner; she could not have thrown it away without my seeing it - I should think not five minutes elapsed from my hearing the cry till I came up.</p>

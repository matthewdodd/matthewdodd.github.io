                  </hi>. I am a toll-collector at the turnpike in the Com<lb></lb>mercial-road. I left a great-coat in the box of the toll-house, on the 13th of May, about a quarter before eight o'clock, while I went to breakfast—a man named Wellen ran up, and said something—I went to the box, where I had left my coat, and it was gone—the prisoner was standing about six yards off when I put it there.</p>

As I was going to breakfast I saw the prisoner's and another man's hands in the box at the toll-bar where Minke stands—I went and told Minke I had seen the prisoner about there before—I am quite sure</p>

On the morning of the 13th of May I saw the prisoner in Bishopsgate Without, about half-past eight or twenty minutes to nine o'clock—that is about a mile and a half form the toll-bar—he was walking along when I first saw him, holding up this coat as if exposing it for sale—I asked how he came by it—he said it was his own, and he brought it from Farnham, in Surrey—in the mean time he put the coat on his back, and asked me if I thought it fitted him—I said yes, but I should take him into custody, on suspicion of having stolen it, and keep him till I found the owner; which I did shortly after—he stated nothing more as to how he came by it.</p>

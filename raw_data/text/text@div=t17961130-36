            , but could not find the watch upon her; the prisoner Costelow stood at the end of the watch-house, as a spectator as it were; I had some suspicion in my mind, that she might have it about her; I asked her what she had got in her pockets, she said, nothing; I have no pockets about me; when I went to search her pockets, there was no pocket-hole in her petticoat at all; I put my two hands all round her, and searched her as decent as I could; I saw her hands down a fidgeting between her thighs, which gave me more suspicion she might have the watch about her; at last I put my hand between her thighs, and felt something hard like a watch; I said, what have you got here, she said, nothing; I turned up her outside petticoat, I felt her pocket between her thighs, and something in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in it? - A. His silver watch; I asked her how she came by it, she said, upon my word, Mr. Romley, I don't know how it came there; so I secured her, upon suspicion of her receiving this watch, knowing it to be stolen; the other was charged for stealing of it; Thompson said she stole it; this is the watch I took out of her pocket. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner Costelow say, when you found it? - A. She said, she had it of the prisoner Cooper.</p>
               <p>Costelow. I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Romley. Cooper said, she gave it her to take care of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cooper say how she came by it? - A. Yes; she said she had it of a young man whom she knew very well, that he left it in her hand for half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Costelow in liquor? - A. Perfectly sober; Cooper was rather more in liquor, she had been fighting with Thompson; the prosecutor advertised the watch, by that means I found him.(The watch was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. You felt her sumbling about your person - she had her hands round you? - A. No; the minute she was gone, I had a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Something passed to create a suspicion? - A. I put my hand in my pocket and found it gone.</p>
               <p>Q. She had her hand upon that side? - A. No; I cannot say I felt her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her fumbling about you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the outside coat pocket, she had not her hand far from it? - A. She was close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober? - A. Quite so; I had not drank any thing the whole evening.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Costelow was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I can say no more, I know nothing of the gentleman; three of us women were in the watch-house for this watch; when he came before the Justice, he was asked which he could swear to, he said, he did not know which; with that he looked short at me; if I had been the robber, I should not have stood next to him; the Justice asked him if he knew the number of the watch, he said, no, neither the maker's name nor the number; Romley gave him the watch into his hand to look at it; I never was in company with him, I never saw him before; I have neither father nor mother in the world.</p>
               <p>Costelow was not put on her defence.</p>

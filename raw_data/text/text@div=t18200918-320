I began to suspect all was not right, and pulled my purse out; the prisoner immediately snatched it from me, the candles were put out, and I was told to get down stairs or they would break my neck; I got down with some difficulty, and immediately pointed the house out to the watchman; we went in and I pointed the prisoner out; she was secured, and the purse found in the house, in the room I was robbed in; I described it before I saw it.</p>

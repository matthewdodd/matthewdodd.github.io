The prisoner came into my shop, and asked to look at some silver seals; my apprentice called me down, and informed me the prisoner had something of my property in his pocket. I charged him with it, and he took the silver out of his pocket and put it on the counter; I sent for a constables and gave charge of him. I am sure it was my property; I saw it in the drawer in the morning, but it was then gone. I knew the prisoner before, he was a jeweller.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the last witness. On the 27th of March, the prisoner came in, and desired to look at some silver seals; there was another customer in the shop. Turning round to serve him, I saw the prisoner put something into his pocket, I watched him, and saw him put some more in his pocket; then I jumped over the compter and laid hold of his hands, and called my master down stairs, and he made him take them out of his pocket.</p>

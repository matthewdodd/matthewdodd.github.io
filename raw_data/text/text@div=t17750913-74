            . Upon the 16th of July at half after ten at night, as I was going home to my lodgings, I passed by several girls, the prisoner took hold of my cloaths and insisted upon my giving her something to drink; I thought I would give her some beer; I went into a house in a street near <placeName id="t17750913-74-crimeloc339">Bishopsgate</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was you sober at this time.</p>
               <p>Maltizue. Yes, as sober as I am at present; after she had locked the door, a person came and knocked, I believe it was a woman, and I think the prisoner said, make haste, and then I saw a woman come and put her hand through the window, and take the watch; I attempted to pursue her, but the prisoner held me first, by my cloaths, and then by my legs, till she made her escape; when I had got loose, I went out of the window into the garden after her, and the prisoner threw my hat after me, I never heard of my watch again; I got an officer directly, but could not find the prisoner; the officer took her on Tuesday morning.</p>

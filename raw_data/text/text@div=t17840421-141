               <p>Court. Where are they? - I delivered them to the Assay Master.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Field. Did Mr. Clarke see me do any thing? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Where were the prisoners? - The prisoner Field stood by the window, and Hogg at the table, they was a buckle on the table, and in the window was the stamps and the colouring.</p>

               <p>I am Assay Master to the Goldsmith's Company, I have got the impression of a Lion, and likewise the initials of the workman's name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How came they into your custody? - They were given me by Mr. Clarke, the Lion is passant, the two letters are I. I.</p>
               <p>What else have you? - The spoon, there is the mark of the Lion upon it.</p>
               <p>Is it silver? - No, I think there may be the quantity of one penny weight in a pound of metal, there are five buckles of the same quality, of one penny weight in the pound.</p>
               <p>Is this the Company's mark? - No, but the resemblance that is made in imitation of the Company's mark, might impose upon any one, but those who were critically versed in things of this sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke. These are the same I gave the Assay Master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Had they the appearance more of silver then, than they have now? - Yes, they had much more the appearance of silver then, the air will take off the silver in a very short time.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>About three weeks ago, I met the two prisoners, and they asked me if I could pledge a ring for them, I took the ring from Field, it appeared to be garnets set in gold, they desired me to ask 4 s. for it but the pawnbroker refused to let me have so much upon it, when I came out I told Field, he said damn it, I have something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270141"></xptr> that will do, and he took out a pair of buckles, and went in with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When was this? - It was about a month ago, Field came out and told Hogg he had got seven shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the other prisoner by at that time? - Yes; they asked me if I would drink, I told them I would; they asked me if I would go home with them, I said I would go with them; I went to Hogg's house, and he asked me what I thought of these buckles, Field asked me the same question, I said I did not see them, and I could not say much about them, he said, don't you think they are silver? I said, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Field go with you to Hogg's house? - Yes; my Lord, he then went to the cupboard, and pulled out a piece of rag with two bits of iron, they seemed to be like files; Mr. Field withdrew, and Hogg said I will tell you the use of it, and he made the impression of a lion upon the buckles and upon a spoon, and he said, if I could meet with any metal buckles and bring them to him, he would make it an advantage to me; one of those stamps was broke in the using, and one was shorter than the other, two or three days after I saw them again, and they said if I would call on them, I could do them much service, and it would be an advantage to me, I was to go to Field's house, but that night I went and laid an information in Bow-street, I was sent to Mr. Reynolds, and he sent me to Mr. Clarke, I went to this place some minutes before Mr. Clarke came, I saw the prisoner stamp the mark on some buckles, he made the mark, and then delivered them to Field.</p>
               <p>(The Buckles produced.)</p>
               <p>Are these the buckles you saw him mark? - These are them I saw him mark before I came out, they were all coloured as well as marked, Hogg marked them, and Field rubbed them over to have the appearance of silver, and threw them in water, they desired me to go and fetch an engraver, instead of that I went to Mr. Clarke, as Field did them he let them drop in the pail.</p>
               <p>Did that change the colour? - Yes, it changed them white, I saw two buckles stamped and a spoon, one of the stamps was broke in the marking.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>Was you ever convicted for some offence or other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it for? - It was for an affair where I lived.</p>
               <p>What did the court in that case? - I have been on board the lighter.</p>
               <p>For how long time? - Three years.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - No. 37, Eagle-street.</p>
               <p>- HURD, Pawnbroker, sworn.</p>
               <p>This man came in, and brought a hoop garnet ring.</p>
               <p>Court. You had it from one of the prisoners? - I had, it was from the man in the red coat.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to doubt it was him? - No, it was him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined.</p>
               <p>You say you remember this ring being brought in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not lend any money on it? - No, I tried the ring, and found it was base metal, I said take the ring and go about your business; the buckles were brought me by Field, I verily believe it was him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hogg called four witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Field called four witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Andrews. No, he was not: he found I followed him, and he dodged me, and turned between the coaches; after that he ran down Fleet-street as fast as he could; I ran after him, calling out stop thief: he was stopped at the corner of Fetter-lane; when I came to him two men asked me, what I had lost? I said, my watch. The prisoner said, is it your watch? I said, yes. He had it in his hand, and gave it me immediately [produced in court, and deposed to]; he begged of me to let him go.</p>

Mr. Andrews came up, and said he had lost his watch. The prisoner said, is it yours, sir? Yes, said he; then he immediately gave it him. I and another person held him till a constable was fetched; he was taken to Bridewell that night. The next day before the sitting alderman he said necessity drove him to it.</p>

            . I am constable. A young man came to my house, and told me there was a person taken into custody for stealing a watch. I went, and took him to Bridewell. I said to the prisoner, it is a strange thing you cannot be honest; how came you to take this watch? He said, he did take it, but it was the first time he had ever been guilty of any such thing.</p>

               <p>I was coming by St. Dunstan's Church. There were a great many people coming out of church. I could not get past; I turned back again. When I came out of the mob, I found the watch hanging by my button; it knocked against my thigh. I was obliged to go by the coaches, and run as fast as I could. The gentleman called stop thief. I had the watch in my hand, and said to him, is it yours? He said, it was; so I immediately gave it him.</p>

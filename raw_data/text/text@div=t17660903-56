               <p>Shadrack Waters. I live in Love-lane, near Billingsgate. On the 25th of July I left two kits of salmon on a form, at the corner of <placeName id="t17660903-56-crimeloc300">Billingsgate</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you find it again?</p>
               <p>Waters. When I returned I found it down in my cellar, and the prisoner was in custody.</p>

            . I was leaning over a kit of salmon, being desired to give an eye to these for the prosecutor, I saw the prisoner take one of his kits and walk round the corner with it to Dark-house-lane; he went down the lane as far as the Green Man; then he turned back again, and went down Thames-street with it; I went and took hold of him, near the stationer's shop; I brought the kit back to its place, and took him before a magistrate, and he was committed.</p>

               <p>A woman told me she would give me a groat to carry it into the Borough, but when she found there were a parcel of people got together about me, she got away.</p>

               <p>RICHARD HOUSEMAN. I am married. On the 6th of September, I had been out taking supper, and was returning home at past one o'clock. I met the prisoner near <placeName id="t18250915-127-crimeloc690">Chiswell-street</placeName>

I then put my hand into my waistcoat pocket, and missed a sovereign which I had had there. I then felt in my trousers pocket, and missed a crown piece. I said "You have robbed me;" she said she had not - the watchman was near, and I gave charge of her; she said, in the presence of the watchman, that she had no such thing as a crown about her - she was searched, and a sovereign and some shillings were found, but not the crown piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I met this gentleman in Featherstone-street; he spoke to me first - I then walked towards my own home, and had got the length of two streets - I then heard him walking after me, and some one said, "Stop a bit." I then turned round, and he said I had taken his money; I only said the money I had about me was my own. I did not say I had not a sovereign. Witness. You said several times you had no sovereign at all.</p>

            . I was the watchman. I heard the witness say the prisoner had robbed him of a sovereign and a crown; the prisoner said she had not - she said five times as we were going to the watch-house, that she had no such thing as a sovereign. She was searched by the officer, in my presence, and there was a sovereign, 3 s. 6 d., and some copper found on her.</p>

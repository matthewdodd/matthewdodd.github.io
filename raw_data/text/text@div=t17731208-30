               <p>Mrs. Jordan. The prisoner brought these things to me; she said she was going into the country, and wanted me to keep them for her; I suspected there was something wrong; I thought there might be some quarrel between her and her mistress; I went to her mistress's house, and gave them notice of it.</p>

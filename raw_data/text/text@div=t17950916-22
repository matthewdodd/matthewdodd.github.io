               <p>Q. Who are your partners? - John Farley, &amp;c. In consequence of this man being stopped at Mr. Wiltshire's, I got a search warrant to search his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man employed about your house? - Yes, for four or five years as an extra <rs id="t17950916-22-deflabel119" type="occupation">waiter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950916-22-defend273 t17950916-22-deflabel119"></join>, he used to be employed sometimes two or three days in a week, more or less as the occasion required, he was employed, and I believe, he was the day before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not discharged from his occasional employment at the time of his being apprehended? - No, he was not; he was sent out once or twice from the house, being in liquor. Mr. Wiltshire had the search warrant, and I went with Mr. Wiltshire to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were his lodgings? - In Welsted-street, Sumer's Town.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there did you see any thing of him? - No; he was in custody on Mr. Wiltshire's charge.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know this to he the prisoner's lodgings? - The woman is here that he lodges with. I found five napkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Who executed the search warrant? - The officer of Bow-street; he is here, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find these napkins? - In the apartment; the prisoner's wife was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know her before this time? - I did not. Some of the napkins were made up in child's clothes, and some into a cloak apparently for a woman. Those that were not made up were found in the front room; the doiley was in the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were not made up? - Three. The constable brought the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to speak of your own knowledge to the napkins that were made up, as being your property? - Yes; they are marked with our usual mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I always take a clean napkin along with me to bring home the broken victuals in.</p>
               <p>Witness. We always give every occasional waiter the broken victuals.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow them to bring home the broken victuals in your napkins? - No.</p>

When the waiter comes to pay the half crown he always asks for the cloth, and I give him my cloth; and if he has given me one of Mr. Bleaden's cloths I cannot say for that; and the last two days I was at work at Mr. Bleaden's I had no cloth of my own, and the waiter lent me one.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you know they were the prisoner's lodgings? - Only as informed by Mr. Bleaden and the other gentleman that went with me. I found the woman up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You of course did not know that woman before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you search? - The back and front garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the habitation of the prisoner? - Yes; I was informed so by the landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find there? - These things that I have now to produce.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them all in one room or in different rooms? - I believe most of them in one room, if not all.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they? - Napkins and one doiley.</p>
               <p>Q. Any things made out of napkins? - Yes, a child's cloak and a bed gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these things shewn to the prisoner afterwards? - None of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These are the napkins that I was to bring back to Mr. Bleadon's waiters, they gave them me to take home the broken victuals with; and I always made a rule for my wife to wash them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you let lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have known him these eight years; he has lodged with me a twelve-month the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did he lodge in? - The two garrets, one at the front and the other at the back.</p>
               <p>Q. What family had he in your house? - A wife and two children.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when Mr. Bleaden came with the officers to search his apartments? - Yes, I was at home then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up with them to the apartment? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them what apartments the prisoner lodged in? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any thing was found or produced? - I keep an haberdasher's shop, and I was below in that apartment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Woollivant knows nothing ill of my character? - I never heard any thing against his character before in my life, and I was quite surprised when I heard this account.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Two of the napkins I can swear to by the stamp of Bleaden and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any number on the napkins? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. As to these napkins having been in your house any particular time preceding this is impossible for you to speak to? - That I cannot say, for we lose such quantities it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how long you have had these napkins? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160072"></xptr>Q. Can you say they were lost a twelve month before this time or less? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a doiley, is that in the same situation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been employed about your house? - I believe about four or five years, sometimes two or three days in a week. I particularly know the child's skirt, it is made up of napkins; here is my marks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never took any thing out of the house without asking my employer, the waiter. As for some of the things made up, my wife bought the things of a person that came round the place. The last time I was working there, the last two days I had no cloth, I asked Mr. Thorn, Mr. Bleaden's head waiter, if he would let me have a cloth to carry home my supper with? and if I get a cloth of any person where I work I always take it back again the next time I go. It is possible I might make a mistake and change my own napkins for one of Mr. Bleaden's; some times we are not sent home till one or two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

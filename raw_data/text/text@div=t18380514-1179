                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Roberts, and live at No. 4, Brunswick-street, Crown-street On the 2nd of April I went to purchase some things in a shop—I took out my purse, in which I had one sovereign, one half—sovereign, one half-crown, and one shilling; after paying for the articles I put the purse into my pocket—I pulled my hand out, and the prisoner put his hand in—I felt his hand in my pocket, I turned round, caught him by the arm, and never loosed him till I gave him in charge of the policeman—I saw my purse in his hand—he dragged me out of the shop, and pulled me up to a boy—whether he gave him the purse I cannot tell, but I saw it in his hand, and he had not got it when I gave him in charge.</p>

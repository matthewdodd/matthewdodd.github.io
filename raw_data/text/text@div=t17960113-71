               <p>Q. Have you seen any thing of a bonnet, a muslin apron, and a muslin cravat? - A. Yes; I was present when they were found; we went first to Bow-street, with the prisoner King, and then to Jones's, at No. 6, Old Belton-street, Long-Acre, he rents the first floor front room, and found these: one cravat, one apron, and a bonnet; I did not see the constable take the cravat, nor the apron; I saw them in the room, but I did not see him find them; I saw him take the bonnet out of the bed; this was on Tuesday the first of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jones at home at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how these things came there? - A. Not then, he wanted to go to dinner; I went to the landlady of the house, the landlord was very ill, the landlady said Jones was the person that rented the room.</p>

               <p>I live in King-street, Seven-dials: On Thursday the 26th of November, about two o'clock, I went to a two pair of stairs window, I lodge opposite the prosecutor's house, I was accidentally at the window; I saw Susannah King standing by a post, about twenty yards from Platten's door; about twenty minutes after that, I observed a woman coming out of Platten's house, with a large bundle in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say who that was? - A. It was the prisoner Crompton.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her by sight before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Susannah King by sight before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such an opportunity of observing their faces, at that time, so as to know her again; - A. Yes; for I never took my eyes from King till I saw Crompton coming out of Platten's door; I looked after them, and saw them go away together up King-street; I saw her side face very distinctly as she stood by the post; and Crompton had a bonnet on, the other had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to speak to one another? - A. Yes; I saw them at Bow-street on the Tuesday after; I knew them again immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them again, and say if you have any doubt that the two prisoners are the persons you saw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What the bundle contained you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You seem a pretty positive witness; have you ever been a witness before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were up in the two pair of stairs window, and Crompton had a bonnet on, and just coming along the street; and four days after, you positively swear that was the person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You continued twenty minutes at the window, though you went there by accident; you seem to have had a great deal of idle time upon your hands; do you often do so? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to swear positively to them? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know this was the room of the prisoner, and not of the two old women? - A. Mr. Platten told me it was: as soon as I got into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130117"></xptr>room, I told King, I had got a search warrant; and, I asked her to let me look at her pockets: in which I found a duplicate of a pair of nankeen breeches; upon which I searched about the room, and found, two aprons and a cravat, in a box without a lock; it was not locked, however; I asked her where she got these things; she told me, she got them from

               <p>Q. Did you go to the pawnbroker's? - A. Yes; No.22, Bridges-street, Covent-garden; I went to order up the pawnbroker, by the Magistrate's direction; the master said, his man was upon a trial, or something of that sort, but he was out; I went the second time, with Mr. Platten, to the pawnbroker's, they produced the breeches, and Mr. Platten knew them to be his: when the second examination was, the pawnbroker brought forth some other articles; a coat, and two shirts.</p>

               <p>Q. Where are Crompton's lodgings? - A. I found her at Jones's room, and two or three more were in the room; I asked Crompton, to let me look at her pockets, which I did; and found no duplicates, that could lead to any discovery; I then searched the room, and found a black silk bonnet, a cravat, and an apron; the apron, I found somewhere about the bed; the cravat, I found, I believe, upon a table; and, I believe, the bonnet was upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether it was or not? - A. I cannot rightly recollect but, I believe, it was somewhere about the bed; I think, the bed was turned up, and it laid behind it; I could not find any thing else; and, then, I said, I must take Crompton and Jones, with me, to the office.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you locked the door in the morning, when you went up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing in that box was taken? - A. Yes; every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any part of your things again? - A. Yes; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of the prisoners before this? - A. No; I went with the constable, to search the prisoner's (King's) room, in Monmouth-court; my husband, and the constable, were with me; she was in the room, and her mother, and some other people; there were two aprons found; one in a box, another on the bed; and the neck-cloth in the box; the constable found a duplicate in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they any part of what you had lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the things produced at the pawnbroker's? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear to them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Crompton's room was not searched, was it? - A. Yes; in Old Belton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a different room from the prisoner Jones's, or is it the same? - A. The same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jones there? - A. Yes; the woman, and Jones, were there; we found a bonnet upon the bed; between the bed and the sacking, a musslin apron, in the bed, in the same place; the neck<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130118"></xptr>cloth was upon the table; Crompton was ironing at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. She was supposed to have lived with Jones, at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p> - ALLEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Sienesi, in Bridges-street, Covent-garden: On Thursday, the 26th of November, the two women, prisoners at the bar, came to our shop, in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they are the same two women? - A. Yes; they had been at our shop before; the middle one, Crompton, pledged, with me, a blue coat, for 12s.; a pair of breeches, for 1s. 6d.; a shirt, 2s.; and, a shirt, 3s. in the name of Hannah Jordan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her any questions, how she came by them? - A. I asked her if it was her own property; she said, it was; the other prisoner only stood by at the time she pledged these articles; the officers came to me, with the duplicate of the breeches, and I produced them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You said, in the afternoon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, by that, between twelve and one o'clock? - A. No; after that.(A coat, two shirts, and a pair of breeches, were produced in Court, by the pawnbroker, and deposed to by the prosecutor).(The two aprons, and cravat, found at King's lodgings, were deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. As to the bonnet and the two cravats, they appear to be very old: what are they worth? - A. It was new made up; it cost me 1s. 6d. making up, about a fortnight before, and I found the stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. At present, as they are produced, you will not undertake to swear, that they are worth a shilling? - A. I don't think it is worth more; when it was stolen from me, it was worth 4s. 6d.; some of the ribbands are taken off.</p>
               <p>King's defence. A woman, of the name of Jordan, came up to me, on Thursday, about half after three o'clock; she told me, she had come from Elizabeth Crompton's husband, from on board of ship; she asked me, if I could tell her where to find

            ; I went to her brother's, in Short's Gardens, and called her, on the stairs; and she came down; the gentlewoman said, she had given me trouble, and asked me to go and have something to drink; we went to Queen-street, and had part of two pots of beer; when we had sat a bit, she said, she was very sick, would we accept of relith of any thing to eat; we went to a butcher's, in Earl-street, and she got a pound of beef steaks; we had them fried; and, after we had had something to eat, and another pot of beer, she asked Elizabeth Crompton to pawn some things for her; accordingly she went to the pawnbroker's, and asked me, if I would go with her, which I did; and we returned the woman the money back again, and the tickets; we had a glass of pepper-mint at the bar, a piece, and she wished us a very good night; she said, she wanted to buy a few things, in Monmouth-street; she went and bought some things, and Crompton and I went with her; she made Crompton a present of these old aprons, and then Elizabeth Crompton gave me the two aprons, and the old cravat.</p>
               <p>Crompton's defence. I have no more to say than what she has said; no further, than when the gentlewoman came up into Mr. Jones's room, I was ironing; and Mrs. Jones was not within at the time; I went up to Mr. Jones's to beg the favour to let me wash a few things, as my husband was on board of ship; his daughter gave me her consent to wash a few things, and I was ironing them at the time; she said, if I could do them before her father came in, I was very welcome to do them; Mrs. Jordan gave me the bonnet, and I wore it for three days; Mr. Jones knows nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Jones's defence. I wish to ask the constable, and the pawnbroker, and that other woman, what they said before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. We have that in writing, and they have declared the same now as they did then.(The prisoner jones called fix witnesses, who all gave him a good character).</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. I would wish to ask him whether he took my clothes away or not out of the room; he says, he found the spoon in my pocket; he took my clothes out of the room while I was a bed? - A. We found them in his pocket, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190036"></xptr>he was in bed, he saw us take them out; his clothes had not been taken out of the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. They took my clothes out of the room, and brought them back again, and said, I had stolen two spoons; I know nothing of them; I happened to he drunk, and that serjeant enlisted me; it is all out of spite; the captain approved of me, and they took me before a Justice, in Queen-square. and he would not swear me in, because he said I was drunk, and wished me to go to bed; they took the clothes out of the room when I went to bed, and, in the course of an hour or two, told me I had taken the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hazard.) Did he go to bed before the property was found upon him? - A. That part of the spoon was taken out of his pocket before he went to bed. <rs id="t17990619-29-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

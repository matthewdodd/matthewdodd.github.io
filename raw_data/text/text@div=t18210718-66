On the 6th of July, I went out about eight o'clock in the morning, and left nobody in the house. I returned about four o'clock, and found the key behind the door, where I generally put it - it was a coach-house, and our rooms are over it; the stair-case leads from the stables up to the rooms. I had locked the stable door, the goods were up in the rooms. I had left the room door unlocked, and not shut, I believe - the stable and coach-house door were locked. I lost the articles stated in the indictment; we found the prisoner next day at the White Hart, public-house, Battle-bridge, fast asleep; Davis took him to the watch-house; he lived with us four months before this, and up to the time, he used to take care of the place; he gave the duplicates to Davis, and said he sold the looking glass to a broker, at the bottom of Old-street, by the turnpike.</p>

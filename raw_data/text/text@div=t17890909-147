            .</p>
               <p>I am eleven years old.</p>
               <p>Can you say your catechism? - Not exactly.</p>
               <p>Do you know you must swear true? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What will be done to you if you swear false? - Go to the naughty man.</p>
               <p>Do you know that you are liable to be punished here in a Court of Justice, if you swear false? - No.</p>
               <p>But do you think if I should tell you you are liable to be punished here, if you swear any thing that is false, that you would? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Sworn. I know the prisoner, his name is Mr. Noble; I was in the room when my mother was ill in bed; the prisoner came there, it was on a Monday, the 3d of August, about half after twelve in the day; I was in the room when Mr. Noble came in; my mother was in bed just before he came in; my mother was asking me what it was o'clock, I said it wanted but five minutes to twelve; I looked at the watch, which was hanging at the side of the fire place; I can tell what it is o'clock when I look.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that clock? - It wants two minutes to twelve.</p>
               <p>Look again; (put her on the table)? - It wants six minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at my watch? - It wants a quarter.</p>
               <p>Court. Wrong in every instance.</p>
               <p>The prisoner knocked at the door; he had a great stick, thicker than my arm, and three horns at the top of it, I opened it; my mother told me to open it; she asked me who it was? I said, Mr. Noble; she told me to tell him to come in, and he came in; and he said, O Christ Mrs. Knight, what a shocking situation you are in; and he asked my mother if she would have any peppermint; and my mother said, she could not touch nothing, if it was ever so; and he said, ever so many wicked words to her, that she should have some, and so he insisted upon it; and so I went and fetched a cream jug out of the closet; and he gave me some money, one shilling, and told me to get a quartern of peppermint; I was not two minutes gone, for I had heard he was so very wicked a man; I was afraid he would kill my mother, or do something wrong.</p>
               <p>If you was afraid he would kill your mother, you could not have prevented him? - No, but I was not sure; when I came back he asked me if there was not a man waiting for him; I said, I did not see any body; he said he expected a man, for he was going to Hampstead the next day to do a job; then he said, there was a man waiting at the corner for him; then directly as he drank the peppermint, he went away; and directly as he was gone my mother told me to run and make an alarm, because he had taken my daddy's watch; and I did not know what an alarm meant, and I ran after him; I did not make an alarm; my mammy told me when I came back what an alarm is; so that I know now; I ran up the fields towards Hampstead; my mother lives No. 2,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090191"></xptr>Cleveland-street, at the top of the rope walk, between London-street and Clipstone-street; it is near the fields; Mr. Strickland and Mr. Howison live next door; their houses join ours; it is a row with ten houses on one side; I was afraid my mother did not want people to know of it, because I thought she did not want my father to know of it; I ran after him to ask him to give me the watch; I told nobody; he never used my mother ill that I know of; I do not know that they ever had any quarrel, or my father and him; It was a large silver watch, with a solid silver trinket, with a seal in it; there was one silver seal, with a red stone in it, and some flower; there was a little cradle, a trinket.</p>

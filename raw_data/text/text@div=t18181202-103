On the 23d of November the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at a gold ring. I showed her one; she said it was too small; she put it on her finger with the string on; she said it hurt her; she pulled it off with her teeth, and said it was too tight, and gave me another out of her mouth, which was brass. I am certain it was not the one I gave her. I immediately charged her with taking the gold ring, and giving me a brass one. I sent for an officer, who searched her, and found the gold ring on her, with the string to it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to Mr. Cotton's, who produced a brass ring. I asked the prisoner where the gold ring was? She repeatedly denied having any ring. I took her into a back room, and asked her to give me her pockets. She said she would not; but she would empty them, which she pretended to do. I was not satisfied. At last I made her give me her pockets, and the gold ring fell out.</p>

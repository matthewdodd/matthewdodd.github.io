In a minutes time the boys came down, they went to the coffee-house opposite, then they ran across to our shop, I saw them pull at it, which took it I cannot say, the little one ran up the Hay-market, the biggest with the watch down Pall-mall, I caught him by the collar and threw him down with force upon his face and he had the watch in his hand, the other ran up the Hay-market; which took it out I cannot say, they were both trying at it, I saw both their hands in the window, Lewis had a long wire inside his coat.</p>

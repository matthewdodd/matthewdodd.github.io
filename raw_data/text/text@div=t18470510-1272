                  </hi>. I am a leather-seller and slipper-manufac<lb></lb>turer, and live at No. 8, Old Gravel-lane. On Sunday morning, the 25th of April, nine Germans arrived from Germany, on their way to New York—they came to lodge at my house—there were a great many Germans them✗—I spoke to Mr. Ireland, and I saw the two prisoners in his parlour✗ and they made an agreement with nine German emigrants to take them on✗ to New York—M'Lean said he was the agent, and Gardner was the captain of the barque <hi rend="italic">Recovery</hi>—Gardner said he was the captain, and he would auls✗ 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a head from the emigrants to take them to New York—Gardner made the agreement, and M'Lean wrote the agreement, and told them the usual prac<lb></lb>tice✗ was to play 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, when they got on board to pay the remaindy✗—I saw all those nine persons pay Garden 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—they were julirs✗ Mendel, Emanuel Moritz, Joseph Rothschild, Isaack Guelder, Fanny roths✗ child, Ferdinand Haas, Sarah Klemberg, Joseph Keller, and Sarah Morits<lb></lb>not one of them could speak English—I explained to them, before they parted with the money, the situation of the prisoners, that Gardner was the captain of the ship <hi rend="italic">Recovery</hi>, and that M'Lean was the agent—they told me so, and I told the emigrants so—I saw the money paid—it was some French✗ money, and some Dutch money—M'Lean and Gardner asked me the worth✗ of it, and they took it—I did not ask Gardner that night where he lived—I did another day—I asked him for his card—he said he had not got a printed card—he said he lived at No. 16, King-street, Tower-hill—I said I knew that Mr. Williams, a provision-merchant, lived there—Gardner said✗ it was a mistake—I went to Mr. Williams', and found Gardner did not live✗ there—I went back to Mr. Ireland's, and said, "I suppose this is only a swindle"—the prisoners afterwards came to Mr. Ireland's house—I went to them, and said, "Give these emigrants their money back, I think everything will be settled"—they refused—Gardner said, "I did not touch the money, M'Lean took the money"—I said, "You gave them a receipt, not M'Lean; they have to do with you now, not M'Lean"—M'Lean said, "Did I promise you!"—I said, "Gardner promised to take them to New York"—I am quite sure Gardner was represented as the captain, and M'Lean as the agent—they took these people on board, and showed them a ship, but I was not at home at the time.</p>

Mr. Rosenubaum told me there were some emigrants arrived, and he wanted to ship them off as there was such a number of them—I had known M'Lean two or three years off and on, acting as a shipping agent—I spoke to him—he said he would do what he could, and on the Thursday night I saw him and Gardner and the emigrants in my parlour—I did not hear anything pass between them—I afterwards went to the barque <hi rend="italic">Recovery</hi> because Rosen<lb></lb>baum seemed to signify there was something wrong—I inquired for Captain Gardner—I found there was no such person—M'Lean had brought Gardner to my house—he had a glass or two of porter, and I said to him, "I hope when I come on board your ship I shall have some wine, better then porter"—I said that because he had represented himself as captain of the barque <hi rend="italic">Recovery</hi>—he did so in the presence of M'Lean, who had brought him there—I had a box in my charge, but it is in charge of the police now—M'Lean gave it to my son while I was gone on board the <hi rend="italic">Recovery</hi>—M'Lean said to my son, in my presence, "There is money in the box, I must have it back."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gardner's Defence.</hi> I called on M'Lean on Saturday evening, the 24th of April; he mentioned having a number of passengers, and I thought it would suit my purpose; I called on a corn merchant in the City, and asked if he would join a charter party to transport these emigrants; he said it was a de<lb></lb>viation from his business, but if it would further my views he had no object<lb></lb>tion; I turned my attention to a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Recovery</hi>; I commissioned Mr. M'Lean to call on the owner, and from what he said I was of opinion she could be chartered; on the Monday I was at Mr. Ireland's, Rosenbaum came in, and I named having a vessel about to proceed to New York; Rosenbaum asked, "What will you take these passengers for?" I named 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said, "What commission will you allow me?" I think I said 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said he was in the habit of having 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Phillips and Tiplady, if I would give him the same he would give me the preference; I agreed to it, and he seemed anxious✗</p>

               <p>that they should see the vessel; I, knowing they wanted to get away, called on a friend, a shipwright, and asked him to walk on board and give me as estimate of what it would come to, to fit it up, in case the charter-party came to a close; they left me about eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning, and agreed to meet me at Mr. Ireland's at three o'clock; I met them, and instead of paying the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was agreed that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid then, and the remainder when they were on board; it made no difference to me, knowing I had a re<lb></lb>sponsible party to join me in the charter; they paid 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the money was put into the box, and after stopping a short time, Mr. Rosenbaum and his daughter asked me to leave an agreement with them, as they might get more passen<lb></lb>gers; I did so, and the next morning I made an arrangement to proceed to Mr. Ireland's; I went to his house about one o'clock on the Wednesday; I left a message that I was on business in the corn-market, and should be back at three o'clock; I returned, and saw Mr. M'lean; I left him full power in negotiate anything that might occur; I called at Mr. Ireland's again in the evening; I was taken into custody; I have not had opportunity to get a solicitor; under these circumstances I applied to traverse my trail, and had his Lordship granted my request I should have had not only a solicitor but a Counsel; I have been a master and owner of a ship the last three years; I commanded a ship for Mr. Soames in 1844.</p>

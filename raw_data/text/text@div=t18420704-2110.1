I was called about half-past twelve or one o'clock, on the 11th of June—I found the prose<lb></lb>cutor lying on the floor at the Swan—there was a wound made with a sharp instrument on the left side of the abdomen—it had penetrated about two inches—it bad taken an oblique direction, or most probably it would have caused his death at once—this knife is a part of instrument that would be likely to make such a wound.</p>

On the 27th of September, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with another young man, who asked to look at some coloured shirts; I showed them a great many - the prisoner brought in a bag- neither of them bought any thing; while I was showing the shirts I had seen the prisoner sweeping the gloves off the counter into his bag - his companion held the shirts before him, to conceal him; I took no notice - they said none of the shirts would do; the prisoner said he would call to-morrow, and have a dozen or two, and said, "We want a pair of stockings;" they bought one pair, which the prisoner paid for, and when they got to the door I jumped over the counter, and collared the prisoner - he slipped out of his coat, and ran out, across the road; I pursued, and caught him by the cravat - we had a struggle; I brought him into the shop, and on opening the bag there were fifteen pairs of gloves in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Are you sure he is the man who had the bag? A. I waited to see how many he would take - he kept sweeping them into his bag- nobody else was in the shop; I saw him sweeping them into his bag.</p>

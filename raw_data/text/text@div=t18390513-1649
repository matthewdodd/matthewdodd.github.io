On the 1st of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Drury-lane—I saw the prisoner and another following a gentleman, and trying his pocket; and just as he got opposite a shop the prisoner went and got his handkerchief half out—the gentleman then went into the road, as there was a crowd; and when he had got about five yards further, he came on the pavement—the prisoner then went and got the handkerchief out—he turned down a street, and the other one who was with him whistled—I told an officer—we followed and took the prisoner—there were six or seven hundred people there looking at the sweeps—I do not know who the gentleman was.</p>

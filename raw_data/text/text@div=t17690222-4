               <p>I put my wife in the hospital some days before this happened. I had no fire at home, and no place to get my victuals. I went to a public house; there were two men drinking: one of them I had seen before, but not the other. I drank share of a pot or two of bear along with them. They went away and bid me good night. I had a pennyworth of purl after that; they came again, in about three quarters of an hour, and brought two bundles of clothes. They asked me if I had any place where they could leave their bundles till the morrow; I said I had. I carried them up stairs, and put them into my room. On the morrow one of the men came, and tied up one of the suits of clothes in two handkerchiefs. I thought I would go and carry my wife a little wine. The man asked me if I would take the suit of clothes and pawn them for him; I told him I was too weak, I was not able to carry them. I had laid in bed four days before that, Mrs. M'Cardell knows.</p>
               <p>M'Cardell. He had been very ill; it was the goal distemper; he had been in Newgate. He kept his bed a day or two; I cannot say positively how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out on the 11th of January?</p>
               <p>M'Cardell. He did, and came home with a parcel at night between nine and ten. He was very dirty and very fatigued, and said he was very tired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come with him?</p>
               <p>E. M'Cardell. No. I did not see him till he came down to light his candle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The two men came with me to the door with the clothes, one of them went with me to the pawnbroker's, and bid me go in and pawn them for 30 s. I went in, and asked 30 s. upon them, and they stop me. I do not know where they had the clothes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The shirts had been thrown out of the window; they were all dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think one man could break the window, and do it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I think one man might, the weight of the things are not so heavy, but one man might carry them with ease.</p>

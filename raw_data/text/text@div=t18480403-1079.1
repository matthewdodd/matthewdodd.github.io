                  </hi> I live at 104, St. John's-wood-terrace, and am a widow—I employed the prisoner as charwoman. On 31st Jan. I went out to dinner in Hamilton-terrace, leaving her alone in the house to take charge of it—I had a box under my bed, which contained five sovereigns—it was not locked, but the room door was—Ihad seen them safe a day or two befort—I missed them on the following Monday, 3rd Jan., and also a half-sove<lb></lb>reign, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a drawer—I said to the prisoner when I missed it, "I am afraid I lost some money from my drawer yesterday, it was in my drawer when I went to chapel"—she said, "Was it?"—I said, "Yes, and I cannot think where it is"—she said she was sorry I had lost it, and wondered who had stolen it—she said she believed it to be a young gentleman that lodged in the house—she afterwards said. "I think you will find it, you have not lost it"—she assisted me to look for it the whole of theweek—in consequence of something that happened three weeks afterwards, I sent for a constable, and went to her house in Tottenham-place—I told her I believed she had robbed me of a brooch, and money, and other articles; and I believed she was the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a goldsmith. The prisoner has been in my employment some years—I have missed large amounts of gold—on the 16th of September I required some gold that was in the prisoner's pos<lb></lb>session—I caused his drawer to be opened by the foreman, and missed nearly two ounces—I was satisfied he must have taken it from his drawer, and sent for him—he was absent from home—I sent a message that be must come to me immediately, and on the Sunday he came—I was in the workshop—I said he had stolen the gold—he said he had not—I still persisted in the charge, and said he had stolen some rings—he said he had one ring, and he pulled it from his pocket—I said he had done very wrong as I had missed a considerable quantity of property, and would give him into custody—I said I knew he had pawned part of it, and had sold some to refiners—he then admitted part of it was pawned, and I asked for the tickets—he said they were at home with his wife—he begged very hard that I would let him go, and said he could make it right—I said he must go before the Court—I sent for my foreman, and to him he confessed something—I sent for an officer and gave him in charge—the wife gave seven or eight duplicates to the officer—the prisoner said he was in distress, and took it intending to return it—he had been with me nearly five years—I have lost seven or eight ounces of gold in a fortnight.</p>

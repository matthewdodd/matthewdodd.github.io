            . I am servant to Mr. Black, pawnbroker, No. 62, Myddleton-street - the prisoner pawned a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200072"></xptr>musical snuff-box with me, on the 16th of December, for 15s. - it was redeemed, on the 19th, by a person who brought the duplicate - I do not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you certain the prisoner pawned it? A. Yes - I did not know him before - it was about five o'clock in the evening - I do not recollect whether other persons were in the shop; if there had been, I should have recollected - I cannot say positively there were not - we have an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the person pawning it go outside to inquire, apparently, of a person who had sent him, to know if he was to take what you offered him? A. I think he did - I think he said he would ask the owner if he would take so little.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known the prisoner, to speak to him? A. I had - I gave him nothing for the duplicate - he asked if I wanted to purchase such a thing - I said, "No" - he said, "If you will purchase it, the money will be of great service to me" - I said, "I do not think it will sell well" - he said, "I will leave the duplicate with you - you can redeem it, and look at it, and it can be pawned again if you do not like it; and I did redeem it, but never saw him again till he was at Hatton-garden - I have spoken to him more than five or six times - he was in a situation in the neighbourhood - I am a hair-dresser, and so is Heard - I have known Heard seven years - I never saw him with the snuff-box.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. How long did you have it repaired before you gave it up to the policeman? A. It came home on the Saturday night; and on Monday, about two o'clock, I took it to the station-house, and gave it to the superintendent - when it was left with me, I found it would not play, and tried to pawn it to get my money back, and could not, and thought by having it repaired I should be able to get my money back - it has cost me 22s.</p>

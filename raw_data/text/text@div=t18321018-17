            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's son; the prisoner came to the shop the latter end of March - I made a memorandum of it at the time, but have not got it - I am sure it was after the 20th of March, and before the 5th of April; he asked me to change him some shillings of George the Fourth, for another coinage of the same reign; I took out a bag, in which was 3l. in silver and a sovereign; he turned over the shillings and changed some, and the moment he was gone, I counted the money, and missed a sovereign, which I am sure was there when he came in; I did not see him again till the 4th of October - I am certain he is the person; the sovereign was my father's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was in his house in March, and never stole any money from him; he produced his book at the examination, and said it was the 15th of March, and it was found to have been put down the day before.</p>

            . On the 9th of February, I met with two shopmates, who persuaded me to go to a public-house in Crown-street, St. Giles'; when I was there I said I had but sixpence, as I wished to deny my half-sovereign - my shopmate said, "I will give you a toss which of us shall pawn our jacket," and so we did; he pawned his jacket for a shilling-we had some bread and cheese and beer; then my other shopmate said, "Take my rule, and you pawn your jacket;" he gave them to this prisoner to pawn - I said, "I can pawn them myself;" my shopmate said, "She can carry them under her cloak:" I afterwards went home to her lodgings, to have some tea, where I found another woman; when I got there she had got fish and potatoes - she said, "Come, send for some beer;" I gave the other woman a shilling, and she brought some beer and change - the prisoner made a grasp at the change; I did not like such behaviour, and said, "Come, give me the sixpence," and while I was grasping at the money in her hand, I found her other hand in my righthand pocket, where my half-sovereign was, which had been there safe while the other girl was gone for the beer- I let go of the halfpence to take hold of her hand; I had never quitted the room: I then came down, and found my shopmates waiting below - I told them to stop there; I went to the patrol, who said he did not like to come by himself; the officer afterwards came, and he took her.</p>

            . I am a patrol. The witness came to me about half-past six o'clock, but we did not know whether we might go; I met the officer afterwards, and found the prisoner in bed with her clothes one - we took her to the watch-house, but found no money on her but sixpence and a few halfpence; the man appeared to have his senses - the prisoner said he wanted to go with her for 6d., that she would not let him, and he went down stairs.</p>

I went to have half a pint of beer, and went to the fire to warm it; one of the men said,"Don't stand before the fire;" they then tossed, and the prosecutor had to pawn his waistcoat - another man who was there took a rule out of his pocket, and said, "This will make 3s., and got a bit of straw to rub it up, and he said, "This young woman will take it for you;" I said, "I will carry it under my clock;" we went down to a pawnbroker's in Holborn - I gave him the articles, and he went in with them; I heard him ask 2s. for them - he then came out, and said, "Come and let us have a drop of gin to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190020"></xptr>ourselves;" the two men had been watching us, and they came into the same public-house; the prosecutor then said"Make it up half a pint" - he then said, "I will go, out of aggravation, and have a pot or two of beer;" I said," I must go home:" the men then said, "We will go wherever she goes, and have a pot or two of beer;" they then all went to the White Bear public-house, and had two or three pots of beer - I said, "I shall go home;" the prosecutor then said to me, "Where do you live?" I said, "It is nothing to you" - I went home, and just as I got up stairs I saw him coming up the stairs; the other two men were at the bottom - I said, "I don't want you to follow me:" he sent a young woman for a pot of beer, and gave her a sixpence, which he said was all the money he had; he shewed a handfull of duplicates, and said he had parted with all these things that week: the girl brought in a pot of beer; the prosecutor then pretended to go to sleep - he said he should like to go to bed; I said, "You cannot, for I expect my husband home;" he said, "I will give you what you please to sleep with that young woman;" I said,"You cannot do any thing of that kind here" - he then shut the door, and said, "I will not go out to-night;" I called up the other men, and said, "I wish you would take this man away;" the prosecutor said, "If you will lend me a collar I will pawn my shirt, and get 3s. upon it;" he said, "I have a few halfpence, and I must have a drop of gin before I go;" he then took off his waistcoat, to take his shirt off - I said, "You shall not do any thing of the sort here;" he then swore he would make me suffer for it - he walked out, and had us taken up, but he did not come for near an hour, and we had laid down; I had had two or three drops of gin, and some beer - it had overcome me; I heard a knock at the door, and I got up - the officer said, "Here's a pretty concern here;" the beer still stood on the table, and I said, "Did you come back for your beer - here it is;" I then said, "Does he want his sixpence?" the officer said, "No, it is a half-sovereign:" the prosecutor then came in, and said, "Take that woman."</p>

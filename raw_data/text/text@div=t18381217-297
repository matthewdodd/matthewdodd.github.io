                  </hi>. I am a wholesale butcher, and live in Whitechapel, in the parish of St. Botolph without Aldgate. The prisoner has been in my service about eight months—on Saturday, the 8th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, I went to my wife and family into the country, leaving the prisoner in charge of every thing—I returned on the Monday following, and found she had left the house—she had given me no notice whatever—we imme<lb></lb>diately examined the house, and found all the plate gone—I went to the secretaire and book-case, and missed 2 £5 notes, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, which had been placed there on the Friday evening, and in the prisoner's room were three chests, one of which was quite emptied—the lock of one box was hampered—other things were gone.</p>

I pursued him, he ran away as hard as he could run; finding he was close pursued, he jumped into Bow-creek, which is twenty-three feet water, and swam over with his clothes on, I stripped and jumped after him, when I came up to him, I told him to stop, he directly put his hand into his pocket and pulled out this knife; I did not hear what he said, the wind was the wrong way, he held it towards me, I cried out stop thief! and

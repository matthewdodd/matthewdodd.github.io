               <p>Ynur Lloyd thus depos'd. About one o'clock last Saturday Morning, the Prisoner pick'd me up in Fleet street, and carried me to a House in <placeName id="t17260711-31-crimeloc137">Shoe Lane</placeName>

I was confoundedly next, and knew not what Course to take. At last I told the Watch of it, and desired them to stop such a Woman if they met her. They said there were a great many Baudy Houses thereabouts, and they'd go with me and Search them. So they got the Constable, and we went together; - We presently came to one of them, and knockt at the Door; it was a long time before we got them to open it, but when we came in, the second Person that I saw was the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in her Defence, said that she never saw the Prosecutor in her Life, till he came and took her out of that House, where she went to receive a little Money that was due to her. That he was so drunk that he could not stand, and sometimes said that he had lost more Money, and sometimes less. <rs id="t17260711-31-verdict138" type="verdictDescription">

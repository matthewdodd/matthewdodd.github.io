On Friday afternoon, the 23d of September, Miles came and asked if the kitchen chimney might be swept next morning, as it was time we had it done - it was usually done once a month, and that he always did it; I asked if they were the right people - he said, Yes: my master was out; it was agreed they should come next morning. He came with a boy about a quarter past five o'clock - the boy went up the chimney; Miles held up the cloth: there was a knock at the door - Miles asked me to let his young master in; I went up, leaving him alone, and let Robinson in; he came down. Soon after the boy came down the chimney. and they sent him to another house; after they had taken up the soot, Robinson asked me to let Miles out with the bag, which I did, and then he went. After they were gone, at eight o'clock, I missed five silver spoons from the kitchen cupboard, which had the key left in it; I had asked if they came from Mr. Bentley, our sweeper - they said, Yes; both the prisoners were present then - they never came to be paid. The spoons were safe the night before - nobody but them had been in the kitchen.</p>

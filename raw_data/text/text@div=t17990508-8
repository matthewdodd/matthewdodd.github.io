               <p>Q. This cellar is part of your house, I suppose? - A. It is under the house; I was going to shut the flap down, when I perceived something move at the bottom of the cellar stairs; when I stepped down stairs, the prisoner turned round, and said, Michael; I laid hold of the prisoner, he had some broaches of candles in his hand; I brought him into the shop, and while I went to fasten the flap, he attempted to make his escape; I missed five pounds out of the place, and there were three pounds lying at the bottom of the stairs, which I saw the prisoner throw down with the broaches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was day-light one? - A. It was dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discern a person's face or buttons? - A. Yes; when he turned round, and said, Michael, I saw it was a man; when I brought him into the shop, he said, he would pay me for all I had lost, as well as the damaged ones, if I would not send him to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise of favour or threat? - A. No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Could he not then have got into the cellar that way? - A. No, not without opening the flap.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the flap broke at all? - A. No, only he had took it up, and set it on one side; when the prisoner was taken, I went into the cellar, and missed the candles off three broaches; there was one broach at the bottom of the stairs, with the candles on.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner came to you on the 29th of October at Butcher-hall lane. - A. Yes; he said he was an interpreter in the pay of this country, he said he wanted eight pounds to pay some foreigners, as he had not time to go to the banker's; I had known him some length of time, he had breakfasted and dined with me when I kept the Three Pigeons, and he saying he was an interpreter in the pay of this country, and seeing some Turks come after him, I let him have this eight pounds, that was soon after breakfast; on the same day, after he had dined, he returned, and said what he would have for supper, for four or five Turks; he requested to have a private room, as they were not allowed to drink wine, or to see wine drank, and he wished me to let him have fourteen pounds, that would make up twenty one guineas, and that he would make up the money when he came to sup with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him have that. - A. Yes, in gold and notes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not represented himself an interpreter in the pay of this country, you would not have lent him the money. - A. Certainly not, I would not have trusted him from his own appearance.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get the money back again. - A. No, he never returned to the house again. One evening a little girl that I had in the house said she had just seen him; I went out and saw him in Cheapside, I followed him into the Poultry, I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140072"></xptr> why he did not return and pay me the money, as he said he would, and have the supper that was prepared for him. He said government had sent him off express to Portsmouth.</p>

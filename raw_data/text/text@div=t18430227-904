                  </hi>. I was coachman to John Long, Esq., of Maxwell Hall, near Winchester. On the 2nd of March I came to town by the Southampton Railway—on leaving the railway, the prisoner came up and spoke to me—I cannot say that I had ever seen him before, but I think I had—he said he had come half-way by the railway—we went into a public-house, and had a pint of half-and-half before we came to Waterloo-bridge—I was going to Pall<lb></lb>mall, and he walked with me, as I did not know the nearest way—before we came to Waterloo-bridge, another person joined him—we went to some other public-houses, and at last to the Swan, in Hungerford-market—we got there about three o'clock, and went into the parlour—I then put my hand into my purse, and took out a sovereign, to get it changed, to bind a bet with the pri<lb></lb>soner—I put it on the table—he pulled out two imitations of sovereigns from his pocket—I saw them in his hand, and one of them is here now—the pri<lb></lb>soner had proposed tossing for grog—he and the other man tossed for three glasses of grog—they had a sixpenny-worth of rum and water each, and I had sixpenny-worth of gin and water—the prisoner paid for it—he offered me several bets—at the last bet he said be would take three crowns to one that I should lose the toss—I said, "Done," pulled out my sovereign, and placed it on the table—he said he would cover my sovereign to bind the bet—he placed down an imitation of a sovereign, and took my good sovereign up—I detected him doing it, and said he had changed the sovereign, for my sovereign had no George and dragon—he directly opened his hand, and said, "Well, then, take this," offering me another sort of sovereign—I, thinking it was a good one, took it up—the other man and the prisoner then placed the money in a hat—as the other said he would make the same bet as I was mak<lb></lb>ing, the other man pulled out what appeared to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and placed it in his own hat—the prisoner placed an imitation sovereign in the hat, on one side, and a note on the other—I went to place the sovereign which he had given me in the hat—I will not swear whether it went out of my hand or not, but I immediately picked it out, on observing the other piece of coin and the note in the hat—I took them out, went to look at the number of the note, and they snatched it out of my hand—I immediately ran out, and asked Dawson if it was a good sovereign—he said not—I held the prisoner, who scuffled with me, and he was detained in custody—I found myself in possession of a bad sovereign for a good one, which I had when I went there—the other man got away.</p>

I am a smith - I was in the tap-room, and saw the prisoner come in; he talked about some marble chimney-pieces which he had to make; he then went into the yard; Mrs. Cable came into the tap-room, and said the pots were gone - I said, "Stop a bit, perhaps he will come in;" he opened the door once or twice, but did not come in - I then got a light, and went to the privy; I found him sitting there - one of these pots was between his feet, and three of them were down the privy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The pots were not in my possession at all, and he knows there was another man in the yard. Witness. There was no other man in the yard.</p>
               <p>MRS. CABLE. These are my pots, they are now bent double, but they were quite right when I put them in the yard.</p>

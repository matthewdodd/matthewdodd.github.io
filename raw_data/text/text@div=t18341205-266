                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at No. 30, King-street, Gol<lb></lb>den-square. On the 29th of November I took two £90 and one £10 notes from my house to my banker, No. 9, Regent-street, but the bank was closed—I then went to a public-house in Newport-street, where I had a glass of ale—when I came out, I put my notes, with eight sovereigns, and come silver, into my boot—I then walked round Newport Market into Castle-street—I went into the new beer-shop, and called for a pint of ale—I put my hand into my pocket, where I thought I had a loose 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I had not—I then took my boot off, and the notes fell out first—the prisoner was sitting in the beer-shop—I had seen him once or twice before—he came</p>

               <p>towards me, and picked up the parcel which the notes were, in a piece of printed rag, from under the chair—I had put the money in my pocket—I accused the prisoner of robbing me—he denied it, and went and sat by the table again—I went for a policeman, and when I came back the pri<lb></lb>soner was gone—it was then about half past nine o'clock—I had been gone ten minutes or a quarter of an hour for the officer—I inquired where he lived—they said, in Tylor's-court—I went there—he was not at home—the people opened the door, and I sat down till half-past twelve o'clock—he then came up the court whistling and singing—I rushed out, took him by the collar, and said, "You are the man that took my notes"—I called to the officer, who took him—in going along he put something to his mouth, and when he got to the station-house, he was chewing my notes—the officer took one £20 note and one £10 note from his mouth.</p>

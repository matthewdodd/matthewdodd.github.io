                  </hi>. I am the widow of John Mackall Reeves; he lived at 48, Phoenix-street, in the parish of Christ Church, Spitalfields. On 4th April I retired to bed at ten o'clock at night—the house was then fastened—I got up in the morning at half-past five—I received information, and went to the back of the house—the washhouse window had been taken out—they could not get in by the washhouse—they opened the door, went into the yard again, and broke in by the back-room window—they broke six squares of glass—I found the things strewed about the room, and I missed this victorine, the shirt, and other articles—they were the property of my late husband, John Mackall Reeves; he laid bad in bed at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was going to work, and met a young man, whom I know by sight, but do not know his name; he asked me to take the bundle in-doors; I did not know what the things were; I was undressed; the officer made me dress myself. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She had no shoes, stockings, or bonnet on—she seemed as if she had walked some distance; her feet were dirty.</p>

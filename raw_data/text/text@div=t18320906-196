               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you keep your mother's books? A. Yes; I remember the prisoner once purchasing some goods on his own account, and then an invoice was given him, the same as other persons.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's eldest son; we missed articles from time time, but entertained no suspicion of the prisoner when he left. On the 26th of July, I received information from Mr. Goldney, and between six and seven o'clock that evening went with him to the prisoner's lodgings, in Newman-street; the prisoner opened the door to us - Burridge, the officer, was with me, but had no warrant - I said, "I dare say, Mr. Howe, you know what my business is;" he said, "Walk into the parlour for a minute" - he went into the back room, and Burridge followed him; we afterwards went up stairs together; and as we went up, the officer said, "We are come without a search-warrant, but if you object to our searching your rooms, Mr. Hogard will go to the Magistrate and procure a warrant, while I remain here to see that nothing is removed; Mr. Hogard suspects there is property of his mother's here" - when I got into the room, I saw some boxes; I think the prisoner opened one of them - I saw in it a piece of cashmere, which I knew; I said, "Did you purchase this of my brother" - he replied, "I should like to speak to you alone;" the officer objected to that - the prisoner then said he would go into another room with me and the officer, which we did, and then he said, "Mr. Hogard, there is a great deal of property in the other room - some it is yours, and some mine - there are two boxes of lace, which are yours;" we then cautioned him not to say any thing that might criminate himself - we returned into the other room with him, and he delivered to me two boxes of lace, saying, "These are your's, they might have been here 17,000 years, and I should never have touched them;" he said he had been the dupe of another party, and he hoped we should be merciful to him - these two boxes contained one hundred yards of foreign lace, the cost price of which, is 250l.; this piece of Mechliu lace cost 19l., and other pieces worth 6l. and 7l. each - they are entire pieces, and have our shop mark on them; the boxes are not ours - we found about one hundred and sixty yards of silk there; here is one roll which cost 6l. or 7l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are the shop marks in your hand-writing? A. No, they are in the prisoner's writing; the laces are partly marked by me and partly by my mother - our stock was advertised as a cheap sale; a quantity of silks and various things were sold - I have not brought the books here; no application has been made for the prisoner to have access to our books, but there was for his own books, which was refused.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How much property have you recovered? About 1200l. or 1500l.</p>

            . I am an officer. I accompanied Mr. Hogard to the prisoner's lodging; before I got up stairs I told him, Mr. Hogard had information that he had a quantity of foreign lace, and would he obliged to him to show it to him; that they had lost a quantity of lace, silks, and other property, and if he did not allow us to search, I should wait there while a warrant was obtained: when we came into the room, he produced two boxes of lace, and said, "I hope you will forgive me Mr. Hogard; here are the two boxes of lace - I have had them in my possession two months, and dare not touch them" - he said they were Mr. Hogard's properety, and Mr. Hogard identified this piece of cashmere; we found in the room silks and feathers: I have some property which I obtained at another place the following day, and a quantity of cases of property which came from Bristol, and which Mr. Hogard claims; they were delivered to me by the prisoner's brother - this direction (looking at a card), came off one of the cases; I found three duplicates for silk in the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did the prisoner say to Mr. Hogard? A. He said, "There is a great deal of property in the other room, some of which is mine, and some yours; I have two boxes of lace in the other room;" I asked him to point them out - we went into the room - he produced two boxes, and said, "I hope you will forgive me, Mr. Hogard, they have been in my possession two months," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had received them, being made the dupe of a villian? A. No - about a quarter of an hour after, he said he did not bring them there; and when I was locking the door to bring him away, he said he had been made the dupe of another person, but should not mention his name, and asked me to speak to Mr. Hogard to be favourable to him; he did not say he had received them from another person, but that he did not bring them there - he said he should not have touched them for a thousand years; I found other things at his lodgings next day: he was in Newgate then - I did not search the room the first day, but locked it up, bringing away what property was identified; and on going again, I found the door had been broken open, a great many things removed and other things left; I brought away some invoices: the Magistrate did not positively direct him to have them - it was to be with the consent of the other party, but they did not seem to consent; I was applied to for them by his attorney, and refused, by the prosecutor's desire - they are here.</p>

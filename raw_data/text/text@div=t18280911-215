            . I am a Bow-street patrol. In consequence of a communication with Avery on the 28th of July, I altered my usual dress, and went to the Black-boy public-house, Long-acre; I saw the prisoner there, and told him I had come from Susan from the House of Correction - that I was very badly off, and should be much obliged to him if he would sell me a little money; he said I have not any now, but if you will come to-morrow night I will see - I went the next night, but he had none then - there was no quantity mentioned. On the 29th he told me if I would come the next night, he would let me have what he could; I went again on the 30th to the Two-brewers, public-housein Whitecross-street, were I met him; we went to Short's-gardens, Drury-lane - he told me he had some money for me, and said "Give me your money;" I gave him 7s., and I received 40 sixpences - he said "As you came from Susan, I will let you have some more," and told me to come again on the Saturday; I put the 40 sixpences into my pocket, and went to the Adam and Eve public-house, where I gave them to Avery; I gave the prisoner for them two half-crowns, which I had received of Avery - I told him I was very poor, or I would have given him more; he then gave me six sixpences for luck - I afterwards assisted in his apprehension on the 8th of August, and have had the sixpences ever since.</p>

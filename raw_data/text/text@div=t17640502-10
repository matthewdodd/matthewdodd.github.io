            . I received an anonymous letter, setting forth, that this Collins had behaved very ill, in concealing oil that I trusted him to light the lamps with; I went and searched his house, and found three gallons, a pint and a half of oil, in a large tin cannister. I took him before my Lord Mayor; there he owned he had taken oil at several times: we have had a general complaint, and I allowed him a shilling a week extraordinary, that he should take care to do the work well.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he had taken the oil from?</p>
               <p>Sabe. He was served with oil every day at my cellar, and the oil must have been taken from my pots. My Lord asked him how he came by the oil; he said, he had saved a little at sundry times, out of the quantity that I allowed him to light the lamps. I had told him several times, if he had more oil than was wanted, to bring it to my house: he never brought any; only the empty pots next morning.</p>

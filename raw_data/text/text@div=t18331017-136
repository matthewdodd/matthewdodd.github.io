On the 21st of September, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, I was on shore; I was quite sober, but was taken with a violent retching as I was coming along the street - the prisoner came to me, and offered her services; I told her I was going home to Deptford; she asked me if I would go with her; I said if she had a place where I could sit down for an hour I would; she said she had, and she took me to some house - I can swear I went for no improper purpose - I asked her when I got there to get me some brandy, which she did, and I paid for it - she then said she wanted some supper, and I gave her money to get some, but I did not take any of it- she then persuaded me to go to bed, which I did - I took out my watch, and put it under the pillow; my money and the ring were in my purse in my trousers' pocket, which I laid in the chair by the bed-side - I fell fast asleep directly; I suppose I slept an hour, when the policeman came and awoke me, and asked if I had lost anything; I then missed my money and watch - the prisoner was then gone - she is the same person.</p>

             (police-constable). I know the house at which this happened; I was on duty just by, and about half-past one o'clock, I saw the prisoner run out of the court in a hurry, she seemed to be putting on her bonnet and shawl; I asked what she was going for, she said to fetch some gin - I saw her put her hand to her bosom; I drew it out again, and took this purse from it; I took her to the station-house - in going along she took these two handkerchiefs from her bosom; I then put my hand to the back of her neck, and found this watch there - I then went back to her house, and found the prosecutor locked in the room.</p>

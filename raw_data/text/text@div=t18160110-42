               <p>JOHN PERRY. I attend in the shop of Mr. Pulbrook, he keeps a shop at 48, Goswell-street; the shop lies backwards, it is about four feet from the dwelling house. There is a court runs down by the side of the house, it is called Willow-row, which goes into a skittle-ground. There are houses on one side of the way, and the other is a rope yard. We found a ladder in the yard. I was in this house on the 4th of December; we went to bed at about ten o'clock, and the next morning we missed the property in question. I found the shelves stripped, and the window taken down in the skittle ground.</p>

            . I am a patrole. At a little after five o'clock on the morning of the 5th of December, I saw the prisoner Smith running along George-street; she was running as fast as she could run with a large bundle, which I had some suspicion was stolen property. I directly followed after her, and heard a very loud knocking at a door. The woman was at first twenty or thirty yards before me; I saw a man and a woman standing at the door; they entered, and we followed them so quick, that they had not time to shut the door. We went up stairs, and there were five or six people drinking, and appeared as if they had been up all night. At the time we went up stairs, we heard the door shut, and then the property was gone. As we were going out, Jane Smith came in again; she was in and out several times; I knew her again, and took her with the property at a little before seven.</p>

I saw the last witness Carter in the morning of the 5th of December, at about half past six; I went with him opposite No. 2, Church-lane; we waited there, when out came the prisoner Chaffray; she came to the end of George-street, which is a very few yards; she looked up the street, and returned, and left the door open.

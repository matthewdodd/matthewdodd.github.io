                  </hi>. I live at 9, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-square. On the 22nd of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I met a soldier in St. James's-park—I was not quite drunk—I had been drink<lb></lb>ing a little as it was my birthday—I met the soldier just by the Duke of York's column—I am sure it was the prisoner—we went to the White Horse public-house, just through the park, and had two pints of beer and a cigar—I had four half-crowns, a shilling, two sixpences, and a knife, in my pocket—we went from there to Pimlico, and I lost my recollection from that time, for instead of going down to the right down to the Compasses, I must have turned to the left, and gone down the Commercial-road—the last place I recollect being in was in the fields—the soldier was with me then, and at that time I had no coat or waistcoat on—the soldier had them on—I do not</p>

               <p>know how he got them, but I recollect his holding his coat up by the collar and putting my arms into it—I had got one arm into it, and he was putting this arm in—I looked and found I was in Battersea-fields—he said, "I want your trowsers"—I said, "You shan't have them"—he threw me down and stood with me between his legs, and hit me in the face—he made my nose bleed—the blood ran on my coat—my waistcoat and jacket had then been taken off—he knelt on my chest and I felt his hand going into my right hand pocket—in endeavouring to extricate his hand I tore my trowsers—I had four half-crowns in that pocket, I am positive—he hurt me when he struck me—he made my nose swell very much, and I had a black eye—the blow and his kneeling upon my chest prevented my resisting—I strug<lb></lb>gled very much and I lost one shoe in the struggle, and he tore my shirt all to pieces—he ran away directly, and my money was gone, and my jacket and waistcoat—the knife now produced I lost from the same pocket as the money—this is my waistcoat and jacket—I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

On the 22nd of March I was at the Grosvenor ca<lb></lb>nal entrance, at the bottom of the Commercial-road, Pimlico, from half-past eight until half-past nine o'clock—I heard a noise in the hedge in the field—I looked and saw the prisoner and the prosecutor fighting with their jack<lb></lb>ets off, and rolling on the ground—I went up to them they were both on the ground—I asked them what game they were up to, then they got up and put on their clothes again—they came towards the lock—the prose<lb></lb>cutor appeared very drunk—the prisoner seemed in liquor—I do not know that he had had so much as the other—he seemed to lead the prose<lb></lb>cutor across the lock entrance as if he was not so drunk—I said it was no thoroughfare, but the prisoner said it was all right, he knew the road—they went round the towing-path into the brick-field, and I saw no more about it—I only saw them going towards the fields where this occurred.</p>

On the 22nd of March, about twenty minutes before ten o'clock, I was going down by the side of the canal, something attracted my attention lying on the ground—it appeared to be somebody asleep—I was going with another woman to look for her husband—I then saw it was two men lying there struggling—I went close to them, and put my head down to see who it was—it was not the man I was in search of—I turned back and was much alarmed—there was a man on the top of the prosecu<lb></lb>tor—he got up and ran away—I cannot say who he was—I went to fetch Mr. Burton—we found Kemp very stupified—he was insensible, and bleed<lb></lb>ing very much in the face—he had neither jacket nor waistcoat on—his trowsers were torn at the pockets—a soldier's jacket, cap, and belt, were there—I delivered them to Burton the lock-keeper.</p>

About three o'clock in the morning of the 23rd of March, I met the prisoner on Turnham-green, wear<lb></lb>ing a jacket and waistcoat which I produce—he asked me the time—I told him three o'clock—be seemed rather the worse for drink—he asked bow far it was to the next town, about fourteen miles distance—I asked him what town—he could not recollect the name of the town—I saw he had regimental trowsers on—I said, "You belong to the army"—he said, "No, you are quite mistaken, I do not"—I said, "Where did you get these trowsers?"—he said he had an uncle under Sir Robert Peel, in Downing-street, and he had got him the trowsers—I took him as a deserter—I asked him about the jacket and waistcoat—he said he had got them from a man on some common—he could not recollect, but he had come over Vauxhall-bridge—I asked him if it was Clapham-common—he said yes, that the man had lent him the jacket, but be could not tell what became of his own jacket, for when he went to look for it was gone—I found in his jacket pocket a duplicate and an order for the Court of Requests, by which I found out the prosecutor—he was committed from Kensington as a deserter he pulled a knife out of his breeches pocket and gave it me himself, and also 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this farthing put on the end of a hook was amongst it—that was identified by the prosecutor.</p>

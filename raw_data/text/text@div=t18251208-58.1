            . I did belong to Bow-street, but am now a labourer in the East India Company's service. On the 31st of October I was coming out of my own door in in Dorset-crescent, Hoxton New-town, about half past seven o'clock in the evening - I saw the two prisoners together - Francis had the copper and Howson had Francis' hat in his hand; I knew them and followed them; when they got some distance Francis shifted the copper to Howson; when they got to Old-street they crossed the road, and put it down; I went over and asked what they had got there; Howson said an old iron pot; I put my stick against it, and found it was a copper - Francis then ran off - I seized Howson, and took him with the copper to the watch-house. Francis was taken by Grafton the next morning - I had known them both before.</p>

I now live at a short distance from there; I had been at that house on the Thursday before, and had fastened it up - no one lives there now, but I have to pay rent till Christmas. On Tuesday morning, the 1st of November, I passed the house and saw one of the shutters broken down; I went in and saw a stove taken from the fire-place, ready to carry away; I then missed the copper; it was brought to me the same evening. I am quite certain that it is mine - my husband was a butcher - I used to scald pigs in it, in doing which I placed a stick across it, which has made those marks.</p>

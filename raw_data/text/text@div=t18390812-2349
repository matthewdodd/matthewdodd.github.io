                  <hi rend="largeCaps">WILLIAM RICHARDSON</hi>. I am in the employ of Joseph Gurney, a vic<lb></lb>tualler, at All Saints, Poplar. On Saturday, the 3rd of August, I missed about four feet of the lead gutter off the roof of the skittle ground—there was ten feet taken away—I know the prisoner by his frequenting the house—I went with Mr. Craig to the prisoner's house, and asked him how be came to take the lead—he said, "Don't make a noise, I will go with you"—on the way to the station-house I said, "You are the last person I should have thought guilty of such a thing"—he said, "If you will let it be till next week, I will make it all right"—we have not found any of it.</p>

                  </hi>. My garden is next door to the prosecutor's. On the 6th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went down to the bottom of the garden, and while I was sitting there I saw some mortar fall from the party wall—I called out, "What are you doing?"—I got up, and saw the prisoner take the lead from the party wall, double it up, and throw it under a bench in the yard next to the skittle ground—it was a piece of the water pipe—he told me he was repairing the gutter—I told him to make good the hole he had left, and left him—I went back in about an hour, and saw some loose bricks put into the hole, which I thought was not done by a workman—I went and told the barman, and went to the prisoner's lodg<lb></lb>ings with him—the hole was nine inches square—I know nothing about the other lead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I saw a piece of lead hanging loose to the wall—I just touched it, and it dropped into his yard—nobody can say I touched any more, and I did not take that away—I tried to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it back in its place.</p>

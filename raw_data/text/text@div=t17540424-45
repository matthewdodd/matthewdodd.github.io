               <p>Haynes. It was about one, or between one and two in the afternoon. Seeing a woman run I ran after her, and got hold of her; she had the goods in her apron. [The goods produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.] I carried her back to the shop; there was an officer sent for, and she was carried before Sir Samuel Gore. I was ordered to aid and assist.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker by trade, and keep a stall by Mr. Watson's door. His wife ran out of the door, and cried out, Stop thief. The woman, I, and the last witness, ran after her; we took her and brought her back to the shop, where she let down her apron and dropped them down in the shop.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On Thursday, the 29th of September, I received information respecting the prisoner - I went next day, and found her at her own house, in London-terrace, Commercial-road - she keeps a house of ill-fame; I took her into custody - she asked what it was for; I told her for some shoes which she had pawned, and asked where she had got them - she said she did not steal them, but a young man named James Rankin had shirked them, and that he gave them to her to dispose of - I asked where she had pawned them; she said she pawned one pair at Williams', Cable-street, Wellclose-square - that she took them herself; I asked if she sent young Stubbs to pawn a pair - she said she did; I asked how much he got for them - she said 2s. 6d., and that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200062"></xptr>were pawned at Hale's, late Anderton, Commercial-road; I asked where the remainder of them were; she said she did not know - I did not mention how many pairs had been lost till afterwards; I went with her to Williams', who produced a pair, but said he was not present when they were pawned - she told him she had pawned them herself, and what they were pawned for, and described them; I took her to the station, and asked if she knew about any more - she said there were four pairs stolen, she knew, but she knew nothing of more than two pairs; I have one pair, which I got from Laws, and another from Nock.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM STUBBS. I am going on for fourteen years old. On Wednesday, the 28th of September, the prisoner sent me to pawn a pair of shoes, and said she would give me a halfpenny - she told me to take them to Anderton's, to ask 3s., and not take less than 2s. 6d.; I received 2s. 6d. for them, took her the money, and got her change for the half-crown - I was with her at the top of Morgan-street, when a young man named Joseph Sheplierd came and asked her how much I had got for them - she said 2s. 6d.; he said,"How much did he ask?" she said 3s.</p>

            . On a Wednesday in September, about half-past two o'clock, I saw the prisoner sitting on the step of her door, and asked her to lace my frock, which was undone; she did so - she sat there with a pair of shoes in her hand, and asked if I would buy them; I asked what she wanted - she said 2s.; I bought them - they were quite new; she said they were misfits of her own - that she did not like them, and would sell them; I pawned them at Laws', for 2s. 6d., to get the money to pay her; I went back, and gave her the money - here are a pair produced by Power, with No.3 on them, which was on those I bought, and they are the same sort of shoes.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was at Mr. Stokes's, a publican, on the 12th of September—the prisoner came to his house about half-past one o'clock—she had half a pint of beer, and went out—in about half an hour she returned with another woman—they had more beer—the other woman drank part of it, and went away—the prisoner then sat down and drank some beer, then went into the back yard, came in again, sat down and drank the beer—she went out—I went to the door, and saw her crossing the road with the pint pot—I informed the publican, and she was taken.</p>

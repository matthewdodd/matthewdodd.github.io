I suspected the Prisoner, because there was no one else in the House; and on her being taken up, she had my little Girl's Knot upon her Head,- the same she has on now. I asked her, how she could be so wicked as to strip my Room? She said I had entrusted her with them; and would fain have made it but a Breach of Trust; but I never entrusted her with my Goods.- I am a Pensioner of a Parish at the Three Cranes, and the Prisoner carried off my Goods, while I was at Market getting Bread for my Children. She was brought to me as a Lodger, on Sunday Night, and she stripped me of all I had on Thursday following, and left the Key of my Room under the Door. From that Time, I could not get Intelligence of her, till last Sunday was a fortnight, and then I heard where she was gone to lodge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She has sworn as much as she can, and now see whether the next can swear better.- A Curse light on her when I am gone - like an old Bitch as she is.</p>

            . The Prisoner having robbed me on the 13th of March, I went with Mrs Low to take her; and we found her in Chick-Lane. She confessed she stole the poor Woman's Goods, and that she had pawn'd them at the upper End of Fee-Lane, by Saffron-Hill.</p>
               <p>Low. She carried us to Higginson's, the Pawnbroker's, at Saffron-Hill, and told us the Petticoat was there; but the Quilt (she said) was sold outright to a Friend of her's in Hand-Alley, Bishopsgate-street, for 10 s. and the Brass Lamp was at the same Place.</p>

            . The latter End of April the Prisoner came to my House, and said she had had a Fit of Illness, and must dispose of some Goods, which her Grandmother had sent her out of the Country: She asked me if I wanted a Quilt. I told her I wanted one for the Children's Bed, and she said she would fetch it out of pawn, and would shew it me. When I saw it, I told her it was too good for me, but she said, I should have it a Pennyworth; for if I would not buy it, she would sell it to the Brokers in the Fields. My Maid then said, I might as well buy it as the Brokers, so I asked her what she must have for it. She said -12 s. I bid her 10, and she took my Money; and put her Hand into her Pocket, and pull'd out a little Brass Lamp, telling me she would give me that into the Bargain. About 3 Weeks ago the Prosecutor came to enquire if I had not bought the Quilt? I did not deny it, but delivered it to the Church-Wardens, who were the Prosecutors.</p>
               <p>Low. The Quilt she delivered them was mine.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner lodged with me ten months, he lodged there the 25th of July. The reason that I had to suspect any thing of the kind, was, the prisoner was discharged from the master that he worked with the 24th of July, and when he came home, it was past eleven in the evening; I told him that I had been informed of his stealing from his master. As soon as I could get entrance, I looked about to see if I could see any thing of his master's; I got entrance there the Friday, the 25th, about nine o'clock, his room was all over litter of paper, he had light a fire in the room, and appeared to have burnt a deal of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any property belonging to Mr. Paramore, in his room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find thirty copper plate prints? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a printed book in sheets? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find a pamphlet in sheets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a quire of demy paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you shew these articles to? Did you shew them to Mr. Paramore? - Yes, I sent for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present when Mr. Paramore came? - He was not; I had discharged him from the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the things? They were left in my care; I kept them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170113"></xptr>by themselves; Mr. Paramore carried them to the justice; I delivered them to him, and they were given to my care again before the justice, and I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in the house with Mrs. Pitburn; I see the things in the prisoner's room, she called me in, Mrs. Pitburn left me in the room, after that she said she would send her brother, Mr. Paramore, to see them; Mr. Paramore was sent for; I went out before he came. I am sure these are the things that were in the prison's room.</p>
               <p>Q. To Paramore. I understood from you that the things were put in your care before they went to the magistrate? - They were; but she took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pitburn. We all went together at the same time, and I delivered them to Mr. Paramore, to shew before the justice.</p>
               <p>Paramore. The copper plate prints I ascertain to be mine, because I printed them, and I missed things of that sort; I print them for the methodist preachers in the connection of the late Mr. Wesley, for Mr.

               <p>THOMAS WALKER. I am a Thames police-officer. On the 25th of August, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in the police-boat, near Rotherhithe church, and heard a man, between the tiers, who was on a float of timber, call sculler. We pulled towards the boat, and found the prisoner in a boat at the Middlesex side of the river, near Wapping-he was brought into my boat; I found a white shirt in his bosom, between his own shirt and waistcoat. I hand cuffed him. He was feeling about his pocket, and made resistance; I heard something drop from him in the boat, I found it was a comb. I took him to the office, when I found he had three coats, two waistcoats, and two pair of pantaloons on; he had a watch in his left-hand fob, and another down his thigh. I found a purse in his waistcoat-pocket, with six shillings, two sixpences, three pieces of foreign silver coin, a took pick, and a purse, in it; in his coat-pocket I found a pair of spectacles and case-the prosecutors claimed them.</p>

            . I am mate of the ship James, which was in the tier, next to the Ann, at Rotherlithe; I lost my silver watch, which hung up in the cabin at nine o'clock-it was taken while I was asleep; I missed it about seven o'clock next morning, and found it at the office. The prisoner had no business on board our vessel.</p>
               <p>JOHN TURNER. I am mate of the Ann. About half-past six o'clock in the morning. I missed a coat, waistcoat, a pair of pantaloons, a pair of spectacles and case, a comb, and a purse, with seven shillings, and three foreign silver coins, in it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WATSON. I am mate of the Brittania, which laid in the same tier; a person could step off one vessel on to the other. I lost a silver watch from my bed-room, which I put away at nine o'clock at night.</p>

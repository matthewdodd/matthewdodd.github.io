               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. About four o'clock in the evening of the 16th; he went away an came again at eight o'clock in the evening; he asked me to go with him to have a pipe of tobacco, and some porten, at a public-house; I went with him, and we came home about eleven o'clock, and went to bed; I awoke about six in the morning, and found the prisoner gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else sleep in your room? - A. No; I fastened the door myself, and in the morning I found the door a jar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was fastened the night before? - A. Yes; I knocked up the people at the landing-place opposite, and while I was dressing myself, the prisoner came up stairs, and said, good God, where is my hat; he had this hat on his head, which is mine, (produces it;) he had not his own hat; I asked him what he had done with my things; he said, don't say any thing, and you shall have them by the time you have done break fast; he asked me to give him some halfpence to buy some geneva with; I told him he had taken all the halfpence out of my breeches, and that I had not got any; he said, my things were left at a night-house, near the top of the Hay-marker; he asked me if I had received a note from him, I said, no; the next morning I went to his lodgings, with an officer, he said, I should have my things, if I would make it up; I said, I would not; we found a half-handkerchief in his room, which is mine.</p>

On the 15th, I met the prisoner, who I knew; we went and drank together, and he said, he would learn me his trade, if I would call again next day; I did so, and we had seven pots of beer, I was rather in liquor and he asked me to sleep with him, and he lent me the handkerchief; he began to behave in a very unbecoming manner; I told him it was conduct I was not acquainted with, and got up and went home; when I found I had mistaken my hat, I went back, but he did not say any thing about his things then; I have been in the army twenty-one years.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner come out of my house with a bundle in her apron, on the sixteenth of October, about four o'clock. I went to the door and found it broke open. I pursued her through some all near where I live, she ran into a man shop, and dropped the things mentioned. ( Produced in court and deposed to) She went into the yard, I took hold on her, she asked me if I wanted to rob her? I said I'd let her know she had robbed me.</p>

               <p>I happened to go into this house to enquire for a chair-woman, and to have a half-pennyworth of small beer. Then I went backward to make water. The man came and took hold on me. I asked him what he wanted with me. He called me several bitches, and asked me what I had in my apron. I had nothing there. Then he had me away to the headborough's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Woolpack tavern, in the Minories. I know the prisoner—I saw him in my tap-room on Saturday night, the 10th of Jan., as late as a quarter to eleven o'clock—I did not re<lb></lb>tire to rest till one—I was the last up in the house—I went into the tap-room at a quarter to eleven o'clock to survey the room, and saw the prisoner sitting by the corner of the fire-place asleep—I just looked about and went out again—there were three or four more sitting round the fire-place—at a quarter past eleven I sent King, the pot-man, to see whether all the parties were out, and to lower the gas and quench the fire, which he did—I secured the front door before I went to bed—I locked and barred it, and put the key in a secret place under the counter, for my son when he gets up in the morning—I had a quantity of cigars in the bar—I was rung up about half-past six o'clock in the morning by the police—I went down—I found the chain of the front door was unloosed, and the lock taken off and laid on the table, and the bar pushed on one side—the door was open, and a policeman standing at it—I found the front of the bar in great confusion, with papers, cigars, screws of tobacco, some biscuit, and orange-peel strewed about—a decanter of port wine had been drunk, and some shrub drawn from a cask—all the cigars that had been in the bar were gone, between 2lbs. and 3lbs.—I missed some biscuit and loaf-sugar, about half a pound weight of tobacco in screws, and a pair of sovereign scales—I observed hand marks of soot all round the counter—the cupboard and all the boxes that were taken out were covered with soot, even the papers and receipts in the drawer—these marks came from the tap-room fire-place, which was covered with soot, and just at the door he had shaken off a great quantity of soot from his clothes on to the floor—there were also marks of soot all over the outer door—all the tills had been opened, but I had taken my money up with me—there were sooty finger marks in every till.</p>

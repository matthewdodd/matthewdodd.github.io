             sworn. - I am a watch-house keeper of Mary-le-bonne; when the prisoner was brought to me to the watch-house, I searched him, and found a brace of pistols in his coat pocket, a tea strainer, a caddle ladle, and a milk ladle. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. I had not slept in the house since before Christmas; Martin takes care of the house; I had been about three days before, and seen all these things; the pistols are worth a guinea and a half; the gun I would not take four or five guineas for; if it was offered me; I went down afterwards, and found the tea-chest, out of which this tea ladle was taken, broke to pieces; I know all these things to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. I put it to you as a man of candour; do you think it possible that such a boy as that could make use of force sufficient to break this door open? - A. I will tell you why; if it had been a short instrument, he could not have done it for want of purchase, but there was a garden-spade near the door, and it having a long handle, would give a purchase sufficient for such a boy to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think it might have been done by such a boy as that? - A. I am sorry to say I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was not near the house at all; the other boy gave them to me.</p>

               <p>of St. Andrew, Holborn. On Tuesday morning, the 3rd of December, at seven o'clock, I was taking down the shutters, and removing them up Thaives-inn, which is at the corner of our house, to put them in a box—I heard the latch of the shop door go, which is on Holborn-hill—I am cer<lb></lb>tain it was latched before—I waited close against the door till it opened, and two men rushed out with a load—one turned up the hill, the other ran across the road—I hallooed after them, crying "Stop thief," as loud as I could, and the policeman caught the prisoner—I never lost sight of the prisoner—he is one of the persons who had one of the loads, which were 750 yards of silk, and 470 yards of poplins—it is here—it is my master's property—the other man made his escape—they both dropped their bun<lb></lb>dles.</p>

On 29th March, at night, I was in Birdcage-walk, in plain clothes, going home, and saw and passed Prior and another man—I went on a short distance, and met Hicks, the policeman, on the beat—I spoke to him and looked at my watch; it was seven minutes past eleven o'clock—I put it in my waistcoat-pocket—my coat was buttoned one button at the top, it was single-breasted—the watch was attached to a silk guard round my neck—I then passed Kinsdale—she was about twenty yards from Prior—I walked past her about twelve yards—Hicks said something and I went back and looked at her—she said something I did not understand,</p>

On the evening of 29th March I was in Birdcage-walk, and saw Kinsdale and a young man who told me something, and I watched her—Prior and another man walked on behind, twenty yards off, or little more—Harvey overtook me, and we walked together past Kinsdale—when about eight or ten yards from her, Harvey turned back, and I looked round—I was then about twenty yards from them, and saw Kinsdale catch hold of Harvey round the middle—in about two minutes she screamed "Police! Murder!"—I ran up and said, "What is the matter?" he said, "I have been robbed; go and take that man," pointing to one—I went after him; another man who was with him ran away—I caught Prior—he did not run—he said, "What is the matter?"—I took him back and took Kinsdale.</p>

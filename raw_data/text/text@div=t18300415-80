            . I am a Policeman. On the 22nd of February, between ten and twelve o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in the Edgware-road, with a basket on his shoulder, containing this linen - I told him he had been very fortunate that morning, and he must go with me; he immediately threw the basket right upon me - it knocked me into the road; I pursued - I dragged the basket along as well as I was able; he was knocked down by some people in Oxford-street, and secured, without my losing sight of him - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long had you known him? A. Some months; he lives within two hundred yards of me - he was in Somerset-street, coming from Portman-square.</p>

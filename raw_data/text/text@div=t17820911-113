               <p>I stooped to look for this half-guinea, I let her search whatever she thought proper, then they both looked, and came and said I must have it; I went into a room among six or seven gentlemen, I stripped all my things, but my shirt, when she found I had it not, she said she did not care if she spent twice the money; I am afraid she is a very bad woman, she had two black eyes at the time.</p>

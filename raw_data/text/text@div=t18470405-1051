                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant K</hi> 5.) I heard of some lead having been stolen from Mr. Nind's portico, at Leyton—I watched near Cat-Hall-lane, opposite the cage, in Harrow-green, Leyton—I saw a cart go down the lane—I watched till it returned in about a quarter of an hour—I, Benton, and Potten, went to the cart—we found the two prisoners in it—Hall had been driving it, but he got out and went to the public-house—the cart was standing opposite the public-house—this was about nine o'clock at night—I laid hold of Root by the collar with one hand, and I felt the lead with the other hand—I asked him how he came by the lead—he said he knew nothing at all of it—he made great resistance, and attempted t throw me several times after getting him out of the cart—another officer came, and we ulti<lb></lb>mately secured him—Benton took Skiggs.</p>

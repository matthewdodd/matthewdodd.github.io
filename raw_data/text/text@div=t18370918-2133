                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>.) I am a locksmith, and live in Charlotte-court, Kensington. On the night in question, I hired the prisoner Barthram's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from Whitechapel, to take me to Kensington—I never saw him before—I was later than I expected, and was waiting for an omnibus—I went into a public-house, and had a pint of beer—while I was drinking it I saw an omnibus, but it went on, and I saw the cabman talking to some women—he came to me, and asked where I was going—asked how much to Kensington—he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Very well,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180094"></xptr>
               <p>and got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I told him to drive to Kensington—he drove on a little further, and took in two women—I did not invite them in—they got in—the female prisoner was one of them—I did not expect much good from them, and put one hand in my pocket to mind my money, and the other to take care of my pin—in the meantime I felt my watch gone—I called to the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to stop, but he let the horse go faster—I then called a policeman, who came—I hardly knew what I was doing, but the girl got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and the policeman brought her back—give me my watch into my hand again, when the policeman had brought her to the station, as I came out again she put it into my hand—I cannot say which woman it was—it was the one that was brought back—the other woman ran away—it was the prisoner gave me the watch, but the police. man must know better than me, because he brought her back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Turner-street Whitechapel, and heard a cry of, "Police, police, "in an outlandish language very loud—I immediately ran up, and saw the female prisoner jump from a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—she had got about ten or twelve yards from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when I cane up—she was running, and had left behind her a shawl and handkerchief—she did not stop to pick them up, but went on—I caught her and brought her back, gave her shawl and handkerchief, put her into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and drove her to the station-house, and there the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> as well as the girl was charged—when he found he was going to be detained, he said, "If you will look in my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, you will see the key and the ring"—an officer looked into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and found the key and ring where he said, in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the officer who found it is not here—I did not see him find it—the officer gave it to me by order of the Magistrate—it was stated in the prisoner's presence that it was found in his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it was brought in and shown to him—I did not hear him make any remark on it—he was not drunk, but he had been drinking—he did not say how he came to have the girls in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said nothing—he was asked nothing—I produce the key, ring, watch, and guard—I got the watch from the prosecutor—the guard was attached to it.</p>
               <p>

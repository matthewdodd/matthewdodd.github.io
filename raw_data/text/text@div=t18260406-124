On the 25th of January a chest was missed from my yard, which had arrived from York the same day. I received information on the 2d of March, and got a search-warrant - I went to the premises of one Cole, in Rosemary-lane, where I found thirty-three dozen of these combs; I then went to the prisoner Mills', in Elder-street, Spitalfields - he is a bonnet-maker; I asked him if he had any combs - he said he had nothing of the kind in the house - we searched the house, and found thirty-three odd combs in his parlour, in a bag, under some pieces of flannel; from there I went, with the officer, to the prisoner Shaw's, and in a room at Mr. Biggs', where he works I found the chest, with part of the direction on it - I could not speak to it, because I had not seen it before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you known Mills before? A. No. I do not know whether the combs were by themselves, or with other things; I do not know whether Mills uses flannel in his business; Shaw is in the straw bonnet business; as he wanted to go back for a coat I returned with him, and found the combs. I am answerable for the property.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I had a warrant against Cole, who lives in Rosemary-lane, and went there, with Mr. Deacon, about one o'clock on the 2d of March. I found a quantity of combs there; I then got a warrant against Mills; I went there, and his wife called him up - I told him I was an office, and had a warrant to search his house for combs, and I believed he was the man who recommended a person to Mr. Cole, in Rosemary-lane; he said, Yes he was - I asked the name of the person he recommended - he said, Shaw - I asked where he lived - he said he did not know, but Shaw's wife's sister was there at work, and she would tell me; I said I should search his house first; he said, "You may, for I have no combs." I searched the back room, and found nothing there; I then came into the front room, and saw the young woman come down stairs; I left Fortune there, and went with her to Shaw's house; he was not at home; I searched the house, and did not find any thing; I returned back, and asked where he worked - they said, there was a lad there who would tell me, and he took me to a bonnet shop in Bishopsgate-street; the lad went up stairs, and when I heard him coming down I pushed the door open, and went in; I saw Shaw, and said, "I want you;" he said, "What for?" I said I was going to put him into a coach, and I would tell him; I told him it was about some combs - he said, "What, those I found at Cripplegate?" I said, "Where?" - he said, "Near the White Horse;" I said that was near where the robbery was committed; he then said "I did not say I found them there - it was coming from there." I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went to Mills' house, and found him at his business? A. Yes. I asked if he had recommended a person to Cole's - he said Yes; I then searched his house - he did not say there had been some combs, but his wife had sold them; all he said was true, except that he said he had no combs, and some were found there. Shaw did not say at what time he found the combs.</p>

I then asked his wife if they had any, and she said they had not; she appeared rather uneasy, which caused me to keep my eye upon her; I then saw her open a burean three times, and take something out; I said, "What are you moving there?" she said, "Only a little parcel;" I said, "Let me see what that parcel is?" she put it under a black bag, which I moved, and saw three parcels of combs; I then asked if there were any more - she said, if there were they were in the bureau, which I opened, and found more - there were thirty-three in all; I cannot tell how many of them were in the parcels.</p>

            . I keep a hardware-shop, in Rosemary-lane. Mills came to me about six weeks ago, and asked if I would buy a quantity of combs - he said he had got some which he had taken for a debt, and if I liked to purchase them he would be able to sell them to me cheap; I told him very well - he said he should not be able to send them that day, but he would send them the next, or the day after; two days afterwards Shaw came to my shop, with a sample of combs, which I took and looked at, and asked the price; I did not buy any at that time, but I did afterwards; I paid Shaw 4s. a dozen for them - these are them - they are worth 6s. or 7s. a dozen one with another; he told me he brought them from Mills, and when I offered him the money he said he should go back and ask Mr. Mills. The price which Mills had asked was 5s. a dozen, and I bid him 4s.; he said I should have them for 4s. 6d. I bought thirty-three dozen - these are the combs - they were found by the officer.</p>

               <p>COURT to DANIEL DEACON. Q. What distance does Shaw work from you? A. About a mile and a half; I have seen him in the yard; he has brought goods from Mr. Biggs. I should have stated that Mills said, after Shaw was found, that there was an account between them, and the combs were taken in that account, but not entered to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you say at the office that Mr. Mills had acted very properly? A. No.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JACOBS re-examined. Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Cole? A. Two years. I had seen Shaw employed in carrying bonnets for Mills last summer - he worked for two persons. I was not examined before a Magistrate, nor before the Grand Jury; I was on the business, but I was not sworn. I came to day with Mr. Cole. I saw Mr. Deacon this morning in the street, and I believe the day before yesterday, at his own house. The bill against Cole was thrown out yesterday. I never was at Mr. Deacon's house but once in my life - I was not at the Grand Jury room.</p>
               <p>MILLS' Defence. I have nothing to say, but, from the character you will hear of me, and the ignorant part I have acted in this business, I trust you will be induced to grant my acquittal.</p>

            . I am Shaw's wife's sister. I have been in the employ of Mills three years last January - Shaw was employed by Mills two years ago but he has not since. In the course of last winter I took a dozen combs to Mr. Mills' shop, and told the work people I had them - I sold one to Smith, and one to Jay - my brother at that time owed some money to Mr. Mills, and he had said he intended to stop my wages if it was not paid - it was a balance of 18s. for some cloth; I mentioned it to my sister, and either two dozen and a half, or three dozen of combs were delivered to him in payment of the debt; I think the whole debt was 27s. - it is not necessary in the straw business to use flannel or silk handkerchiefs, but Mr. Mills had taken some for a bad debt in the City; I was at his house when the search was made - he had no claim to the combs, except the two or three dozen he took of my brother.</p>

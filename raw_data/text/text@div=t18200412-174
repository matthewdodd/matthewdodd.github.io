He got out of the window, with a bundle in his arms, accompanied by a man named Wicks - they took a sack from Harris's door; Wicks took the sack up, and carried it. - Pizzey took the bundle, and Bryant walked by his side. I watched them all three together into the fields, almost a quarter of a mile off. I saw them hide it in a hedge in the fields, and then all three went away - I went, and told Mr. Lancaster, my master, and we both went about an hour and a half after I told him. He told me to watch to see if they returned, which I did for an hour, but nobody came. I went into another field, from which I could see if they came. I saw the men after they were taken into custody by Lancaster - the sack laid in the same place. A person, named Westman, carried it away - I knew Pizzey before; I was a schoolfellow of his. I am certain Bryant is the man who accompanied them.</p>

            . I am a farmer's man. I went with Mr. Amer, the prosecutor, in consequence of the boy's information, and took Bryant and Pizzey into custody - the boy told me the way, and I followed about a mile and three-quarters before I took them. When the boy told us it was about half-past eight o'clock - it was about ten minutes before I saw them; they were separating, Wicks went one way, and they another. I found the sack when I got up to them, which contained lead - they resisted. I told them I stopped them for taking a sack and bundle away from Harris's house. They said they had taken nothing.</p>

I fitted the lead to Mr. Amer's house, over the door, and it tallied with the shape of the roof - it was ripped off. It weighed about 60 lbs. The sack belongs to Burrows.</p>

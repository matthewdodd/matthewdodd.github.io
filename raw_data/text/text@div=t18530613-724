I knew his wife—they occupied the front parlour—on Saturday night, 28th May, a little after 12 o'clock, I heard a scream at the bottom of the house; I went down to the door of the prisoner's room, and he closed it just as I got there—I heard the little boy cry out, "Oh, father, you have killed my mother; she is dead"—I unlatched the door as fast as I could, and the prisoner had not returned from the door then after shutting it—he was in the act of taking his wife up by the hair; he swung her round, and knocked one cane bottomed chair down, and the next to it as well, the baby's chair; and he threw her into a corner of the room on a little bed on the floor, and said, "Go to bed to your child, you b—r"—the baby was sitting on the foot of the bed, screaming ready to go into fits—I said to the prisoner, "Don't ill use that poor afflicted creature, don't ill use her"—directly he returned from the bed I retired from the room, and stood outside for I dare say ten minutes, and heard his wife talking to him; but being up in a corner I could not distinctly hear what it was, but he was accusing her of spending some money, and the little boy said, "Father, mother has not spent the money; she gave it to me to fetch something in"—he told his father that she had given him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to buy a pair of shoes, which were in the drawer, and tried to smoothes his father from going at her again—he said, two or three times over, "Don't father, don't father, my mother is dead"—after I left the room the deceased called out <hi rend="italic">a time or two</hi>, on which the prisoner said he would give her something presently for hallooing—I went away after that, and saw so more till the Monday—she was then upright in bed in a sitting posture; she was such a size that she could not lie down—her eyes and face were in a dreadful state, and very much discoloured; every part of her was swelled just ready to burst—she could just see out of the corner of one eye—she spoke to me when I went to the bedside, and asked me how my daughter was, who had been very ill; I told her she was a great deal better, and with difficulty she said she was very glad—that was all that passed, and I went out of the room immediately—she could scarcely speak.</p>

               <p>I was present when my mother died, about 11 o'clock on Monday night—on the Saturday night before that, my mother and I took tea together, my father was at home lying down on the boards asleep—my mother had not been well—after tea I and my little sister went out—we came back between 7 and 8 o'clock—I then went out again, and came back about half past 10 o'clock—my mother was then lying down on the boards by the side of my father, with the baby—she was not asleep, but the baby was going off to sleep—about half or three quarters of an hour after that my father and mother had some words about some money that my father bad given to my mother, and he suspected her of spending some of the money—he hit my mother in the face with his fist, and knocked her down—he then kicked her twice here (<hi rend="italic">on the hip</hi>) while she was lying on the boards—as he did that he said something in his own language, Irish—I did not understand what it was—I cannot remember whether my mother said anything to him—Mrs. Gray did not come into the room at all; all she did was just to open the door, and put her head in, and as soon as she had done that she went out again—I cannot remember what my father was doing to my mother at the time Mrs. Gray came—there was a bed in the room—my mother was not near it; she was up against the door—she was on the bed afterwards, because my father put her on it by the two arms—he did not drag her there, be lifted her up off the ground by her arms—I was very much frightened when I saw this going on—one of the chairs was knocked over, but only one—I cannot say whether that was done at the time my father had got my mother by the arms—my mother was not able to walk after that, only by holding by something—she was able to walk before he struck and kicked her—my father afterwards went and fetched a medical man—my father had his boots on when he kicked my mother—he has a lame foot, with a laced clump boot on it—it was with that foot that be kicked my mother—it had the dump on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, practising at St. John's Wood. I knew the deceased for some time—I was called on Sunday morning, 29th May, between 10 and 11 o'clock, and found her sitting up in bed, breathing with great difficulty—her eyes were bandaged—I observed bruises about her arms, and considerable distention from the escape of air underneath the skin, indicating that the lungs had been wounded—the tenth and eleventh ribs on the left side were fractured—she was perfectly sensible—her husband was in the room, and while he was there she said that she met with an accident by falling down stairs over a pail or a bucket—I saw her again on the Monday morning, between 6 and 6 o'clock—the prisoner was present, and I asked him to retire, and then had a conversation with her; it appeared to me that she was conscious of the dangerous state in which she was—I do not know whether she expected immediate death, but her condition was manifestly dangerous, and I think she was impressed with that condition.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If the kick had been sufficiently strong and violent it would have caused it; but a fall down stairs would have caused a fracture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—the ribs being fractured, the edge of the bone presented a very acute point, and penetrated through the pleura into the lungs; I believe that her death resulted from inflammation of the pleura—I had been treating her before for disease of the lungs; she had bronchitis, and also a disease called <hi rend="italic">emphysema.</hi> in which the lungs present the character of large vescicles, resulting from dilated or ruptured air cells, probably both.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

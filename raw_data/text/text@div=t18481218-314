On Monday, 16th Dec, I saw them at the house, he was in a passion with her, and said, "You old b----r, I will kill you;" he took her up in his arms, and threw her down on the door-sill, which is rather higher than the stone steps—she said, "Oh <hi rend="italic">Sail! Sail</hi>! pick me up!"—she was picked up, and walked into her own house, and the prisoner also—he took her up and threw her down again on the floor, using the same expression—she groaned very heavily—she had done nothing to him that I knew—I did not see her again till Wednesday, she was then dead.</p>

                  </hi>-Vallance. I am a surgeon, of Stratford, and have known the deceased some years. I had seen her five or six days previous—her health was bad—she had diseased lungs, and general infirmity, being eighty years of age—I did not see her between the Monday and Wednesday, but received the coroner's warrant to makes <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—her lungs were thoroughly disorganized, but the left fourth rib was fractured, which would be calculated to accelerate her death—I cannot say that it did, because the rib hid not penetrated the chest, and there were other diseases—if she had been thrown down once or twice on the ground, it would be calculated to accelerate death—the fracture was recent; not of five days' standing.</p>

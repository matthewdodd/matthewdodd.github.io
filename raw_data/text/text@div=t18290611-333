Lord Lansdown's carriage was at my door the day before yesterday, at a quarter-past ten at night - I saw a coat go off the box, and gave an alarm; the footman went round the carriage, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARRIS. I am a constable. The prisoner was given to me with this coat.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MUSPRATT. I am footman to Lord Landsdown. I ran round the carriage, and saw the prisoner throw this coat on the wheel - I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you not first see it on the wheel? A. No; he was not walking with his hands in his pockets; he had the coat - I saw him throw it on the nearest hind wheel - there were no other persons about; the landlord was talking to us; he said the coat was going - I ran round the carriage - on my oath I saw the coat thrown on the wheel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came out of the corner door - I went round the carriage; the coat was on the near wheel; I was on the off side with my hands in my pockets; the coachman caught hold of me, and said,"Where is my coat?" - the footman went and got it, and said, "Here it is;" and then he said, "There is no one here but this man, we will give charge of him, in fact, I will swear I saw him throw it."</p>

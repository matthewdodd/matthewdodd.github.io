            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I met the prisoner on the night of the 16th of December, in Whitechapel-road, about seven o'clock, with a bag under his arm - I asked what he had got, and he said plate-glass, which he had brought from No. 11, Munyard-street, Hoxton; he afterwards said he was going to take it there, and had bought it of a man at his own door. I took him to the office, and then went to Munyard-street, where he said he lodged. I found a great number of articles there, some behind the bed, and some in other places, which I have brought here.</p>

The prisoner was in the employ of Mr. Griffith, whose premises join mine - there is a wall between our yards, and an iron gate which leads to premises where I carry on my glass business. I have missed a great quantity of property at different times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARAY. Q. Do you deal in glass? A. Yes; but I never sell it in this state; I know this because it has my initials on it, which are taken off when it is worked - they are put on when it is selected at the glass house; I know this veneer to be mine, and this looking-glass; I have very few workmen.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was with Brown, and what he has stated is correct; when I took the prisoner into the Nag's Head, public-house, he said if I would let him go, he would tell me where he got it, from Mr. Loader's, in Tabernacle-walk.</p>

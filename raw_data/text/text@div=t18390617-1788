                  </hi>. I am a varnish-maker. On the 5th of April I was at my cousin's house, Mr. William Day, the younger, in Edward-street, St. Pancras—my cousin brought the prisoner home, about half-past one o'clock in the morning—I was sitting up to let my cousin in—I had never seen the prisoner before; but he and I having been to sea, we sat, talking, till about four o'clock—I then said I was going to bed, and went up stairs, but previous to that I had made up the prisoner as comfortable a bed as I could in the kitchen, where we had been sitting—I got up about half-past six o'clock in the morning, and the door was open—the prisoner and the articles stated were gone—I found this strange knife lying in front of my trunk, which had been broken open, and these pincers, which are mine, are, I believe, what the trunk was broken open with—I looked round, and missed a pistol from the mantel-piece, which was my cousin's—I then missed my boots, my cousin's hat, and the rest of the articles stated—I was looking for the prisoner, but did not see him till the 18th of May, when I caught a glimpse of him at the corner of Brill-row—I followed him, and saw, by his quick step, that he must have recognized me—I followed him, till I saw a policeman—I then collared the prisoner—he said, "What do you take me for?"—I said I would let him know when I got to the</p>

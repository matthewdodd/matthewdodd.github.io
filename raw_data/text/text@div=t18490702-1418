                  </hi>. I live in York-street, Port man-square. On 9th June I was in the Regent's-park with my sister—I saw some boys coming along; the prisoner was one—one of them got before me and asked me the time—the others were going along all in a cluster—I did not take my watch out then; I had taken it out just a minute before—they were then about the length of this Court from me—we walked on—one of the boys came before me, and the prisoner came behind, and caught hold of me—I turned round, and asked what be wanted, and then another ran and caught hold of me too—they both called out, "Traitor!"—then the prisoner let go of me, and took my watch—he got it off without the guard, and got away, and ran—I got loose from the others and ran after him—I caught him, and got him down, and began to struggle with him—all the others got round and got him away—they did not do anything to me, only pushed me; they then ran away; I did not get my watch—I told the park-keeper—we went after the boys; we saw another park-keeper—we took three boys the first day; the prisoner was not one of them—I had never seen him before—I am able to swear he is the boy; I saw him for two or three minutes.</p>

I am ten years old—I was with my brother in the Park; there were about sixteen boys there—one boy came and asked my brother the time, and he told him—after that, the boy went back to the other boys—then one boy came before my brother, and one behind—I cannot wear to the boys—then the boy that was behind caught hold of my brother's watch—my brother caught him, collared him, and they came to the ground—the other boys came up, and the biggest one asked my brother what was the matter—he said, "He has got my watch"—he said, "Oh, what nonsense!"—I</p>

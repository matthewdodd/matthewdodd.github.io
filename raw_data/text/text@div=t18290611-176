               <p>GEORGE CORNER. I am a watchman of Bethnal-green. On the morning of the 13th, about a quarter before four o'clock, I saw three men enter the field near my box, in Three Colt-lane, Dog-row; they each had baskets - I did not then know them, but I imagined they were going to Whitechapel, they were coming in a direction from the prosecutor's premises; I had suspicion, and went up to Crockford, who was behind the other two - I asked what he had in the basket; he said nothing - I caught hold of it, and discovered it was glass; I caught hold of him, and he caught hold of me - we had a scuffle, and I fell; he called to the others to assist him - Pearce looked back twice, but did not return; he got quite away from me, with his basket -I sprung my rattle, and the other two were taken afterwards by some Whitechapel watchmen; I saw them in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110076"></xptr>watch-house, and knew them to be the persons I had seen with Crockford that morning - I knew Bateman by his being nearest to Crockford: I had seen him in Whitechapel several times - I had not so good a knowledge of Pearce, and cannot speak positively to him; I said he had a long coat on, and Bateman a flannel jacket; their dress corresponded with the description I gave - before I went to the watch-house I went with two of the Whitechapel watchmen to the field, and found the sashes; this was about half-past six o'clock - it was a quarter of a mile from where I saw the three men, and about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's premises: the glass had been removed from the sashes - I am certain Crockford is the person I had the scuffle with; I found a basket in the field, which I think had been dropped by Pearce - it was a small basket, with one handle off; I saw Crockford outside the door of Lambeth-street office, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q.Can you speak to Bateman as being one of the parties? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOWARD. I am a watchman of Whitechapel-road. On the morning of the 13th of May, at a quarter before four o'clock. I heard a rattle spring; I made towards it, and in Wellington-street I met Bateman and Pearce running - I saw Bateman drop a basket, containing glass; I met them between these houses and Whitechapel - I took up the basket; I afterwards took Pearce, and Kettle took Bateman, in North-street, by their own doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw nothing of Crockford then? A. No.</p>
               <p>MARTIN KETTLE. I am a watchman. I heard the rattle spring, and saw Howard with a basket in his hand, with some glass in it; I saw nothing of the prisoners then, but we afterwards took Pearce and Bateman at their doors- Corner saw them at the watch-house, and spoke to them as the persons he saw in the field; they did not say they were not there, but said they were going their own way.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BLAKE. I am a watchman of Whitechapel. I heard the rattle, and ran nearly two hundred yards; when I got to Wellington-street. I saw Bateman drop this basket, with glass in it - I described his person; he was afterwards taken: he had a flannel jacket and white stockings- I knew him. but did not know the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BATEMAN. Q.Where is your beat? A.Down by the horse-boilers - I was close by you, and could describe you.</p>

               <p>Prisoner BATEMAN. Q. Did not you see me the evening before? A. Yes, about eleven o'clock - you and Pearce passed by me, in the same line that the goods came next morning; I saw nothing of Crockford - about half an hour after the glass was taken we had lost sight of you, and we saw you again; I have seen you with roots, and other things, early of a morning.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a news-agent and bookseller. I live at No. 11, Brace's-buildings, Newmarket-street. East Smithfield. I have known Crockford one year and a half, and lodged with him. On the night of the 13th of May, I let him in at twelve o'clock, and he was in bed with me till seven in the morning; I went out and left him in bed, and when I returned at nine he was not up.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you know it was the 13th? A. His father came the same day, and said his son was charged with a robbery - I went up to the Magistrate, but I was ordered out; I offered to state the fact - I am in the habit of sleeping with him, as he has a sister out of place and she sleeps in my apartment. I do not keep any shop -I have bought books of Piper, late Sherwood, Neely, and Sons, Cowie and Strange, and others; I have not been supoenaed here to day - Crockford is a sawyer, and was out of work at that time - he had been at work the week before, but I do not know for whom; his sister slept in the house that night - I let him in at twelve o'clock, and we went to bed together; his sister had gone into her apartment at half-past eleven - she did not see him that night, but she bade him good night as he passed the door; his father slept in the same room with us, and had not gone to bed when he came home - his father and sister went to the Police officer, and a person named Mayne who had been in company with him from twelve at noon till near twelve o'clock at night; he is here to-day - I never saw Pearce till I was at Lambeth-street; I never saw Crockford in company with him, nor with any persons but those whom I believe to be sawyers.</p>

            . The prisoner is my son. On the night of the 12th of May I will take my oath he was in bed with me - it might be twelve o'clock, or a little before, when he came in, and I called him the morning between four and five o'clock; he said it was no use for him to get up - he never got up till nine o'clock; he could not have gone out without my knowing it - he did not go out, so help me God - he was at home all night.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was he taken up the same day? A. Yes, he went out - Pearce's father came to let me know he was taken; I had never seen him before; my son sent word by him where he was; I went to the office, but they would not let me in - they said they wanted no witnesses there; I have a trifle allowed me by the parish, and have been dependent on my son; he had been on the 12th to Hackney, with Mayne, to see if he could get any work - Bethnal-green is the nearest way to Hackney; I do not know the prosecutor's houses - I cannot say whether he had any supper or not; I think I was in bed when he came home - Harper was getting into bed, and when my son came home he let him in; there was a candle - my daughter was gone to bed, perhaps half an hour; she bade him good night - the door was not open, but I heard that through the wainscoat; I cannot tell whether I had any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110077"></xptr>supper - I frequently go to bed without supper; I had cocoa at tea time, with my daughter - I cannot say whether Harper was there then; twelve o'clock is rather a late hour to go to bed, but I have nothing to do - he did not dine at home on the 12th; he had been to look for his mate, and he could not find him - he went out in the morning, and did not come home till twelve o'clock at night; he had been to Hackney to see for work, and got with a shopmate or two - he had nothing to do at the office the next day, but he went by as I am told.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What made him stay at home so long as nine o'clock that morning? A. He was very slack of work, and said it would be time enough for his mate; I cannot say what time I got up, but I was partly dressed when the news came that my son was confined - I am lame, it takes me an hour to dress.</p>

               <p>JANE CROCKFORD. On the 12th of May, I heard my brother come home about twelve o'clock; he bade me good night.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.What time did you go to bed? A. About half-past eleven, or a little before twelve o'clock- I did not know Pearce till I saw him at Lambeth-street; I did not know Bateman - my father is old, and gets up late - sometimes at ten or eleven o'clock, sometimes twelve; I cannot say what time he got up on the 12th. I am a glove-maker, and work for Mr. Butts, in Leadenhall-street- I cannot exactly say whether my father had dined at home that day, or whether I was at home at tea; I had been to Leadenhall-street on the 10th, but I do not think I went on the 13th - I cannot say whether my father and I drank tea together - we generally have cocoa for tea; my brother went out at half-past nine or a little before ten o'clock that morning - he was in bed at eight, when I got up; I have one key of the street-door, and Mr. Harper has another - Harper went out, I believe, about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he dine at home? A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MAYNE. I am a sawyer, and live at No. 7. Gower-place, Mill-yard, Cable-street - I know Crockford- I have been a mate of his. On the 12th of May I was with him (but not at work) from half-past twelve o'clock at noon till a quarter before twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.What were you doing? A. I met him opposite Mr. Richmond's, in Old-street-road - I did not go in there: we went and had two pints of beer at a public-house at the back of the Vinegar-yard - we then went to Cambridge-heath, stood on the bridge for half an hour, and saw a young fellow who is waiter at the Rose and Crown public-house; we went into the Hare public-house, and had a game at skittles; this was about five o'clock - we had passed some time at the other house, where we went to have some beer; I do not know where the prosecutor's buildings are - there are new buildings in many parts about there; I was with Crockford till a quarter before twelve at night, I then went home and went to bed.</p>
               <p> - PEARCE. I am Pearce's father. He was at home on the night before, and the watchman came and took him against my house - he said there were two more in it - I went to speak for my son; Kettle came out, and said,"You may go home, and make yourself comfortable, not one of us can swear to him;" when the two lads were taken, they wanted to lay it to my son, and then Howard said it was Bateman.</p>

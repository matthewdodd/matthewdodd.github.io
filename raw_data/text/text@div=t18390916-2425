On the afternoon of the 11th of September, I was near the Monu<lb></lb>ment, about half-past one o'clock, and at five minutes before two o'clock, I noticed the prosecutrix there—I saw the prisoner, and watched him—he stood behind the prosecutrix two minutes—the was looking over the rails where the young woman who threw herself off had fallen—she was driven away by the policeman, but returned and stopped about three minutes longer, and the prisoner was there at the time—I saw him lift up her pocket and take something, and leave suddenly—I went after him, and saw him put some silver into his pocket—I went to the prosecutrix, and asked if she had lost any thing—she said, "Yes, some silver and a sovereign."</p>

Pray, said I, do not stop me, I have but a trifle in my pocket, and am a poor widow. He said, D - n you, do not tell me you are a poor widow, deliver to me what you have got upon the spot, or you are a dead woman; I will have your money or your life before you wag a step farther. The child ran from me crying, I put my hand into my pocket, and gave him about 3 s. Said he, is this all you have got. I said it was. Then he said, D - n you, what have you got in your bundle? I said nothing but a few things for myself and a child. D - n you, said he, I will have that or you are a dead woman this moment. I am fare that during this time his pistol was at my head and breast six times at least. I gave him my bundle, upon which he ran away as hard as he could, and I ran on to the child, [the bundle produced in court, all but the man's shirt, and deposed to at the property of the persons mentioned in the indictment ] I found my shift in Abbot's lodgings in a box; the other evidences will give an account of the other things.</p>

            . I live at Hammersmith, and have a town house in Great Brook-street; Mary Crook is my wife's sister, and she lives with me. She coming home, and relating this robbery to me, some time after some of my neighbours supposing it might have been committed by one Price, told me if so, very probably the goods were to be found at a pawnbroker's, one John Clare's, in Duke-street. I got a search-warrant on the 7th of this instant February, and went and searched his apartment; he lives at the house of one Elkins, up one pair of stairs; there I found all the things mentioned in the bundle, except the shirt and shift. On the Monday after a messenger came and told me the two prisoners were in custody, and they were brought before the Justice, and there Abbot denied the robbery. The woman said the things were her property, and that she had had a child that died some time before, to which the child's cloaths belonged, and she acknowledged the pawning of them there. She passed for the prisoner Abbot's wife.</p>

               <p>Brown's Defence.</p>
               <p>I carried the goods to the pawnbroker about three days after I heard this robbery was committed. About three in the morning I was going out, and in Duke-street, just by my lodgings, I met a woman with this bundle in her hand. She asked me if I would buy the things in it, and opened them; I looked at them, and asked what she would have for them. She said she was in distress for money, and would sell them for 4 s. and I unfortunately bought them of her for 2 s. 6 d. Abbot and I live together, but I mostly go by my husband's name, which was Brown; I do not say Abbot is my husband.</p>

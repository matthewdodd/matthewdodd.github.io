               <p>THOMAS HOBBS. I am a watchman of Whitechapel. At half-past two o'clock on the morning of the 13th of January, I met the two prisoners; I followed them to Rosemary-lane, where I called another watchman - we went and took them: I asked what they had got - they said, clothes belonging to their husbands, and they had taken them out of pawn; I said I did not believe it, being that time in the morning: the things were under their shawls - I took a hat and a close body coat from Williams.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FOLKER. Hobbs called me to his assistance, and I secured Sullivan - she said she had got her husband's coat, and I found this light drab coat on her.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BROWN. I took charge of the prisoners. I found this handkerchief in Sullivan's pocket, and this other was in the great coat pocket.</p>
               <p>GEORGE EASTHAM. These are my property. I had been spending the day in town, and had no memory; I met the prisoners in Oxford-street - I me Sullivan first, who asked me to treat her; I refused at first, but I did treat her - another woman was with her, but I cannot tell whether it was the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>SULLIVAN'S Defence. We were coming home, and met with this parcel at a door - we took it, and the watchmen detained us; we were making the best of our way home.</p>

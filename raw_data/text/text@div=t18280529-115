A boy came and told me it was gone: I went and missed it - I had seen it the night before; I met Rivers with it on his shoulder about twenty minutes after - I watched him down Turnmill-street with it, and at the corner of Greenhill's-rents he met a man with a cart - he put it into the cart, and they went on with it; I got a constable, and gave them into custody. Payne was by the side of Rivers - I do not think I said anything to them; Rivers had been in my employ two years, and had a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Did you not know he was living with Mr. Caudwell ever since? A. I did not; it happened about twenty-five minutes past six o'clock - I believe the milk was delivered right at the Middlesex-hospital; Mr. Cleeve manages the business - I did not see the milk put into the can; it was warm when I took it out - I cannot say water was not mixed with it, because the prisoner was trusted to measure it - I took it from Beavan's hand, just under his window; he keeps a milk-walk.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. Yes, he dealt with the concern about two months before, and knew Walton was in their service - the hospital people keep a key of the can.</p>

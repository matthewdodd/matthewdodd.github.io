On Monday night, the 12th of October, I met a woman in Rosemary-lane—I went home with her, to No. 2, Crown-court—after I had been there ten minutes we had been talking about having some liquor, and I had just given the money to the woman—the rum was brought in—I received the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—Brown then came in the room with a child in her arms—she remained in the room till the other woman came back—the half-sovereign I sent out was in a purse—I took it out without taking my purse out of my pocket—I had thirty-three sovereigns and a half-sovereign when I went into the house—I took the half-sovereign out, and there were in that pocket thirty-three sovereigns in the purse and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after I had re<lb></lb>ceived this change—there was then a bustle in the room—the chair was thrown against the bedstead, the candlestick pulled away, and the light put</p>

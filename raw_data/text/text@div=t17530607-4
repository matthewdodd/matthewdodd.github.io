On the 22d day of May I went down into my kitchen, and saw the prisoner there, she hid herself in the closet; it was between 9 and 10 o'clock, I asked who was there, she gave me no answer, I stept to her, and said, What do you do here? She said she was waiting for a person in the house, I stept up stairs, and desired a young man to prevent any body from going out of coors, then I went and enquired of my wife whether there was any body waiting for her below, she told me no, I came down stairs again, and met her coming out of the kitchen, I called down John Green, and sent for the constable, and stopt her till he came; she had two handkerchiefs, with things in them, when the constable came, he opened it, I was present; there was the things mentioned in the indictment; on searching her further he found the stew pan tied under her petticoats, I charged the constable with her, he took her before the justice, she had very little to say for herself, she own'd she took the things.</p>

I was at work above stairs, my master called me down, I saw a woman upon the stairs, there were two bundles upon the top stair, tied up in handkerchiefs; my master sent me for the constable; when he came I saw him open the bundles, there were the things before mentioned, except the stew pan which dropt from under her petticoats: I went with them before the justice, she made but very little defence, I don't know that she said any thing at all.</p>

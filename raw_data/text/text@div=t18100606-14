            . On the 17th of April, about eight in the evening, I was standing at my own door; it was just dusk. I had information that the officer was waiting for a person that had robbed the shop. I saw the prisoner cross the way with the jean under his arm; the prisoner was coming from Mr. Sorel's shop nearly across to ours; the officer met him in the middle of the street and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him at any time in Mr. Sorel's shop, did you - A.I did not; the officer attempted to take him; the prisoner struck at him twice or three times; after he struck at him he dropped the property and ran off; the officer picked up the jean. I pursued the prisoner, the prisoner was never out of my sight till he was secured, there was a board in the jean when he struck at the officer.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was coming through Bishopgate-street on the 17th of April, a little after eight o'clock. I saw three or four suspicious characters. I saw the prisoner Davis, and another, go to Mr. Sorel's shop, the lower part of the window is board instead of glass; they stood a tiptoe and looked over the blank window into the shop. I watched the prisoner, and crossed over the way, being by myself, and spoke to Mr. Hughes's porter, and while I was speaking I saw the prisoner coming towards me with this jean in his arms; I stopped him and said, what have you got here? he said, you b - r, I'll let you know, and then hit at me. made a hit at him with my truncheon; he hit me again and I dropped on my knee; I made a catch at his waistcoat, the buttons broke, he got away; on his seeing Mr. Hughes coming he dropped the goods and set off; Mr. Hughes got hold of him, and then I got up to him and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in Mr. Sorel's shop at that time. - A. I was not positive what shop it was taken out, after I had secured the prisoner I went to a linen draper's shop. I asked them if it was their property, they said, No; Mr. Sorel's shop was shut up. I went there the next morning, they said they had lost the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. This was about eight o'clock the man stopped him, how lately before had you seen it. - A. I had not seen it since the morning; the person to whom it was sold lived in Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body at home in your shop at this time. - A. There were two men, they are neither of them here; the jean is worth thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

My partner lives upon the premisses; the part that was broke open is a sugar-house; my servants live in a dwelling adjoining to the sugar-house; it is all one building; there is a door out of one into the other, the same as out of this court down into the parlour; the men are obliged to come into the open air, the stair-case being on the outside; there is a door on the lower part to go out of the sugar-house into the dwelling-house; there is a door out of the house into the compting-house; and a door out of the compting-house into the sugar-house; I left it safe on the Friday night, but I can't speak so well to the hour as one of the men can, for he came last out of the sugar-house.</p>

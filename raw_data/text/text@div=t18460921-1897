I am married, and live in St. Ann's-street—the prosecutor Deane does not live at the house now—he did at that time—on the 17th of Aug., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in St. Ann's-street talking to Dean, opposite the house where Brown and Toy live—Toy came out and used bad language, and asked what we were standing talking in front of her door for—Dean said he thought anybody was allowed to stand in the King's higway—she then made a blow at me, and asked me to fight—Dean put me on one side and her on the other to keep us away—he did not strike her—Brown then ran and struck Dean—I saw Dean knocked down several times and kicked and ill-used, and Toy ran out, laid hold of the hair of his head, and dragged his handkerchief off his neck, and I took it out of her hand—I afterwards saw Adams going towards the Elms with a black rib<lb></lb>bon belonging to the watch in his hand—I did not see the watch, but I knew the ribbon—I had seen it on Dean's watch several times—I gave the hand<lb></lb>kerchief I took from Toy to my son John Harding—after I saw Adams going away with the watch I saw Murden in the mob, but did not see him strike or kick—there was a great deal of confusion—I could hardly tell who was striking and who was not—both Brown and Adams were on the ground with Dean—they were near enough for one to hand anything to the other.</p>

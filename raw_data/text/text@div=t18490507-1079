                  </hi> On Sunday evening, 22d April, I was passing along the high-road from Barnet to Hatfield, in South Mimms parish, with my brother—three <hi rend="italic">navvies</hi> came up, the prisoner was one—they all three laid hold of our basket, and asked what we had got—we said, "What has that to do with you?"—they tried to get it, and said, "What you have got I mean to have"—I was knocked down by the prisoner, and my brother by one of the others—one of them kicked me on the head—while we were struggling a policeman came up—I gave one man in charge; he got away.</p>

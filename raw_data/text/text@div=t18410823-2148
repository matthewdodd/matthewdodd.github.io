                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 1, Burford's-court—the prisoner lives at No. 6, in the same court, and a man named Timothy Driscoll, also—I do not know that he is related to the prisoner—last Sun<lb></lb>day week I went to Timothy Driscoll's, between twelve and one o'clock at night—he is my wife's first cousin—I was not paid my wages till eleven o'clock—I found the prisoner and him there, and both their wives—we had some beer there—I had some—I and the prisoner talked about scholarship—he was talking about a brother of mine—I said my brother was five years at school, and learnt nothing—the prisoner said all the scholarship my brother learnt was from Mr. Townsend, who was a gentleman in Ireland my brother lived with—I said, "Mr. Townsend never sent for my brother to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to see Sul<lb></lb>livan on the 15th of August, about three o'clock in the morning, at Bur<lb></lb>ford's court—I found him seated on a chair in his house—he appeared to be very much excited—a wound was inflicted on the left side of the neck, five inches long, about half an inch below the ear, extending from the side of the neck on to the cheek—it was more than one inch in depth—there had been considerable hemorrhage, from the appearance on his clothes; but when I arrived it had ceased—he appeared considerably excited, as if he had been taking liquor, I should think beer—I did not smell any spirits—he was not intoxicated—he was quite capable of knowing what he said and did—he appeared to be agitated by passion—I dressed the wound, which had extended through the carotid glands under the ear, and the external carotid artery was laid bare, but not divided; if it had been, I consider he would have been dead before I could have arrived—he has been under my care ever since—there is now every appearance of his doing well—I should say decidedly it was what is termed an incised wound, such as a knife or razor, or some sharp-cutting instrument would make—it could not hare been inflicted by any thing else—it was quite a clean cut; the edge was not jagged at all—I put four sutures into the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might not that wound have been caused by a broken piece of glass, if he was thrown violently on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think it could—a wound of that description could not be inflicted by a point of glass—if the edge of the glass against which he was pushed was proportionate to the length of the wound, that might account for the appearance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it have done so if the edge of the glass was of the common thickness of a pane of glass, or must it be sharper than that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think a piece of glass would have cut the wound so clean, the edge would be more ragged, and I should have found some small pieces of glass adhering to the edge—I should say if the prosecutor had fallen down on glass in that position, it might have produced that wound, but not by falling against a pane of glass in a window.</p>

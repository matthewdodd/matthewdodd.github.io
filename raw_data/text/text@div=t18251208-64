On the 14th of November, the prisoner came to look at some black silk handkerchiefs - he said they were too small, and I was to get him some others by the evening. He returned in about ten minutes - during which time I had missed some handkerchiefs - I accused him of taking them. He said I hurt him very much by saying so - my husband came in, and I saw the prisoner take four handkerchiefs from his pocket, which he threw down and ran away - my husband pursued and took him in the square. I am certain of his person.</p>

On the afternoon of the 19th of April, I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoner cross from Red Lion-court, with something in his apron—I followed, and saw the lining of a coat in his apron; he pulled his apron round it, to hide it—I told a constable to go and stop him, which he did, at the corner of Shoe-lane—I instantly went over—he was asked what he had in his apron—he said a coat and a pair of trowsers—I asked where be got them from—he said from his sister's—I asked where he was going to take them, he said to his sister's—I asked where his sister lived, he said, "Just up here," pointing up Shoe-lane—I directed the constable to go with him.</p>

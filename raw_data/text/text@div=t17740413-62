I was with Mr. Vevers and Miss Potter when they were robbed; coming towards Kensington from the Gravel-Pitts, three men came up and desired us to give way, which we did; then the three men pushed us up against the wall, and desired us to deliver our money, or they said they would blow our brains out; they went first to Mr. Vevers; I saw them take his watch; I was frightened and did not take particular notice of them, so that I cannot swear to their persons; the prisoners resemble two of the men that robbed us very much; afterwards they robbed Miss Potter; one produced a pistol, and gave it to another; they robbed me of three shillings, and Miss Potter of a pocket piece.</p>

On the 29th of July I bought the horse of the prisoner, at Brentford, in Ward's presence, for 7l., all but 1s.; he said he had it from Smith, his brother-in-law, at North Hyde, and that Smith sent him to sell it; he asked 9l. for it - he turned it into Mr. Rodwell's field, which he had brought it out of - I found it there that afternoon; East claimed it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060113"></xptr>on Monday; the prisoner was taken on Monday - I had paid for it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Monday evening I received information that the horse was stolen, and saw it in a field at Brentford - I saw Ward, and from his information apprehended the prisoner on Monday, at Uxbridge, about three miles from East's; I asked if he had received any money from Cox for a horse on Sunday - he denied it; I took him to Ward, who gave the account he has now, in his hearing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going by Botwell on Friday, and saw John Smith; he asked me to go to Moore's, the jobber, at Brentford, and ask him if he wanted to buy a horse - I went, and he was not at home; I returned to Smith, and he asked me to come at six o'clock on Sunday morning, and bring the horse to Ward's house; I did so, and told him Smith had a horse to sell - he gave me 5s. for my trouble.</p>
               <p>JAMES COX. I did not see any John Smith about the house.</p>
               <p>JAMES SOUTH. I found 10s. 7d. on the prisoner, and asked what he had done with the rest of the money he had received from Cox - he said, "Go to my wife, and ask her for what I gave her last night;" I went, and she gave me two sovereigns - I said, "Is this all you received from your husband last night?" she said No, and then brought me two sovereigns and a half.</p>

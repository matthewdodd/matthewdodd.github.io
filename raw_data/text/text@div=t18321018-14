             is the only name I know him by; it became due on the 23rd of August - I saw my horse and chaise on the 14th or 15th of August, when I went to Kennington to look for it; I went to the Horns, where he said he had put it up - I got no account of it there; I inquired at several places, and at last saw it standing at a public-house door in Kennington - there was nobody with it, so I got into it, and took the reins; a lad came out, and said it was his father's - I went with him to his father. Thomas Evans, in Belvidere-place, Southwark, then took it home, and have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. He had hired a horse and gig before? A. Yes, three times - the firs was on the 21st of June; he kept it longer than he had hired it for each time - he hired it first for two days and kept it six; then for four or five days and kept it sixteen: the third was for one day, and he only had it one day - on the 18th of July he hired it for a friend for six days, and he was to pay me; I did not know his friend - I had 7l. 15s. from the prisoner previous to the last hiring, and on the 18th of July he gave me 4l. more; that was after he had hired it the last time - it was towards his former account; I did not complain of his keeping it so long, as I expected to be paid for the hire - the bill of exchange was not paid to me at my own request; I refused to take it several times; I said I had a bill to take up, but my object was to get money from him - I got the bill discounted; on the 31st of July, when I received the bill, he told me his friend was down at Coventry on business, and I need not be uneasy, as it was perfectly safe - I saw him twice after that, as he used to call on a neighbour of mine on business - he did not call on me within ten days of my finding the gig; I called several times at his house, but could not find him - I cannot say when I last saw him I had known him about six weeks before this; I was often in the neighbourhood, and we smoked on pipes at the same tavern; Evans told me he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180026"></xptr>bought the horse and gig, and showed me a receipt, but did not say the prisoner had bought it of me; I took a warrant out against the prisoner the day after I found it, or the second day; I saw Evans, but had no conversation with him about letting it stand over - Evans said, "Let it rest a day or so," but I was advised to the contrary - I said I would sooner have my money than prosecute; the warrant was delivered to the officer immediately - I told him it was useless to go over the water unless I went with him; I was busy for a day or two, and could not go, but I told him to call in Shouldham-street, where the prisoner lived; he was taken on another charge - I called at his house once or twice, but the young man said he was out of town; there was a person with Evans, who he called Solomons -I have not kept him out of the way.</p>

            " - I have known him five or six years by that name; he said the horse and chaise were his own; I sent my son out with them on the 15th of August - he came back with the prosecutor and another person; I live at least three miles from Harley-mews.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been intimate with him? A. I knew him as a tradesman, but have not seen him latterly - I saw him the day before I bought the horse and gig, and said I was going into the country; he knew I had been in want of a horse for some time, that would do various works - I did not particularly want it for that journey; I had a horse and gig from him once before, but not more - I think it was the 6th or 7th of July; I kept it nine or ten days - I did not buy it: he offered that one for sale, and recommended it as strongly as this; I had it on trial, and not approving of it, returned it - I lent him 20l. on it, and took his receipt, which he has destroyed; it was not for 35l., but I took very little notice of it, as the bargain was not concluded - the money was returned to me, and the keep of the horse paid; he promised me two tons of coals for the interest; he was then selling them at 25s. a ton- Solomons' son introduced me to him about the first horse and gig, but he knew me well; Solomons wrote the receipts on both occasions, and some trifling money passed between them, which I understood was commission for some coals - I gave the money to the prisoner on both occasions; I paid him 35l. for the horse and gig - it was no loan; he paid me about 1l. 15s. for the keep of the first horse, but not as interest - Bannister came to my house soon after he got his horse and chaise, to know what was to be done, and we went to the Duke of York; Miller came in; I said to Bannister, "I don't rightly understand this business, it seems strange the man should sell a horse and gig which don't belong to him - have you ever received any money of him?" he said Yes, and I think said between 11l. and 12l., in cash, and a bill for 24l.; I said,"Well then, he has bought the horse and gig of you" - he said, "Oh, no, I don't know about that - the bill is not paid;" I am quite sure he said that - I did not tell Mr. Richards that all I wanted was 27l. 10s., nor that it was all that was due to me; I did not mention any sum - I said, "Where is Golding? had he not better come forward and arrange about the horse and chaise? Bannister don't want to injure him, nor do I;" I did not say I had not bought it, nor any thing which he could infer that from.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it the same gig that you had both times? A. Yes - I objected to the first horse, and afterwards the same gig was brought with a different horse; he came to me about eleven o'clock in the morning on the 18th of July, and said he thought he had a horse that would suit me, and brought it between two and three; I went into the country on the 22nd or 23rd of July.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg to say Evans had the horse and chaise three times, though he swears he never had it, but twice - Solomons, who managed the whole transaction and wrote the receipts, would be able to contradict every word Evans has stated, as to the sale and money, as Evans on one occasion received 7l. interest; Bannister told me he was so pushed for money, he had a bill to pay, and if I would let him have it, I might keep the horse and chaise, or if I returned them I should have the bill back again, or the money; I have lent him money on one or two occasions to take up bills; we had a running account between us, being out together smoking our pipes; Evans first let me have 20l., for which I gave him 2l. 10s. interest and paid for the keep of the horse; the next time I had 20l., and gave him 22l. 10s., and 3l. or 4l. for keep, and on the third transaction he gave me 20l., which Solomons could prove.</p>

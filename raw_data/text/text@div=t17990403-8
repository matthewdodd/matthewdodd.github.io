             sworn. - I am a watchman upon the Stamford-hill Trust: On the 15th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came past me with a bag, he threw it down, and I saw something move; I asked him if he had got a hare; he said, no, he wished it was; then my brother watchman asked him what he had got; says he there they are, and if I had not been stupid and drunk I should have been at home by six o'clock; says I they seem like geese.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from Mr. Dyson's house? - A. About three miles and a half; I asked him where he had brought them from; and he said, he had brought them from Cheshunt, that they belonged to Mr. Wilson that keeps the White-lion in Bishopsgate-street, and he was going to carry them there; I said I thought it was very old Mr. Wilson should send him for them, when there were so many coaches coming that way; he said I might do as I liked, they were Mr. Wilson's property; I then stopped him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been to see my daughter, at Edmonton, I had got rather too much liquor; I saw a man at Tottenham with a bag at his back, and he asked me to carry it for him, I did not know what was in it; just before I came to the Red-lion, I missed him, I thought he had stopped to make water, but he did not come up, and the watchman stopped me. <rs id="t17990403-8-verdict46" type="verdictDescription">

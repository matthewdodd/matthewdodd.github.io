I had just crossed the street. The prisoner came on one side of me and snatched it from me; it contained the articles stated in the indictment. I could not swear to his person till he was brought to the office, which was on the Saturday; he was dressed quite different to what he was before; at the time of the robbery he had a brown coat and velvet collar. I pointed him out from several others at the office. He had turned round to see if I was pursuing him. I pursued him through several streets, and had him in view all that time, till I lost him in an instant. I have no doubt whatever of his being the man. I have found none of my property.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles's. Reardon apprehended the prisoner, and gave him into my charge. I had described him to Reardon from the description the lady had given me, a quarter of an hour after the robbery. I went, in consequence of information, to Ivy-lane, St. Giles's, and found this coat and waistcoat, (producing them) thrown down in the corner of the room on some coals carelessly, as if they had been just thrown off. It is a house of ill fame.</p>

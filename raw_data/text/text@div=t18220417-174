On the 11th of February, I locked these things all safe in the stable at seven o'clock at night, and next morning at six o'clock found the boards pulled down, and the things stolen; they had tried to force the door open, but had not succeeded. About a fortnight after, I saw the bridles at Johnson's. The stable yard is fenced all round. Sullivan had come into the stable between three and four on the 11th, and asked if I had any horse hair to sell.</p>

            . I am a collar and harness maker, and live in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. On the 15th of March I saw Padgett in Smithfield-market, and bought the bridles of him. I said that before I paid him, he must go to somebody, and be identified, for I was afraid it was stolen. I took him to several people, who said they would be answerable for him, and I paid him.</p>

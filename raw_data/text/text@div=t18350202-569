                  </hi>. I live in Allertbn-street, Hoxton. On the 17th of January, at a quarter past eight o'clock, I was going down Goswell-street with a bundle on my left arm, containing the articles stated—when I was opposite Hatfield-street, a man came behind me, snatched my bundle, and ran off—I ran after him, and called, "Stop thief"—he ran on till he came to a crowd—a boy ran out of the crowd, and said, "Mistress, is this your bundle?"—I said, "Yes, where is the villain?"—he said, "He is safe, he is taken into custody"—I said, "Where is the policeman?" but I could see no one—they hastened me out of the crowd—I went on to the gentleman where I was going, and told him what had occurred—on the fol<lb></lb>lowing Saturday I was going to the same gentleman, and the policeman called me into a shop, and asked if I had lost a bundle—he took me to Worship-street—I saw the prisoner, but I cannot swear he is the person who took my bundle—it was a man of exactly his stature, but I only saw</p>

About eight o'clock in the evening of that day, I was in my shop—I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running, with a bundle under his arm—I started from my door to lay hold of him—he left the pavement and ran in the road—I pursued and overtook him, two doors from Golden-lane—he had no bundle then, but I am sure he is the person I had seen with it—I never lost sight of him—I saw the bundle was in a blue handkerchief with white spots, similar to this one.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 24th of July, Mr. Macmanus and I were coming along Sutton-street, just before one at noon, and I saw the prisoner Lee stand at a public house door with the landlady, and as soon as ever he saw me walking down the street, both the landlady and he turned in sharp immediately, I followed him very close, he ran through into a back parlour, where the other prisoner was; I got hold of him, and I felt the outside of his pockets, and I thought he had some pistols; I searched his pockets, and found these four table spoons and marrow spoon, I secured him, and Macmanus searched the other; I looked at the clock, and it wanted a quarter of one, as soon as I got down to the office, a gentleman brought a spoon to match them with. Lee said a man gave him the spoons to carry: his turning back so sharp gave me a suspicion.</p>

               <p>Court. If you harbour these people, knowing what they are, you are not only liable to lose your licence, which it is the duty of the Magistrate to take from you, but you are further liable to be prosecuted as an accessary. - I knew no more than this child.</p>

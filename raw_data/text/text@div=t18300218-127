On the 15th of February, about a quarter to two o'clock, I was at the <placeName id="t18300218-127-crimeloc700">Old White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18300218-127-crimeloc700" type="placeName" value="Old White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly"></interp>

               <p>JAMES TALLY. I am nearly eleven years old; I go to church, and believe persons who tell lies will be punished in the next world. I was standing by the Old White Horse Cellar, against the lamp-post - the prosecutor was two yards from me; two boys were together - I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take the handkerchief out - he delivered it to the other boy; I sweep a crossing close by the place - I told a gentleman what I had seen, and he informed Mr. Strathern; two men laid hold of the two boys, one got away, and dropped the handkerchief on the ground - the prisoner was detained; I am sure he is the person who took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me near the gentleman's pocket? A. I saw you put your hand into the gentleman's pocket, and take out a handkerchief; you delivered it to the other, who dropped it.</p>
               <p>JAMES FISHER. I am a Police-constable. I was called from the opposite side of the way; a gentleman had Smith in custody, and gave him in charge for stealing the handkerchief; he said nothing to it - I asked if any body had seen him do it, and Tally said he had - I have had the handkerchief ever since.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been on an errand for my master to Knightsbridge; I came Piccadilly way home - there was a crowd assembled at the coach office; I was passing through, a gentleman laid hold of me, and said I had stolen his handkerchief - I said I had not seen one; he gave me in charge - the gentleman then said, "I cannot swear I saw him near my pocket, nor did I feel any thing, but I have lost my handkerchief;" he had it then in his hand - the gentleman who took me laid hold of another lad, and let him go; as we went to the watch-house the Police-man told the lad he would get more by prosecuting me than if he was sweeping the crossing - I ask the prosecutor if he did not say so.</p>
               <p>JAMES FISHER. On my oath I did not make use of those words, or any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>MR. STRATHERN. I did not hear the officer say any thing of the kind to the boy.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. If the Magistrate was brought forward, he could prove the same; you may be assured it is true - the Magistrate asked the lad the meaning of an oath; he said he did not know - then he said, "You would not take a false oath?" "No, (said he,) unless I could get any thing by it" - the Magistrate said, "Oh then, you would, would you, if you could get any thing by it?" the lad said,"No, I would not."</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 17th of March I found the prisoner at a quarter-past ten o'clock, leaning against some rails; I found a silver spoon in her pocket with a crest on it - she was drunk; I took her next morning to High-street, and the Magistrate ordered me to go and search her box; she gave me a wrong direction, but I found her place at No. 2, Little Park-street; she did not tell me it was her lodgings - and no person is here from the place: this is the spoon I found on her person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you take 1l. 7s. from her? A. No.</p>

            . This is my mistress' spoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is your mistress' married? A. She is a widow; her title is the Hon. Mrs. Latouch - it is her title in her own right, not derived from her husband; there was a person employed under the prisoner as charwoman - this was St. Patrick's day; she was in liquor, but able to walk about - she was not to say drunk; I did not perceive her to be in liquor till she came down from Mrs. Latouch - I did not understand that she gave notice to leave, in consequence of the service being too hard, till Mrs. Latouch told me to discharge her, and I went to ask for some money to discharge her, then Mrs. Latouch said, "I don't think I shall give her any thing, she gave me warning;" the plate is generally kept in the sideboard drawer - the tea-spoons were in the pantry; I do not know that this tea-spoon was left in some wash - it was my duty to take care of the plate; I do not know when I had seen this spoon before; I know it to be Mrs. Latouch's by the crest, which is a star, and I know the pattern.</p>

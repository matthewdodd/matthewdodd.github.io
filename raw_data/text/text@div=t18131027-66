On the day stated in the indictment the prisoner came into my lodgings; he brought a bag upon his shoulders; he asked for a light; he left the paper there. He said, Charles has got a bill of parcels; he knows where to take it to. He carried them up stairs in a bag to Faint's apartment, and left them there. I took particular notice of the bag. I saw one of the bundles was a ream of paper. I saw at the time there was a ream of paper in the bag. I could not see what the other was. I then sent for Mr. Whitehorn, of Foster-lane, to come and look at the parcel.</p>

            , No. 39, Ludgate-hill. On the 11th of October, between seven and eight at night, I went to Faint's lodging; I there saw a bag which contained two reams of paper. That paper was the prosecutor's property, I have not the least doubt of it. The paper is worth about thirty-six shillings. Faint absconded that evening.</p>
               <p>- KIMBER. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 11th of October, after the clock had struck nine. The prisoner said he was innocent; he should not have done it if it had not been for Faint; he had put it in the waggon, and he took it to Faint's lodging. In Faint's lodging I found the paper, in this bag. I believe the bag belongs to Mr. Morgan.</p>

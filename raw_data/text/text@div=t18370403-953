                  </hi>. I am a currier, and live in Union-street East, Spital<lb></lb>tields. I know Mr. Hill, a coach-maker, in Little Moorfields—I have had transactions with him in business, in the course of which I saw the prisoner frequently, as his clerk. On the 5th of January, he called on me and brought this bill, saying Mr. Hill would be greatly obliged to me if I would discount it, that he wished to have the money, and I should be doing him a favour by discounting it—after a few words about it, I said I would give him 40/. towards it at that time—I merely said I had not a large stock of money at the banker's at the time—I had objected the day before to discount it, as it was not payable in London, it would not be of any service to me, and that it must be payable in London—he said be would take it back, and get it made made so—I said I would let bio have money on it when it was payable in London—it was merely "Accept<lb></lb>ed, T. Rich"—it was addressed, to "T. Rich, grocer, High-street, Croydon"—he brought it the next day with the words, "Pay<lb></lb>able at No. 21, Little Moorfields, "which is Mr. Hill's place of business, and I gave him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a cheque on Ladbroke's—I had accommodated Mr. Hill with a loan of money before—the cheque was drawn in the name of myself and partner (<hi rend="italic">bill read at four months after date, for</hi> 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.) the cheque was returned to me as paid by my banker—I have only one son in partnership with me—on the 3rd of March I received this letter by the twopenny post, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Hill next morning.</p>

I was, by my father's dog; I jumped out of bed, I looked out of the window, I saw a man going along my father's yard, towards the little house that stands at the bottom of the yard; I thought this man went behind the house, I lost sight of him for ten minutes; I was up stairs all the time; I saw a man with a white jacket on come up the same way; he went down, he had a bag at his back; I slipped on my clothes, ran down into my father's room; I told my father I thought there was somebody going to rob the little house in the yard; I asked him for the pistol, I got the pistol in my hand and ran down stairs; on opening the fore door I saw a man going along the road towards Mr. Burchell's enter field, with a bag at his back; I ran across the road with the pistol in my hand; he throwed the bag behind the gate, and stood up along side of it; I said my friend what have you got here; he answered there is nothing broke; I not knowing the meaning of that, said I want to know what you have got in the bag; he answered it did not belong to him, I know nothing at all about it; I said my friend if it does not belong to you I will take it, and you come along with me; he instantly followed me to my father's house; I did not take hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see your pistol - A. Yes, he did; after I got the bag into my father's house, I went down to Mr. Green, he manages Mr. Burchell's business.</p>

            . - Mr. Walford. Are you a constable of the parish of Bow - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner and when - A. Early on the 15th of May, between one and two o'clock, I was in bed, I heard a violent knocking at the door; I got up, the prisoner was brought to my door. After I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, I went and got a bag of broad cloth from the last witness; I have had it ever since; it was wet in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Wheatley.) Was the bag of broad cloth that you gave to the constable; the same that you took from the prisoner - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Paxton.) Have you measured it - A. Yes, there is seventeen yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you walk about the premises in the way the prisoner was described to come - A. I did; I found two more pieces of broad cloth rolled up laying over the wall in the field, where Wheatley had seen the prisoner near this little house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare these pieces with the piece you have in your hand - A. Yes, they appear to sit altogether; in length they made thirty four yards.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Furman.) Where you had hung this piece of cloth were there twenty four there - A. No, only twenty three; there were twenty four the day before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Wheatley says very false, he says he saw me coming out of the ground and pitching it behind the gate; he never did; I was coming home, I went behind the gate to make water; I was not five minutes behind the gate, when this young fellow and two more came in with him and asked me what this bag was: I dont know says I, I have no call to it; he says I will have call to it; he took me to his father's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010056"></xptr>house. I went up into my own room and went to sleep; he went down to Mr. Furman and Mr. Green; they called me up; they took me out of bed up to the constable.</p>

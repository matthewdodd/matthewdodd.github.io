               <p>The prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, came to my shop; I am a silversmith in Red Lion-street, Whitechapel, I think it was the 20th, I am not positive, it was about dinner, between one and two, he produced a silver spoon, and said he wanted to sell it; I weighed it, and gave him five shillings an ounce for it; he went away, and in a short time brought five more; then I observed a crest upon them, and I asked him whose crest it was; he shook his head, and said it was his own crest; I weighed them, and paid him for them, and then he went away; the next morning on looking over the papers, I saw these same spoons advertised in the papers, I went to Bow-street, and met, I think, young Mr. Lockhart there.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the prisoner is the man who brought the spoons to you? - To the best of my knowledge I think it is the same man, I believe he is the person.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - He was not in this dress at all.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether it is the man or not? - I think I have no reason to doubt but it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Do you doubt? - No, I do not doubt but it is the same person.</p>
               <p>(The spoons produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Did this man, coming a second time with five more spoons, give you no suspicion? - Yes; on that account I went to Bow-street, thinking he lived in our neighbourhood, but I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very unguarded to buy such things of strangers? - It is very often done.</p>
               <p>It ought not to be done, and you should bear in memory the case of the silversmith in the Strand; your business ought to be conducted with great caution, in buying old silver, both for your own sake and the sake of the public.</p>

               <p>Q. Have the prisoner and you lived together since? - A. He claimed the privilege of a husband over me, and I could not help living with him, but I ran away from him six times; he threatened my life several times, and I put him in prison three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring him any fortune? - A. I had respectability, and some money, when I married him; but he has blasted my character, and he has done me every public and private injury; he has put a knife to my throat, and threatened to murder me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At the time he married you, what did he pretend to be? - A. He came to me as a person having a place under government, and going to receive a large sum of money; he told me, and I believe he had, just left a place called the Mary-le-bonne Coffee-house, which he had kept, and then lived in a private lodging.</p>

            Did he tell you, at the time he paid his addresses to you, that he had a place under Government? - A. He did, and that he was going to receive a large sum of money.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you heard what he has said, by way of defence? - A. I did; there is hardly one word of it true.</p>
               <p>Q. He told us, when he was going for the licence, that he told you, he had but one shilling and six-pence in his pocket, and that you gave him two guineas to buy a licence - is that true? - A. No; the week that I had him, I gave him change for a 10l. note, and going down Holborn, he said, I have spent so much money, that I have searce any left, will you lend me two guineas, I will pay you to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you, that he had but one shilling and six-pence in the world? - A. Quite the contrary; these two women that have been produced he cohabited with, they are both sisters, one of them he cohabited with eleven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he cohabited with them? - A. He has always told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were married? - A. No, since; he told me that he had spent a great deal of this last woman's property, that she was poor, and for the value of a few shillings, or a glass of liquor, he would bring them both to swear any thing. He solemnly swore to me, that he had been a widower sixteen years. The second day, he took an inventory of my things, and put a pen-knife to my throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Wilson-street, Barnsbury-park. On Tuesday, the 24th of July, I went out at half-past five o'clock in the morning—I am positive I locked my door—I have only one room, which is the back parlour-the window was shut down, I am positive—it had not been open that morning, but I fancy it was not fastened—I observed that it was closed before I went out—I cannot say whether I shut the street door or not—I returned at seven o'clock in the evening, and found the room-door tied up with a cord—the staple of the lock had been wrenched off inside—I found a rasp and a table-knife on the bed—I suppose they had got in at the window, and forced the door from inside, because the door-staple inside was broken—it could not have been done I from outside—I missed the articles stated in the indictment—these things produced are all mine—they are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner is a total stranger to me—I saw her the evening before, about a quarter after eight o'clock, and she asked me if Mrs. Goddard was at home—that is my land lady, who lives in the next room—the prisoner was then at the door—I was in the room, she knocked at my door, opened it, and asked me the question.</p>

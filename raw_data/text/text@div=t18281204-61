            . I am a constable of the City. On the 4th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with a person following the prosecutor in Fleet-street; I saw him attempting his pocket, and get the handkerchief out a little way just before I came to the Bolt-in-Tun; I followed him about fifty yards further, when he got it quite out; I went up and seized the prisoner, and took the handkerchief from him - the other went away while I was struggling to get the handkerchief from the prisoner; I took him directly after, but he was discharged, as I had not seen him do any thing - he was in company with the prisoner, and touched him over the elbows.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

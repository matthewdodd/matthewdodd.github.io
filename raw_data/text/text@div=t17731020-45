               <p>Q. Then you are sure they are not his work?</p>
               <p>Flowers. Yes; he said he was wickedly drawn into it by Hayward. When we took Hayward he said he had employed this man three years, that he gave him shelis to work, and money to buy shells; he said he gave him sometimes a shilling, sometimes eighteen-pence to buy them; it is impossible to buy mother o'pearl of this quality for eighteen-pence; he said before Sir John that was the most he ever gave him. On his cross examination, he said, a frame before it was worked up was worth two-pence; that he could not describe how he knew them to be his, nor could any one that had not served seven years apprenticeship to it, but that he knew his own work.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Flowers. On the 28th of September as I was at work near the prisoner. I saw him take some mother o'pearl frames out of a paper that lay by him, and put them in his waistcoat pocket; I was turning frames and he was making drops; the frames were laid there for the man at the next bench to him to pick a pair out of them; he was going to dinner; I did not say any thing to him; I was going to tell my master but was prevented. On the Thursday night I saw him polish some drops and put them in his pocket; I told my master of it that night; I went with my master and the constable to search Hayward's house, and the frames fitted to pins in his house. I have been apprentice to Flowers six years; I am used to turn and drill these frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the frames whose work are they?</p>
               <p>Loton. William Blakesley's; I know the work of every man in the shop because they all come through my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How does Blakesley work?</p>
               <p>Loton. I cannot describe it; they lie in a different form rather to another man's work. When we went into Mr. Hayward's house my master told him he had a warrant for him, and on what account; he denied knowing any thing of it; he said he had employed Morris, and had a man at work up stairs; we searched his house and found the frames and some drops; we went up stairs; there was no man at work, and the lairs proper for this work had not been used a great while; they were very dirty and rusty. On his cross examination he said the frames were quite plain when they came out of Blakesley's hands; that since that holes had been drilled in them, which makes them feel not quite so smooth.</p>

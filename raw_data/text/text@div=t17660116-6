               <p>Porter. I had, two or three times, but never was in company with them. They sat down and said to their companions, we wish you would give us a dram. Said the woman, this gentleman will give you a dram, no doubt. I was pretty well dressed. I said, I would give them a dram of gin: they said they never drank gin, they drank rum. I said, call for a quartern, I'll pay for it. A man came in with a sort of rattan, and fell a laying upon Baker with it. I said, that is very bad usage; if she has done any thing amiss, you should take her to another place: upon that, the son-in-law to the woman of the house, said to me, Mr. Porter, come into this room: then the man fell a laying upon me. When I was out, he advised me to go home. I went out with that intent. I had not got past two doors from the house, before the two women came running after me, and said, now sir, you have seen us righted: if you will go to the King's Arms, in the Fleet-market, we will bring some men to see you righted. We went there; there was the prisoner at the bar. The woman said to him,

            , such a one has used Mr. Porter very ill, for taking our parts. Who are they, said he, and one Doleman. D - n them, we will see him righted. Said Wright, before you go, call for a pot of half and half, to put us in spirits before we go. I had a pot of half and half; then up we went to the Bell again; there they fell to writing, and asking one's name and another's name. I said, it does not signify, I have got no matter of damage, let them go. Said they, we must have something to drink: said I, what will you have: they said, a quartern would be too little, so I gave them a pint of rum: then the women said, we have seen you righted; we beg you will see us home, and as you are pretty well dressed, no body will meddle with you; they said they lived in Whitecross-street; at that time I did not know where Whitecross-street was: then we set out, and they went to Lingard's, at the King's Arms: there the prisoner and Doleman borrowed some money of me. I had known the prisoner on board the Africa, Captain Wood. He was a foremast man. I said I would stay no longer. I paid for all. We went out, and when we came to the White Hart, by Turnagain-lane, they said, this is the last house that will be up, let us drink here: they went in all four of them; I followed and treated them there with a pot of beer. There they fell to fighting one among another. There came in 8 or 10 watchmen. The prisoner and Doleman went away; then I and the two women went out, and up Turnagain-lane. When we came to the Blue Anchor, they said, where are you going? I said, I'll go no farther with you. They said, you shall go with us to Whitecross-street. At the time we were disputing, came 5 or 6 watchmen, and took us all three up to the watch-house, by St. Sepulchre's. One of them, named Chamberlain, knowing me, they let me go, but said, pray what women are these? I said, God knows. I know nothing of them no more than the dead. I know no ill of them. They let them go.

When we were 2 or 3 yards in it, I said, I do not understand this part of the town: they said, they would shew me the way to Whitecross-street. Are you afraid of this place more than us? I said, if a woman is not afraid, I need not. They turned on the left till they came to the second door; they knocked at the door, and I heard a whistle immediately in the court. I was immediately surrounded by three men, and the two women. The prisoner was one: he took a truncheon from under his coat, and said, you old blackguard, have we got you here at last? Mrs. Barnsley opened her door, with a candle in her hand (I found the house the next day.) They swore they would have my life, money, and cloaths, before they left me. I said, for God's sake have mercy, I'll freely forgive every one of you. They laid on me with a great stick. The blood ran down me, and I was in a miserable condition. I held by the women; they pinched me to make me let go. At last, one of the men catched me by the heels, and hawled me down; they drawed me to the next door, and from thence to the dunghill: there I catched the prisoner's hand in my pocket, with a handful of money. I held it. I can swear very safely to him. The man that pulled me down was a tall man, neither Doleman nor the prisoner. I lost a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160009"></xptr> guinea, and 12 s. 6 d. after he had taken that, Doleman came and cut my pocket out; saying you old dog, here is your money, and totes. I heard it rattle. So the prisoner had not all, the watchman came crying the hour 12, then they quitted me, and ran away; the prisoner came back, and made a push at my hat; I got hold of him, and hawled him out into Chick-lane, and begged the watchman would assist me: he said he durst not, for if he did he should be murdered, there was such a gang of them; then came the other two men, and two women up, and rescued him.

             sent his wife to my house in Cow-cross, to let me know he wanted to speak with me. I went with her to her room up two pair of stairs, in Sharp's-alley; he asked me what he owed me: I said 8 l. he had got some foreign money, and wanted to pay me. I said I do not care to take it: said he do not be afraid, I found them in a box in Moorfields. I said I will give you my debt, rather than take them; by his persuasion I bought 7 l dollars, and some gold of him, for betwixt 22 and 23. He bid me sell them any where, for he found them honestly.</p>

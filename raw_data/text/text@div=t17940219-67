               <p>I live in Carrier-street, St Giles's; I keep a lodging house; I never saw him in my life before yesterday morning; his wife came and took a room at my house yesterday was a week; I never saw him till yesterday, his wife took the lodgings, and he came into the house to lay there when he thought proper; his wife was sent to Bridewell, and his wife being put into Bridewell, I had a strong suspicion about the man. I got up yesterday morning early to go to work, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190145"></xptr>five o'clock, and my wife says to me, I heard a strange bustle in the night, between one and two o'clock, William, do you light a candle and go up stairs, and see what it was with that strange man; I went and got a light of the watchman, and went up stairs, and went to the door, and knocked sometime at the door before I got an answer, he lodged in the two pair of stairs, at length this man opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there alone? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with him? - A girl of the town that he brought in from the street. My wife she came up and came into the room, and asked for her rent, the week being expired, which he refused paying; my wife asked him how came he to bring that girl into the room, and into her bed? he replied it was his sister; I said it was very uncommon for a man to have his sister in bed with him. My wife turned about and see this lumber of baskets in the room; I said to him, this is what you have been robbing all night; I told my wife to keep the door secure till I called the watchman; accordingly Hogan, the watchman came, and the watchman took him and linen to the watch-house. The constable of the night viewing of the linen and the letters on them, said he thought he could find out where they belonged to, and he came up to my house, and he looked at the baskets, which he said were part of the property, and they were taken to the bench of justices, at Marlborough-street, and there they bound me over to come and tell the court, which is a very heavy loss, because I am a very poor working man.</p>
               <p>DAVID COLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of the night. Yesterday morning, about half after five, the watchman brought the prisoner to the watch-house and the cloths, I asked the prisoner whether the cloths were his property? he told me he had found them; I examined the cloths and I found they were marked W.Phillips on them; I took the charge, and I locked him up; after I had taken care of the prisoner I left him there, and went and searched his lodgings, I went to his lodgings and I found two flats in the room with the same name there is on the cloths, we left them in custody of Mr. Bowen, the man that keeps the house; after that we went to the watch-house again and stopped my time. In the morning I went up to the Green Man and Still, to see if I could find out the owner; they told me Mr. Phillips's waggon put up there, I should find the book-keeper there; I went there and I asked him if he knew of Mr. Phillips's waggon being robbed? he said no; I asked whether it put up there? he said, yes, then I shewed him the cloths, and marks, and asked him if they were Mr. Phillips's? he said, yes. We went together then to Marlborough-street; he was examined then before the magistrate, and committed to prison.</p>
               <p>Holt. One of these cloths is marked with the name at full length; the other is not marked at all; they generally have one in each hamper, in order to know who the meat comes from; he finds hampers for the whole of the butchers, but not cloths, therefore we know by the name who they belong to; these baskets were butter flats but these cloths were put into the hamper where the meat had come from; these cloths were in the meat hampers returning home, not in the flats. The flats were at the tail of the waggon, and tied in such a manner that it was impossible to get them out without cutting the rope; the waggoner is not here; I made enquiry at the Green Man and Still, and they told me his ropes were entirely cut to pieces; I saw the ropes of the waggon fast; the cloths was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190146"></xptr>an hamper with some other goods, a large mat of leather, and two half firkins of oysters, very heavy goods, I dare say the whole would weigh two hundred weight if not three hundred, and the cloths lay at the top of the goods in the hamper; the ropes of the waggon when I saw it was fast.</p>

               <p>Q.Can you at all say whether these were the cloths that you set out with Thursday night? - I know it very well by the mark, and I know there was no others of his in town at that time. These cloths are never left, we always return them the day they come up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the flats? - Yesterday morning. One thing Mr. Bowen omitted in his evidence.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowen. Have you any thing more to say? - He first said yesterday morning, that he was a butcher by trade, and the girl told him before his face that as soon as he pulled out the linen, he pulled out some skewers, which he threw down under the grate, and the constable picked them up and put them in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming home Thursday night, between nine and ten o'clock, and I saw these two baskets and these cloths lay down in the broadway of St. Giles's, laying down in the middle of the road, I took them up and carried them into my room. Between five and six Mr. Bowen and his wife came up into my room, and asked for the rent; I said it was not due; he then snatched up these two cloths and said he would keep them, and his wife took and slapped me in the face twice; then Mr. Bowen ran and fetched a watchman from the watch-house, and came back with the cloths.</p>
               <p>Q. To Holt. You did not see the waggon set off? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether they were taken from the yard or past, you don't know? - I know they were not taken from the yard; all that I know of it, is, that he left word at the Green Man that his waggon was cut open in St. Giles's.</p>

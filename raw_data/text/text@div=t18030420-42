I had no suspicion of their robbing me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you a partner? - A. No; my wife sometimes serves in the shop when I am out, and was in the shop at the time, but is not here to day. I have no shopman.</p>
               <p>- OWEN sworn. - I am a butcher, and saw the prisoners turn down a gateway opposite my door, No. 6, Sun-street, in great confusion; I suspected them, and went to Coombe's, and told him which way they went; he followed them, and took them; I did not see them drop any thing.</p>
               <p>SARAH OWEN sworn. - I was in my husband's shop, and saw three women come out of Mr. Coombe's in a great hurry, go down a gateway, and stop, but I saw no further; I cannot say whether the prisoners are the women.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SAPWELL sworn. - I am an officer, and took charge of the prisoners, and produce the cotton, which was delivered to me by Mr. Coombe.(The cotton produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harcourt's defence. I went into the shop to buy a piece of cotton to make a frock for Jackson's child; the prosecutor's wife served us, and I never saw the property till he came up, and took us with it under his arm.</p>
               <p>Jackson's defence. I went with Mrs. Harcourt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200052"></xptr>to buy the frock, never thinking of any thing happening, and never saw the cotton till I saw it under the prosecutor's arm.</p>

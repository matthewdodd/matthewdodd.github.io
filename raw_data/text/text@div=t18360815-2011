                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. William Winterbourne—we are linen and woollen-drapers, in Blackman-street, Borough. The prisoner came into our service about March—we do the tally trade to a considerable extent, and are obliged to employ persons to make col<lb></lb>lections by the week—I have got the book that the prisoner kept in his travels—it was his duty to receive money on our account, and to enter it in this book, and account to me every night—his par<lb></lb>ticular days for collecting were Monday and Tuesday, and it was his duty to enter in this book, the sums received on each of the days mentioned, in this column from the person whose surname appears—there is no entry of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Stubbs on the 5th of April; nor of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Carpenter on the 16th of May, or the 27th of June—Stubbs' was a Tuesday's collection, and Carpenter's a Monday's—we have some of Mrs. Carpenter's bills which are in the book—it was the duty of the prisoner to enter on the back of each bill of parcels, the date and sum received by the week—on Mrs. Carpenter's bill there is a sum of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 16th of May, and 27th of June, but they are not in the book, and he never accounted to me for them—the writing on the bills is his—on the 29th of June he did not come, and a letter was received by Mr. Winterbourne.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Grave. On Tuesday the 28th of June, it was the prisoner's duty to attend in the evening as usual with his collecting book—instead of coming, he sent a letter about half-past ten o'clock in the evening—I took no charge of the letter, and cannot find it—it was not in his handwriting—in consequence of what the letter contained, I went to his residence, No. 3, Crown-square, Borough—he was not there—according to the note, I expected to find him ill in bed—I found him in the street dancing with a pipe in his mouth—I did not let him know I saw him—he has not accounted to me for my of the sums that have been mentioned.</p>

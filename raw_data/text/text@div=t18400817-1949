                  </hi>. I live at Godley, in Somersetshire, and am a farmer. The prisoner lived servant with my father—he had been living with us about nine weeks—I had a box, locked, in my bed-room—I saw it safe and locked last Sunday week, the 9th of August—there were some silk handkerchiefs in it—I did not see the money that day—I had seen it about a fortnight before—there were twenty-five sovereigns, wrapped up in a piece of white paper, in one corner—I went on Monday morning, the 10th, to examine the box—it was then unlocked, and the money gone—the prisoner had left our house on the Sunday evening, without notice—he agreed with us at first for one month, and then he agreed till next Michaelmas—he left about one month's wages due to him—I came to London, and found him at the Bell and Crown inn, in Holborn—I sent for a policeman, and he was taken—there was 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on him—he lodged in the next room to that in which this box was-two other servants lodged in the house with him, who are still at home.</p>

The pri<lb></lb>soner arrived there last Monday week, by the Bridgewater coach, at eleven o'clock at night—he had his supper, and went to bed—the next morning, when he was going to pay me, he told me he was a stranger, and as I saw he had some sovereigns, I told him he had better let me take care of them he gave me fifteen sovereigns, and in the afternoon he asked me for two to purchase something, and next morning he had one—he had no clothes but what he has on—I kept twelve sovereigns, and gave them to Butcher.</p>

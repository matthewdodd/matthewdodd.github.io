On Saturday evening,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150134"></xptr>the 10th of April, I saw the trees in her garden all safe, between six, and seven o'clock, and the next morning, between five and six, I found four plum-trees and four cherry-trees had been broken down and destroyed; one pulled up, and the others destroyed - the branches were all off; they had been against a wall; I afterwards found two apple-trees were destroyed, which had been full of bloom - they had been all alive, and were worth more than 10l. - I saw some footmarks, and had suspicion of the prisoner, from some language which he had used to me on the Saturday night; Mrs. Flint had warned the prisoner off her ground, and I had told the foreman to warn him off - I keep the Phoenix public-house, and on the Saturday night the prisoner was there; he wanted to kick up a row with six or seven others, and I told him to go along; he came, put his fist in my face, and said,"D-n your eyes, you bl-y b-r, I will go down the garden, and destroy every bl-y tree you have got"- I therefore thought he was the person, I fetched the constable to the garden, and sent him to take him on suspicion; his right shoe was taken off, and fitted to the marks in the ground; they matched exactly - he was sent to the cage; we went on board the prisoner's barge, and found some brocoli, which fitted to the stumps left in the ground - they had tried to break into the house, and if they had they would have done much more mischief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there not two persons taken? A. Yes; one is here as a witness - the nails fitted exactly in the footmarks; it was the right shoe - I do not know how many nails there were; there might be twenty-four - there were six nail marks in the ground; the prisoner had been drinking, but he was not so drunk but he knew what he was going to do - he was not sober.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I hope you were sober?" A. Yes - he was a little the worse for liquor; he did all the mischief, except taking up the brocoli - he made me go against my will to the garden, take up the brocoli, and take it on board the barge.</p>

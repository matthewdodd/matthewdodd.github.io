                  </hi>. I am shopman to Richard Hall and Philip Free<lb></lb>man. On the 15th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the pri<lb></lb>soner soner came to our shop, and asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs—I showed her several patterns, some single, and some in pieces—she bought one for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—she had a shawl over her shoulders—while I was serving her, I saw her draw something off the counter, and conceal it under her shawl—I suspected it was a silk handkerchief—I saw the corner of it under the shawl soon after—after she decided on having a handkerchief, I told Mr. Wilson, the head shopman, of it; and he told me to go on serv<lb></lb>ing her, and leave it to him—she paid for the one she bought, and left the counter—she did not go out of the shop—I saw her afterwards going towards the counting-house, away from the street—I did not see any thing taken from her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Hall and Freeman. Bloxsome gave me information—I saw the prisoner standing at the counter—after paying for what she purchased, on her attempting to leave the shop I told a young man to call her into the counting-house, and heard him do so—she came—I did not go in with her, but I kept my eye on her; and while she was going round the counter to the counting-house, just before she</p>

               <p>entered the door, I saw her draw two silk handkerchiefs from under her shawl, and deposit them on the shelf—I said to Mr. Hall, in her hearing, "These handkerchiefs I saw her draw from under her shawl"—I imme<lb></lb>diately took them up, and sent for an officer—Mr. Hall took her into the counting-house, and examined the handkerchiefs—they appeared to have been opened to be shown, and taken from the counter without being folded up—they are my employers' property, and have a private mark on them.</p>

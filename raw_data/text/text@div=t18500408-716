I have not passed any to-day"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him a penny loaf, but no money—there was time enough for him to get rid of the money when he joined the man and woman—he walked some distance with them—I produce the two sixpences, one from Hayes, and the other from Miss Harrison—they were both marked before I had them.</p>

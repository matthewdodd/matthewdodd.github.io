Then they asked me whether they could put the iron into the stable till I could carry it. Mr. Powell, a waterman, came while we were doing it; and in the afternoon I carried it, as the prisoner and Carty desired, to East-Smithfield. They had left three bars behind.</p>

I said, then I would go and get a search-warrant. As I was going, I met Williams, who told me he had brought it to Dixon's. I returned to Dixon's again, and his wife denied receiving any. I went to get a warrant, but the Justice not being in the way, on my return from the Rotation-Office I found the prisoner and Carty had been to claim the iron.

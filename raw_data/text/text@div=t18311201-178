            . I am a Police-officer. I heard a great noise - I went into Gray's Inn-lane; the prosecutor said he had been knocked down, and his hat taken from him - the hat is quite lost; I went down the court, and found the prisoner in a room: I then asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing else - he said Yes, his watch; the prisoner and two other women were in the room, and I saw the prisoner put her hand down - I felt, and found this watch between her stocking and her leg; there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010090"></xptr>one man in the court quite a cripple, but the man who I believe had the hat, has got away.</p>

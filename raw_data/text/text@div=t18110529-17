               <p>RICHARD TAYLOR. I am a soldier in the 2nd regiment of Tower Hamlet militia. On the 6th of April; between seven and eight o'clock, I was going to Leadenhall for half a pound of cheese, I was going along Gracechurch-street, I saw the prisoner look at a coat hung out at a door for sale; I saw another with him, I thought he wanted to take it; I walked down Gracechurch-street after him; he went to the shop of Mr. Willatts; he walked by several times, and looked in; when he found an opportunity he snatched down a parasol; I followed him; he ran up a court right fronting Fen Church; I lost sight of him a little while; knowing him by a brown coat that he had got on I went up to him; I said, what have you got here; I saw a bulk under his coat; he made no answer. The other ran away; he wrestled with me a bit; something dropped; I cannot say what it was. I held him and Mr. Willatts saw the parasol.</p>

             brought the man back with the parasol upon him, and before the Lord Mayor, he said he found it upon him. When the prisoner was brought into the shop the property was upon him.</p>

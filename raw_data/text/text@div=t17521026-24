They called for a tankard of mild beer, I ran down into the cellar with one silver tankard, and left another upon the shelf in the back room; but before I came up, my boy came down for a pint of beer, which he said was for a stranger in the back room; I replied, I am drawing this tankard for one of them. When I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260014"></xptr> came up there was only Welch sitting. I said, where is the other gentleman? He said, he is gone over the way and will come presently. Then I saw Smith standing at the tap-room door, and said, you are the person that came with the other gentleman. He said, no, he was not, he never saw him in his life. Seeing my tankard was gone I challenged them with it. Smith said, he was never in the kitchin, the boy and maid said he was there. We searched about the bench and found nothing where Smith was standing, but under the bench between Welch's legs there I found a base metal tankard, or what is called French plate, tied up in a handkerchief.</p>

He asked me for a pint of beer, so I went down into the cellar and told my master, there was a strange gentleman in the kitchin who had sent me down for the beer, and the tankard was gone when I returned with the beer. In searching about the tap-room this base metal tankard was found in a handkerchief between Welch's legs under the bench.

Then the boy went into the cellar to his master. Smith walked past me to the tap-room door and opened it, and was half out; then he came and sat down by me, with asking my leave by way of compliment; I said he was welcome.</p>

I went down into the cellar and left them in the room; Welch was seated but the other was not. I did not see the mug brought to Smith. When I came up again the maid was making them a welch rabbit. Then they were both seated, and as close together as two men could be, at a little table about two feet six inches long, in a settle near the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them converse together?</p>
               <p>Corrall. I saw them lean their heads together once or twice. Then they had two silver mugs standing before them on the table, and I observed when I came up the candle was removed from the table and put on the mantlepiece aloft, which was not a usual place. Smith's pint being out he ordered the maid to send the boy to fill it again, which was done. Then he desired the maid to drink with him, she refused it, and said, she had drank once out of the other pint. He desired very much she would, and at last she did. They staid some considerable time. I was sitting in a box just by, the maid was just stepped out at the door and gone a cross the way. Welch paid me for one pint of beer, the other for two and a welch rabbit, all in halfpence, and went away about five or ten minutes before eight o'clock both together </p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue in your house after you came out of the cellar?</p>
               <p>Corral. About a quarter of an hour. The pot was missed before the mugs were put out of my sight, or any body moved in the house, which was in about three or four minutes after they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260015"></xptr> gone. My maid,

               <p>Corrall. It was too late to go after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found it again ?</p>
               <p>Corrall. No, I have not. Hearing of the prisoners being taken up about a tankard, I went to see them, and swore they were the men that were drinking in my house at that time. The metal mug was produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this one of the mugs that you had in your house before ?</p>
               <p>Corrall. No, it is not. I am positive both my mugs were silver that were on the table, and there was no soul near the table but the prisoners. The base metal one was very much like that which Smith was drinking out of; having but one of that make, and finding two, we found it out directly. The other that I lost had no belly to it, only a litle rim round it, and it goes straight up.</p>

He staid there about ten minutes, then Smith came in and called for another pint of beer. which was drawn him in another silver mug. He sat down at the same table with Welch on a settle near the fire. Smith desired me to make him a welch rabbit.</p>

               <p>J. Stock. I am sure they were, Smith drank his pint of beer and desired me to bid the boy fill it again, I did. Then he desired me to drink with him, so I did, and then I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. I went out about four or five minutes before eight o'clock. I had not been out above three or four minutes, and when I came in they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you went out?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. I left them in the same place where they were drinking near the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they continued in the same place all the time they were in the house?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. They had. I sat facing them about half an hour, and for the rest I was backwards and forwards about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that silver mug which is missing last ?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. I had drank out of it the moment before I went out. When I came back again I went into the bar for a mug to draw a pint of beer, and seeing two of the same pattern missed it directly. It was in three or four minutes at most. We had but one mug of that shape which is lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go into the bar to look for a mug?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. Because the boy had taken the two mugs from off the table and set them in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Which mug was missing?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. The mug that Smith had was missing, and a base metal one put in its place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the boy here?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. He is not, being wanted at home.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I ordered the boy to take the mugs off the table and wipe out the score as soon as they had paid their reckoning, in both their hearing, and saw him set them in the bar close by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this base metal mug. Is that the mug you found in the bar?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it stand on the table when they were drinking?</p>
               <p>J. Stock. No, I did not at all. When Mr. Smith had eat the welch rabbit he took the news paper to read, but Welch removed the candle from the table to the mantlepiece and the other took it back again three times.</p>

            , On the twelfth of this month I went into the prosecutor's house about seven o'clock in the evening, there were two men, I don't attempt to swear they were the prisoners, for I took but little notice of them. I observed the candle to be removed from the man a reading two or three times. When they had been gone two or three minutes, and the master had bid the boy clear the table, the maid went into the bar and said, what strange silver mug is this, so it was found out.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. In whose possession has this base metal mug been since that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It has been in the possession of the constable.</p>
               <p>Welch's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have been acquainted in the house, and went in to have a pint of beer in the morning. I went into the city, and came again about seven o'clock and had another, and staid there some time. This man that stands here ( pointing to Smith ) I never saw in my life, till I was taken a fortnight ago.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260016"></xptr> I observed a man to come and sit down facing me, he had two pints of beer, but never spoke to me all the time.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence.</p>
               <p>I absolutely deny that of being in the prosecutor's house, or in the court where the house is. I will make it manifest, that I was at St. James's all the afternoon till eight o'clock at night, and after that at my lodgings in Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Are you certain Smith was in your house that night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am very sure he was, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. By what did you observe of him to know him again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He has a sort of a mark on his left cheek. I know him perfectly well both by his countenance and speech.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does he lodge?</p>
               <p>A. Plea. I don't know that. It is somewhere in Clare-market. I saw him the twelfth of October at our house in the Hay-market, we lived there then. I believe it was between three and four o'clock, he called accidentally and was very urgent to be gone, but staid till between seven and eight. My sister came home to drink tea, I believe it was a full half hour after seven, but then you must allow, as the justice told me, that the clocks vary. I believe there is a good deal in that.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business?</p>
               <p>A. Plea. I never enquired into that. He always appeared to me in the character of a gentleman, and I liked his company as a good agreeable man. I did, indeed I did. I came acquainted with him purely by accident.</p>

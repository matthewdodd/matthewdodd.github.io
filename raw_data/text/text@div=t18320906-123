On the 12th of July, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was making the best of my road home - I had been out with a young man who was going into the country, and staid out rather late; I was drunk - I met two women, whom I do not know that I had seen before; the prisoner was one: she spoke to me first, and then the other came up - I went with them to a house which I now know is in <placeName id="t18320906-123-crimeloc696">Hopkin's-street, Berwick-street</placeName>

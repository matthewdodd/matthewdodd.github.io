                  </hi>. I was an inspector of police up to a recent period. On 27th March, in consequence of information, I went to a cottage in the rear of Went worth Street, Whitechapel, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the forenoon—I was accompanied by several other officers—the street door was fastened; I broke it open with a sledge hammer, and saw the three prisoners in the room, sitting near the fire—Fowler was in his shirt sleeves—the door opens into the room—the house consists of that one room only—Phillips picked off the hob of the grate a part of a plaster of Paris mould, she dropped half of it on the floor, and Fowler attempted to stamp on it—he was immediately seized by Briant and myself—he offered a desperate resistance, and kicked us most violently—we succeeded in throwing him on a bed in the room, with the assistance of Evans, who had Phillips in custody—I took from her hand a piece of plaster of Paris mould, which I produce—both the females were then secured, and I commenced searching the place—I found on the floor the obverse side of a plaster of Paris mould for making florins—on a dresser in one corner of the room I found this galvanic battery in full action, with a counterfeit shilling in the bend of the wire, and a good sixpence—the shilling was undergoing the process of coating—on the dresser I found seven counterfeit shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—under the bed I found this iron ladle, with white metal in it, and three gets—I found three pieces of white metal, and three Britannia metal spoons, one of them partly melted, a piece of glass which is used for making the moulds on, and all the necessary implements for making and coating counterfeit coin, and several bottles with acid in them.</p>

               <p>I accompanied the last witness to the cottage—I saw the door broken—it opens into the room—I followed the last witness in—I immediately seized Fowler, who was rising from a chair—he fastened on me by my hair, and kicked me violently—we had a struggle for several minutes—the last witness assisted me, and we succeeded in pushing Fowler on the bed, and after some time in handcuffing him—I then found these four counterfeit shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the floor by the bed side—they are finished—I then searched Fowler, and in his trowsers pocket I found a good shilling, which has been used in solution for coating—while I was struggling with Fowler, I saw Usher stamping on part of a mould, which had been dropped by Phillips—Usher kicked it under the table—it was then out of her reach—she tried to escape out of the room, and was stopped by sergeant Brannan—I went afterwards with Fowler and Phillips and sergeant Brannan, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, to the police court—as we were going, Phillips said, "We are not married, sir; we have only been a few days together; he told me if any of you came, to be sure and break the moulds; how do you think I shall get on?"—I said, "I don't know"—Fowler was sitting there—he heard it, but said nothing—Usher was in another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Mr. Brannan.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. This mould has on it the obverse side of a florin, it is made of plaster of Paris—the moulds are formed on a piece of glass like this, or sometimes on tin—this plaster of Paris is in powder, it is put in the mould, and hardened with water—the impression on the mould is by putting a coin on the glass, and the plaster runs all over it, and then the mould is half done—here is a frag<lb></lb>ment of a mould with enough to enable me to see that it is the reverse side of a florin—here are Britannia metal spoons, and metal used in making the coin—this spoon has been put in as they wanted it, and so much would be melted away—here are twenty or thirty counterfeit shillings of the reign of George the Third, 1816; some of them are quite complete, and ready for circulation—here is no mould for making shillings, nor any part of one—here is a good sixpence, which has been used in the acid—this is the acid—here is the jar and the battery—here is a good sixpence attached to one wire, and in these other wires are the shillings—they are all put into the acid, and the acid takes the silver off the good sixpence at the bottom, and throws it on the bad shillings—they then undergo another process, which is scouring with sand, to take off the taste which they have from the acid—after that they are coloured, to make them look well when thrown down, like shillings that have been some time in circulation—almost anything will do that, sometimes they use a little black, or a little dust—here is a good shil<lb></lb>ling which has been in the solution—here is everything necessary for carry<lb></lb>ing on the business of coining—here is some stuff used for cleaning the coin—these files have white metal in their teeth, after getting the gets off; these are used to file the coins—this battery is on a large scale—it would hold half crowns as well as shillings—a good shilling would coat, very likely, a thou<lb></lb>sand—it would go a great way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fowler's Defence</hi>, I have known Phillips for some time, and we were to have been married on the 6th; I deny the charge of coining; the house was certainly occupied by me, and I gave a man my consent that these articles should be there, on condition of his acknowledging a debt due to me of 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I took no part in making these coins; I allowed my house to be used for such purposes without the knowledge of the crime, and without the knowledge of Phillips; I have stated this not to exonerate myself; I am aware that I must suffer, but I wish to prove to you the innocence of this female; I had allowed the man to have the use of my place for six weeks, and four of them had expired; I had contrived to keep Phillips ignorant of it, by sending her on visits or errands when anything was going on, but on the Sunday previous I accidentally said to her, "If anything happens, put those away which shall be at the fire;" she said, "What?" I told her to keep everything out of sight, and to say that she knew nothing of what was going on; Usher has known me the last three or four years, and knew that I obtained an honest livelihood; she had no thought that anything wrong was going on; she came in that day without fear, little thinking that within half an hour she would be in custody; is it likely that a man should leave the door of a house, when he was carrying on such a dangerous trade, on the <hi rend="italic">jar</hi>, or on only the common fastening of a lock, which would open with a kick? had I been in the habit of obtaining my living by such means, I should have fastened it, but though I was in the house, and knew what was</p>

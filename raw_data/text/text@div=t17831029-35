             lodged in my house on the first floor: I was in my house between six and seven o'clock, on the 3d of October, a servant girl called out thieves! I ran out of the back parlour into the passage; she said, the thief was gone out of the window; I ran into the street to pursue the thief, presently I saw a number of people coming to the top of the street out of Coventry-street, and going nearer towards them, I saw the prisoner at the bar, and a servant of Capt. Hazard's bringing the prisoner along with several others; I assisted to take him to Litchfield-street Office, he was examined and committed.</p>

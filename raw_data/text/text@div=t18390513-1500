                  </hi>. I am groom to Mr. Edward Protheroe, who is a single gentleman, living in Chapel-street, Grosvenor-square, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On the night of the 22nd of April I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock, in the back-room, on the same floor as the street-door is on—I had seen all the doors and windows safe before I went to bed—the kitchen window was fastened with a snap—I was alarmed about twenty minutes after three o'clock in the morning—I called the lad who sleeps in the next room—he went to the front-door, and the policeman gave him information—I went to the door myself and let the policeman in—he went down stairs and opened the kitchen door—I found part of the panel of the in<lb></lb>side window-shutter cut out, the window pushed up, and the curtain taken away which had hung between the window and the shutter—nothing else was missing—a pane of glass was broken in the window to open the hasp—I went with the policeman into the area, and found the two prisoners concealed in the coal-hole under the street—after they were taken to the station-house we found a dark lantern, a box of lucifer matches, and a very large spring back-knife, and the curtain was in one corner of the coal-hole—the window was fastened by a spring catch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the night of the 22nd of April in Chapel-street, which is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square—I was passing the prosecutor's house, and observed a pane of glass broken in the kitchen window, and the window lifted up—I waited till I obtained the assistance of a constable, and alarmed the inmates—I went down with the groom, and found part of the panel of the shutter cut—I found the two prisoners in the coal-hole, and took them into cus<lb></lb>tody—I saw nobody at the window—the curtain was handed over to me by sergeant Pullen, in Falwell's presence.</p>

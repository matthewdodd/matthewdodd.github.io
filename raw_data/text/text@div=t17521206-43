               <p>Q. Did you see him take it?</p>
               <p>White. I did very plainly; I was looking to see my lord mayor go by in his return from court; the quickness of the motion threw the handkerchief near as high as my head; I saw it fly up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner before or behind you?</p>
               <p>White. He was standing behind me, and I catch'd him by the collar, so he dropped it upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it fall?</p>
               <p>White. I saw it before it dropped to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there much crowd near you?</p>
               <p>White. No, there were but few people near me besides the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he gone far before you seized him?</p>
               <p>White. He was not got above a yard from the place; I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>White. He said the handkerchief was hanging out of my pocket, and he took it out in order to give it me, being apprehensive I should lose it.</p>

            . I was coming along St. Paul's church-yard, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner standing together.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Field. It was about a quarter of an hour after three o'clock; I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket and draw the handkerchief out; he dropped it, and as he stooped down the prosecutor catched him by the collar; then the prisoner said he was just going to give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words he said?</p>
               <p>Field. He said, sir, I was going to pick your handkerchief up to give it you; then the prosecutor took him to the Compter; the prisoner at the Compter said it was the first fact he ever did.</p>

I was with him almost instantly - I lost sight of him as he turned the lane; I brought him back - the handkerchief was given to me; I am not certain whether it was by Coleman himself or not, but it was taken from his bosom. It is but justice to state, that Coleman appeared very penitent, and I have also heard so from two or three persons who have called on me about him.</p>

            . I saw the two prisoners in Cannon-street, about half-past two o'clock, on the 1st of June; I watched and saw them walk together near Mr. Cox - I saw Allen lift up the tail of his coat with one hand, and, with the other, take out the handkerchief and give it to Coleman, who put it into his bosom; Mr. Cox turned round and laid hold of Coleman - I went and took hold of him, while he ran after Allen; I asked Coleman to give me the handkerchief, which he pulled out of his bosom and gave me - he said, at the watch-house, that he was in great distress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then Mr. Cox brought back Allen? A. Yes - he had lifted up the pocket quite gently - the prosecutor did not run after Allen till he had taken Coleman; when he took Coleman Allen was walking, and nearly across the street - Allen saw him catch hold of Coleman, and then dart at him, and he ran.</p>

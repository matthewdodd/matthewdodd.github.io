               <p>JONES' Defence. I know nothing of this young man. I had been to the playhouse, and was talking to a coachman when the witness, Phillips, took me and this young man, who was speaking to me about the play.</p>
               <p>DRICEMAN'S Defence. As I was coming out of the playhouse I met a young man, who asked if I would buy a handkerchief, which I did, for 4s. I put it round my neck, and had not had it on five minutes before the witness came and took me. I asked if he was an officer - he took out a staff, and said he would knock me down.</p>

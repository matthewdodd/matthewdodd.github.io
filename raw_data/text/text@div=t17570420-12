            . My father's name is Edward. I let the prisoner a ready furnish'd lodging, being a back garret up three pair of stairs, and he was to pay 20 d. per week. He took the things mention'd in the indictment out of the room.</p>

               <p>M. Rogers. He own'd it, upon my charging him with it, and that he had pawn'd them, and where; I went to the pawnbroker's and found them, and they were delivered to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the pawnbroker's name?</p>

               <p>M. Rogers. He is here.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was it not by your consent that I pawned these things?</p>

               <p>M. Rogers. No, I did not know when they were gone. When he pawned the coverlid, sheet and saucepan, I asked him about them, and he own'd it, and because his wife lay in my heart bled for them; but there was no consent of either my father or mother, nor me neither, and we did not take him up till after he had pawn'd the bed, which was some time after.</p>

The prisoner has pawn'd several things at our house; there were a bed, blanket, sheet and saucepan, which we delivered up to Brown the constable when he came.

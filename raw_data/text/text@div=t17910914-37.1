On the 27th of July, about ten in the morning, I returned out of my shop into the back kitchen; in about ten minutes I was called out, to know if I had sold a looking-glass; in about two minutes I came out, and saw the prisoner at the bar with the looking-glass in his hand; I pursued him on the opposite side of the way, that he might have no suspicion of me, and that he might not throw the glass down, and break it. When I came level with him, I immediately ran across the way, and stopped him; he then threw down the glass against my legs; it being a gilt frame, and wire ornaments, and it pitching on the back, the glass did not break at all. I was obliged to let go my hold of him, or step through the glass; I let him go, and he ran about ten yards; I pursued him immediately, and called out, Stop thief; and then a man immediately ran before him, and stopped him; the man that stopped him the second time brought him back immediately. I never lost sight of him. He is the man, I can swear positively.</p>

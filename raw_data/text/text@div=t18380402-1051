On the morning of the 24th March, before three o'clock, I was on duty in Wentworth-street, and saw Thomas Thompson—he had got a jacket and waistcoat on, and a pair of drawers, but no trowsers, shoes, or neck-handkerchief—he was standing in Wentworth-street, against a door-way—he complained of being robbed—went to the second floor of a house in Essex-street—when I got to the top of the landing, I saw the prisoner, M'Carthy, holding a pair of trowsers before her, coming out of the room—I said, "Halloo, what have you got there?"—she ran into the adjoining room, which was the back-room two pair and threw them underneath the bed—as soon as I had picked them out from underneath the bed, I said, "I have got the trowsers, where is the watch?"—she paid, "I know nothing about the watch, the watch is here"—while I was kneeling, I saw her go to a fife-place, and stoop I went and looked, and found two half-crowns, three shillings, one sixpence, and three penny pieces, and half the glass of a watch, among the dust, under the stove, where she was stooping—we then returned into the front-room two pair, from which she came with the trowsers—the sergeant was in that room—I said, "Look out, the watch is in this room, some-where"—the sergeant looked about, and found the watch in that room—we then took the other six prisoners, who were all in the room, to the station-house—after that, I went to No. 107, Wentworth-street, to the first-floor backroom, and found a pair of men's shoes, and On the table, a black silk neck-handkerchief, which prosecutor claimed.</p>

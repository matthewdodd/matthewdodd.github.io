                  </hi>. I keep a ladies' school in Canonbury-lane, Islington. The prisoner was my cook—on the 23rd of February, a little after eight o'clock in the evening, I saw her in the kitchen sitting by the fire, com<lb></lb>plaining of violent pains in her back—I spoke to Mr. Semple, a medical man, who happened to be in the house at the time—I went to the privy, which is in the garden, immediately after speaking to Mr. Semple, and saw some ashes or mould had been recently thrown down on the soil—I had a candle with me, and besides the mould, there were two or three garden-pots, or parts of garden-pots thrown there—I beard no noise—I then came back into the house, and went to the prisoner with Mr. Semple—she was still in the kitchen—Mr. Semple asked her if she was in the family way, or had been so—she denied it—he remarked some appearance of blood on her arm, which she said was occasioned by salting some beef, which I contradicted, as I had salted it myself—she complained of being</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Islington. I was at Miss Lemoyne's house on the night in question, and at her request went down into the kitchen to the prisoner, who was sitting by the fire in a state of very considerable exhaustion—I examined her externally, and found some flabbiness about the abdomen—I saw a good deal of blood on her arms, and suspected she bad delivered herself—I asked whether she had been in the family way, and whether she was married—she said "No"—I said, I suspected she had been delivering herself, and it would be well if she would say, and she had better say so to her mistress, as something might be done, thinking the child might be in the house, but she said, "No"—I afterwards went to the privy, and took the child out—it was a female—I found it lying partly on its back and partly on its side; the legs only were seen above the soil; the head and upper part of the body were buried with the ashes and mould—it was apparently dead, but I had heard an indistinct moaning before I took it out—I used a warm bath and friction, and ultimately restored it—I found the placenta in the cess<lb></lb>pool, just by the child—the umbilical cord was torn—Miss Lemoyne asked the prisoner, in my hearing, if she knew why the mould and ashes were thrown down—she said, she had not thrown any down for many days before—this was before the child was found.</p>

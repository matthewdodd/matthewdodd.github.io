                  </hi> I am a tailor, and live at Tunbridge Wells. On the night of the 19th of Aug. I locked up my house and went out, leaving no one at home—I had at that time a quantity of cloth there—I returned the next morning between one and two o'clock, found my house broken open, and missed about 200 yards of cloth, worth between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 21st Goddard, the constable came to me, and in consequence of what he said I went to the railway-station—a basket was there opened, and I saw my cloth there—it was repacked, and I saw it again in London—this now produced in it—I have some list here, to compare with this cloth—I am perfectly satisfied it is mine.</p>

Chitty, 2, Arnold's Paragon, Francis-street, Newington Butts, London"—after the hamper per was delivered there, I went into the house—I saw Morton and Eaton talking—the hamper was taken into the parlour, and afterwards taken to the station-house in Lock's-fields.</p>

Chitty—I then went in, and saw the two prisoner talking in the front parlour—I asked Eaton where the hamper was that had just come—she made no reply—I asked her to come with me, and I went into the back parlour—I there saw the hamper—I asked her what was in it—she said she did not know—I said, "It contains cloth stolen from Tun<lb></lb>bridge Wells, and I shall take you for receiving it knowing it to be stolen—she said she knew nothing about it—I asked where Mr. Chitty resided—she said she did not know, that he had left there six months, and asked her</p>

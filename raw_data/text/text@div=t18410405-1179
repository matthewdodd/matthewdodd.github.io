On the 1st of April, we had a coat hang<lb></lb>ing up within the door—I saw it safe at seven o'clock, it was brought to me next afternoon—I had not missed it until then—Cleaver and Arm<lb></lb>strong came to our shop on the evening of the 1st of April to purchase a jacket—I had none cheap enough for them—I said, if they would call in a day or two, I might have one to suit them—Cleaver was left in the shop last—I said to him, "Your friend is gone"—he said, "He is no friend of mine," and then he went away.</p>

We keep a second-hand clothes shop, in Monmouth-court, St. Giles—on the evening of the 1st of April, I went outside my door to buy some meat for the dog, and when I came back I found the three prisoners in my shop, and this coat on the counter—I said, "What is this?"—my husband said, "The lads have brought a coat to sell"—I said, "It does not suit me, I shall not buy it"—(I saw no jacket)—Armstrong said, "Won't you buy it?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I want a crown for it"—I said, "I don't want any thing to do with it, so take it away"—he said, "Well, if you don't buy it for a crown, I can pawn it for a crown"—the officer then came in, and took them.</p>

            . On the 9th of August I was going home in a chair, very much in liquor, and the chairman set me down at a night cellar by <placeName id="t17440912-4-crimeloc19">Charing-Cross</placeName>

I had 3 s. to pay, and I gave the man of the cellar half a guinea instead of a sixpence. I lost my purse, in which I had a two guinea piece and 60 guineas; though I swore but to 59 guineas, because I don't know but I might change one. I lost my snuff box. When I came home I told my wife I had been robbed; I went to the cellar and told the person that keeps it what had happened. He said if I would give him 5 guineas he would help me to my money: and the Prisoner was taken with the money upon her, and my purse was brought to me with 45 guineas in it, the rest of the money was gone. When she was before the Justice she fell down on her knees and begged for mercy; she owned the taking the money, but she denied that she took the snuff box.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Haddock; I was at the taking the Prisoner at Chelsea, we forced the door open and took her in bed about two o'clock in the morning. I was afraid there was a man in bed with her, but there was not; when I told her what we came about, she said she was a dead woman, and begged for mercy. She took the purse out of her pocket and said, here is the purse, it is Mr. Haddock's purse and money. - There were 45 guineas in the purse: she said she wished she had gone to Portsmouth , for she was to have gone there the next day , in order to go to Flanders .</p>
               <p>Jury . Did the Prisoner know Mr. Haddock?</p>
               <p>Mr. Haddock . I did not know her, she lived with a woman next door to me, so she might know me though I did not know her. <rs id="t17440912-4-verdict20" type="verdictDescription">

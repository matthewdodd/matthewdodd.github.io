On the 14th of April, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at a bull-bait; a man was talking with me, and said he had been attacked, and the person wanted to rob him; I said I would forgive anybody who robbed me, he said do not boast; I turned round, and was surrounded by a gang of about fifteen - they pushed me about; the prisoner came up, and asked the man what he was looking at, but he made no reply; the prisoner said he would fetch him a punch of the mouth. They knocked me down, beat me violently, and took my watch and half a crown from me. I am sure he is the man, I knew him before - one of his companions took it. The prisoner was the first that laid hold of me.</p>

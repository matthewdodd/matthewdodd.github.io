                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Green, who keeps a coffee-shop in Great Portland-street, Marylebone. On the 28th of April last the pri<lb></lb>soner came to our house, and asked for half-a-pint of coffee, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she tendered a shilling—I looked at it, and thought it was not a good one—I took it to my husband, to be satisfied—he said it certainly was not, and cut it with a graver—he went to look for a policeman—the prisoner walked out of the shop, and after she got round the corner, across Lang<lb></lb>ham-place, she ran very fast—she had not been told the shilling was bad, and I had not given her the change—she was taken into custody in Ben<lb></lb>tinck-street, close by—I followed her—when I came up to her the police<lb></lb>man asked if she was the woman—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You hare been passing a bad shilling"—she said, "I did not know it"—she was detained.</p>

               <p>MRS. RUMSEY. I had had the gown for twelve months; I never gave her permission to take it, but told her never to go into my room; my name is on the handkerchief at full length, and my husband's initials on the apron.</p>

I went up stairs and took the gown out to try it on, not intending to steal it - but hearing her coming up, I pulled my own over it till I could get it off in my own room; I came down to take it off; she charged me with stealing it, and got a man to hold me that I should not take it off till the constable came; I thought the apron was mine till I saw the mark.</p>

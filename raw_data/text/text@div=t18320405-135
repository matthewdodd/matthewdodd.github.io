            . I am a Police-constable. On Wednesday morning, the 7th of March, at a quarter-past three o'clock, I was in Red Lion-lane, Church-street, Stoke Newington; I heard some persons talk - I then saw the two prisoners coming down from Lordship-road, and the Green-lanes; when they came in sight, I heard one say to the other, "Go on" - I stopped till Head came up to me with a basket on his shoulder; I said"Where are you going?" he said, "To the Bull and Mouth, and I have a parcel for my master:" he asked me what time it was - I told him; he said, "I shall get there by four o'clock;" I said "You must go with me?" I felt the basket, and said, "You do not send baskets to the country without a direction, do you?" he said, "You may look at it if you like;" I said, "I must look at you as well"- I put him into the watch-house; I felt something warm in the basket, and found in it one duck, one cock, and eight hens - I then sent our serjeant after Higgins, and he had one duck in each pocket; I found the prosecutor the next morning.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Berry, Ludgate-hill, pawnbroker, I produce a petticoat and pair of stockings, I received them of the prisoner, on the 29th of March, at our shop, by the name of Mary Cox, I took them in myself, I am sensible it is the woman I took them in off; I lent her 8 s. upon them.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>It is my own petticoat, the constable knows I took him to where my gown and coat were made, and the constable knows that the person at home said, that they had made a gown and coat for me, but that her mother was gone to Brightheinnstone; the constable knows they belong to me. My Lord, I have a very good defence; the prosecutrix and I lived in a place together, and I told my mistress I would not live in one house with her; I said she was not a natural woman, and I would not sleep in one bed with her; and so it is through spite that my prosecutrix has taken me up, and brought me here.</p>

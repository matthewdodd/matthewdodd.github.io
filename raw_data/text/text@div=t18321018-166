             (Police-constable H 91.) I was at the top of White Lion-street - I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor on the opposite side of the way, in Norton-falgate; I saw the prisoner leave him; I had suspicion. and asked if he had lost any thing; we took the prisoner near Spitalfields-market; I told her I wanted her for robbing a person in Norton-falgate - she denied it, but I saw her hand was closed - I seized it, and took out of it 4s. and come halfpence; she said, "Give me 2s., and I will throw it away, and that will puzzle him;" I said I would not - she then said, "Throw it all away, or give it to me, and I will;" I said I would not; she said "Then it will lag me."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was counting some money when he came up; the prosecutor said he had lost 5s. or 6s.; I had 41/2d. in my hand, and three half-crowns - I had changed a 5s. piece. Witness. She said so at the office, but not before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said I was not the girl, and then he said I was; I told him to go to Mr. Fulcher's, and inquire if a girl had not changed a crown piece.</p>

               <p>I am second coachman to Lord Amherst, I missed two great coats, a box coat, and a surtout coat, in the evening of the 15th of April, when I went to bed; one was my fellow servant's coat, and the other was mine, one hung up in the room on a peg, and the other laid on the bed; there are two beds in the room, I sleep over the stable, I cannot say who stole the coats, I went to bed at eleven, I had been in the room at three in the afternoon and the coats were there then.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose the room in the day time is not locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many keys are there? - Two keys.</p>
               <p>Who keeps these two keys? - My fellow servant's key is hung up in the stable, and the other I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>What other servants sleep in the same room? - My other fellow servant, the first coachman.</p>
               <p>Any body else? - Only we two.</p>
               <p>Are there any helpers in the stables? - No, sir, all done by us two.</p>
               <p>Where was your fellow servant that day? - He was in the country with my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was your stable door locked or not locked? - Locked to the best of my knowledge, I had usually locked it.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether the door was locked when you came home at night? - To the best of my knowledge it was locked, I put in the key as usual, my room door was not locked.</p>
               <p>Do you know who stole these coats? - I am innocent of the affair, I was discharged from the Compter but was turned away partly through this affair, though I was going to leave his Lordship's service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Hill, of Mount-pleasant—he is a brewer. On the 3rd of March I was walking along, and the prisoner Kenny, whom I had never seen before, came and told me he had some casks to sell, and asked if I would buy them—I said, "No," and asked what casks they were—he said large ones, and that he had about fifty, but they were about three or so he wished to get out of the way—they were, he said, in Lansdown-mews, and if I Would come and fetch them I should have them for nothing—he said, "Come any time after dark"—I asked him how he came by them—he said that was nothing to me—I said I would come; and when I got home I told my employer, who directed me to take the dray and go to Lansdown-mews—a policeman went with me—we got there about six o'clock—a person, whom I should not know again, came to the gate—I asked if any stone-sawyers were in the yard—he said yes, I might go np and see—I went up, and saw the prisoner Cann—he told me there were the casks, and I might take them—I said no, I had nothing to do with them—I considered it was not right—he said he knew nothing about them—he would go and fetch his companion—he went out and fetched Kenny—we went down the yard—I told Kenny I considered they were not his property, and would advise him to have nothing to do with it—he went down the yard—the policeman and I went away for about four minutes—when we returned, there weve two casks on the dray, and Kenny was bringing out the third, the largest of the lot—he threw it down on the ground, and said he could not lift it up—the po<lb></lb>liceman helped him up with it on the dray—the policeman then asked him if there were any more—he said, "Yes," and the officer said, "I think we may as well have more if you can spare them"—Kenny said there was one more, and Cann then went and fetched the last one—Kenny then asked what we would give them—I said nothing, nor offer them any thing—the policeman (who was dressed in plain clothes) said he would give him what he was accustomed to get for such things—he said he had never sold any before—the officer said, "Well, never mind, come down to Gray's-inn-lane, and we will go and settle it"—we went there, and found another po<lb></lb>liceman, who took them—the casks were in Mr. Chadwiek's yard.</p>

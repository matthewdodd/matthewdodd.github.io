               <p>What answer did Hobbs make? - I cannot say particularly; the drawers were behind where he sat, and in those drawers I found the things which I now produce; the bed was in the same room.</p>
               <p>Did he make any objection to be searched? - No, I did not ask him for any objection; he said he had the things from the prisoner Giles.</p>

               <p>Are you clear in that? - I am quite clear. I went into the shop after the things were found, and I found this pocket-book which the prosecutor said was his; it is not mentioned in the indictment: I found one livery coat, one fustian coat, one fustian waistcoat, one striped flannel waistcoat, one pair of velveret breeches; these are all the things that I found; here is a coat that belongs to the witness Hemmings, that I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260005"></xptr> also at Hobbs's; I did not take up the other prisoner, I know nothing of either of them before.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you happen to know whether that room where the things was found, was occupied by Hobbs himself, or was let in lodgings to any body else? - My lord, there was a bed in it, and this man and his wife sat there together, and a child was there, but I do not know whose child it was.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnson. When you went first into the house of Hobbs, and told him what you came to search for, do you recollect whether he made any answer? - I do not recollect his making any reply; he looked rather astonished and surprised; he did not say whose the things were, till they were found.</p>

               <p>He says you opened the gate to him? - I do not know his name, I opened the gate between ten and eleven, and let the lad in, this is the lad I let in.</p>
               <p>Who lived in the opposite chamber? - Our hostler.</p>
               <p>Have you any business up that stair-case of a Sunday afternoon? - No, I have not, I was not that way that evening, I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260006"></xptr> nothing about the door, whether it was shut, or whether it was open.</p>
               <p>Was your hostler at home that afternoon? - Yes, till seven, then he went out, and came home about half after ten.</p>

               <p>Were the gates locked? - To the best of my knowledge they were, I saw the hostler hasp the gates, and I believe he locked them, but I do not know; I found the key in the same place I have found them this two years, in the stable; the gates were opened afterwards for a gentleman's servant, which was between eight and nine.</p>

               <p>Court. How came that book not to be put into the indictment? - It was a mistake.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. It is not in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Do you know the pencil? - No otherwise than being with the book.</p>
               <p>What sort of pencil was that that was in your pocket book? - A slate-pencil in a tin case.</p>

               <p>Was there any threats or promises made use of to induce him to confess the truth? - None at all, Hobbs stood close to him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Was the examination taken in writing? - Yes, I believe my name is to it.</p>

            , the prisoner at the bar, came into my master's shop, and desired me to shew her some ribbon. I did, and after tumbling them about, she said there were none that would do. I ask'd her if there were any thing else wanting. She desired me to shew her some silk mittins. In the mean time she took three pair; she tumbled them about, and said they were all too dear. I ask'd if any thing else was wanting, she desired me to shew her some white lace, and I shew'd her some.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it made of?</p>
               <p>Peirce. It was made of thread. After looking over a great quantity of them, and tumbling them about, she took a piece of lace, I saw her take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the silk mittins?</p>
               <p>Peirce. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it you did not secure her then, but instead of that to shew her the thread lace?</p>
               <p>Peirce. I always let them go out of the shop first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she buy any thing?</p>
               <p>Peirce. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did she take them?</p>
               <p>Peirce. Her apron was pin'd up before her, and I saw her drop the mittins into her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did she dispose of the lace?</p>
               <p>Peirce. I think by her motion it went under her capuchine. After this I ask'd her if any thing was wanting; she said there was none would do for her, they were too dear. Then she went out of the shop, I followed her, and she turn'd the corner of Tooley-street. I went to her, and said, I believed she had got something that did not belong to her, and brought her back into our warehouse, and found these silk mittins in her apron, among other things. The piece of lace she drop'd in the compting-house, before she came into the warehouse. (The goods produced in court.) Here is a mark on the mittins, by which I am certain they are my master's property, and on the lace is a mark of my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went into that shop to match a ribbon pattern that I had, they shew'd me two or three patterns, and none would do. Then I ask'd them to shew me a pair of stuff mittins for myself, and they were all too small. Then I ask'd him if he had any lace that would suit a pattern that I had with me, and there being none that would suit, I bought none. As to these things I know nothing of the matter.</p>

On the 23d he and his wife went out, they locked the door, the bolt went by the side of the staple, a lodger of mine went in, and saw something missing: they came home, and paid me for a week, then I missed the sheets and one blanket; the wife owned they had made use of some of my things. I desired them to let me know where my things were. The Justice gave them three days to produce them, on the Tuesday following, the tea-kettle, looking-glass, and sheets were brought by somebody, and I would not take them in.</p>
               <p>Q. As the Justice gave you three days, why did you not receive them?</p>
               <p>Carlton. I was afraid, fearing I should not do right: there was a man came afterwards, and desired me to make it up, and he would see the things forthcoming, if I would take his word for it: they lived in my house just a fortnight.</p>

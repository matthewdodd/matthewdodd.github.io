            . On the 5th of July, I was on the bridge. I saw Willis, and Russell, they were very busy, putting their hands into people's pockets; I kept my eye upon them. One of them put their hand into my pocket, felt the staff, and then they sheered off. In a few minutes afterwards. I saw them again, and followed them and stopped them; Nicolls searched Willis, and found the handkerchief in his hat. When he took it from him he said, it was his own.</p>
               <p>- NICOLLS. I was in company with Limbrick, I saw Willis, and Russell, come from the crowd; Russell was thrusting something into his breeches. We took them into a public house, I searched Willis, and found this handkerchief in the crown of his hat; he said, it was his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was on the bridge. I met Russell, by that means I crossed over the way; I spoke to him, he asked me if I was going home; Limbrick came and took us both, and searched us both, he found the handkerchief on me, and the watch on Russell. I bought the handkerchief for sixpence of a man, he said, he was starving; he would sell the handkerchief off his neck to get him a bit of bread.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. In June, 1825, I received this money from him. I then lodged in the prisoner's house, No. 22, Bury-street - he knew I had this money, as I paid him some - the rest was in a paper; he came up to my bed-room door on the 24th of June, (I think) - I was not up, and asked who was there? he said, "It is me;" I put on my gown, went into the front room, and he said, "I have come up relative to this money, for I advise you not to keep it in the house, where there are so many lodgers, and so many persons coming;" I said, "I intend to take it to Coutts' bank;" he said, "I am going past there (to the Adelphi) in the course of the morning, and will leave it, it is not safe here;" I said,"Who is to find the money - how are they to know it is here?" he pointed to the window, and said, "How easily might a man get in there, and if any thing was to happen to the money I should cut my throat, for my regard to Mr. Devenish;" I said, "How are they to find it?" he said they would have it if they tore the carpet up; I had put it on the top of the bed, and in several places - I believe I then took it out of the chimney; he said he would take it to Coutts', and would put it there, in Mr. Devenish's name or mine, which I liked; I said I would take it myself; he said there was nothing to do but to take it there and bring me a book, and leave it in what name I thought proper; I objected to it for, I suppose, a quarter of an hour; he said he was going to a jeweller for some watches for his brother, and would leave it, and bring me the book before I was up; I at last gave him a 200l., a 100l. and a 50l. Bank note; I had 27l. in gold, which I kept back; he said, "You had better send the whole;" I said I would not - he took the notes, and came back at three o'clock to dinner - I did not see him then, but I sent down in the evening for the book - he sent up word that they would not take less than 500l. there, and he would keep it till next day, and take it into the City; I asked him about six o'clock for it - he said it was in his brother's iron chest, and he would keep it there till next day, when he would go and get me more for it in the City, by putting it into the Stocks or Bank; I told the woman with whom he lived, that evening, that upon consideration I would not have it put into the Bank next day, which was Saturday, I went into the kitchen to him, at three o'clock, and asked him for the money, as I would not have any thing done with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070083"></xptr>it; he said he had left it at his brother's, and would go and fetch it; I said, "Mr. Devenish is now up stairs, and I wish to have it immediately, as he does not know it is out of my hands;" he said he would go and get it immediately - he went out, and I did not see him again till last Thursday week, when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by living with the prisoner? A. I lodge there - I gave him the money in the front room; there was a gentleman in my bed at that time - I do not know his name, on my oath - I never described him as a dry-salter in the City; my husband was with me the next day - I did not tell him what I meant to do with the money; I never said I wished to put it out of my husband's way because he wasted it; or that he was a worthless and careless fellow; I told the prisoner to put it in my name, Mrs. Devenish; I have at times gone by my maiden name; I never authorized him to take it into the City; I did not go to his brother's; I indicted his brother for receiving the 50l. note this Sessions; nobody advised me to prosecute - I always intended to do it when I found the prisoner; I saw him last Thursday week in a public-house at the corner of Bury-street. I believe my husband has had 100l. back; Sarah Heale acted as landlady in the prisoner's house - I paid her the rent occasionally; I told her on Sunday morning, I did not know how to tell my husband about the money, for he would murder me; she and I went to his brother's house at two o'clock that morning - I saw my husband's receipt for the 100l.; I said I had ruined my husband, because he had sold his commission to get me out of my situation, and I would punish the prisoner whenever I found him; I went to Bow-street, and took every pains to trace him; Mr. Devenish also went to Norwich about him; I was never married but once - I have heard he had a wife living when he married me, but I am not positive of it.</p>

            . I am an ostler at a livery stables, and have been there 25 or 26 years. I have known the prisoner 12 or 14 years, he keeps a house close to Mr. Bevan's stables. In June, 1825, the servant of the prosecutor came for me; I found Mr. and Mrs. Devenish there - they asked if I knew where Mr. Tupman was - I said,"No; I saw him last night, and parted with him at the corner;" I did not know what they wanted - they sent for me again in half an hour; I saw them both on the stairs - it was on a Sunday; they said they had had a great loss; I asked, what - Mrs. Devenish said she had put 350l. into Tupman's hands to take to the banker's, and they were afraid he had absconded; I said, I thought he would return in a short time; she mentioned Coutt's name to me, but nobody else; Mr. Devenish then came and asked if I had any relations at Norwich; I said, "Only an acquaintance or two;" he asked their names - I said, I did not know - he said he would find them - that he supposed he should not get half his money back. In September last, I sent for Mr. Devenish, and told him there was a great chance of his getting 100l. back; I had not seen Tupman till last September, at a house in Russell-street; I did not say I had seen him; he said he would give a receipt for the whole if he could get 100l. back; he said he would prepare a receipt, and brought a draft of it, and left it with me; we met the same day to settle it - Mrs. Devenish knew what was going on - she did not see the prisoner, but she came to me with her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know while all this was going on, that they charged him with a robbery? A. Yes; Mrs. Devenish objected to a receipt for the full amount - but Mr. Devenish proposed this form - as soon as this was done, the prisoner appeared in his business as usual.</p>
               <p>Mr. McDOWELL. Q. He was very much in your society? A. Yes. - I knew he was charged with a robbery; I saw him in September, and asked what he had left; he seid, 100l. - he had spent the rest; he kept out of the way till I got the receipt; I recommended Mr. Devenish to take the 100l., rather than lose all.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know that he had stolen it? A. Mrs. Devenish said she had given it him - I should not have interfered if I had known he had stolen it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She gave him the money? A. Yes, to put in the banker's.</p>

               <p>Mr. McDOWELL. Q. Did Tupman return at his usual hour on Saturday? A. No. He went away - I never saw him after - when he came home on Friday, I asked him what she wanted; he said she had given him 350l. to put into Coutt's bank. The truth is, I was living with him.</p>

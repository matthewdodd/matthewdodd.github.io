                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the 6th of October I went to the water-side, and saw two nets hanging up on the yard of a boat at Wandsworth. eleven or twelve miles from Greenwich—I staid there to see who took them down—about half-past four o'clock I saw Dearman come on board, lower the nets down, and put them under the half-deck of the boat—I met him, and said I wanted to go on board his boat—he went with me—I said, "Where are the nets you lowered down?"—he said, "Here they are"—I said, "You must remain here"—I sent, and the witnesses came down and identified them—I told them to proceed with the search, and in the locker we found the remains of two other nets, which had no leads on—Dearman said he knew nothing of them, he had been working for a man named Brigland, at Greenwich, and he got the nets from him; that he had got permission from Brigland to bring the boat up to Wandsworth, and Brigland told him, when he got to Wandsworth he was to hang them up to dry—by order of the Magistrate I took him down to Greenwich, and gave information to the police there, and Lovell took Brigland into custody.</p>

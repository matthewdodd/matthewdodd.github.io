             came in, sat down in the settle at the end of the table, and fell asleep; the prisoner got off his seat, walked across the room, at over the table, and sat down by him - he took his hand out of his own pocket, and put it into the prosecutor's right-hand breeches pocket; he then took it out, went back, and sat down; I went to the bar, and told the landlady to let no one out till she had got a Policeman, who came, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were you perfectly sober? A. Yes; I am a helper in a stable - I only help in a morning; I had been at work the day before in Middle Scotland-yard for an hour or two; I never was in any trouble in my life, not in custody - there were six men in our company, mostly stable men; we were strangers to the prisoner - I did not see any money; I and one of my friends got up, walked to the bar, and told the landlady of it in about five minutes - the prosecutor did not appear very drunk; I did not see him drink any thing there - I paid for one pint of ale in that house, and had about two glasses; this was between four and five o'clock in the morng - Ini was not there above an hour - the prisoner did not leave the room; I had not been in bed that night - I left my work about eleven o'clock in the morning of the day before; I had not been all night in public-houses - I was only in two public-houses; we had all six walked round Covent-garden and the Strand.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I live at No. 6, Blenbeim-street, Chelsea. I am a gentleman's servant out of place. I was at the Castle between four and five o'clock in the morning, on the 4th of April; I saw the prisoner there and

             - the prisoner got up, and went across the room to where Dixon was; he sat down by his side, put his hand into his right-hand breeches pocket, and took it out again - he got over the table, and sat down where he was before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to represent that this man, in the presence of five or six of you, got over the table, and put his hand into his pocket? A. Yes - there were some strangers there; our party sat at one side of the room with our drink before us - none of the strangers are here to-day; I had been out of place some time, as I had been ill - I had been out rather later than usual, and was locked out; I walked back again to town from Chelsea, and I met my companions at Charing-cross, I suppose a little before four o'clock in the morning - they were walking along the street when I met them; they said they were locked out, and we walked about. I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DIXON. On the 4th of April I went to the Castle public-house, in Bull Inn-court, Strand, between four and five o'clock - I was in liquor - I had walked from Blackheath-hill, and was fatigued; I asked the landlady for a glass of ale - she made it too warm, and I told her to make a pint of it, and give me a pipe of tobacco - I sat down and fell asleep; I had then two half-crowns in my pocket, and three shillings - I changed one of the shillings at the bar before I went to sleep; I got a sixpence and some halfpence; I put the sixpence into my pocket, and I then had two half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence - when I awoke I had nothing in my right-hand breeches pocket in which I had had my money - I know it was all safe when I paid for the pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you drink any of the ale? A. To the best of my recollection I did not, nor smoke the pipe; I had not sat many minutes before I went to sleep - I was not very drunk; the last place I had drank at was Blackheath-hill - I had walked up to town; I think I had about 14s. when I went out; I had not spent any money in town.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Did you take all the money out when you paid for the ale? A. No, only a single shilling.</p>

             - he keeps the Castle. I recollect the prosecutor having a pint of ale and a pipe, about four o'clock - he gave me a shilling; I gave him a sixpence and three-farthings; in about ten minutes the witness came and told me that his money had been taken, and in about half an hour I got the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner there? A. Yes; three of them came in, and had a pint of ale between them - I recollect the other six men being there- they were all strangers to me; the prisoner did not attempt to go out; if he had I should have stopped him; I said I would not allow any one to go out.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THORPE. I am a Police-constable. I was called to the house about twenty minutes past four o'clock - I took the prisoner by the desire of the landlady, who had sent for me; I found on the prisoner one half-crown, two shillings, three sixpences, and twopence halfpenny, all in different pockets.</p>

             re-examined. Q.Did you receive any money from the prisoner after you heard of the robbery? A. Yes; in about five minutes he came and brought me half a crown, and I took ninepence halfpenny out of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you receive them, at the bar? A. Yes; he had been sitting in the room opposite the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How far must you go out of that room to get to the bar? A. About two yards - the door does not open between the bar and that room; they are by the side of each other; he had to walk across the room, and the persons there must see him - the street-door is about two yards from the bar; in two steps more he might have gone into the street - I gave him 1s. 8 1/2d. in change.</p>

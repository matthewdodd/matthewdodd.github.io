               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman asked me where the handkerchief was, and I told him I did not know - Witness. I asked him, and he said he would take me back to the place; as we were going back he loitered behind for a minute; there were ten or twelve more round us, and then he denied the theft.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutor; he turned round suddenly, and said to the prisoner, "You young rascal, you have picked my pocket." I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand; I followed, and did not lose sight of him, except for a moment when he turned. I am sure he is the boy. When he was taken he said he would take Mr. Stibbard to the place.</p>

               <p>MR. STIBBARD. I felt the handkerchief going from my pocket, and saw it in his hand immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I deal in earthenware and other goods. On the 11th of February I came up from Woolwich and went into the Rose and Crown, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, about four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—there were about five persons in the tap-room—I was there all the evening—I took a basket and bundle with me, and laid it on the tap-room table—the bundle contained the property stated in the indictment—the prisoners came in together in the course of the evening—Dixon asked me to drink with him, and I did—he was a stranger to me—we remained there the latest—all the other people were gone, and my bundle was safe in the basket as when I put it there—the prisoners went away about twelve o'clock—immediately after they were gone I missed the bundle—no one could have taken it but them—no others were there but them, the landlord, and myself—about three o'clock in the morning the policeman brought me my bundle, and the handkerchief had been changed—I had a silk handkerchief on the outside; and when it was found by the policeman a cotton handker<lb></lb>chief was substituted—every article is my property.</p>

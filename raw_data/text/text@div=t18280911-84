            . I am an officer. I followed the prisoners from Bishopsgate-street down Cornhill, and there saw Anderson attempt a person's pocket; he crossed up'Change-alley to the Post-office - Walford was with him, and when I got up the handkerchief was in the act of being taken up - they were both in company.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know an attempt to pick a pocket is an offence? A. Yes; I did not take him - I saw him lay hold of two different pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not take them up them? A. I will tell you: I have cantioned Anderson over and over again, that he would suffer for it, as he was constantly about picking pockets; I waited that day to see if he would commit a felony; Walford did not attempt a pocket at all.</p>

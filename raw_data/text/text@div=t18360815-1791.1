                  </hi>. I live in Jane-street, Commercial-road. On the 10th of August, I was just by Aldgate, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—I saw a gentleman and lady walking together—the prisoner followed them—he put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, and took this handkerchief out—he put it into his coat-pocket, and went after another gentleman, and turned his pocket inside out—the gentleman went on, as he did not miss his handkerchief—I do not know his name—my sister was with me.</p>

W, on it—the girls told me the colour of the handkerchief before it was found.</p>

            . On the night of the 10th of January, about eleven o'clock, I was accosted at the end of Piccadilly, by the prisoner, who asked me to go with her; I said I was married, and objected - she asked me to treat her with some drink, and I gave her a glass of brandy - I had one; she afterwards wanted me to go with her, and I still objected; we got on to the end of <placeName id="t18300114-223-crimeloc1190">Rose-street, Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How long have you been in town? A.Nearly two years; I had not been drinking a great deal - I was as sober as I am now; I had not put my watch into the flap of my trousers - I went to Hammersmith after dinner, and had tea there; I had a glass of gin, a pint of beer, and a glass of gin and water - nothing else; the liquor had not affected me at all - the prisoner said she had never seen my watch.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty in Rose-street, Covent-garden; I heard the prosecutor talking with the prisoner, and passed them about five yards - he said, "This girl has robbed me of my watch;" I took her about four feet from him, and said, "Search yourself, and be sure you have not got it;" he searched himself down his thighs, and every where, and said, "I am certain I have not got it" - I pulled the prisoner's right-hand out of her muff, and then pulled the muff off the other's hand, and gave it to the prosecutor; she sprang to him and said, "You shan't have my muff," and put her hand into his trousers - he said, "She has put something into my trousers, I think it is my watch - take hold of my trousers, and don't let it fall, it may break;" I took up the watch, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you not every opportunity of looking into her hand before it got to the prosecutor? A. No, Sir - I thought it the best way for him to search himself, as he might be mistaken; she denied having seen it - she seemed a little the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking with him; he said,"Good God, I have lost my watch!" he put his hand into his trousers, and the watch fell on the ground.</p>

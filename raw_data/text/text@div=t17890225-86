               <p>I was coming with my daughter to London on the 27th of January; I had a trunk before the chaise, and having been cautioned about the possibility of its being cut off the chaise, both me and my daughter looked frequently to see if the trunk was on; the last time we saw it on we went into the next street by the Seven Dials; there we missed the trunk, the postilion-endeavoured to see whether it was dropped, it was not dropped there; I think that was near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250107"></xptr>six o'clock; I then recollected the Rotation-office at Litchfield-street; I went there and gave information of my loss; I was called back by some of the people belonging to the office, saying that a trunk was secured at the watch-house, and that a man was brought in; the trunk I verily believe to be my property, but it has been used for my daughter's things; and as to the contents, they were principally my daughter's; she can give an account of them; I waited at Litchfield-street till they brought the trunk and the man; there was then an immediate examination, the trunk was in the possession of one Furneau.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long was it from the time you saw the trunk yourself, till you was told they had seen the trunk? - I should suppose it was twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>

               <p>What did you say? - I said, you are the thief; then I might be about five or six yards below the watch-house, and he threw down the trunk; I ran after him, calling out stop thief; he ran as far as Frith-street, where, by the assistance of a shoemaker, he tumbled down; the shoemaker and myself collared him; then my master and me went home; about six o'clock, the watch-house keeper sent for us, they took the prisoner to the Justice; we went to the watch-house, and carried the trunk to the Justice; we took the trunk home again to my master's house, where it has been ever since; the trunk is here.</p>

               <p>Are you very sure that that man you saw at the watch house, was the man you saw with the trunk on his shoulders? - Yes, I saw him once at the Rotation-office; I knew him again then, that is the man that I saw with the trunk; I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The first thing that you observed, was a man as you thought entangled in the wheel of the chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then somebody else told you they would do you a mischief: How long was the man when you saw him in your view? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>He was leaning on the perch? - Yes, he went away with the trunk, he went the same way that I was going.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him before in your life? - Never.</p>
               <p>When you went to the watch-house, you had been told that the man was found with the trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore you expected to see the right man at the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you came to the watch-house then you saw this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, how is it, that you come to swear positively to a man whom you saw the first time in your life, for three minutes leaning on a carriage, and running with a trunk? - Because, when he came from under the coach, it was almost the turn of a street, and he came as near to me as I am to you, and he was going quickly, and I saw his face by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>What time of the evening was it when you first saw the man? - Between five and six, the 27th of January.</p>
               <p>You did not see his face while he was under the carriage? - I did not, I saw him when he came from the carriage, and came on the pavement.</p>
               <p>How near was the other man at the time? - He was standing almost abreast of me; my attention was a little taken up with him after the prisoner was gone by me.</p>
               <p>Had not the prisoner an iron on at the watch-house? - I did not see it, I heard that the man was taken, and as I was going to the watch-house I expected to see the same man I saw before.</p>

               <p>I am a shoemaker; I was at work, I heard the cry of stop thief; I got out of my stall; the corner of Frith-street, Soho Square, the prisoner turned the corner; and as I got out I attempted to lay hold of him by his great coat, he was running, I missed my hold; I went a little further, and went to lay hold of him again, he stript his coat half-way down his arms, and I put my foot before him, and threw him down; then I secured his arms that he could not do any thing to me; if he had any thing in his hands, and by that time the baker's man came up to my assistance, and we took him to the watch-house; he said he was not the man that they were in pursuit after, that they took him to be the wrong person; he was quite a different sort of person to what they took him to be.</p>

               <p>I was coming along Macclesfield-street, in crossing the road, I stumbled over something, at the side of the road; I looked at it, and it was a trunk; I immediately thought it would be the best way to take it to some place of safety, that it might be advertised; in going along to the watch-house, a gentleman tapped me on the shoulders, and asked me, where I was going to with the trunk; I told him I had just pickt it up, and was going to the watch-house.</p>

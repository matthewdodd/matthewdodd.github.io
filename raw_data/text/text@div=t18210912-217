            . On the 10th of September, Mrs. Airey gave me information - I went to North-end, Fulham, to Mr. Kent's, where the prisoner was in service - searched her trunks and found a petticoat and part of a gold seal.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Thursday before the robbery, I was next door and returned about eight o'clock, the street door was open, and I lost some shifts, stockings, and four sovereigns. Another box was robbed of several things, and a counterpane of my master's - they said next day they had lost a purse, containing twenty guineas, and hoped I would keep it secret, or they would be discharged, I agreed. As to the things, I do not know how I became possessed of them, unless they got mixed with mine at the mangle. The prosecutrix was much embittered against me for not conniving at her changing some feathers out of the bed - she said she would be my destruction, unless I gave her a sum of money.</p>

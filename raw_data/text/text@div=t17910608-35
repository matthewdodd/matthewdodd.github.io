The prisoner at the bar came into the shop, on the 21st of March last, and asked to look at some silver watches; I handed him down two, and he looked at them, and he asked me to look at a metal watch; I left those two silver watches on the counter, to reach for the metal one, as he wanted, with a long handle, and in that moment he made off with the silver watches, and went out of the shop at the front-door: I saw him go out, I cannot say I saw the watches in his hand when he went out, but I saw them in his hand the minute before. and I missed the watches from the counter; I pursued him but did not see him; I saw him again on the 23d or 24th of May, about two months afterwards at Guildhall; I have never seen the watches again at all; I went to Guildhall in consequence of being informed that a man was taken up on suspicion,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080046"></xptr>and went to see if that was the person, and I recollected his face again.</p>
               <p>Was he long enough in your shop, so as you can say decidedly that is the man? - I can.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - I have not.</p>
               <p>How long was he in your shop? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What may the value of these watches be? - They had cost as much as laid in the indictment; one cost thirty shillings, the other twenty-six shillings. It is uncertain what they would have sold at.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How long is it ago since these watches were first missing? - The first of March last.</p>
               <p>Was there many people in the shop? - Only one person as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - There was a woman standing pretty near you, on the same side of the shop.</p>
               <p>Do you know that person? - I know her very well; she remained after you was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. What is that person; is she of a good character, how does she get her livelihood? - I do not really know, but I fancy she is a woman of repute; she lived then in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>That woman is not here? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you not to have that woman her? - She could not recollect his face.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - About eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>When he went out of the door did he run or walk? - I did not see him, after he got out of the door.</p>
               <p>How did he get out of the house? - He pulled the door open.</p>
               <p>In what manner, when he left the counter, did he go out? - He went out in an instant, quite abrupt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Have you no reason to suspect that person in the shop? - I had not.</p>
               <p>You did not search her? - I did not.</p>
               <p>It is very extraordinary you should not see the watch go out; as that woman came to pawn things, she might be distressed for money.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she, when in the shop, near the counter, so as to have the watches within her reach? - She stood very near to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am entirely innocent of the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the woman come in before him or after him? - She came in I believe after him.</p>

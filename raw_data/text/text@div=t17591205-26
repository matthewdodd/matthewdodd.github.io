Pray don't be so hard against me; I own myself in a fault, and it is the first I ever did.</p>

I have known her sixteen years; two days before she did this crime she washed for me, and has for fifteen or sixteen years; I never in my life heard but what she was honest, and I would take her home to wash for me now, was she out. I believe she is as much guilty of it as we are, and I am afraid she has fallen into bad hands. I believe her as honest as myself, and I believe myself as honest as any body. If I had known she had been here. I would have brought better people to her character than there are.</p>

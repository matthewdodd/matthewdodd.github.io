                  </hi>. That is my watch. <hi rend="italic">'Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>.) The first week I was in Mr. Barker's employ<lb></lb>ment, me and John, Mr. Barker's apprentice, got into conversation about tramping for work, and how much he should like to see the country, and how much he should like to go with me, because, as he said, he though that having travelled two or three times for work I naturally should know the best way of getting an existence on the road, and I told him that if ever I tramped again that I should <hi rend="italic">go</hi> down to my friends in Bris<lb></lb>tol—we had held a little conversation about tramping several timer during the time that I worked for his master, which was about six weeks About two or three days before I left, he made a proposition to me (<hi rend="italic">having previously heard his master tell me that he should not be able to employ me after the Saturday</hi>.) to tramp with me to Bristol, and if I would go he would lend me his boots to tramp in, because my boots were bad; upon which I left on the Monday—he told me to stop till they were all gone down stairs to their dinners, and then to put on his boots and leave di<lb></lb>rectly, which I did, and he would meet me at the Black Boy at Windsor on the Tuesday week, with plenty of money. I went straight from there to my lodgings, where there was my fellow lodger, with whom I had been like brothers, and I had, with his consent, the use of his top coat, when he did not want it himself, because my coat was not a very good one. I was not in the habit of asking him for the loan of it every time I wanted it but used to go and take it, as I did on the day in question. I wandered about London for work till the following Monday morning, when, being very short of money, I got a young man to pledge the coat for me, because I had not been in the habit of pledging any thing, and he got me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it I then made the best of my way to Windsor, and got in on Tuesday, where, instead of him meeting me, he sent a young man with the red purse now produced, with a lot of old coins in one end and ten shillings in the other, with the ticket of the watch in a piece of paper, which he sent word was his own, and that his motive for sending them was that I might make money of them to assist me on the road. The young man told me that he was out of work, and he knew John very well, and that he gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and plenty of pastry to eat on the road for coming down. I went down to Bristol, where I called at a place, in Narrow Wine-street, for work, and told them innocently enough my name, where I had come from, and who I had worked for, as I did to the policeman when I was taken.

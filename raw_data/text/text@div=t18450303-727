                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Joseph Richards—I live with my parents. On Saturday night, the 8th of Feb., about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Chapel-street, Somers-town—a man was exhibiting something and there was a crowd—a young woman told me something—I put my hand in my pocket and missed five shillings, which I knew was safe two or three minutes before—I had had five shillings and a sixpence, and the sixpence was left—the prisoner was standing by my side—wheirf the young woman spoke to me he went away—I ran after him—he had then got about half-a-dozen doors off—the young woman stopped him, and we gave him in charge—I had just before seen him pass something to another boy who was with him, and he whispered something to the other boy-the prisoner had songs in his hand—the five shilling were my father's.</p>

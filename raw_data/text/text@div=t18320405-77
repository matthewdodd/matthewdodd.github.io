I came to bring the straw to London on the 10th of March, and when I got on the London side of Stamford-hill, I met Redding and Fielder - they asked whether I would sell the straw, and what I wanted for it; I believe Redding spoke first - I had not known them before; I asked 38s. a load; I then asked 37s., and at last agreed to take 36s. a load, and 1s. over in the three loads - they told me to turn off at the Kingsland-gate, and to go towards the west-end of the town - I turned off at the gate, and when I had got a good bit on, Henwood met me, and asked if that was

On the 10th of March Clinton came to my stable with three loads of straw, and Henwood, who was a stranger, came with him, and brought me a note from Redding, with the price of three loads of straw; I went out, looked at the straw, and told them to bring it in at the price expressed; after the straw was unloaded, I paid Henwood 5l. 8s.; the straw had been unloaded in my yard, but I did not see it, as it was a foggy morning, and I had a had cough - I paid Henwood 5l. 8s. for the straw, and 1s., which Redding was to have for purchasing the straw; when I paid him, he walked out of my passage, and I considered he was going to pay the carman - I saw the carman afterwards; he said he had not had the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know Redding before? A. Yes, for a good many years - I have purchased a deal of straw of him; I consider him honest; I have generally paid him, and he has paid the carters who have brought the straw or hay - I considered I was buying this of Redding, and I treated Henwood as his servant; I had no receipt; I knew that it could not be Redding's except by his buying it - I have not seen the carman paid before, but I believe the money has been paid regularly; I believe Redding gets his living by purchasing straw and hay; he has bought a good deal for me and other persons, who keep stables.</p>

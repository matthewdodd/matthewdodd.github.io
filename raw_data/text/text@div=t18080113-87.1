               <p>Q. There has been a bed produced worked with yellow silk; have you seen that bed before in the hospital. - A. Yes. I saw it in Mrs. Hutchinson's ward; it a flock bed belonging to the hospital; the other bed worked with brown I saw made in the hospital three weeks after I was in the hospital - it was kept in Mrs. Hutchinson's ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Perfectly well; he was a watchman of the hospital. He breakfasted, dined, and had his tea with Mrs. Hutchinson for five weeks, and his supper was sent to the gate every night.

The prisoner was there on the Tuesday evening as she left the ward on the Thursday; and then the ward was put in darkness. - At the time that Mrs, Hutchinson ordered the ward to be in darkness, the prisoner and a young man were in sister Hutchinson's room; sister Hutchinson went out into the lobby, she said now all is safe - come along. - The prisoner and the young man that was there, assisted in carrying two or three bundles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and ironmonger, and live in St. James-place, Hampstead-road. It is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Pancras—on Wednesday, 20th March, I went to bed about half-past tea o'clock—I was not the last up—I have a son who comes in after me—I was awoke about four in the morning by a noise—I sat up in bed, and called, "Who 's there?"—I got no answer—I was going to lie down again, and saw a man in the room, between me and the window—I called out, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> thinking it might be my son—he made no answer, but walked out at the door, on to the staircase—I called out, "Thieves!" struck a light, and followed him—when I got into the shop, I found the shop-window pushed down, leaving room enough for a person to get in—I had left it secure when I went to bed—I fastened the shutters myself.</p>

About a quarter-past four o'clock on the morning in question I was on duty in Great George-street, Hamp-stead-road, and saw the prisoner come out of the top part of the shop-window of the prosecutor's house—I went across the street, and asked him what he did there—he said, "All right, policeman; all right"—I took him into custody—Mr. Sweet looked out, and said, "That is right, hold him"—as I took him to the station, he said, "If they had greased the b——y window, I should have been all right."</p>

About four o'clock on Thursday morning I was on duty near this place, and heard a rattle—I went to the prosecutor's house, and went in; and under the shop-window I found three forks and two knives thrown on a bench under the window out of which the prisoner got.</p>

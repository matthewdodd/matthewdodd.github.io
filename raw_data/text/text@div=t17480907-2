             . I happened to be passing by my own door the 30th of July, about 5 in the evening, and saw the prisoner going by with a bundle: about 200 yards from Mr. White's house a young woman came running, and said the house was robbed, and cried out, Stop thief; and the prisoner threw down this bundle, and run. These things (which the prosecutor claimed) were wrapt up in this coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the coat?</p>
               <p>Bromley . 'Tis like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. White's Servant. About a quarter of an hour after five I had almost cleaned my house; I heard the street door clap; I opened the door, and saw a man running along with these things, and I went and called out, Thieves. The prisoner was stopt, and he said he knew nothing of the matter; but he was seen by Mr. Bromley to drop them.</p>
               <p>Bright Wilmott . There was a person that cried out, Stop thief, and I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Wilmott . No; he was running as fast as he could, and cried out Stop thief, himself.</p>
               <p>Q. So there was no-body before him.</p>
               <p>Wilmott . No; he was the first man himself, and I was the second after him.</p>

On the 17th of December, about three in the afternoon, I was told by some persons I had lost some tobacco; I went into the warehouse to examine and weigh the tobacco, and found a quantity had been taken away; I am positive the full quantity was there the day before. The prisoner was a servant in my warehouse.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 18th of December at five in the morning, I saw the prisoner with a sack upon his shoulder; he was about 200 yards from Mr. Fonsica's; he said he was employed to carry it over night, and not having done it he chose to carry it at that time, and said he was going into the Borough; I suspected him, took him up, and carried him to the watch-house; there I examined the bag; it contained a considerable quantity of tobacco (The bag produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The bag is mine, and the tobacco is mine; I know it by its having been wetted and put into the kiln to dry, that gave it a peculiar smell.</p>

            . I rent the cellar in the prosecutrix's house - I am a smith. I lost several tools, and found the lead cut off the pipe; the prisoner used often come to assist me; he came two nights before that, and stood in the corner where the lead was taken from - we agreed to watch him. Next night he came as usual, took a coffee-pot, and said he was going for water; he went to the water-butt, then went to the corner above the shop - it was dark; he went away, saying,</p>
               <p>"Good night." We instantly went after him, and secured him in an old iron shop, where he had sold the lead for 9 1/2 d. It was safe when he came, and missed immediately after he went.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was set to watch the place, saw the prisoner go in, and come out again; they said he had got it. I lost him, and went another way to an old iron shop in Bridgewater-gardens, and found him there; he had just received 9 1/2 d. for the lead, which was in the scale - the woman refused to produce it. I found a knife on him, with which he said he cut the lead, and that he did it through distress - the money was in his hand. I told him to give the lead up, but the woman said I should not have it.</p>

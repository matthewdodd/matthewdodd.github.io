The watchmen were perfectly upon their duty. Before he was taken I saw him throw away the watch and almost immediately he was in the custody of the watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was the man - A. I am perfectly certain that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a shove was it - A. I am very glad that question is asked, I was desirous of making it known to the Court that their was no stick, no bludgeon or knife, merely running violently against me and at the same time snatching out the watch; there was no blow, a mere shove, I conceive it was to put me of my guard, it was by no means to do me any personal injury.</p>
               <p>Q. It produced no terror in your mind then - A. None at all.</p>

He had a chesnut mare - on the 7th of March, I saw it between eight and nine o'clock in the evening in the stables - it was a nag mare - I went to the stables about half-past five next morning, and it was gone - the stable door was shut at night, but not locked - it was latched and pinned, and there is a double door - it could not get out - I traced the mare through three gates, and gave my master information - I have known the prisoner about four years and a half -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100049"></xptr>I had seen him about a fortnight or three weeks before, at Blixley - he does not belong to that neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. I suppose, when you went to the stables in the evening, it was not very light? A. No; I had a lanthorn - my master had no other horse in that stable - I latched the stable myself, and pinned it.</p>

            . On the 8th of March, I drove the Birmingham Celerity coach, and saw the prisoner, about a quarter or twenty minutes to two o'clock in the morning, on horseback, in Towcester town, about four miles from Blixley - I met him on a chesnut mare - I turned round, and he rode by my side, 15 or 16 miles, alongside of my lamp - I noticed it as being a particularly fast trotter - it kept up with my coach - I lost the prisoner at Dropshot - it was a dark night, but I had two pair of lamps - I imagined he had stolen the mare, because he got through the turnpike gates without paying them, except one, where I winked at the turnpike man - I lost him near Brickhill-hill - one of the roads where I left him would lead to Edgeware - I afterwards saw him and the mare at Edgeware, and I am certain he is the man, and it was the same mare - that was on Wednesday, the 20th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many days afterwards? A. Twelve days - it may be fifteen miles from Brickhill to Edgeware - I do not know the distance at all - I took particular notice of the mare and the colour of it - I thought it singular he should ride so many miles with me, and his slipping through the gates - he went from one side of the coach to the other; sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other - I altered my pace, and beat him, and sometimes he beat me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you, in consequence of his shifting from one side to the other, observe him more particularly? A. I did.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHAMBERS. I live at Blixley, in Northamptonshire. In consequence of information from my servant, I went in search of my mare, on the 8th of March; and in consequence of inquiry, I got to Edgeware - I went to the White Lion, and saw the ostler; and, in consequence of what he told me, I went into the house, and found the prisoner there - several persons were there - he sat in the window - I said, "Young man, you have got a useful mare at the door here" - (I had seen the mare then; it was mine) - he got up, and came across the room; and when I came to the door, I asked the ostler, in his hearing, if he was the young man who brought the mare there - he said he was - the prisoner directly ran away, and crossed over the turnpike, and ran across the fields - I followed him on horseback, and overtook him - I told him I should take him - he said he hoped I should be as favourable as I could with him - I told him it was not likely I should be very favourable in the way he had served me - I afterwards took possession of the mare, and am quite certain it is the one I had lost - it is worth between 30l. and 40l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you took him, did you charge him with stealing it? A. Yes; he confessed it to me on the spot.</p>

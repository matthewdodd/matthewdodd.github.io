             sworn. - On the 11th of August, about eleven o'clock, I was going down Red-lion-street, Whitechapel; I overtook the prisoner, I thought I observed something under his jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A.Perfectly well; I asked him what he had got; he said, nothing; I said, there is certainly something more; I turned him round, and found this gown by the side of him, (produces it); I asked him how he came by it; he said, it was his wife's; I told him I did not think he had a wife; then he said it was a gown he had given twelve shillings for, for a blowing of his; I then took him to the Office, and found it belonged to Mr. Windsor.</p>
               <p>Evants. This is Mr. Windsor's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going down Red Lion-street, and met with a girl that asked me if I would take that gown to her husband, who was on board the same ship with me; I said I would, and then this gentleman came up, and stopped me. <rs id="t18020918-155-verdict812" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. At the time this took place I lived at No. 59, High-street, Lambeth—I do not know the parish—I occupied the shop, parlour, and back room, first-floor—I held it of Mr. Hancock, the land-lord, who did not live in the house—I occupied the room entirely myself in which the watch and spoon were—I afterwards let the room to the pri<lb></lb>soner's cousin—the prisoner himself did not occupy that room at all—I let him the top-room—I remember his cousin going into Somersetshire—I saw the spoon and watch last on the 18th of July—I think it was about a month before the fire happened—the outside of the watch was metal, and the in-side silver—the spoon was silver—I kept it in a box in the parlour where I slept—I kept the box locked—I went out on Sunday, the 18th of July, my box appeared in the state in which I had seen it before—I left it un<lb></lb>locked—when I went out, I locked the door of my room, and put the key in my pocket, and took it with me—I am confident of that—I came home about ten o'clock—I did not see the prisoner, to my recollection, till next evening—he then asked me how I came to go out and leave the door unlocked—I said I did not, for I went and took the key from my room up stairs, and locked it myself—the fire took place on the 9th of August—I did not ascertain my loss till about the 11th of August—on looking into my box, I missed the watch and spoon—the box was locked then, but I think I left it unlocked on 18th of July, because I took the key out on the Monday morning, and locked it—I have since seen the spoon in the pos<lb></lb>session of Mr. Cole, and the watch in possession of a person in Black-friars-road—I believe the name is Aldous—the spoon and watch were what I kept in my box—I never authorized the prisoner to pawn them, or to go into my room, or take them—these now produced are them.</p>

My mother occupied the attics in No. 59, High-street, Lambeth, in July and August last—I remember Mr. Cord<lb></lb>went going into the country—about three weeks before the fire, on a Sunday afternoon, between three and four o'clock, I was sitting at the back-door—I am sure it was on a Sunday—the prisoner came down stairs and unlocked the back-parlour door with a key—I saw the key in his hand before he went to the door—he went in, shut the door, and took the key inside—I went up stairs, and saw no more of it—after the fire, on being questioned, I told Mr. Mattock what I had seen.</p>

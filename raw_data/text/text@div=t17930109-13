               <p>I am a constable, the prisoner came to me on Friday, and asked me if I wanted him, I told him I did, he said he came to deliver himself up, and there he was all night, and then I delivered him up to the magistrate, I have kept the pot in my possession ever since it was carried to the justice's by James, and after he was examined it was put into my possession. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Midwinter. Where did that back door open to? - It opened facing the gardens.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found a bundle of wood in a ditch, and I took the bundle of wood out, and then I saw the pot was underneath there; I told that woman that I found it, and she said she would go and sell it for me, she went and brought me 4 s.</p>
               <p>Bonsell. I gave him 6 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you tell me that Mr. James had given you 4 s. and if that would not do he would return the pot? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Bonsell. He says you know him, what is his character? - I cannot justly say, what he does for his bread, nor nobody else I believe.</p>
               <p>Midwinter. He never would stick at any thing, now and then he would do a day's work, and that is all.</p>
               <p>Court to James. What passed between you and the woman, when you bought the pot, she said she brought the pot, and that it belonged to a poor woman at Hillingdon, I gave her 6 s. for it, the prisoner came again to me afterwards and said I had given a bad shilling, which I knew I had not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Praed-street, Pad<lb></lb>dington. On the afternoon of the 28th of February, I had some clothes hanging in my gardens. I saw them at three o'clock, and missed them at a quarter before four o'clock. I ran to the bottom of my gardens. the gate was open, and I saw five boys runnings. I gave an alarm, but they got aways. this is one of the handkerchiefs I lost that day.</p>

I have had the fel<lb></lb>low-handkerchief to this to wash, for the same person, about three times. I can swear this is the one I washed that days. the mark was on it, and the number, but it was partly picked out when it was found on the prisoners. at seven o'clock in the evening, there was a person named Gomer, who came to say, he saw five boys running, and one of them had the handker<lb></lb>chief under his jacket, and the prisoner was one of the five.</p>

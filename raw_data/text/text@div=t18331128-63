               <p>BERNARD FARRELLY. On the 17th of September, I found myself in <placeName id="t18331128-63-crimeloc370">Glass-house-yard, Rosemary-lane</placeName>

I had my coat off, and my back upon a bed, and the prisoner was strangling me; it was before day-light - she was choking me with both her hands, and cut me very severely - when I took hold of one of her hands, she scratched me with the other, and bit a piece out of my nose - I had been, on the 16th of September, to the Borough, and I had a pocket-book and some memorandums in it, and a £10 bank-note - I saw it safe before I went to Rosemary-lane, at six or seven o'clock, and then they involved me to give them some drink - we did not go into any public-house; they had liquor in this private house - they fetched it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by they? A. There was another female with the prisoner, but she is the only person I can swear to, as being the person who robbed me, and nearly choked me - I had some liquor in the room down stairs; I did not go up stairs; I was the worse for liquor - I took off my coat, the pocket-book was in the breast pocket of the coat; when I awoke in the morning the pocket-book was gone - when the prisoner was mangling me, I suppose she meant to Burke me - I did not know the number of the note till I went to the cashier's - the book has not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR, DOANE. Q. Where do you live? A. In Kent. I came to Rosemary-lane to see a friend named Timmings; I knew him and his wife, they live handy to Rosemary-lane - I had not known the prisoner before; I do not know Mrs. Reed - I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280051"></xptr>received any rent that day - the prisoner asked me to go in, and give her some drink, and I did; there was another female there; I cannot tell the time; it was before dark; I treated them to beer and gin - I took some other persons up who were discharged; the prisoner was discharged, and I had her taken again - I do not know how long I was drinking - I had seen the pocket-book and note that evening, and to make a long story short, here is the note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went in, I suppose, sober? A. Not quite sober - I do not know the other person who was there - I had eight or nine sovereigns in a small pocketbook, in another pocket in my coat, and two handkerchiefs over them - I did not lose any of them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 17th I was called by a boy, about five o'clock - I found the prosecutor, the prisoner was in her room; he was outside the room, all over blood; he gave me charge of her; he missed his pocket-book, when he got his coat on - I searched the house, and found a handkerchief which he said was his, in a jacket pocket, which laid on the floor, in a room up-stairs, where there were two persons in bed - I afterwards traced this note from the Bank.</p>

            . I live in High-street, Shadwell. On the 30th of September the prisoner came to my shop; she bought a pair of blankets, and 20 yards of bed ticking - she paid me this £10 note; I wrote her address on it, the day of the month, and my initials.</p>

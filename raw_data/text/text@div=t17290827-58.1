He order'd Mr. Sawtell one of the Officers, to write a Letter directed to Mr. Williams on Board the Ship Cornwall, to be left at the Posthouse, Portsmouth, bidding him write it in as ordinary a Hand as he could; this being done, he put into it a Guinea and 2 s. wrapp'd up in a Piece of Paper, and seal'd the Letter with a Thimble, and then order'd Mr. Dickenson to put it into a Box among other Letters which the Prisoner was to stamp and face that Night: Then he gave Dickerson Orders how to behave in order to detect him.

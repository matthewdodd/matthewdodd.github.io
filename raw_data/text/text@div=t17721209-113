               <p>"G - d d - n him, knock him down, knock him down;" that then he was set upon by several of them, who beat him in a very violent manner, knocked him down, and tumbled their horses over him; that then they forced him towards a ditch about a road wide, and proposed to murder him, and throw him in; that then they forced him into the ditch; that he exerted himself, and slipt in so as to have his face upon the bank, and lie partly out of the water; that he received two violent blows as he was falling with large sticks or whips; that some of them had sticks as big as a man's wrist; that then one man struck him upon the eye, and another gave him a blow that took away his senses; that he soon recovered, and seeing the smugglers in confusion, and imagining that Playford and Warren were come to his assistance, he exerted himself, and got out of the water; that as he was rising, a smuggler upon a bald-faced horse, lifted up a whip, or stick, and threatened to knock him down, upon that recollecting he had a pistol in his waistcoat pocket, he presented it to him, upon which he gave back; that then Playford and Warren distinguished him, and Playford gave him his sword; he had wrested a whip from one of the smugglers, which he kept for his own defence; that then he and Playford stood back to back, and one of the smugglers, who was on his right, struck at the pistol, and knocked the cock down, but being wet it did not go off; that at the same time, another attacked him on the left with a large stick many times, which he held in both hands, because it was too large for one; (he described that man to be about the size and shape of the prisoner); that he was obliged to use the sword with his left hand while he held the pistol in his right; that he pricked him three times with his sword; that the last time he cut him on the cheek, under the left eye, upon which he gave back a little, which gave him an opportunity of changing his sword to his right hand, being released from the man he had presented the pistol at; that the smuggler continued to press upon him with his stick, upon which he pushed at him very hard; that he had a loose riding coat in, which seemed to prevent the sword penetrating; that the second time the sword went through his clothes, and the third thrust he stabbed him just under the left breast; that then the man left him, and the smugglers collected together and went off with their goods; that he found three tubs of brandy in the road, and then Hubbard came up and informed them that his horse had run away with him and had thrown him; that then Warren and Playford went in pursuit of the smugglers, and Hubbard went in search of his horse; he returned with his horse, and a fourth cask of brands, which they found in the road just beyond where the attack was made; that the man on the bald faced horse, and another came up, swore at him, and threatened him, upon which he presented a pistol to them, that he had received from Playford, upon which they went swearing away towards Hubbard; that he went to Hubbard's relief, and presently met him, who told him that the smugglers had taken the casks from him, and had threatned to murder him, but he said he knew them; that they were Will Skinner,

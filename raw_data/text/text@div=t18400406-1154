                  </hi>. I live in Boston-street, Regent's-park. On a Saturday, early in March, I was returning from Portman-square, going up Baker-street, close to the wall—the chapel clock struck five when I was in Port<lb></lb>man-square—I had a reticule in my hand, twisted round my arm, and the cord round my two fingers—a man threw his person upon me, almost felled me to the ground, and dragged at my reticule two of three times—he could not get it off, as he would have broken my arm if he did—it was a new re<lb></lb>ticule, with a yellow silk cord—his hat was over his face—I could not recognise his face—a woman was standing by the chapel—I called out, "Come and help me there," A thief—she stood like a statue, and never moved—he afterwards joined that woman—he did not leave me when I called out, but he squeezed my throat, and pressed me against the iron railing of the empty house which he attacked me at—I said, "Help, help!"—he said, "I will help you, if you will give me your bag"—I said, "Will I give you the bag? You shall try hard for it first"—he squeezed me almost to death, 1 have never had a day's health since—my arms have been black and blue for six weeks—I was full half-an-hour struggling with him, and not an omnibus or any thing passing all the time—nobody came to my assistance—it is most extraordinary—he took my reticule, with all the contents, from roe, and ran off with it—he snapped the cord, and all my fingers were cut, and my hand cut, as if it was with a knife—here is the mark now—he disabled me so, he got my reticule at last—there was a crimson silk purse in it, one sovereign of George the Fourth, quite a new half-sovereign of Queen Victoria, and, I think, five half-crowns—I had changed a sovereign in the morning, to buy some tea—there was also an emerald brooch in the bag, with a pearl, a large key of the house, and a pocket-handkerchief—I got up to Fin lay's public-house, and I saw him go up Adam-street with the woman—she opened the door of a house without knocking, and went in, and presently I saw the reticule thrown up in the air—he threw it into some house he was acquainted with—I do not know where it fell—I lost sight of it, but did not lose sight of him—I could not speak, I was so disabled—I saw Webster, the witness, and said, "Be so kind as to run after that man and woman, and say he has got my reticule"—I pointed the prisoner out to Webster—I continued on that side till a policeman came up to me, and said, "Make haste up, a young carpenter has secured the man"—I had not lost sight of him—I saw the carpenter take him—I saw him scuffle with him, and beating him, and trying to get away from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter.

Let me go, I have done nothing," and began wrestling with me—the prosecutrix came up after I had him a little while; but some children ran up first, and said he had stolen a bag—the lady then came up, and said all she wanted was her bag, and the money would not do him any good, and soon after the policeman came—the prisoner said to me, "Search me, I have done nothing"—he was not searched in the street—I delivered him to Macdonell, the policeman—there was nobody running but him, that I could see, but it was a dark night.</p>

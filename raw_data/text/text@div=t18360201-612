                  </hi>. I work in the employ of Mr. Frederick Farrand, of Long-lane, in the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey. I am a carpenter—I was at work there on the 7th of January, and at six o'clock I left work—I left my tools in the shop, at the back part of the premises—there is a fence and yard—the shop is within the yard, adjoining the house—on the Thursday evening, when I left work, I saw all the men out of the shop, and locked the shop door—I left six saws, hanging up at the end of my bench—I went at seven o'clock the next morning, and found a ladder stationed at the counting-house window—I saw the window had been broken—the counting-house forms part of the same buildings—there was room enough for a man who was not of every large dimensions to get through the place—I found the counting-house had been torn about, the cupboard broken, the shop door broken open, and the marks where a chi<lb></lb>sel</p>

I examined this counting-house, which had been all safe on the evening of the 7th—my attention was called the next morning to a ladder raised to the counting-house, and the window had been broken—I found the door of the workshop had been opened—I went and found the cupboard broken, all the locks were forced, except the iron safe—the drawers and closets had been ransacked, the books and bills were all gone; and the saddle, which had been left there the night before—the bills and papers were all found in this bag, which was stowed away under the shed, ready to be carried away—I should suppose the saddle was worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is crupper of it—there can be no doubt this is my crupper.</p>

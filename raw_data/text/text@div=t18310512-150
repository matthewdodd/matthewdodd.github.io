The prisoner came in between one and two o'clock, as I was serving three customers - I had never seen him before; he put the basket down, and sat down on it - when I had served my customers, I asked if it was cheap bread, (I sell stale and damaged bread), and while he was taking it out, the witness came in and claimed the bread; he ran out, they had a struggle, and fell down - I went out as soon as I could get round.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going past, another man and you came and asked me if I had any bread. Witness. No -I was serving some potatoes at the time; I did not buy the bread, neither should I, for I examined it, and found no fault with it.</p>

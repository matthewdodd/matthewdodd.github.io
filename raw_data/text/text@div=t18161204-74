My friend told me that it was the other man who had picked my pocket. I followed him, and could have seized him, but the prisoner stood in a menacing attitude, and prevented me. I saw the prisoner by a shop, where there was a very strong gas-light, so that I cannot he mistaken in his person; they got off. I had occasion to go by the same place for two or three nights following, and was hustled every time; in consequence of which I gave information at Bow-street, and the prisoner was taken about a week afterwards. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. GEORGE ANDREWS. On the 14th of November, I was walking along Coventry-street, with the last witness, I saw a man close behind us, and the prisoner and another man behind him; the first man was in the act of picking Mr. Silver's pocket; I am sure the prisoner saw the man take the handkerchief out; he appearcd to put his hands behind for the purpose of giving it to the other men; of whom the prisoner was one. Seeing that we observed them, they did not receive it, and it fell on the ground, at the prisoner's feet. The men ran off, and the prisoner passed us, and stood at the corner of a dark place, called George-yard; The man who took the handkerchief ran up the yard; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

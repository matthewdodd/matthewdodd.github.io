            . I lost my coat with a pair of breeches, and a handkerchief in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Friend. Seven weeks ago last Friday; I left nobody in the room but the prisoner at the bar; he very much importuned me to go and fetch him a pint of beer, and while I was gone, he was gone and my coat also.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure your coat was in the room when you went out?</p>
               <p>Friend. I am sure it was; as sure as we are all here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your things, or any of them again?</p>
               <p>Friend. I got the handkerchief and gloves again the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not accuse him the last sessions?</p>
               <p>Friend. He was then in Tothill-fields bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Friend. He said he was quite innocent.</p>

            . I am serjeant in the same company with the prisoner; the prosecutor came to me on the 19th of July, in the morning, and told me he had been robbed of his coat and things by the prisoner; I told him the prisoner had lain out of the barracks all night; the prosecutor described the coat: in about half an hour's time the prisoner came, and I confined him; after which I saw him take and throw the gloves into the hole as he was coming out (produc'd in court, and depos'd to) then I took a candle and looked about, and I saw this handkerchief, (produced, and deposed to) I charged the prisoner with the coat, he denied it; Mr. Friend said he should be contented to have him tried by a court marshal; but the court would not try him; he having been punished several times for such crimes before; then the colonel gave me a shilling to go and get a warrant from Mr. Fielding, and gave him up to the law.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of it; as I was coming down stairs in this man's house I took up the gloves and handkerchief, and put them into my pocket.</p>

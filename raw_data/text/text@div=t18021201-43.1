               <p>Q.Whereabouts had you laid it? - A. I laid it within six inches of the iron bar which goes about six inches from the door jam.</p>
               <p>Q.Might a person going by easily have taken it? - A. Yes, by pulling it hard; I immediately asked a friend's advice, and he recommended me to go to Bow-street; I went there immediately; then I went to Crocker's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Crocker? - A. A Bow-street officer; according to his directions, I went to the top of Doyl-street, and stood within Russell-street, at the top of Dyot-street, in company with John Mountain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a currier, and live in Bell's-rents, John-street, Southwark. On the 23rd of February I was coming through the Strand—we met the prisoner Page, and some more young women—we gave them something to drink, then we went to an eating-house, then went and had some more drink—after that, Page took me to Morte's-place, over Waterloo-bridge—when I was going over the bridge, I looked at my watch, and it was then safe—when I got to her house I separated my purse from my copper—my purse contained 15 sovereigns and eight shil<lb></lb>lings—I then went up stairs with her—I remained half-an-hour, or three quarters—I pulled off my clothes and went to bed, but as I did not find Page was coming, I jumped up—I took up my trowsers—I heard the coppers jingling, and I thought all as right—I then missed my watch, my purse, and money—Seymour then came in and collared me—he said, I did not take it there, and he turned me out of the house—I called the police—we went to the station-house, then went back to the house, and an old woman attacked me, and my nose bled—the officer took her, and she had three months' imprisonment—we could not get in, and the house was not searched.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020212"></xptr>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went home with Page, do you recollect producing any money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—only at the door, I separated my purse from my cop<lb></lb>pers, while she was rapping, in order to button my pocket—I had my purse in my hand when I went into the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you never said you had not seen your purse and money from the time you left the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have said I did not see them, but I felt them—I mentioned about separating my purse from my coppers, and feeling the purse—I had seen my watch in going over Waterloo-bridge—I took it out, and looked what o'clock it was—I mentioned that, and I think it was taken down—I am positive I said it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After you say you had lost all this, you saw an old woman a ser<lb></lb>vant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not charge her with being in the room while I was with Page—that I swear—I charged no one with coming into the room, but Seymour—I did not say that that woman assisted Amelia in getting the money out of my pocket—nor that the money had been put on a trunk, or in a trunk under the bed—I said there was a trunk in the room—after the prisoners were taken to the station-house we went back to the house, and the old woman struck at me right and left—the officer had not time to make a search—he had to take her with him—there was no other policeman brought to search the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to leave the Bolton police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I resigned under Sir Charles Shaw—I heard that this case was kept back till the solicitor had an answer from Sir Charles Shaw—I receive 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from a tan-yard of my brother's—the rent is paid half-yearly—I received these fifteen sovereigns for the half-year due at Christmas, on the 3rd of February—I received it in Bolton—I received the letter on the Sunday, and got the money on the Thursday following—mine was a double-cased watch, which I have had ever since 1833—the dress I had on that night was the same as I have on now, with the exception of a scarf—I have always been quite certain as to the dress I had on—I have been asked about it, and always gave a clear account of my dress.</p>

               <p>then came back, and the prosecutor said to her, "You assisted the female prisoner in taking the trunk from under the bed"—se di<lb></lb>rectly flew at his face, and brought blood from him—she went to him a second time, and did it again, and he insisted on my taking her to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—I did so, and then went on my beat—I did not go back to the house again till the next day, when we came back from Union-hall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at Mr. Price's oyster-rooms, in the Strand. I recollect seeing the prosecutor there on Sunday week last with a man, the prisoner Page, and the witness Gibson—they came about half-past ten, or eleven o'clock at night—when they came in first they had half a pint of gin—I fetched it myself—the prosecutor's friend paid for it—I did not see them drink it, I left the room—our cook had gone to bed, and the prosecutor ordered some chops, which I cooked myself—they had three chops, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prosecutor's friend paid for them—he paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave me the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I learned that the prosecutor's friend's name was Captain Golding—he then lived in a court in the Strand—I know the court, but I forget the name of it—he is now gone to Ireland—I recollect, before the prosecutor's friend gave me any money, that he said to the prosecutor, "Now, you villain, you have ordered the chop, pay for them"—the prosecutor said, "You know I have no money"—the prosecutor's friend pulled the bell-rope down in ringing for me, and he paid me—I saw him take the money out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know all about Captain Golding? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We went on Tuesday night to his lodgings—he had come a night or two before to my master's house, and got drinking—my master learned his name, and he left word where he lived—my master sent me there with two or three more—with Gibson, and a young man named Phillips, and they said he went to Ireland—I do not know what day my master sent me—I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday—it was in March—MRS. Seymour was with me and Gibson and Mr. Phillips—the first time I saw Gibson after that Sunday night was the night that they came to me—it was on Tuesday or Wednesday—I knew Gibson again directly, that I swear—I have no doubt about her whatever—I had seen her before that Sunday—I had seen her Walk up and down the Strand—our shop is next door to the theatre in the Strand.</p>

               <p>Gibson before that day—I sent her to listen to what Gibson and Seymour's wife were saying before the trial came on, and she remained nearly an hour hearing what they said—my wife it in a house just by, and if you send for her, and put Gibson in any corner of the Court, the will pick her out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 128.) I was on duty at Tower-street station-house on the morning of the 24th of February—I had this charge to take to the Hall myself—the prosecutor met me at the station-house, and had an inclination to speak to me—I would listen to nothing he had to say—I heard him in conversation with his friend at Union Hall, and his friend was interrogating him very closely as to his being capable of swearing to the person who hid robbed him—I heard him tell his friend more than once that he was so drunk he could not tell, but he firmly believed that these were the persons who had his money—Gibton is not the girl who was with Seymour's wife at the office—it was a girl younger in appearance, and half a head shorter.</p>

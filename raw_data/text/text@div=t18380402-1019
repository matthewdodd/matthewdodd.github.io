I was driving a wagon of theirs on the 17th of March, about nine o'clock at night, through Oxford-street—I stopped at Charles-street, went to the back of the wagon, and missed a chest of tea, which I had from Fickson &amp; Co., in Queen-street—it was directed to go by Daniel Deacon—it had been on the front of the wagon—my mate was asleep on the top of the wagon.</p>

I live in Hanway-street, and am a china-dealer On that Saturday, about nine o'clock, I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner reach a box from the wagon—I am certain he is the man—in crossing the road a driver of an omnibus called to him, and a hat fell—he did not stop, but went on—I followed him through Hanway-street—I there saw a policeman—I told him, and the tea was taken on the prisoner's shoulders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Fickson and Co., of Queen-street, grocers.

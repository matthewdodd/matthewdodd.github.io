            . I am a constable; on the 24th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, as I was passing down Newgate-street, I saw the prisoner standing in the street; I saw two waggons, one unloading, and the other waiting to be unloaded; I walked on with my parcel to the Saracen's head, Snow Hill; I delivered my parcel and returned up <placeName id="t18061203-8-crimeloc43">Newgate-street</placeName>

               <p>JOHN - . Q. You are the waggoner. - A. Yes, I was feeding the horses all the time, I saw the prisoner go round the waggon several times, I had no suspicion of him taking any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cheese again. - A. Yes, a young lad came and informed me of it.</p>
               <p>- . On the 24th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the first witness stop the prisoner, with something that he was carrying in his arm. I went over the way to them, and saw it was a cheese; the prisoner was taken to Mr. Clarke's shop, and there the cheese was marked.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

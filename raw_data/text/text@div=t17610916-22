            . This was the 3 d. of Aug.</p>
               <p>Q. What man was it?</p>
               <p>A. Maddox. I do not know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that man [directing her to Rant.</p>
               <p>M. Hawley. That is the man: he pulled off his cloaths, and laid them down by him. Shaw took my apron, and tied his coat up in it, and carried it into Field-lane to sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen that man before?</p>
               <p>M. Hawley. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner seem to know him?</p>
               <p>M. Hawley. No, they thought he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to them, when Shaw took his coat.</p>
               <p>M. Hawley. No, he only said, give me my equipage. I went after Shaw, to Field-lane, to the door where she went in, the people did not chuse to buy it, then she went and pawned it for 3 s. 6 d. and fetched out a new checque-apron with part of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she pawn it?</p>
               <p>M. Hawley. At Cow-cross, to Mr. Masters. She gave me the box that was in the coat-pocket: the perriwig she put upon a bush, and somebody took it away. She gave one buckle to Garret, and the other to Allen: she would have given me a groat, but I would not take it. The other two prisoners had no share of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man make any resistance?</p>
               <p>M. Hawley. No, he was not able.</p>
               <p>Mr. Masters. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Cow-cross. I lent Shaw 3 s. 6 d. on this coat here produced. She told me she brought it from one Mr. Knight, and she redeemed a checque apron at the same time, that lay for 18 d.</p>
               <p>Rant was set up, but not sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what these women did to you?</p>
               <p>Rant. I attribute it to downright madness.</p>
               <p>Q. Doing what?</p>
               <p>Rant. Their doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that lady ( meaning Mrs. Maddox)</p>
               <p>Rant. I know her, I lodge there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to take care of you?</p>
               <p>Rant. By my inquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pays for your lodging?</p>
               <p>Rant. I am responsible in the watch-making to my obligations.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176109160026"></xptr>Q. How much a week do you get?</p>
               <p>Rant. Seven or eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what it is to take an oath?</p>
               <p>Rant. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what will be the consequence if you take a false oath?</p>
               <p>Rant. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What?</p>
               <p>Rant. The production of money, find money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what obligation you are under when you take an oath?</p>
               <p>Rant. Nothing but a fine, as the law shall demand.</p>

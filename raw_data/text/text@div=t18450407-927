                  </hi>. I keep a hosier's shop, in Newgate-street. On the 4th of Feb. I observed my shop-window broken—it bad been done by what they call starring the glaze—I missed a large number of shawls, handkerchiefs, and other things, from near where the window was broken—the handkerchiefs which are here are a part of what I lost about ten minutes before, or after nine that evening—they had been near the broken window—they have all got my writing on them—these gloves have not got my mark on them, but I have some similar to them, and I lost some of them.</p>

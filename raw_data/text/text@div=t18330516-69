             (police-sergeant, G 3). On the 13th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the Duke of York, in Gloucester-street - I had suspicion from seeing a suspicious character waiting outside - I went in and saw the prisoner sitting on this property; I asked him where he got it, he said it was not his - I took him, and found this purse and 2s. 4d. on him, and this piece of fur - I found the prosecutor on the Monday after.</p>

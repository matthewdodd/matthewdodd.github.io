            . I am servant to Mrs. Barnett, the Hammersmith carrier. I remember the box being delivered to me, directed to Master Cartwright; I took it to Northend, but could not find the owner - I then took it to Mr. Donaldson's shop, and left it there all night; next morning I saw the prisoner inquiring for Mrs. Barnett's stable- I did not know him before, but I told him I was her servant - he then asked me if I had a box directed to Master Cartwright, to be left at North-end, Fulham; he said it ought to have been directed to be left at the Red Lion, near North-end, Fulham - that he had been to the person who sent it; that he told him he sent it to the booking-office on the Friday, that he had been to the booking-office, and they told him Mrs. Barnett's cart had it; I came with him to the lane close to our yard, where he saw another man waiting for him, and he told him he had found it; I then went to the shop where I had left it, took it out, and walked with them towards North-end; they asked me what the carriage was - I said 1s.; they said, as I had had so much trouble and running about, they would give me another 1s. - the other man gave the prisoner 1s., and the prisoner gave me 2s., and they took away the box, which has never been found; when they were gone I began to think that all was not right - I ran after them, and said that I would rather go with them and deliver it myself; they said I need not do that, as there were two of them, and they had been sent for it - we went on as far as the Three Kings; we there had a pint of ale, and I went away - on the Saturday after we heard that it was lost, and on the Tuesday after I saw the prisoner and the other man, walking in Holborn; I jumped out of my cart, got a woman to mind it, and followed them from Grays' Inn-lane, to Chancery-lane, with an intention of finding an officer, but I did not see one; I then went up to them, and said,"A pretty row you have got me into about this box:" the prisoner said, "There is a row if you will go along with me, I'll put it all right" - he called the other man Jack or John, and said "Here's the man about this box;" the prisoner said to me "Can you go with me to Harry's?" I said I could not, but I saw my mistress in another cart; I asked him to go and speak to her, which he did; she asked him to go to the booking-office and make it all right there - he said he would, and he went on till he came to a court; he ran down there into a house; I ran after him, collared him and pulled him back - I am sure he is the man; his companion had gone off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did not you take us both? A. I could not; I do not think the other staid five minutes -I followed you up Holborn, and you were looking into a shop; if I had seen an officer I would have given charge of you both - you told my mistress the box was all right.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not find I had lodged at a barber's shop there? A. Yes, at No. 28, not No. 3.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I consider it is a concerted plan, between the carrier and her man; I can assure you, however clear their evidence is against me, that I was not at Hammersmith at that time; I was not out of town till eleven o'clock that day, when I was at the Elephant and Castle; I took my breakfast in Drury-lane at nine o'clock: it is very clear some person changed the direction, and it is an astonishing thing to me, that the porter does not know something about it - it must have been somebody connected with the booking office that did it.</p>

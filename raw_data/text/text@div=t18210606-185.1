            . I am constable of Pancras. I know Richard Holt by seeing him on this occasion. On Saturday the 21st of April, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Oxford-street, and saw the prisoners in a gang of seven, and pointed them out to Cooper, and desired him to watch them, and I watched myself - they turned into <placeName id="t18210606-185-crimeloc1066">Bond-street</placeName>

            , and I saw Corbett following him. I saw Corbett take a pocket-book out of Holt's pocket, and give it, I think, to Hutchins. I saw it pass between them, and I think Hutchins took it; he was close to Corbett; Wyatt was obstructing Holt in his way at the time; I saw Hutchins make a motion, as if he was putting something under his coat. I was on the opposite side of the way, and had been watching them for two hours. The rest of the party then joined them, and they all went down Brook-street, except one, who continued leaning on a post, looking at the gentleman; that was neither of the prisoners. As soon as I could, I ran to the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060081"></xptr>and told him he was robbed. He said, he was not; but felt and missed his pocket-book - he went into a shop, and I declined following them till I got his address. I then went immediately and got further assistance - I went in search, but could not find them. I took them on the Monday, in the act of picking pockets - I waited in Bond-street, and saw them come into the street together - Fowler and Saunders were with me. I pointed them out. - Fowler took Wyatt; Saunders took Corbett; Hutchins turned away down the street - I followed and took him. We found nothing on them - they were taken to the office - I am certain they are the men. Holt appeared against them as the person robbed, and described himself as 
               <persName id="t18210606-185-person1838">
                  Richard

            . When I took Hutchins, he asked what I wanted, and what use was it my going to tell the swell - he said, it was of no consequence, it was only for an attempt, and he could get bail for 1000 l. I took him at that time in the act of attempting a gentleman's pocket. I saw Holt's pocket-book taken plainly; it was a red book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. There were seven of them - A. Yes; sometimes together and sometimes apart - a great many people were passing - I think three of them were dressed in blue and another in green. I knew the prisoners before personally, and cannot be mistaken. I have been beat about by several gangs, and did not think two persons sufficient to take them - I went on Monday prepared for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How came you to know Holt's Christian name - A. He appeared by the name of Richard. I went after them the instant I got his address.</p>

            . I am a staymaker, and live in Tash-street. On the 21st of April I was with Colton, and saw the prisoners and three or four more, and watched them from Oxford-street - I think they were there half an hour. They then went into Bond-street. I saw Corbett follow a gentleman, who I afterwards found to be

             - I was on the opposite side of Bond-street, and saw them there for half an hour; I then saw Corbett go behind Holt, take a red pocket-book out of his pocket, and give it to Hutchins - I believe it was taken from the outside pocket; the other four were close round surrounding them. Wyatt was just before Holt; I had observed them together all the time. Colton said it would not be safe to apprehend them, so we went and told the gentleman - he felt and missed his pocket-book - they went down Brook-street - one of the four remained, leaning on a post at the corner of Brook-street. I am certain of their persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. Are you a constable - No; I met Colton promiscuously, as I was going to St. Anne's-street on business; we walked up Oxford-street; he pointed them out, and told me to watch. I am not in the habit of accompanying him. I passed and re-passed them several times, and saw their faces. I am positive Corbett took the pocket-book. We watched them above two hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you ever find your way to Chancery-lane of an evening - A. I sometimes go to chambers to bail above, for a lawyer in Gray's-inn. I do not stand there - I am not in the habit of bailing people. I think I could pick out all the seven men. I may have given bail four or five times in my life; I never go before the Judge, nor do I swear. I was never rejected.</p>

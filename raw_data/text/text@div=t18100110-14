            . I am shopman to Mr. Romanis in Cornhill. On the 22d of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing in the shop; I saw the stockings were shaking; they were hung at the door, part in and part out; I heard a noise as if some of them had been snatched; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner crossing the road with the stockings over his shoulder; I ran after him, and called, stop thief; he dropped the stockings and attempted to ran away; some persons hearing me call stop thief, stopped him; I never lost sight of him. I picked up the stockings. He was brought back to the shop, and I gave him in charge of the constable.</p>

The Angel-bridge crosses the Wash, and Water-lane turns down by the side of it—my farm is opposite the Fleece—if a person went down Water-lane about half a mile, and then turned to the left down Journeyman-green, there is then a gate which was nailed up, and a bridge—if a person went through that gate, and through three meadows, and three other gates, it will lead to the back of my stack-yard—when you get to the end of the meadows there is a cow-yard, but that had not been entered—a cart had stopped at the end of the last meadow, and there turned round, about fifteen or twenty yards from where the hay was, and across the cow-yard, which was littered up with haulm—on Friday, the 9th of January, I had thirty-six trusses of hay loaded on a cart, with a new tilt over it, under the shed—it was bound, and ready for market—I saw it safe at seven o'clock that evening—at four o'clock the next morning, my man called me up, and said the hay was gone—I found the cart empty about six o'clock, and have not seen any of the hay since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of Edmonton. On Saturday, the 10th of January, I received notice of the loss of this hay—I went with Morison to Water-lane—I saw the track of a cart drawn by one horse—I saw it just at the corner, turning down from the high road towards the farm—the track was very recent—it went round down Journeyman-green, across the meadows—the first gate was open, and the others also—when the cart had got to the end of the meadows, it appeared to have turned round, and there were the impressions of a cart, which appeared to have gone back across the same fields, down the same lane, and turned into the road towards Lon<lb></lb>don—the near hind shoe of the horse which had drawn the cart appeared to have been recently turned up for roughing, and the off hind shoe had two stumps behind it—the hind shoes made different impressions—I saw no<lb></lb>thing about the fore-shoes any more than common—Forster had some horse-shoes in his possession afterwards, which appeared to me as if they would have made the impressions I saw on the ground—I did not see them fitted to the marks.</p>

I got a black blind horse, which was fetched from Ponder's-End on the 16th of January—Kirk rode it up in my presence, to the smith's shop, near the Angel at Edmonton—Belford told me it was his horse—I caused the smith to take off the off shoe behind, and the off shoe before—these are them—it was Camp's mis<lb></lb>take, to say it was the near hind shoe, it was the front off-shoe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me the last time it went out, Webb took it; when was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The last time I saw it, was on Wednesday—I did not see Webb fetch it after that, to my knowledge—it was out, because it was not in the yard—I was in the yard on Thursday and Friday, and it was not there, but I do not know how it got out—he might take it at any time—he brought it home on Saturday, he did not say where he had been—no one but Webb used it during the month.</p>

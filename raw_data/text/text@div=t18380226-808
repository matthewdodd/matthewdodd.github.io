                  </hi>. I am a City Marshal. On the 27th of February I went to make a search at Bailey's house, at No. 57, Grey Eagle-street—it was about six o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came in there, and he spoke to a female, and asked to see Bailey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear his name mentioned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The woman mentioned his name—she said, "Ridgway, here is a pretty mess"—I asked him if he bad seen Bailey that day—he said he had not—I asked him if he had any dealings in silk with Bailey—he said he had not—I think I asked him if he had any silk to dispose of, and he also said he had not—I asked him for his address—he said, in Grantham-place—I asked tint some time after where Grantham-place was—at last he said it was at Hoxton, and he also gave me his own address, "No. 3, Foster-lane"—I asked him if he had any place of business there—he said he had not—I asked him if he had any drawers, or counters, or any place there—he said no, he had not, he was merely an agent for Mr. Mills and Mr. Henwood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know who occupies the house in Foster-lane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is let out in counting-houses—Mr. Hen wood has got a warehouse there—he was speaking of that Mr. Henwood—I did not tell him he was my prisoner till after this conversation took place—I then told him he must be my pri<lb></lb>soner—he said he was respectably known to Mr. Peanall and to Mr. Ram—while I was taking him down to the station-house in Spitalfields, he asked me whether it was any thing relative to Mr. Fellowes's robbery—I made no reply—I did not satisfy him on that point—on the following morning I went to No. 3, Foster-lane, with Herdsfield, and saw Mr. Hen<lb></lb>wood there—on my saying I had Ridgway's keys, he showed me the beck attic at the top of the house—he opened it—I do not think it was locked—it was not furnished—it was merely fitted up with a scale and a kind of counter and board to put the weights on—there were no drawers—it was merely supported by a trestle—they were very large scales, and weights corresponding—such scales as would weigh a pretty bulky quantity—there were eleven parcels of sewing-silks, and some other silk on the ground, which I brought away—that was a truss of silk with a card attached to it—it had been opened and sewn up—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is the card—it was sewn on the canvas, and was in this state when I took it off—I sent Herdsfield for</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it not Grantham-terrace he said he lived at? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I found that correct—I went to No. 3, Foster-lane, on the 28th—at that time the prisoner was in custody—this robbery had made consider<lb></lb>able noise in the City—particularly among the silk people—large placards were posted all over the walls, offering £200 reward, from the 16th—it was perfectly notorious, from the 16th, that this robbery had been committed—I was at the Mansion-house when this case was gone into—I remember the two Shermans, father and son, being in charge—they were afterwards examined as witnesses, and kept in custody to give evidence—they are in custody now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What passed between you and Ridgway, in October, about purchasing any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he had met with a friend who had advanced him a considerable sum of money, and he should have silk to sell at times, such as he could not use—that he was commencing manufacturing, and should have silk which he could not use—I told him I should have no objection to take any thing that would do for me—I afterwards saw him in Maccles<lb></lb>field.</p>

I go with the cart driven by Bray, to deliver parcels—I remember taking a package to Foster-lan"—I do not recollect whether is was on Saturday—I did not get the money for it—I was to call again—the package was delivered at Ridgway's, No. 3, Foster-lane—I carried it myself up two pairs of stairs—not to the top of the house—the ticket was signed and given back to me, and I gave it to Bray—this is something like the bale I took—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the one produced</hi>)—I cannot tell whether it is the same.</p>

            . I am a cork-cutter, and live in William-street, Regent's-park. I was in Kensington-gardens, heard a cry, and ran with another person in that direction - I saw the prisoner running towards us, in an opposite direction to Mr. Meyer, about a furlong from him - he then turned, and went in another direction, at a good pace - I went up to him, and asked what was the matter; I did not distinctly hear his answer then; but afterwards, when I returned from assisting Mr. Meyer. (whom I left bleeding on the box with the porter.) he told me he was in want - the grass was very high, and I could not see whether any one else was near Mr. Meyer.</p>

            . I was with Stewart, in Kensington-gardens. I heard a cry of Murder! and saw Mr. Meyer run without his hat; I looked after him, and at some distance I saw the prisoner walk, and then begin to run; he was the nearest person to Mr. Meyer; he walked up towards us, and I asked him what he did to the gentleman - I think he said, nothing; I took him, and Stewart went to see for Mr. Meyer; there was a labouring man stood with me; the prisoner asked me to let him go; I said I would not; he said he was doing his business, and the gentleman came and took him by the collar, and said the park was no place to do any thing of that kind in; he then wanted to go again, but I said, "If that was all, he had nothing to fear."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FISH. Q. There was a considerable concourse of people, was there not? A. No; the prisoner was on one side of the river, and we were on the other, which is a considerable distance; he was going in a direction from the gentleman.</p>

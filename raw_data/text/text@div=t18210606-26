            . I am an officer. On the 16th of May, about two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me in the Strand, and said he had been robbed of 15 s. at a brothel in Swan-yard - he described the girls to me. I went with him to the house; I afterwards searched him, but found nothing on him. I searched a boy named Green, who was in his company, and found the duplicate of this watch on him. He said, in the prisoner's hearing, that the prisoner pawned the watch at Dry's, and gave him the duplicate - the prisoner denied it. I was taking him home, by the Magistrate's orders, but he took me to different places; at last he told me Green stole the watch, at Covent Garden, and gave it to him to pawn; he took me to the pawnbroker's. I went to the watch-maker, and found the prosecutor out.</p>

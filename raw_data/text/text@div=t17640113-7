Under the window, on one side the door, we took the whole pannel out: I got into the shop, and took out three great coats, four waistcoats, eight shirts, and eight silk and cotton handkerchiefs, five pieces of printed linnen, two remnants of silk, one about 8 yards long, a black cardinal, six pair of white gloves, four pair of worsted stockings and an odd one, we dropt the other; I hauled down a blanket from one side the shop, but did not take it away; I handed them out to the prisoner, then we put them into a bag, and went away with them, and the things that we broke the house with, to Thompson's house; there we distributed the things. He took three shirts, and I took three: we sent our wives to sell some of the things in Rosemary-lane.

            . I had a warrant against Branch from the bench of Justices, on Christmas-day in the morning: I went down to Saltpetre bank, and met with him there between 11 and 12 in the day. He made his information before the Justices, in Whitechapel, on the Monday: he impeached Thompson, as being concerned with him in breaking the house, and Biass for receiving a coat and waistcoat, and also he gave an account of other robberies. Then I went over the water, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130007"></xptr> Thompson; and, in the house where he lodged, we found a coat and waistcoat on his bed; we tied his hands. Said he, pray is Branch turned informer? I said he is not made an evidence yet, but he has made an information. Said he, I doubt you are going to deceive me? I said no, he is not admitted; the prisoner had a white coat on: he said, the man that owns this coat, shall die with me, if I die; and a dozen of them shall die, if they will admit me an evidence. After we had secured Thompson, in the watch-house, we went to seek for Biass; we found him at cards in his lodgings, and he was committed.</p>

            . I was sent for to know if I could see any thing of the people that did this robbery. I was coming out of the Gun and Holly-bush, in the Back-lane, and saw Biass, with a bundle under his arm; I followed him; there was the evidence with him; they turned back, and looked at me, and ran away; I shot after them, and overtook them in a little alley; I took hold of the bundle, and said, my lad, let us see what you have got?

On the 17th Febru<lb></lb>ary, about five o'clock in the morning, I was between Bow-bridge and Bow-church—I saw the two prisoners a short distance apart—perhaps twenty yards, walking the same way—I stopped Johnson with these two pieces of cotton tied up in a blue handkerchief—I asked him what he had got there—he said he had got some prints, and he had brought them from Messrs. Lane's, at Harlow—as the patterns did not suit, he was going to take them to Bethnal-green, to have them exchanged—I thought it was an unlikely story, and took him to the station-house—I called my brother-officer, who went after Turner, and he brought him with another bundle—he said he got them near the Horse-shoes, at Potters-street, which is about three miles below Epping—that he took them out of a bale he found in the road, and thought they had dropped from Mr. Mend, the Harlow waggoner—I went to the King's Arms, in Leadenhall-street, and saw Mr. Mend, and found he had lost a small bale of goods of this description.</p>

Gurling, of Harlow—it had been put in the middle of the waggon—it was a tilted waggon—I arrived at Harlow about eight o'clock on Wednesday morning—Joseph Stoten was with me—the bale could not have fallen out—Johnson had driven the waggon for me before—it it about six weeks since he left—he knew the road.</p>

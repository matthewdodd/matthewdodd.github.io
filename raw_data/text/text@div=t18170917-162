            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Wild-street. I was in the market about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prosecutrix there. The prisoner and another boy stood by her-the prisoner was on one side, soon after he came in the middle. The prosecutrix stooped to take up her basket; I saw a hand drawn from her pocket - I did not know which of them it was; it was one of the boys; they walked on about four yards. I asked her if she had lost her money? she felt, and asked me who it was? I told her I saw a hand come out of her pocket-two of the boys ran away. As soon as the prisoner was taken she took her money from him. He said,"Mrs. Marney, let go; I have taken no money from any person."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw the prisoner until the time he was taken. She did not miss the money till I asked her. She said she had lost the pear-box, with the money in it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard the cry of"Stop him! he has picked the woman's pocket." The prisoner ran against me; I seized him, and asked what money he had about him? he said he had no money about him whatever. I found two half-crowns in his left hand. one half-crown, and 1s. in his pocket; he attempted to swallow something; I found 3s. 6d. in his mouth - He denied having any money in his mouth. The prosecutrix said she put her money in a box, but the box opened, and the money was loose in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I asked him why he said he had no money? he said he knew I was going to rob him, and swear his life away. He did not say it was his own money.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, yesterday was a week, to lord Buckinghamshire's. The prisoner unlocked his box. We let him take the things out, and put them on his bed. There was a great quantity of things; I saw him lay a parcel in a paper on the bed, after which I went to look into the bottom of the box; when I came to look for the paper parcel, it was missing, and I found it betwixt the blankets and sheets of his bed. I found two keys upon him, which seem as if they would open almost any door (Producing two picklocks, part of the wards were taken out.)</p>

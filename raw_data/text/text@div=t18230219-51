On the 25th January, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop together - no other customers were there; I was the only person serving. They bought some Irish and flannel, and a blanket which were to be put up for them. I knew Sullivan before, but not Dowling - she came to recommend Dowling, who bought the goods. They were half an hour in the shop; there were other goods on the counter. I missed nothing, but the officer came in in about twenty minutes, while I was putting away the blankets, which I had shewn them. I accompanied him to the office without looking if anything was gone, and found the prisoners there in custody. I saw the articles there in a basket. I found three hearth rugs in one basket, and some flannel in the other - they were my master's property. I returned to the shop, and missed them; they had laid at the side of the shop, about two yards from the counter, against the wainscoat. Dowling sat on a stool close to the counter, and Sullivan stood at her side, and each had a basket - Dowling had a cloak on, and I think Sullivan a coat. I went behind a partition at the back of the shop for ten minutes, for the blankets, and I could not then see into the front.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 25th of January, I was on duty at Charing-cross; with Ball, and saw the two prisoners coming towards the Horse Gaurds, in a direction from Cockspur-street. As we passed them Dowling slipped down by accident, and I saw this roll of flannel under her cloak, with the shop ticket on it - Sullivan lifted her up; they walked on about twenty yards together, and Dowling staggered in the road - Ball caught hold of her arm, and brought her on the pavement - Sullivan had then left Dowling, and was crossing the road; I fetched her back to where Dowling stood, and as I took the flannel from under Dowling's arm, two had shillings fell out of her hand, as she was trying to snatch the ticket off the flannel - she shut her hand again; I forced it open, and took three bad shillings from it, tied in a piece of rag. I gave her to Ball, and took Sullivan into custody; I found two hearth rugs, and a bill of the prosecutor's, and 20 s. in silver in her basket.</p>

The prisoner was in our employ, and has been so since the 7th of July—on Monday evening, the 17th of December, I heard a noise in the ware-room, about half-past five o'clock—I went on the stairs, and called the servant—she answered me from another room—I then went to the ware-room, and saw the prisoner facing a closet, which contained glue and candles—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, in partnership with Mr. Karslake, and carry on business in Regent-street. The prisoner was in our employ as clerk from the 1st of January, 1832, down to the 15th of August, 1835—at that time we kept a cash account at Bosanquet's—I was in the habit of drawing cheques on account of office business, and sending them by clerks, and I was also in the habit of paying in drafts which I received on other banks—we generally paid in and presented drafts at the same time, if we had occasion, as we lived at some distance from the bankers—the prisoner would have the opportunity of knowing that prac<lb></lb>tice—in July, 1835, I received a letter from Griffiths Jones, of Welsh Pool—I had before that spoken to the prisoner about his irregular attend<lb></lb>ance, and he said if he did not give satisfaction he had better go, and I said he had—I afterwards received this letter from Welsh Pool, to which I wrote an answer, and gave it to the prisoner to take a copy of by the machine—after making the copy he brought it to me himself—he had no authority from me to make a second copy—he never told me that he had done so—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two sheets of paper</hi>)—these appear to be copies of the two first sheets of the same letter—they were no doubt made the ma<lb></lb>chine—the signature I use in drawing drafts on bankers correspond gene<lb></lb>rally</p>

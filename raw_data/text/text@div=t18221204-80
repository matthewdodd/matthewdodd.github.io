            . Parker brought two chests, and put them in the warehouse just by the scales, twelve yards from the door. It was then dark. I saw</p>
               <p>"S. Ogle, Leeds," marked on them. In about half an hour I saw a man lay hold of one of them, pitch it on an end, and put it on his shoulder, and go towards the gate. I came up with him outside the gate, and said,</p>
               <p>"My good fellow what are you going to do with that chest;" he mentioned some name. I collared him, he gave a hollow like an owl, and the prisoner came from over the way, struck me on the mouth, and cut my lip without saying any thing; I had hold of the man at the time, and he threw the chest down; it struck me on the toe. He got away leaving it behind. I laid hold of the prisoner; he dragged me six or eight yards through the mud, but I held him. Hodge came up, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You cannot say whether he was present at the time of the robbery. A. No. There was five or six people round me inside the gate after the scuffle, but at the time he came over I saw nobody else near; some people were a few yards off; it was five minutes before I could get assistance. I am sure he is the man who struck me, for I never lost sight or let go of him.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was sent for, and found the prisoner in custody; he resisted being searched. I put my hand into his left hand pocket; he swore he would not have his money taken from him by any man. He went quietly with me towards the Compter till we got to Wood-street, where four or five men attempted to rescue him. I was struck in the mouth, and my hat knocked off; he made every effort himself to get away. I found 6 l. 9 s. 6 d. on him, which was returned him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Atkinson says I came up and struck him, and nobody was near; and this man says he saw me come over and strike him. I was coming by, very groggy, and as another stranger might, I stood looking on. I was struck and collared, and asked what I had done. I should not have struck him if I was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>All the witnesses declared the prisoner to be perfectly sober.</p>

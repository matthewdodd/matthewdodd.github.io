            ; I lost a looking-glass; on Friday the 5th of September, the prisoner came in and took off the looking glass; she was taking up the glass; I followed her immediately and overtook her about five yards from my own door; she was going to set down the glass; and I caught hold of her; I took her to the office myself; this is the glass; it is mine.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>It rained very hard last Friday evening; I was standing up by a door, when a woman came to me, and said, let this glass stand by you; I am moving, and I have lost my child; I run after the woman, and caught fast hold of her; and she tore a piece out of my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you see her in the shop? - I did; there was a woman came up to her, and followed me to the shop; and took hold of the prisoner's gown; when she came back to the shop, she came up with her to the shop door.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the prisoner was the same woman that you saw in the shop? - I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

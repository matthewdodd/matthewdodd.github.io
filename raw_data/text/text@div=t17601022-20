               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. It was either a quarter before eleven at night, or about eleven; they came from under the arch way, behind me; one laid on one side of my collar, another the other side, and the third took hold on the slap of my coat behind; they never let me go, but dragg'd me up a court to the second house in it, which is about 25 yards from the place where she seiz'd me.</p>
               <p>Q. On which hand-side the court?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. On the left-hand side; they dragg'd me into a lower room, and lock'd the door, and one of them took the key out of the door; two of them fell to beating me in a terrible manner; they struck me over my face with their double fist, as hard as they could strike me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they a light?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. There were a parcel of bricks in the fire place, and a candle was stuck amongst them alighted, by which I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in that room?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I was there pretty near half an hour; the prisoners are two of them, I know them well; I saw them all three very plain. I look'd at their faces, resolv'd, in my own breast, to have satisfaction for the injury I receiv'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell which of the prisoners assaulted you, and what each did?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. Oatley took my common prayer-book and gloves; the fellow pair to these on my hands?</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket did she take them from?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. From out of my left hand coat pocket; when she had her hand in my pocket, I turn'd about and said, let my pocket alone, there is but a trifle, there is only a pair of gloves; she said, d - n you, I don't care, I'll have it. Mary Burn stood on the other side, and had hold of my collar at the same time; she and the other kept fast hold on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Oatley take your things by force?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. She did;

               <p>Baldwyn. I lost 8 d. halfpenny in halfpence, and a 6 d. in silver, out of my right-hand breeches pocket.</p>

               <p>Baldwyn. I was put in great fear.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after that?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. They kept me near half an hour, and beat me in a terrible manner, thinking I had gold about me; they demanded more money of me, and swore and d - d my eyes, if I did not give them all the money I had they would knock my eyes out of my head. Burn pull'd out a knife, and held it at my breast near twenty minutes on and off; whether it was a claps knife, on fix'd in the handle, I know not; at last they let me out. I apply'd to justice Welch for a warrant, and took one up the 10th of this instant, and the other afterwards, and I took them before the justice, and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in Drury-lane at that time of night?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I was going to Wild-street, to one that was very ill, to see if my wife could be of any service to her in sitting up by her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not you in doubt about Oatley.</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. No, I always said I knew her; she took my gloves and prayer-book; I knew her on first seeing her again; her husband is waiter at a public-house or tavern near Charing Cross; I never saw him till the saturday after in the round-house; and when I saw him after that, he had inlisted, and was in soldier's cloths.</p>
               <p>Oatley's Defence.</p>
               <p>When that man took me up first of all, he swore I held a knife against him, and rifled his pocket, with two women with me; this was at justice Cox's; I was in the Gatehouse from the saturday o the monday; a woman that I never saw before told me the three womens names that did this robbery; this very girl said to the other girl that was going off, is that the man you robbed? she said yes; there was another girl that had a child, she left her child, and is gone off too; I never saw the man with my eyes before he swore against me, I innocently said; when he laid hold of me, he said I was one of the women; I said, I was not; but I knew the women, and that was no farther than hearsay.</p>
               <p>Burn's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw the man in my life, and this woman (meaning her fellow prisoner) I never saw her in my days; I own I was going by with one of them, that did the robbery, when they took me.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Summers. I heard a great noise out at my window; I heard they took a snuff box from a man; the girls came to my house afterwards; I ask'd them how they came to do such a thing; they said, they were in liquor, and did not know how they came to do it; these prisoners are not the prisoners that did it.</p>

               <p>Broadburst. I can't say whether she is a woman of the town or not; the few things she bought of me, as chairs and things, she paid me very honestly.</p>

               <p>Ingram. It was that very same day that she was taken at night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Baldwyn. Do you remember your going into this man's house that day?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I don't remember I ever saw this old woman, nam'd Ingram, in my life. I took Oatley in Mr. Thorn's house, on the 10th at night.</p>
               <p>Thorn, When Mr. Baldwyn came to our house, he said, that was one of the persons concerned in the robbery, and she was the person that held the knife to him, and before justice Welsh he swore Burn was the person that held the knife to him.</p>

               <p>Davidson. Please your honour, he has a very bad character, he'll swear and lie, and stand to it; I have reason to believe he will take a false oath; for he swore against me, and I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Davidson. I am wife to the last witness; I know the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think he ought to be believed upon his oath?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Davidson. I do not think he ought; for I have suffered for it.</p>

               <p>Baldwyn. I summon'd him to the court of conscience, and he abus'd me in the street, and I took him before the justice, and the justice talked to him.</p>

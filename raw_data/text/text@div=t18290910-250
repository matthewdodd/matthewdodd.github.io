I said, "Two for a halfpenny;" I gave him two; he gave me a halfpenny, and I put it into the till - he went away; I looked round to see if any thing was gone - I then drew out the till, and missed the money; I ran out with my baby, and called to him to come back - he set off running; I overtook him; I asked him for the money - he said he had no money, and had taken none.</p>

             sworn. - I have been a servant, but I keep gentlemen's houses lately; I was employed to keep Mr. Romily's house, No. 71, Warren-street, Fitzroy-square. I went there on the 1st of June; the family left town that morning at half past three o'clock; I staid till the family returned on the 27th of September, Mr. Romily's servant put the young woman at the bar into the house to take care of four canary birds that were left in the house; she came every morning after they were gone out of town, about seven or eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. I never saw her before; she was a stranger to me; she told me she came to look after Maria's birds;

             had told me she was to come to attend the birds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come every day till the family returned? - A. I had not seen her for about a month before they returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you looked after the birds yourself? -</p>
               <p>A. No; she took them away with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing belonging to you during the time the prisoner was coming to the house? - A. I missed the key out of my box in the kitchen for three weeks before I found it again, then I found it in one of the great drawers up stairs in Mr. Romily's daughter's room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300013"></xptr>Q. Was it in the lock of the drawers, when you found it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that key of your's unlock that drawer? - A. Yes; that one it would; I locked that drawer, and took it out; the prisoner was gone away that night; I went up stairs and found it; the next morning she came, and I said to her, how could you take my key, and open Mr. Romily's drawer, she said, she had never touched it, nor had she ever opened the drawer, she said the drawer was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the drawer was locked or not? - A. They were all locked, I had tried them by the handles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body tried them after the prisoner came to the birds? - A. I always tried them when I swept the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the drawer when you took the key out? - A. Nothing of any consequence. Mrs. Thomas, an aunt of the young ladies, came the next day, and she tried the key, and it would not unlock the other drawers. It opened only that one drawer in the chest of drawers.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether any wearing apparel was put in the chest of drawers in the ladies room? - A. Yes, there was in Miss Romily's room, the drawers were locked, and the keys of all the drawers were locked up in a closet; Mr. Romily's cloaths were in a book-case in his own bed room.

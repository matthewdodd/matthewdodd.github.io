                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was directed to watch the house, No. 1, Deer's-place, Somers-town on the 19th of May—I went there every half hour, and between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, while passing the back premises, I heard a noise in the front—(I had examined the house at half-past eleven o'clock, and it was all safe)—I found the door ajar, the windows open, and part of the brick wall knocked down—I entered the premises, and heard a knocking in front—I went away to call my brother-officer—we returned in five minutes, and met the two prisoners about twenty yards from the premises—I stopped them, and took them into custody, and afterwards Howes made his escape—I left Ryan in my brother constable's custody, and found a crow-bar in his hand—I followed Howes, and saw him throw something away, and after return<lb></lb>ing and searching the place, I found it was the key of the house—he was stopped in my sight by a policeman—on taking the prisoners to the station-house I found a knife on Howes—I went back to the house directly, and found they had got in at the windows at the back—there were marks up the wall—I found this lead within two or three yards of where we first stopped the prisoners—I am quite certain, when last at that place, there was no lead there, nor when I went to call my brother officer—on examin<lb></lb>ation, I found the lead had been cut from the area, and along the passage into the back kitchen—it was pipe—here is part that was left on the premises—it tallied in all respects—it appeared to be cut by a knife.</p>

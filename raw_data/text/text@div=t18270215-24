            . I live on my property, at Bethnalgreen. On the 31st of August I was close to Bishop Bonner's field, and saw the prisoner and five others; I watched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150016"></xptr>them for a quarter of an hour, at the bottom of the north side - they were sitting and tossing on the grass, about three hundred yards from where the prosecutor was robbed; they were all in company together - I am positive the prisoner was one - I had seen him a hundred times before. In about a quarter of an hour they all got up, and came close past me - I watched them, and when opposite some buildings in Bonner's field the whole six changed their dresses; three took their coats and hats off, and gave to the others - three then went round to the left - the other three remained opposite the buildings, and in about two minutes the three returned to the others, and then changed dresses again. The prisoner was one of the six, but I cannot say whether he was one who went round the building; when they came back there was a cry of Stop thief! and I ascertained that Molloy was robbed; I took his address. I was in front of the buildings, and the robbery was committed behind, within fifty yards of where they changed dresses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You will not say that the prisoner went behind the building? A. No.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker. On the 31st of August, about twelve o'clock, I was close by Bonner's field, and saw six persons crossing the field; I saw Molloy turn down the side of Bonner's buildings; the six all followed him; three laid down in the grass, and changed dresses - three then went round to the left, to meet Molloy- the other three got up in a few minutes, and turned to the right hand; I heard a call of Stop thief! and saw the whole six running away together, within a minute or two of my hearing the cry; Molloy was robbed not more than thirty yards from where they changed dresses. The prisoner was one of the six, and one of those who went round the building, meeting Molloy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at Worship-street in December? A. I believe it was in December that the prisoner was there, but no witness being there but Molloy, he was liberated, and taken again in two or three days.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 31st of August I was close by Bonner's fields, and saw Molloy; I saw six persons divide themselves; three stood on one side the buildings, and the other three went on the other side, but by the time I got up the robbery was committed- the three who went behind the buildings came to those in front; I saw them change their dresses both before and after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What were the three doing behind the building? A. I cannot say - I saw them come back in a very few minutes, and the robbery was then done; I was about one hundred yards off at first - they changed their dresses before I got up - they changed them the second time while they were running. I know the prisoner was in custody at Worship-street, and was at liberty for a day or two after that.</p>

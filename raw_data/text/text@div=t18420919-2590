I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-driver, and live in Watney-street, Commercial-road—at Half-past eight o'clock on Saturday evening, the 27th of August, I was in the Poultry—I saw the prisoner following the prosecutrix moving up her dress with his left hand, and his right band in her pocket—I stopped my horse and went over the way, I tapped the lady on her shoulder, and told her she was robbed—the prisoner had then hardly taken his hand out of her pocket, and in taking it out he took out a small portion of the handkerchief out in his hand—there was one or two others with him—I turned immediately and took him by the breast—I said, "That was the man"—he made a violent blow at me—I happened to stoop down a little, and he sent my hat half way across the road—I warned him.</p>

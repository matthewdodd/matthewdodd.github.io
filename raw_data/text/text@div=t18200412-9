               <p>"Old man, will you carry this trunk?" - I am certain he is the man. I borrowed a knot, he helped it on to the knot, and told me to carry it to Whitechapel. He walked before me about twelve yards - I then called to him not to go so fast, as I could not follow him. He went down Lower Thames-street, Pudding-lane, and into Botolph-lane. An officer stopped him, and asked if the trunk belonged to him? he said No - the officer then asked me if he was my master? I said he had employed me to carry the trunk - the officer detained him. I followed them to the Mansion House, and attended on Saturday, when Stringer claimed it.</p>

I did not secure him when I first saw him, because I was carrying some prints.</p>

The prisoner came in under pretence of changing a gold ring for a pair of buckles. I shewed her a couple of papers. She threw her cloak over them, took one pair, and put them in her pocket. She was very difficult in choosing her patterns. I opened another paper or two. She took two pair more; then I asked her if she would buy a pair, and was coming round the counter to stop her before she got out of the shop. She got out, but I stopt her, and brought her back, and sent to a neighbour, who searched her, and found three pair of our buckles upon her. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Aldgate. On Saturday last I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner snatch a coat from off the block inside the door—he ran off—I went after him and he threw the coat down, and while I was picking it up he got a few yards a-head—he was then brought back by the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Messrs. Venables, Brothers woollen drapers, Aldgate High-street. On Thursday evening, 10th June, about half past 10 o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Duke-street with Thompson, a relation of mine—we met with a man, who tripped up Thompson's heels to throw us both on the ground—we turned round to ask why he did so, when a woman, who he said was his wife, began to abuse us, and the prisoner passed between us, and took the watch from my right hand waistcoat pocket—I felt a <hi rend="italic">tug</hi> from the chain round my neck, and saw the watch in his hand—I saw his hand come from my chain with the watch in his hand—there was force in taking it from me—he passed between two other young men, but I did not see what he did with the watch—I caught him within about five yards—I did not recover my watch—it was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I kept hold of the prisoner, and gave him in charge—I had seen the watch about two minutes before it was laid hold of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter. I have got no situation—I left Mr. Venables a fortnight last Saturday—I was not in the same house, but in the employ of the same firm as Whiting—I was with him on this night coming down Aldgate by Duke-street—we were walking together—I had got hold of his arm—a man came by me and tripped me up—I nearly fell to the ground—I turned and asked the man what he meant by tripping me up; he began to swear and curse—Whiting said, "I don't want any disturbance"—the man said, "You live at Mr. Venables'"—he said, "It don't make any odds where I live; I don't like to see my friend tripped up"—as soon as he said these words, a person came up whom he claimed as his wife, and she began to swear and curse, and to use language not fit for a woman—while we were talking the prisoner passed between Whiting and the woman and took his watch—I saw the watch go away out of his pocket; I saw it in the prisoner's hand—I said, "He has got your watch;" and before I could get the word out of my mouth, he said, "He has got my watch"—the prisoner rushed between two young lads, and I caught him within five yards of the place—during the time he ran away he had his hands before him—I did not lose sight of him from the moment I saw the watch taken till I took him—he was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

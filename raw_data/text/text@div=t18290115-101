I was sent there to inquire about a place; I was two hours in the kitchen, and as I walked out of the house I picked up the property - Gidding had asked me to come and dine there on the Sunday, and bring her sister; I thought if the property was inquired after I could tell them I had got it, but as I heard nothing of it I threw it into my box. <rs id="t18290115-101-verdict516" type="verdictDescription">

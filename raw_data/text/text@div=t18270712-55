            . I am a jobbing porter. On the 19th of May, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming up Cheapside with Girton, and saw the prisoners standing at a post at the end of Cheapside; they were strangers to me - I was on the opposite side of the way; another stood at another post; we saw them all join company, and watched them about three parts of the way down Newgate-street; they then met a carrier's cart - they all three turned back with it. I continued to watch them; the cart came down into Cheapide, and stopped a short time at the end of Milk-street - both the prisoners stopped with it; the other walked on the other side of the way; he had crossed some time before; I think I should know him again - they stood close by the cart; the third man stopped opposite to them: the cart then went on to Gracechurch-street - the prisoners followed it very close all the way, on the footpath. The third man still kept on the opposite side of the way, and was in Gracechurch-street with them; the carman left the cart in <placeName id="t18270712-55-crimeloc310">Gracechurch-street</placeName>

I did not see them again till the 9th of June, when they were in custody; I was positive of them both; I had them in sight nearly an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I suppose you had no job that day? A. Yes, I had, but I had two or three hours to spare; I am only a jobbing porter; I live in White Hart-yard, Coleman-street. I was a minute or two looking for Girton, and when I turned back they were gone. I went across the street to look for him. I went to the carman when he came back, but alarmed nobody else - Girton is an officer, and I was walking with him - I have known him some years; I do not often walk out with him.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Ward. On the 19th of May I was with Henley, and saw the two prisoners and another - I had seen the prisoners before, and knew their features - I saw them standing at a post at the top of Cheapside; they moved into Newgate-street all three together; I watched them - the errand-cart was coming up, and they turned back immediately after it; the prisoners were on the left-hand side, and the other on the right; the cart stopped opposite to Bread-street, near Milk-street; the carman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120035"></xptr>went down Bread-street, and returned in a few minutes; the prisoners stood close to the cart, and looked into it - they followed it, on the same side of the way, into Grace-church-street, the third man keeping on the opposite side; there was a hamper behind the cart, and I thought they were after that. The cart stopped nearly opposite Bell-yard - they stopped, and I told Henley to give a sharp eye on them while I went a little further down - I was on the same side as him; some carts and coaches came along, and I lost sight of the cart altogether; I might be a dozen yards from Henley; I saw him half an hour afterwards. I found the prisoners in custody on the 9th of June, and am certain of them - I should know the other man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a ward constable? A. Two or three years - I am a porter by trade; I was going on duty. I have known Henley some years. I saw nobody in the cart.</p>

I received this box from Turner, and put it inside the cart, between two and three o'clock - it was directed to Lewisham; I went down Holborn, along Newgate-street, and into Cheapside - I book at the Bull public-house, in Bread-street, and stopped the cart to go there; I went from there to Gracechurch-street, and into Lime-street, left something there, and returned into Gracechurch-street - I stopped at the corner of a passage leading to the market; I went up to fetch a box from the market, and returned in ten minutes - I received information, and missed the box - it has never been found.

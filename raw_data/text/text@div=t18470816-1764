                  </hi> I am the principal teller in the office of Sir Francis Hastings Doyle, Bart., the Receiver-General of Customs. At the time this occurred, and some time before, the prisoner was an assistant teller in that department—it was his duty to receive monies from merchants and others who have to pay money into the Receiver-General's office at the Custom House—there is a cash-book in which he should enter all such receipts—he had pay<lb></lb>ments to make as well as to receive—it was his duty to enter on the other side of that account the payments he so made, and the account should be balanced every day—his duty on making up his accounts at the end of the day was, to hand over the notes to me—the cash that he took in the course of the day was generally retained in the cash-box till next morning, and was to be delivered up to me the first thing next morning—he handed to me at the end of the day, a memorandum of the whole of the money he had taken, the amount of notes he had got, the amount of payments he had made, and the amount of the money he had retained in the box, all of which I had to enter in my book at the end of each day—it was a memorandum tran<lb></lb>scribed from his book—before he gave me that memorandum, it was his duty to balance his cash-book, and then to transcribe this from it—on the 9th of Jan. last, I acquainted the principals of the office that I had suspicion of him, and they desired him to make up his accounts—that was about half-past eleven in the day—he was then in the Treasury, in which office we all transact our business—on that order being given to him, he continued to take money until eleven o'clock, and did not make up his accounts—he then left the office, and I saw or heard nothing more of him till he was taken into custody on this charge. on Saturday, July 31st—he had a desk in the office where he was employed—it had drawers, of which he had the keys—his desk and drawers were left open, I acquainted the principals that he was gone, and they were examined in my presence—his book was taken possession of, and the money that was found in his drawers—I produce the book—I find entered in it, in his writing, thirty-four receipts, as received on that day—they amount to 2,783<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I find on the other side, there payments, amounting to 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he ought to have had a balance left in his drawer of 2,652<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found notes and cash in his drawer—they were not examined in my presence—the notes handed to me by Mr. France, the Assistant Receiver-General, amounted to 2,310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—the balance was 2,382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficient.</p>

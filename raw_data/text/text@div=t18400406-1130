                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. John Thornett, at the Bull's Head pub<lb></lb>lic-house, in Tottenhan-court-road. The prisoner came there on the night of the 2nd of March, and asked if he could have a lodging for one night—I called my mistress, and he gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his night's lodging—he went up stairs, and had a glass of gin-and-water—he went to bed in the room, No. 11, about twelve o'clock—the next morning I came down at seven, and afterwards saw my boots under a chair in the room, No. 9, which I slept in—a servant saw him go out of his room into mine, and he went out about ten minutes past ten o'clock—I went up about ten minutes after, and my boots were gone—I missed some sheets off the bed where he slept—on the 6th of March the prisoner was brought to our house again—I was called into the parlour, and the boots he had on were mine—I gave him a pair of old boots that he bad left behind—I asked if they were his, and he said they were—I have not seen the sheets since—he had no busi<lb></lb>ness in my room at all—I found his old boots under the bed he had slept in—they were very old, and worth about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—mine were worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were on the same floor, but in a different room.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 10th of February, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners and three others lurking about Stockham's shop, talking together. I saw Earl go into the shop, the rest were about five yards off. Then one of them went up to the door of the shop, and the others went down the street - the shop door was open. I stood on the other side of the way, and saw Earl offer a piece of paper to the last witness, and saw him receive the change. He took up the bread and came out. He went towards Wilderness-row, in a direction that Batten went. I ran into the shop, came out, and saw the prisoners going up the street together. I overtook them in Wilderness-row, and met Read. He secured Batten, and I took Earl. Batten then had the bread. I found 18 s. 10 1/2 d. on Earl.</p>

               <p>EARL's Defence. I was coming down St. John-street, a young man in a flannel jacket put the note into my hand, and asked me to go and get the bread. I asked why he could not get it himself. He said he lived at Mr. Johnson's, a bookseller, No. 10, Wilderness-row - I have been to that shop twenty times. He said he had had some bread in trust for his master, and did not like to go himself. I went in, came out, and put the bread into his lap. We went and got some porter, and before I gave the man the change, I heard the cry of Stop the boy! I stopped and was secured. I believe the man sold the bread to this prisoner. The girl did not put her address on the note till I was brought back.</p>

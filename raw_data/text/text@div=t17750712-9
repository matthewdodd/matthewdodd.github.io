I am certain to the man. I missed a watch from over the mantle piece: I am sure it was there when I went up stairs. The table-cloth was lost out of the same room. I followed him into the yard catched him by the skirt of his coat, and cried Stop thief! he attempted to make his escape over the fence; he fell down, and I fell, and he fell upon me. The rest of the things were all found in a black bag in the room.</p>

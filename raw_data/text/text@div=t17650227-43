The prisoner and Smith sat about half an hour; then they said they would have something to drink; they had a shilling in rum and water; they drank it and sent the shilling and bowl up to me; after that they sat the best part of an hour, and ordered sixpennyworth of rum and water more: I made it and carried it to them; about ten minutes after that Smith had a pennyworth of purl; about eight o'clock Mr. Tupnail came from Mr. Stevens's, the packer, the next door to me, and ordered a pot of purl there: then they insisted upon his drinking with them, so he had a pint of purl; then they all went away together, with the boots and shoes, and every thing they brought with them.</p>

            . On Wednesday morning, the 20th of February, Mr. Tupnail called me up to go to work: we got into Leadenhall-street just about five o'clock: I rang the bell at Mr. Taylor's door; during the time the boy was getting up we went to the Bee-hive, in Leadenhall-market, where we had a pint of hot together; we came back, and at the corner of Lime-street (I had a candle and lanthorn in my hand) a man met me, and said, Halloo, watchman! I said halloo again, I am no watchman: if you want one, there is one yonder: he said he had lost something; he seemed to have things in his pocket. I looked about, and saw a boot in his hand: I said, Where is the other boot? he had a bottle of wine in his hand; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270039"></xptr> gave it me to drink some: I drank, and so did Tupnail, out of the bottle; he said somebody has picked it up, and was going away: turning round, I saw a boot standing by the side of a post: I called to him, and said, here it is; he came and took it, and said that was his; then we drank more of the wine; he came back to the door: as we were standing there, the prisoner came; as soon as the other man saw him, he said, this is my man: they wanted a lodging; I said they could get none at that time of the morning. The first man, which was Smith, said he came from on board a ship. Tupnail took the candle and lanthorn, and we took them to Mr. Williamson's, at the Bee-hive: the prisoner had some cloaths upon his arm; we came back and left them there.</p>

            . I am a constable for Westminster; I had these boots of 'Squire Rouley's Cook, in St. James's Squire. (Producing a pair of Boots.)</p>
               <p>Faulkner. These are my property, which were taken away that night the counting-house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Noaks. The cook says he bought the boots of one Knight, a chair-man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that cook here?</p>
               <p>Noaks. No, he is not.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Knight here?</p>
               <p>Noaks. No; he is bound over to prosecute Smith; he knows nothing against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Last Tuesday se'ennight, about nine o'clock, coming from the city, in order to go to Greenwich, because Smith had an uncle there, lie carried me to Lime-street; he went from me for about three hours: when he came back again, he said, if I would go with him to Greenwich, he would pay my expences. I said, I did not care. Then he ordered me to stay at Lime-street, because he had left a portmanteau there, and he wanted to get clean things to put on: I asked him where they were; he said, at the Thistle and Crown in Billiter-lane: this was about three o'clock: I said, the people would not be up: he desired me to wait there, and said he would be back again in three minutes. I was walking backwards and forwards between Billiter-lane and Lime-street; I found no appearance of his coming; I went down Lime-street, and knocked at the Thistle and Crown door; I came past that gate, and saw a light in the house; I looked to see for Smith: I hollowed out; Smith came out; but I never was within the house: Sir Alexander's gate stood open, but I never was within it. When he came to the end of Billiter-lane, I said, what have you here? he said, I have got my things: he said, Lay hold of that, for I have lost a boot; I took hold of the things, while he looked about for the other boot, and found it; when I saw the other things, I said, Smith, this is not right; you have done something or other: I said, how did you get in? he said he saw the gate open, and he went in and took the things out: I told him I would stay no longer in his company, for he had got them feloniously: I went down Bishopsgate-street, with nothing in my hand, and he went away. Was it the last thing I was to say, I never saw the coat, boots, or shoes, from that time. On the Thursday after, I went to the other end of the town and met with Smith; I asked him what he had done with the things? he said he had sold them to a chairman, or a chairman had sold them for him; I cannot tell which; and that he got 12 s. for them: I never did say to Mr. Faulkner that I was in the house.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alvarons. It is out of humanity I have had the honour to attend upon this honourable court; the prisoner lived servant with me about six months; he had all the care of my plate, and several valuable things in my house: I have a desk in my parlour, in which I keep things of value; the prisoner has more than once brought me the key to that desk when I have left it in, or the like. The reason of my parting with him was, he was given to drink, or I should never have parted with him. I gave him a character to another gentleman; the prisoner lived with him two months, and behaved well.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave your service?</p>
               <p>Alvarons. He left my service three months ago; the other gentleman parted with him for the same reason as I did.</p>

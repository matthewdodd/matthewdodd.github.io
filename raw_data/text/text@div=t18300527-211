            . On the 10th of May I was in the market, filling up a half sieve of gooseberries - I looked up, and saw the prisoner's right hand in Mr. Tomlinson's pocket - he pulled out a very dirty bag; I went to tell Mr. Tomlinson, but my master said, "Come home, I want you;" the prosecutor afterwards came and said he had been robbed - I said I knew the person; the prisoner had got out of the market before the prosecutor said that to my master, but he was taken in the afternoon.</p>

            . I am a headborough. The prosecutor came to me on the 10th of May, and said he had been robbed in Newgate-market; I went to look for the prisoner, by the description he gave, to Battle-bridge, where his uncle lives - I met him in the afternoon going up St. John-street, and charged him with it; he said he had not been in the market all that morning, but when I took him to the station he said he had been at the market, but not till eight o'clock - he had only 4s. 6d. on him, but he had a new suit of black on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all of it - I was out at work that day.</p>
               <p>JURY to ELIJAH WHITMORE. Q. How soon after you saw this did you tell of it? A. Directly he told my master - not above two or three minutes after.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TOMLINSON. I went across the market, and had occasion to pay some money - I then missed my bag; I went back to the stall I had been at, and then round the market - it was a dirty bag; I am in the coal business.</p>

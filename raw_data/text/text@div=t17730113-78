               <p>- Zacherly. Curd was tried for robbing me: Curd and the prisoner both came up to me to the foot path; the tallest man, which was Curd, held his pistol against my head before my face; I looked at the pistol and him all the time; Fox took the money out of my pocket; Fox presented the pistol against my breast, the other to my face; they had each one.</p>
               <p>Q. Fox did not clap two pistols to your breast?</p>
               <p>Zacherly. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Curd was as much concerned in robbing you as Fox?</p>
               <p>Zacherly. Yes, all the same.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this examination reduced into writing?</p>

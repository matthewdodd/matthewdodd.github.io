Yes; having suspicion of the prisoner robbing me, I went to a neighbour's house about a quarter after three in the morning; the prisoner came, he usually rang my bell, and the boy let him in; after he had been in the house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I perceived the prisoner coming out with two bags of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was it. - A. Eighty nine pounds of flour; after he came out a gentleman, who is in court, and I, pursued him, he made a kind of a stop and let one of the bags fall, holding the other under his arm; I then went to him, and asked him what he had got, he made me no answer, I said I suppose you have got my flour; he begged me to let him take it back and put it in the trough where we had taken it from, and if I would forgive him, he would leave the town; I told him I could not think of doing that, he must go along with me.</p>


               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you. - A. Nearly four years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the flour and put it in the bag. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you permitted him to do it, a very honest lad you are. - A. When I first went to Mr. Swann he was robbing his master then, and he said if I told Mr. Swann he would kill me; I saw him bring those bags out of Mr. Swann's house, and Mr. Swann took them from him.</p>

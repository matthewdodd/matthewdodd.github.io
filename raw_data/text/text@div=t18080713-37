I asked him who he bought them of, he said it was of no consequence to me, he would pay me for them if I had done them; I told him he must go along with me, the constable stood there waiting for him; he said that he bought them of a man that came from Coventry the day before.

We had this conversation in his house. Going along he said he bought them of a man that came into his shop, but he did not know where he lived nor his name.</p>

Mrs. Smith asked him if he had a bill of parcels with it, he said he dare say he had; his wife went to a file to see if she could find it; she could not; he said he gave eighteen pounds for them - two pieces of Irish linen in part, and the rest in money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have stated the truth to my attorney, the case is what you have already heard; before the Lord Mayor I stated the same; I bought them of a man that I have bought braces, stiffeners, and ribbons of before; he came in the morning, he told me they came out of Coventry; I looked at these things; I said they were old things; no, he said, they wanted dressing; he said he would deal with me if he could, he would take half goods, and half money; he took two pieces of Irish, and the rest in money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

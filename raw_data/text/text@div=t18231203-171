             and Jenkins, and in a small box were two pairs of ear-drops and rings, four clasps. In the next room I found Groves on the bed with Aldridge and Thompson. Groves denied his name, and denied the robbery. I think he gave the name of Jones. Bibbs gave me a ring off her finger. I took them all to the watch-house, and about eleven o'clock that morning I took Asbury in St. Martin's-lane. He denied the charge. When we got to the Office, I told him the other prisoners were in custody, he then said he did not steal it, but knew something of the robbery.</p>

            . I am an officer, and went with the witnesses. I was the first who entered Groves's room, and asked if he was not known by the name of Sailor? He said his name was Groves. I have a brooch, a clasp, and a pair of ear-drops, given me by Thompson's uncle. I had questioned Aldridge closely what she had done with what was given to her? She at last said she gave them to Thompson.</p>

               <p>GROVES'S Defence. I am guilty, but Asbury was not with me. I gave him the things, but he did not know where I got them.</p>
               <p>ASBURY'S Defence. When I came home on Monday. I went into my brother's room, which is next to mine. I saw Groves, Aldridge, and a young woman there, and the box on the bed. He said it was a box he got from his brother, and asked me to carry it up to the room for him, while he got the key. We both sleep together. I carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030063"></xptr>it up - he opened it, and gave Aldrige a comb. I asked where he got it - he said from his brother, and laughed, and gave me several things, which I gave the young women.</p>

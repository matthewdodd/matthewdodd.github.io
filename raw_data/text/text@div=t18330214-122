            . I live at No. 13 Buckeridge-street. The prisoner lodged with me; on the Sunday morning, about one o'clock, she came to pay me her rent; she had something in her hand, which looked to me like a brooch - I did not examine it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was not a brooch, it was a pin.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140060"></xptr>I had been on the Saturday to take some clean linen to a friend in St. Bartholomew's-hospital, and on returning, I met the prosecutrix in a public-house, opposite Middle-row; she spoke to me, and said she knew the family I lived with - she asked me to show her the way to Leicester-square; I went as far as Drury-lane, and then I wished to go home, but she urged me to go to Leicester-square with her, and said she would give me one of her handkerchiefs to tie my dirty linen in - we then went on, and the gentleman asked her if she was going to Hampstead; she said No, she was going to sleep with me - I said she could not; she then said if I would go with her to St. Giles', she would give me some cap-ribbon - I went with her, and there she got this parcel; we then went to a public-house, when she gave me the cap-ribbon and this other handkerchief - we then went to Leicester-square, and she gave me the umbrella to carry to the public-house; we had some more to drink there - I do not recollect where I parted with her, but I got into some dark passage, and the officer took me; we were both drunk.</p>

               <p>Lockhart Gordon. On the 25th or 26th of October, about eleven at night, I came out of the Bedford-Head coffee-house, <placeName id="t17521206-4-crimeloc16">Covent Garden</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17521206-4-crimeloc16" type="placeName" value="Covent Garden"></interp>

He pointed at another man, saying it was him that picked my pocket and flung the handkerchief under his arm. I saw a parcel of ugly fellows about me: I seized him by the collar, drew my sword, saying I was more than a match for him, took him into the Bedford coffee-house, and sent for the playhouse guards who were not then gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the Bedford coffee-house ?</p>
               <p>Gordon. It was about thirty or forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to discern the prisoner's person?</p>
               <p>Gordon. It was (the lamps being lighted) very light. I took him to justice Fielding's, who was in bed and refused to get up; this gave the prisoner fresh courage, who used me very abusively saying, that he would blow my brains out, or words to the same purport.</p>

               <p>Q. from the prisoner. How near was I to him when he missed the handkerchief ?</p>
               <p>Gordon. If he did not touch my shoulder, he was as near as he could stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Gordon. No, my lord, not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I was going thro' Covent-Garden piazzas, and a young fellow ran away at the same time; there was also a great crowd about the gentleman when the handkerchief was lost.</p>

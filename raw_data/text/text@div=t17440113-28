            . On Wednesday morning last my house was broke open, and robbed of goods to a considerable value. I suspected some houses of ill repute that lie on the backside of my workshop, and I got a search warrant to try if I could find any of my goods: I searched the house of Mrs. Beane who is a person of a very ill character, and when I came to search her room there was a sack which was tied up at the mouth. I untied it, and in it there were several pewter pots wrapped up in rags, I suppose to prevent them from rattling; there was a chest of drawers which had pewter pots in each of the drawers, there were a dozen pots in all, there was one in a child's cradle under the things. I asked her how she came by them, and told her she did not come honestly by them, for I saw by the inscription whose property they were; then I sent to the last Witness, and he came and owned them.

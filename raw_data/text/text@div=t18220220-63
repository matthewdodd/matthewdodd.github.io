               <p>Sir, - My Mamma desires her compliments to you, and desires me to say the silk pleased very much; but the muslin is not fine enough, which she will bring to London next month. She wishes you to send on next Tuesday, by Mr. Bartlett's waggon, from the Keys, in Fleet Market, furniture sufficient for two large four post bedsteads, with yellow lining; as it is for the rooms appropriated for the Judges, who sleep at our house, during their stay on the Circuit - let it be a very good and fashionable pattern. The furniture we had of you a few years since, wearing very well, my Mamma hopes you will let it be good. Send a piece of muslin finer than the last, and four black silk shawls with broad borders, for myself and sisters, not too expensive; as they are to wear over the silk - Mamma will leave the price and pattern to yourself, so as to correspond with our dresses. We visit London next month, with Colonel Bund, and we will call - Sir your obedient servant,</p>

            . I am assistant to John Reeves, pawnbroker, of Snowhill. I have known the prisoner three months. On the 21st of December, he brought some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200041"></xptr>sarsenet for sale; he said he was an agent employed by Mr. Stevens. I think he brought forty-one yards, and think it was in two pieces; we gave him 3 s. 6 d. a yard, and sold it for 3 s. 9 d. On the 24th, we bought seven pieces of chintz cotton furniture, twenty-four yards each, a remnant of eight yards, and seven pieces of calico. I think we gave him 1 s. 8 d. a yard for the furniture, and 10 d. a yard for the calico; the whole amounted to 20 l.; we sold part to Mr. Hedges and part to Mr. Miller. On the 14th of January, he came again; I bought three shawls of him, and a remnant of six yards of cambric; we gave him 9 l. 5 s. for that parcel. I believe we sold two of the shawls - I produce the other and the cambric.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who brought the goods - A. I think you brought some, and a porter the others; they were sent on Stevens's account, the prisoner called in four or five hours for the money, and I paid him. He produced me an invoice - I did not see the name at the top, I saw Watson and Co. on the furniture.</p>
               <p>MR. HOMYER. This shawl and remnant of cambric, are part of the order I packed up; I am certain of the cambric, the shawl is of the same description, but the mark is off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live in the parish of Harmonds<lb></lb>worth. On the 9th and 10th of December, George Batchelor was threshing in my barn—there was some wheat which had been threshed, but remained on the floor with the chaff—on Monday, the 11th, Batchelor called me—I went, and looked at it, and missed some from the bulk—there were footsteps going out at the back of the barn—there were the footsteps of three different men—we traced by the wheat-droppings to within a quarter of a mile of the prisoner's house, and footsteps to with<lb></lb>in forty yards of his house—he lives at Harlington—the way they went, which was across the fields, is about a mile from my barn—I had two offi<lb></lb>cers with me—we went into his house and found some wheat in chaff—there was nearly five bushels in two or three different sacks, and there was nearly a bushel and a half in the prisoner's room—he has two lodgers, and I found nearly three bushels and a half in their rooms—they were all three taken into custody and committed, but the Grand Jury have thrown out</p>

I threshed in the prosecutor's barn—I fastened the barn door on Saturday the 9th, and missed the wheat on Monday morning—when I went to the barn at six o'clock, I found the door had been opened, and missed about eight bushels at the least—I went to the prisoner's house afterwards, and was shown some of the wheat found there—it was master's wheat—I have no doubt of it—it tallied in all respects, in quality, smut, and weeds, with what I had cleaned.</p>

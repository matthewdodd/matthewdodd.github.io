            . I am a servant at this house. I came there only yesterday week; the things were missing before I came; there were but two copper pots in the kitchen; my mistress desired me to carry them up into her room because so many had been stolen. On Wednesday morning I cleaned them, and left them in the kitchen; in about five minutes I returned to the kitchen and missed one of them; I came out directly and the prisoner, Bird, with a pot, was climbing over the table that stands by the back door; there is no passage to the door without getting over the table; he jumped off the table on the outside towards the door; I went directly and got the pot and asked him how he came to have the pot there; he said he never saw it; I went and told my master.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner getting up on the table or was he upon it?</p>
               <p>Duncan. He was on the table with the pot in his hand; he let it down directly on the ground on the side of the table. (The pot produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>It is a common passage, and this gentleman knows many of the things were lost before I came there; I know nothing of the pot; I was not out all the morning till they served the warrant upon me; that passage is a common passage; it is never locked night nor day. I had been to the vault and was coming back; I had not the pot nor do not know how it came there; they keep an irregular house; there are comers and goers all night long.

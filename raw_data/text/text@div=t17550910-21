On the 20th I missed twelve gold rings out of my shew-glass: I went and got a warrant against him on the 25th, suspecting him. I took and brought him to the constable's house; there I charged him with taking these things; he owned he had taken eight rings from me: saying, I am very sorry I have taken eight gold rings from you, and you are the worse man for me by more than them, and offered to make it up by paying 3 s. 6 d. per week. We took him before justice Fielding, and got a search warrant: he told me where six of them were. They were at five different places; one in Newport-street, two in Sidner's alley , one in St. James's-street, one at a pawnbroker's . Some we found, the others did not deny but they might have bought them of him, but if they had, they were sold.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them?</p>
               <p>Callard. They are worth 40 s. to be sure.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor has trusted me in the shop with the drawer when he has gone out of the shop, and it is extraordinary. I should take those rings and they not be missed sooner. I leave it to the jury whether it is probable.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were silver thimbles in the same drawer, and on the nail where he had taken a ring, he had hung up a thimble, so that they were not so easily missed at first sight.</p>

            . On the 29th of August, about eight o'clock I put my little boy to bed, and coming down stairs I heard the water running away in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these things the last time before the pipe and the cock were taken away - A. About half an hour before, they were safe then. I went to the street-door, and from information. I pursued the prisoner and took him, he had the leaden pipe about him and a brass cock; they were behind his great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who helped you to secure him - A. Mr. Humphreys the constable. I let him go and called my husband, he pursued him and then he was taken; it was not quite dark, I am confident the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What clothes had I on - A. A brown coat.</p>
               <p>JOHN TRIGGER. I saw the prisoner come across Drury-lane; I saw him go into Vinegar Yard; there he dropped the pipe. The prosecutor lives in Bennett's-court, it is nearly opposite Vinegar-yard. I saw him through the pipe down, I piched it up, he was half way down Vinegar-yard. He took the pipe from underneath his coat, and threw it down; I am sure it is the same man, I saw him in the court before this happened, I have no doubt at all of his person.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This is the first time I ever was in confinement or had my character called in question. The leaden pipe and brass cock the prosecutor has recovered, nor is there any evidence to prove they had been in my possession. In Bennett's-court there was a hue and cry that the prosecutor had lost his pipe and cock; in Vinegar-yard the property was picked up. I was taken in Russell-court when the prosecutor charged me; I offered to be searched, and went voluntary to Bow-street, where the prosecutor said he could not swear to the person of the prisoner as he had changed his clothes, which is not true, as I had the same clothes on. I live in the same court where my prosecutor lives; I left work at eight o'clock, I went through the the court, I saw the man cross over Drury-lane into Vinegar-yard, where the property was picked up.</p>

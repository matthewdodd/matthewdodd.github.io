                  </hi>. I am a shopman to William Broome, a hosier, in Ox<lb></lb>ford-street. About eight o'clock in the evening, of the 30th of March I saw these socks safe just inside the door—I saw them unusually working up and down—I ran to the door, and saw the prisoner with another lad run off—I followed, and saw the prisoner throw these socks up Marylebone-lane—I followed, and took him—they are called half-hose in the trade—some people call them socks.</p>

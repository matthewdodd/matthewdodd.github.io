               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes; I know them both; On the 7th of July, I was going from Shoe-lane to the Angel-inn, the back of St. Clement's, to take a place on the outside of the coach, to go to see my brother in Wiltshire; as I got near Butcher-row, I was overtaken by Hodges, the man in blue; I was looking up at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140057"></xptr>the buildings at the time, he said, they were very bad in repair; I said more than that, they were very dangerous to pass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you begin the conversation with Hodges, or he with you? - A. He with me; he told me there was an act of Parliament to take the buildings down, and I went to take my place up the Angel yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you imagine you had parted with him? - A. Yes; after I had taken my place, I was going to Vere-street, Clare-market; I turned to my right hand, and overtook him again in Clare-market; I staid at Mr. Gardener's, in Clare-market about ten minutes; when I came out, I went towards Portugal-street, to go to my friends in Shoe-lane. Near Portugal street, I was overtook by Hodges again; before I saw him, I saw a parcel lying at my right-hand door; he clapped a hazle cane he had in his hand, upon the parcel: he was behind me; he picked up the parcel, and tore away the middle part of the paper, and shewed me the red, which appeared like a pocket-book; he put it into his pocket; he took it out again in about a minute 9 time; and opened the end, and doubled it as large as he could to satisfy me there was some thing in it, and told me he had got a finding; I asked him what it was, and he stopped near Mr. Chorley's, the <placeName id="t17960914-11-crimeloc54">sign of the Castle, in Portugal-street</placeName>

Hodges ought to have the pocket-book, and the valuable property in it till four o'clock; Probin then asked what I would leave to have the property left with me till four o'clock; he asked me if I would leave 100l. as a security for my meeting them; I then pulled out some papers I had concealed in my stocking, and took out a bill of 100l. while I was reading the 100l. bill, Hodges took it, and looked at it; it was a Bank bill on demand; Probin took it out of Hodges's hand, turned it over, and examined it; Probin said it was pieced, and would do very well; I left the note in the care of Hodges, and we then departed; Hodges went out with me; I went towards Shoe-lane; he went a yard or two with me, and then we parted; we left Probin in the room; this was about ten o'clock; I have had the possession of the cross and pocket-book ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it after this that you shewed this cross to any body? - A. Not five minutes; I shewed it to a friend of mine; and from what he said I had an alarm, and went to No. 7, Charing-cross, to enquire after

               <p>Q. One would have thought you had not been in London many times? - A. I have not given much proof of it this time.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know either of the prisoners before? - A. Not before the 7th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think it very honest to find a thing of this value and not to advertise it? - A. I proposed to advertise it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not propose to advertise it after you were to have a part of it? - A. I made no claim.</p>
               <p>Q. You were ready to take a part of this dishonest claim? - A. He made me a promise of 10l.</p>
               <p>Q. You meant to take whatever he would give you? - A. I had not been offered any thing at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been offered to you, did you mean to refuse it? - A. That remained with me.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have an answer; upon your oath if it had been offered to you as a part of this dishonest bargain, would you have refused it? - A. I probably should have accepted of something.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you have received 10l.? - A No such sum was expected by me, nor half of it; I should have been very well satisfied if he had given me a guinea, or nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had received a part of it would you have advertised it afterwards? - A. I don't know that I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me, you had never seen either of the prisoners before? - A. Not before the 7th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been as certain of their persons as you are this moment? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in town ever since? - A. No; I came up this morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who have you been talking to? - A. My Friends. I hope.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been talking with the officers of Bow-Street? - A. I have been with the officers, and had some talk with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with the Solicitor? - A. Nothing more than alluded to the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, you should know Hodges, and that he had a green striped great coat? - A. I did not say any thing about a green great-coat; I did not take much notice of his cloaths, I did of his person; I mentioned that he was rather meanly dressed, and had a pair of old boots, with turned down tops.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not describe him as having a striped great coat? - A. I am not positive about that, I might say something about his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the officer sent from Bow-street to the house of Hodges, to find this great-coat, in consequence of your information, and did not find it? - A. I am not capable of saying any thing to his great coat now.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your saying he had a striped great-coat, did not the officer go from Bow-street to search for this great-coat, and did not find it? - A. I cannot take upon me to say, he went in consequence of the information I gave of the man and his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the officer go, in consequence of your describing a great-coat? - A. I don't know that he went in consequence of the great-coat, possibly I might mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. This conversation between you, and Hodges, and Probin, was in the public coffee-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Anybody might have heard the conversation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On finding the pocket-book, Hodges seemed confused, and surprised at the contents of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was never advertised? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the paper first lie in the street? - A. I cannot say I saw it first, he was behind me; I did not see him till he put his stick upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you know his note; how long had you had it in your possession? - A. I took it the day before of Mr. Coxall, the Red-lion, at Red-burn, in Hertfordshire.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you noticed the number? - A. I did, when I delivered it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make a memorandum of the number when you received it? - A. No.; I observed the number when he took it out of my hand, and kept it in my mind till I came to a convenient place to put it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there are other Bank notes of the same number? - A. I don't know; I never had two of the same number; I know it by the number, and being pieced at the back.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140059"></xptr>Q. Has it not happened to you, in the course of your experience, to see Bank notes before that were the worse for wear, or cut in two, to send by the post, and pieced on the back? - A. I have frequently cut them in halves, and sent them by the post.</p>

            , Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a cashier to the Hitchin Bank: I remember paying some notes to Mr. Coxall on the 5th of July; but I have a record by which I can tell better. (Produces the book).</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note; have you any recollection that this is one of the notes you paid to Mr. Coxall on the 5th of July? - A. I can swear to the number of the note in the book.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that is a note you paid to Mr. Coxall on the 5th of July? - A. None upon earth; the No. 7883 on the note, was made by my clerk, and is entered in the book; we call that the debtor-side of our waste-book, every note that comes in, we put a number on the Bank note and enter it in the book for the clerk more easily to find the number.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Here is no record here that it was paid to Mr. Coxall? - A. We don't enter them in the name of the man who brings the check, but of the man to whose account it is placed; it is placed to Mr. Wilshire's account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are cashier to the Bank at Hitchin? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Does any body write in this waste-book besides yourself? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not any body else make an entry of a number in Mr. Wilshire's account in your waste-book? - A. I am very well satisfied no man made that entry but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not any one, who has access to that waste-book, make an entry of the number you have made an entry of, in that book? - A. Nobody has access to the waste-book to make entries but in my presence, the entry made in that book was made by my hand, and the note described, was delivered by me, on Mr. Wilshire's account to Mr. Coxall.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are not always present, might not an entry of the same number be made when you were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140060"></xptr>not present? - A. It appears to me to be utterly impossible; because, it another person were to make an entry in that book, I, as Cashier, being accountable for the Bank paper in my hands, when I came to make up the balance, must know if that note disappeared.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for knowing that another person has not made a like entry of the number when you were not present? - A. It is impossible he should make such an entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you have any other knowledge of having paid this note to Mr. Coxall than by referring to the number? - A. I depend upon the number perfectly being there wrote; I likewise depend upon this, that the gentleman is Mr. Coxall to whom I paid this note.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you recollect that day, personally, making that payment to Mr. Coxall? - A. From the document, and from my personal recollection, I paid that note to him that day.</p>

Bank notes upon him, and five guineas, (producing them); Hodges was taken soon after; I searched him, and found two guineas and an half upon him, and two red morocco pocketbooks, (producing them); one of them contains another cross; in the other pocket-book there was nothing but a direction,

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable of St. Clement's; On Friday morning the 8th of July, I went to Hodges's house and in about a quarter of an hour after, Probin came to the window, the shutters were a little open; he peeped in, and Hodges's wife waved her hand to him, to go away, he did not take that directly; he came and peeped in again, and she waved her hand again; upon that I ran out of the room, and said, Mr. Hodges, I want you; and I seized him, supposing him to be Hodges; he said, his name was not Hodges, and he would be damned if he would go with me; I told him he should, for I would never leave him; he made a bit of a struggle; I told him, if he did not come quietly, I would knock him down, and then he went with me to Bow-street, and I left him in custody, and went back to Hodges's house, and in about twenty minutes. Hodges opened the door and came in; his wife got up, and asked, when did you hear from our friends in Cirencester; my husband will be there next week; I thought he answered the description of Hodges; I left him in custody, and went to Bow-street to fetch Rivett.</p>

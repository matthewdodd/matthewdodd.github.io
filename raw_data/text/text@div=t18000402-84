             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I carry chalk in a barge as far as Egham, sometimes further: I know the prisoner at the bar very well; I came up to town in January, upon some business of my own; I went to the Bowl and Pin public-house, in Thames-street, and asked if I could sleep there; they said, and welcome; the prisoner, Miles, was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who Miles worked for? - A. Yes, for Mr. Sills, at the Hambro' Wharf; he asked me to go to his lodgings, at the Cart and Horse, just by the Bowl and Pin; I went with him, and sat and drank with him till half past ten, and I went up to bed with him, and we talked a considerable time about this cotton; he got up early in the morning to go to work; and he took a large brown paper parcel off the bed, he asked me if I had got any money in my pocket; I said I had but ten-pence; he persuaded me to carry some of it to Marlow, and to send him up fifteen shillings as soon as I could; I took it to Marlow; I asked him how he came by it; he said he came by it very honest, he found it; he told me there was no danger to carry it, for he had cut the names off, so that nobody could swear to it, for my safety, if any body took me; my wife disposed of it, and I disposed of a little of it; he came to my house, at Marlow, with a sack upon his shoulders, about a week afterwards; he put it down under the table, and sat down by it, and said he was very poor; he asked my little girl to go and pawn a bit at the pawnbroker's, Mr. Puddeford's; the girl pawned it, and brought six shillings and three halfpence, and gave him.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your wife at home at this time? - A. Yes; I believe it was pawned in my wife's name; she gave the duplicate to her mother, I believe; I was at home when he received the money, and he took me to the White-hart and gave me some ale; the things in the sack consisted of some dowlas, frocking for smock-frocks, and some children's frocking; he was backwards and forwards with me for a week, that I can swear for, I was in his company almost every day while he was there; he told me if I would bring a punt to the Hambro' Wharf he knew how to get some more out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he got it? - A. Yes; he said he took it out of a small truss, put it in his smock-frock, and brought it home to his lodgings in the dusk of the evening; I was taken up, and had before Mr. Pigeon at the White-horse; I was confined one night by Mr. Pigeon's order; Mr. Pigeon took notice of a frock that my child had on; the stuff it was made with I had from the prisoner at the bar, part of what he gave me in London; I know that my wife disposed of what I brought from from London; my wife put the money into a little wooden dish, and I gave it into his hand, it was silver and halfpence, and a seven shilling-piece; it was kept apart from my own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. He has been tried at Aylesbury himself? - A. Yes; a man at Langley swore against me for some fowls, and I was acquitted, at the sessions, before my Lord Temple.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. The constable will prove it; did not you propose to me to leave the wharf for a night, and you would rob the wharf with a punt? - A. No such thing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am porter to William Wallace and John Harding, linen-drapers, in Cheapside, they have no other partners: I delivered a bale of linens and cottons on the 21st of December, to go to Whitchurch, for one Richardson, by the Basingstoke canal; I I took it to the Hambro' Wharf myself, and delivered it to one of the clerks; I saw it again about three weeks after, Mr. Pigeon shewed it to me, cut open, and some goods taken out; I packed up the goods myself; I missed from the truss a whole piece of printed calico, a piece of Hambro' rough, which is a coarse linen cloth, that they make smock-frocks and bags of; I also missed a piece of Irish linen dyed blue.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece.(The piece that was pawned)? - A. I have no doubt but this is the same; it is the same quality, and firmness, and of the same pattern; it is in every respect like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece. (The piece found at Day's)? - A. I believe this to be a part of the piece that was lost from the truss, it is fine calico; I really do believe it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece of blue Irish? - A. This is of the same quality and pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two pieces. (from Mrs. East's)? - A. I believe these to be the very same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am as innocent of the charge laid to me as an unborn baby.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Vintry Ward. On the 10th of July, between one and two o'clock in the morning, Dawson, the watchman, brought two pieces of copper to me, which he said he found at the door of the sugar-house in <placeName id="t18200918-88-crimeloc497">Maiden-lane</placeName>

I went with him, searched the premises, and saw where the copper had been taken from, the mortar was quite fresh - we found a hammer and wrench just by, which it had been done with. The prisoner was brought down from the upper part of the premises; I took him to the watch-house, and put the tools upon the table. He said the hammer was his, but he did not know the wrench.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Mr. Schroder's sugar-house is in my beat. Between one and two o'clock I saw a light there, and heard a noise like copper moving. I found the door not locked, and two pieces of copper outside on the threshold - the moment I called my partner the light was put out. Baylis went with me, the prisoner was brought down.</p>

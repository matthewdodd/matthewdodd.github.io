Yes, quite sober; she said, who do you do, my dear; and I said, how do you do; says she, will you give me something to warm me; no, I says, I shall not; she asked me several times, and I would not; I then gave her two penny pieces to get her a glass of gin, and then I felt her pulling my money out of my breeches pocket; I did not feel her put in her hand. but I felt her take it out, and I laid hold of her, and directly her hand was out of my pocket, I said, she had got my money; she said, she had not; I then took her into a chandler's shop opposite, and I told the man of the shop,

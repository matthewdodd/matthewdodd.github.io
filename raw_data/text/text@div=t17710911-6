            . I lost the things mentioned in the indictment on the 30th of August. When I went to bed over night I saw every thing was fast; my servant came up in the morning and told me the shop was open. I came down, and from the appearances there I suspected it must be somebody that had secreted themselves in the house. I suspected the prisoner because I had seen her in the garden the day before. I went to search the place where she lived; there I found a bundle containing all the things mentioned in the indictment, except the purse, the money, and the gold stock buckle. The bundle was covered over with fresh earth.</p>

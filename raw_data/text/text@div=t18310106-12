            , I live in Greenhill's-rents. I was with Mr. Castle; I perceived the prisoner, and another younger than him, cross from the hospital towards Hosier-lane- they passed behind us; Mr. Castle felt his coat tail fall, and said he thought they had robbed him; he missed his handkerchief - we pursued, and overtook the prisoner about half-way down Hosier-lane, and charged him with picking the pocket; he denied it - I nearly laid hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060015"></xptr>the other, but he got away; I saw the handkerchief found under the prisoner's shirt, next his skin.</p>

            . I am a constable of the City. The prisoner was brought to the Compter - he strictly denied having the handkerchief; I was going to strip him, as he seemed guilty, and when I got his coat nearly off I saw something under his arm - I took off his shirt, and there was the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing Smithfield, looked up at the hospital to see the time, and as I looked down again, I saw the handkerchief on the ground and picked it up - I saw a boy running down Hosier-lane; this gentleman came, and said I had his handkerchief - I said I had not; he took me to the Compter, and said it was his - he said at the officer that he had no mark on it.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CASTLE. I said I was not positive, but I thought there was a letter on it, and on looking I found it.</p>

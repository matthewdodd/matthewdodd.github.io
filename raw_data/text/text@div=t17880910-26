               <p>On the 17th of August I lost the things in the indictment; my wife had been at prayers on Sunday about half after twelve, and when she came home she put her cloak and bonnet on a chest in the kitchen, and the sheets were in the kitchen close by them; we missed them before nine; the prisoner worked for my wife, on Saturday, the day before she lay at our house, she supped, breakfasted, and dined with us; on Sunday about two o'clock, after dinner I went out; she asked my wife to go out; my wife locked the kitchen when she went out; and when she returned, she sent her down with the key to make a fire; when she thought she had been long enough, she knocked with her shoe; she did not answer, and we went down to see for her; she saw the place opened and missed her cloak and bonnet and sheets, and said she was robbed; and when she went to make the bed she missed the blanket; I advertised the property, and found it and the prisoner; the patrole stopped her with the property; his name is Spiller, he ought to have been here.</p>

               <p>I was in the house when Mr. Macdonald that lives opposite came over; I know the cloak; I went to the Compter to the prisoner on the Wednesday after the things were advertised, and the girl owned the things, and cried, and said she was very sorry she had robbed Mrs. Kirk; I said, why should you do such a thing to a woman that has behaved so well to you.</p>

               <p>Did you promise her any favour, or any thing? - Oh, no, no, no, no.</p>
               <p>Was what she said voluntary and of her own accord? - I asked her how she could go to rob a woman that was such a friend to her; and she said she believed the devil drove her to it, and she cried; I saw the things, she said the patroles had the sheets, and the cloak and bonnet.</p>
               <p>What conversation led her to say that? - I asked her how she came to rob Mrs. Kirk, and she said she believed the devil drove her; I did not mention the sheets or blankets, only the cloak; she had torn it very much when she had it on.</p>
               <p>Did you talk to her about the cloak that the patrole had taken from her? - Yes.</p>

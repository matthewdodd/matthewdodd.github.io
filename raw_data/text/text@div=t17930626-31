            . Yesterday about two o'clock I lost ten pair of womens cotton stockings, value 1 l. 10 s. eighteen pair of childrens cotton stockings, value 18 s. a shirt, value 1 s. a silver salt spoon, value 1 s. 6 d. a silver tea spoon, value 1 s. 6 d. They were taken from the lower part of the house; I rent the parlour, and kitchen, and the room on the second floor; these were taken from the parlour, they were taken away about two or a very little after, I was not at home at the time, I knew it about an hour after they were taken, which was about a quarter past three; I saw my things again part of them at my own house, and part at the watch-house; he dropped some in the passage, and the rest were found on him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked those up in the passage? - My wife. I have got the stockings that were dropped in the passage, and the constable has the rest; I received them of my wife,</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them again? - I do. (Produced and deposed to.) They are new stockings; I deal in them, I know that I bought them by the bills that I can shew for them, and I have my own private mark on them.</p>

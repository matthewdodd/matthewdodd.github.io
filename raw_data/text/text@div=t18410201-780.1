                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 26, Duke-street. On Wednesday, the 20th of January, in the evening, I was going to my employer's in the London-road—I was going up Duke-street, and as I came on the opposite side to No. 3, I saw Edwards and another man come out of Mrs. White's house—Edwards had a bundle—they left the street-door wide open—I saw some others lurking about outside, and fol<lb></lb>lowed them—they were three suspicious characters, as I considered—I saw three standing near the spot, besides the two who came out—they were doing nothing, but standing close on the spot—Edwards and the other walked down Duke-street, and I followed them, leaving the three men where they were standing—Mrs. White is no acquaintance of mine, but I live in the same street—I could see into the house, and could see nobody but the men who came out—I knew they did not live there, as nobody but Mrs. White lives there—about the middle of Duke-street they parted, Edwards walked sharply away, and turned the corner into Webber-row towards Waterloo-road, and at the corner of Waterloo-road I laid hold of his collar, and said, "Come back"—he made a stop, and I thought he seemed to put himself in an attitude of defence—I put my hand into my pocket, and said, "If you play any tricks with me, I will shoot you on the spot"—I had nothing to shoot him with—he said nothing, but walked quietly back with me to Mrs. White's—the bundle turned out to be a clock—he had it with him—I sent for Mrs. White, who came—I asked if she had lost any thing—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184102010162"></xptr>
               <p>looked about, and said, "Who has been pulling my things about?"—Isaid, "Fetch a policeman,"upon which Langston and several others came to the door—I said to Mrs. White, "Shut the door, for there is some of the party"—I still held Edwards—the people at the door directly rushed in, and Langston struck me on the side of the head—it went right through my hat, and cut the lining and all—I could not see what he struck me with, but I am positive it was not with his fist—the moment he struck me, he said with an oath, "You b—, let go," and laid hold of Edwards and <hi rend="italic">lugged</hi> us both out together into the street—he laid hold of Edwards, and I was drawn out with him—when we got into the street, I was thrown down and kicked in the body, by some person—I still kept hold of my prisoner, and called "Murder," "Police"—Edwards was down as well as myself—the policeman, No. 36, came to my assistance, and I gave him in charge—he was taken to the station—another policeman came to my assist<lb></lb>ance and secured Langston—I left the bundle in the house—I took it from Edwards when I brought him to the house—I saw it was a clock when I took him in Waterloo-road, it was not wrapped in any thing—my head bled for about an hour and a half from the blow—the policeman took me to a surgeon to have it dressed—the surgeon is not here—there was a great deal of blood—I have never been able to do any employment since—Ihave kept my bed for above a week—Edwards did not strike me at all—Ihave nothing to say about Hopkins—he was in the crowd at the door—Idid not see him do any thing.</p>

I live at No. 3, Duke-street—I was fetched home on the night in question—when I got there Mr. Wood stood there with the clock in his hand, and with Edwards in his other hand—it is my clock—I had seen it safe a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before, banging on a nail opposite the window—I was at home then, and went out to a stand which I have with fruit—I left all right then—I could not swear whether the door was fastened or not—I know I did not leave it quite open, but very likely not quite fastened—I think it was ajar—Edwards is a stranger to me, and so are all the prisoners—when I got home Wood said, "Send for a policeman;"I said, "Let me have my clock, and don't send for a policeman"—he said, "I insist on it, you shall not be robbed, I will have a policeman"—then a person rushed in and struck something over his head—I do not know who it was, I was so frightened—I heard the blow struck, but did not know what it was with—it could not have been a fist, for he was too far off—I rushed out to call a policeman, and fell down in the kennel—I got up, fell again, and Mr. Baker, of the Oxford Arms, hearing the alarm, came out and caught one of the young men.</p>

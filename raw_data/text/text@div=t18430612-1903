                  </hi>. I live in Dudley-street, Paddington. About twelve o'clock at night of the 3rd of June I was in the Harrow-road, leaning against the pilings, dozing, as I was tired—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a few halfpence in my pocket—the prisoner came up and stood by me—I took no notice of him—he put his hand into my pocket, and I felt it coming out—a person on the opposite side told me if I had any money in my pocket that person had taken it—I felt, and missed my money—the prisoner was just leaving me—I followed him, and called out "Police, take this man in charge; that is the man who robbed at, and he should not have robbed me, a poor hard working man"—he said, "I did not take it, another man gave it me"—I did not see any other man.</p>

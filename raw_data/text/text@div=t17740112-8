I was desired by the porter to go into the shop; when I came forward the porter said to him, You have stole some tea; he caught his pocket, and said here it is, and I saw it was loose in his pocket; the prisoner immediately took it out of his pocket and laid it upon the compter; my servant weighed it, and said it was fourteen ounces and a half. The porter said it was taken out of such a chest; it agreed with that tea.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Anstie. He said it was his own property; I believe I asked him then why he took it out on the compter, or wanted to go away after it was taken out of his pocket; for I had kept the door; he asked me if I would detain him upon these circumstances; I told him my servant was gone for a constable, and I would certainly detain him till such time as he returned, to clear up the affair. He had heard me give the orders to fetch an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of tea did he use generally to buy?</p>
               <p>Anstie. He used to buy a pound, or two, or three, and then carry it about to <rs id="t17740112-8-deflabel46" type="occupation">sell as smuggled tea</rs>

               <p>Q. You have known him some time?</p>
               <p>Anstie. I told you three weeks I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. He used to buy it and sell it as smuggled tea?</p>
               <p>Anstie. He has often told us so; and that he sold it for a shilling or eighteen-pence a pound more than he gave us.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he told you as soon as you charged him, that it was his own property?</p>
               <p>Anstie. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. He pulled it out at once and shewed it to you?</p>
               <p>Anstie. Yes, and was willing to leave it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to go?</p>
               <p>Anstie. Not by force, only by asking the question whether he might.</p>

            . I am porter to Mess. Anstie and Worstead. The prisoner walked backwards and forwards in the shop; I saw him stop at the chest and take a handful of tea out; the chest stood upon another chest about the middle of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of tea was it?</p>
               <p>Grover. Green tea. I saw him take several handfulls out of that chest that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120007"></xptr>Q. How long was the second time after the first?</p>
               <p>Grover. About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop was you in?</p>
               <p>Grover. Putting up some currants in a bag at the end of the compter, between two and three yards from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not prevent it after you saw him once?</p>
               <p>Grover. I was willing to be certain. He put his hand open into the chest, and took it out full, and dropped some putting it into his pocket. I went into the compting house, and told my master that he had taken some tea out of such a chest; he took it out of his pocket and threw it out, and said it was not my master's; I said it was my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. It is common I believe when people buy tea to smell it?</p>
               <p>Grover. Yes, they may smell to it, and put it into the chest again. I had suspected him before, which induced me to watch him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On Saturday I went into their shop to buy some tea as usual. I bought a lump of sugar that came to 13 s. 1 d. on Saturday evening, two pound of Hyson tea at 9 s. 9 d. a pound, and a pound and a half of common tea at 5 s. 1 d. I happened to be short for a little more, and on Monday Miss Crawford desired I would change a pound of tea for her; accordingly I took her tea and put it from the cannister loose into my pocket. As I was going up Lombard-street I met Mrs. Jones, a custom-house officer's wife, that used to be a well-wisher of mine; I asked her if she wanted half a pound of tea against Christmas; she said she would; I gave her a little of it, perhaps an ounce or thereabouts; I desired her to stop while I went into Mr. Anstie's shop to buy some tea as usual; she would not stay; I said I would call in a day or two and make it up half a pound. I went into the shop and asked the shopman for some sugar; the man weighed and did it up for me, and put it into the window till the Monday, then I said I would call and pay for it. I asked him for some green tea; I did go to the chest and took a little tea out in my left hand, and at the same time I took some tea out of my own pocket with my right hand, and smelled to it; I returned my tea into my own pocket, and the other tea into the chest again; then the porter asked me if I had any tea; I said I had; he said it is in your pocket; I said you may take it, but claimed it to be mine; Mr. Anstie stopped me, and the constable was charged with me.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Crawford. On the 13th of December I exchanged about fourteen or fifteen ounces of tea with the prisoner; my tea was in a cannister; he emptied the cannister and put the tea loose into his pocket. I have known him three months; he has bore a good character.</p>
               <p>- Jones. I have dealt with the prisoner several times: I met him in Lombard-street between five and six o'clock; he asked me if I wanted any tea against Christmas, and gave me some out of his pocket loose; he said perhaps that is not good enough for you, but if you will stay a little while, I am going into this shop to get three pounds of tea as usual, and you will have some better; I could not stay; I went away. I have known him two years; he always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>- Sharpe. I am a taylor; he lodged with me three or four months; he always behaved well.</p>

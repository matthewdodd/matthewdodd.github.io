            . I was sitting on Waterloo-bridge, and saw the prosecutor coming up to the pay place; the prisoner was behind him - the moment he got to the gate the prisoner took up his pocket, and took something out; I could not see what it was - I at first thought he was his son, and that he was going to take the halfpence out of his pocket that he should not have money to pay the toll- I thought it was a joke; I then heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner run; the box was taken out of the cart, and delivered to the prosecutor.</p>

On the 14th of October, I was going up High Holborn, opposite St. Giles's church, I met the officer with the prisoner - He asked me if I had lost my handkerchief. I immediately missed it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. On the 14th of October, I was in Holborn; they were burning the gas in the street. I saw the prisoner very active in attempting people's pockets; I watched him for a few minutes, and then lost him. I went towards St. Giles's church, and was returning back when I saw the prisoner following the prosecutor in High Holborn, very close; I crossed over, and watched him about an hundred yards; two more boys turned round and looked at the prosecutor, and was going to follow him-some conversation passed between them and the prisoner; they went away, and let the prisoner go on - He put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket and took the handkerchief out; he ran away, and passed the prosecutor about an hundred yards - I laid hold of him, and asked him what he had done with the handkerchief? he said he did not know what I wanted - He had got none. I saw his left hand come out of his breeches - I put my hand down there and took out the handkerchief - I held him till the prosecutor came up and claimed it.</p>

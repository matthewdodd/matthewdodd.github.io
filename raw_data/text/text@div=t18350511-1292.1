On the afternoon of the 8th of May, I was in Chancery-lane, about half-past four o'clock—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soners together—I saw Goody lay hold of agentleman's pocket—they turned towards the Strand—Goody then put his hand into another gentleman's pocket, but I could not get across without their seeing me—they got through Temple-bar into the Strand—a young gentleman passed—Clarke passed him, put his hand up about the height of his throat, and Goody immediately drew a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket—the gentle<lb></lb>man put his name down in my book as Porteous, or something like that—I have never ascertained correctly his Christian or surname—when Goody drew the handkerchief, Clarke received it from him, and crossed the road—I crossed the road—the gentleman followed Goody up a court, and I fol<lb></lb>lowed him as well; when I got up the court, I lost Goody—I afterwards secured them both, I searched them, and found five handkerchiefs in Goody's hat, and one in his breast, which was the one I had seen taken from the gentleman—they had been sitting at a door in Shire-lane together.</p>

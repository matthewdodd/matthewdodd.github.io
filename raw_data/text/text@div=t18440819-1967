                  </hi>. In Dec. last I lived in Church-street, Bethnal-green, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; it was my dwelling-house. Between half-past five and six o'clock, in the evening of the 26th of Dec., I left my home perfectly secure, to go to my father's, at Stepney—I locked the door—the window was down, and the shutters too—I returned about half-past eleven, and found two cane-bottom chairs, a pair of sheets, and a blanket, and the other things stated, taken away—the prisoner is a chair-caner—I knew him—he came the next morning, and sympathised with me, and said he was very sorry to hear of it—I heard no more till the 16th of June, when a woman, who I believe to be his wife, came and gave me information—I then gave him into custody for the robbery—he said he knew nothing about it—I went with the officer and the prisoner to Leonard-street, where they told me he lived, and found my property there—he did not say anything.</p>

             (City Policeman No. 71). On Friday, the 16th of November, I met Eveson on Holborn-hill with this bundle - I asked what he had got there; he said he would not tell me, and dared me to stop him in the street, for he was going on business - it was twelve o'clock in the day; I said I had some suspicion that the bundle was stolen, and he must go to the watch-house - he went a little way, then said he would not go, but I made him go; on getting there, before I opened the bundle, I asked him what was in it - he said shawls; I asked how many: he said he believed there were ten - I asked where he got them from; he said he brought them from a person named Hawkins, at No. 39, London-wall - I asked if they belonged to Hawkins; he said No - I asked if they belonged to himself; he said No - I asked where he was going to take them: he said no where - I asked if he hawked them about; he said No - I said, "Whose are they then?" he waited a few minutes, then said they were a person's named Harris, but he did not know the young man, nor his Christain name, nor where he was to be found; I asked what he was himself - he said he was a plumber and glazier out of employ; I then gave him into custody of a brother officer - I went to No. 39, London-wall, and saw Mrs. Hawkins, I went to the first floor room, and there found two small bits of paper, which I produce; I have kept them ever since - I brought the shawls to the prosecutor, and marked them before I parted with them at all; these are the same shawls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. He first mentioned Hawkins? A. Yes; he afterwards said he did not have them from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police officer. On the 30th of May I went to Fleur-de-lis-court, Peter's-lane, Cow-cross, about two o'clock in the afternoon, with Duke, Hall, and Palmer—I went to the door and found it fast—I had a crow bar with me—I put it to the door and forced it open, and went into the room—the with me—I put it to the door and forced it open, to lay hold of me, to prevent my going in—the male prisoner was sitting in front of the fire on a small box—he rose up, threw something down on the ground, and tried to break it with his feet; he had it in his hand when I entered the room, and with his left hand he threw something into the fire—Duke and I a strong scuffle with him for some time, he being a powerful man—I picked up, in front of the fire-place, these pieces of mould, in a broken state; near to where the pieces of mould were, I picked up one six<lb></lb>pence</p>

               <p>with the get on it; it was quite hot, I could hardly hold it; it is dated 1824—I asked Duke to feel it, which he did—on the box I found four gets, and on the floor near the box, I found six counterfeit sixpences, and two of them having the gets on—one is dated 1817, and the other, 1834—on the right hand hob I picked up one counterfeit sixpence—as soon as Hall entered the room, the male prisoner said, "Hall, O my God, you had not enough for us last time, you will find enough how—I had rather you would take a pistol and blow my brains out"—after they were taken away, Hall and I went back to the house, (we had fastened the door,) and under the stairs we found a saucepan, containing powdered plaster-of-Paris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I accompanied the other officers—I entered the room with them, and met the female prisoner against the door, she immediately called out, "Oh Christ, what do you want here?"—I pushed her into the room, and observed the man rising from the box—I saw him throw something away, and stamping something under his feet, what he threw towards the fire-place seemed to be money—we had a severe struggle before we could secure him—the other officers came to my assist<lb></lb>ance—I searched the fire-place, and on the left hand bob I found four counter<lb></lb>feit sixpences in an unfinished state; two dated 1817 and two 1834; and under the grate I found another—there was a fire in the grate, and an earthen pipkin on it with tobacco pipe in it—there was white metal in the pipkin, and a quantity of dross; the metal was in a fluid state, and the pipkin in a slanting position—I took off the dress—and in the lower part of it observed another counterfeit sixpence, but that got into the metal and melted sway—on the box I found a pair of scissors and a file with white metal in it—I searched Smith, and found part of a metal spoon in his pock, which I gave to Hall; also three sixpences and a shilling—the male prisoner's hands were very dirty indeed, and smelt very strongly of metal—the female prisoner said, she was very glad it was found out, for they had been working in dread and fear all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Silvanus Partridge. Lodonny was in our employment—he came in Feb. 1842, and left at the end of the year 1843—I know the mouslin-de-laine now produced—we had such, and have missed such—I cannot say that we have missed this—I gave directions to the officer in November last to watch Lodonny.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 224.) I was employed in Nov. to watch Lodonny—I saw Henry Anscomb meet Lodonny on several occasions in the evening, between six and seven o'clock, and, on the 23rd of Nov., Lodonny went into Williams's coffee-shop, opposite the Post-office—Henry Anscomb was there—they sat some time—some money passed from Henry Anscomb to Lodonny, but how much I cannot say—I went to Henry Ans<lb></lb>comb, and took him—no promise or threat was held out to him—we asked him if he knew James Lodonny, in the employ of Partridge and Price—he said, "Yes," and he was taken there—he stated he had been in the habit of receiving lengths from Lodonny, for which he paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., sometimes 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I searched Mrs. Anscomb's house, and found the property which I produced on the last indictment—this other property was found at different houses of persons who had bought them—I got this one from Mrs. Johnson—I told Mrs. Anscomb that I came to take her into custody, and asked whether she had bought any dresses—she said, "Yes, the dress my</p>

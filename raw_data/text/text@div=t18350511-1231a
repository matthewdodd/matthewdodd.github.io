I was in the service of Mr. Lilley on the 25th of February—the prisoner was his shopman—early that morning, as we were getting up, he asked me to lend him my box; I brought it down stairs, and when I opened the shop, he said, "I wish you would pack these things for me; "and he brought me four bars of soap, the ba<lb></lb>con, and the other things, mentioned in this indictment; he told me they were for himself, and I packed them in my box, as he desired me—he then told me to carry them to Mr. Enever's, a gardener, who lives about a quarter of a mile down the lane—I asked him whether they were set down—he told me they were—I took them, and left them as he desired me, at Mr. Enever's.</p>

Q.</hi> You would not venture to swear that any of these articles belong to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I would to the soap—I have sugar here which corresponds with what we found at the lodgings—I can swear to the soap by the make; it is yellow—I had not seen any of the persons I saw at the lodgings before, to my knowledge—I have seen them since, when I was endeavouring to apprehend the prisoner with the officer—there are a great many complexions of soap—this was in a box wrapped in blue paper, and some of the paper adhered to the soap—another tradesman might have put his soap in blue paper, but it should have been a very rare thing that it should be the same coloured paper—the alkali would take the colour out, and put a colour in.</p>

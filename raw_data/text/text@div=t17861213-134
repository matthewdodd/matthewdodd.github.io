               <p>Was that before or after you heard the cry of murder? - No, at the same time; when I heard the cry of murder, I went and stood at the corner, and I heard somebody say, if he did not go about his business they would cut his bloody head off; I saw Osborne there, and the two prisoners, nobody else; I saw them strike him after he had cried out murder.</p>
               <p>Did not the people of the house hear the cry of murder? - Yes, they must hear it, but they would not open the door; they did not know it was this man; I saw the two men go towards Bell-wharf.</p>
               <p>Was the prosecutor in liquor at the public house? - No more than I am now; he was there about half an hour.</p>

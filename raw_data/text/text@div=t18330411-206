In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's house in a court in Hackney-road, between two and three o'clock last Friday; I asked him if any property had been brought to his room - he said No; I said "Perhaps you do not understand what property it is - it is some silk handkerchiefs;" he said "There was no silk brought here;" I saw a hat on the table; I asked him if it was his - he said Yes; there was an old handkerchief over it, I took it off; and found this piece of handkerchiefs in it; I took him to the station, and then I and my brother officer went back to the house, and found this guinea note. this duplicate, and this bottle - this skeleton-key was found on his person.</p>

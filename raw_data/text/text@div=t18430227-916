On Friday, the 3rd of Feb., I went to dinner at a little past one o'clock, which is the time the men leave the warehouse for dinner—I then left eighteen sacks of canary-seed safe—I returned at a quarter past two—I directly saw some of the canary-seed was gone, I missed twelve sacks of it, and found twelve empty sacks there—the shoot goes out into Trigg-lane, and I found some marks of the seed in Trigg-lane, under the bottom of the shoot, where a small quantity of the seed had been spilt, and laid on the stones—there is a crane attached to the premises—a person could climb up that crane, and get in or out of the warehouse, and get to the loop-hole very easily—the loop-hole is large enough for a man to get in—I know Castle—he had no business at my masters that day, and had no right to be near this hopper—he had worked at Mr. Rathbone's, who is the proprietor of the wharf, but not at my master's.</p>

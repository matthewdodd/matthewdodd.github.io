            . I am a horse-dealer, and live at Burnwell, near Cambridge. On the 2d of September I was in London, and went to Smithfield the night before the fair, with a Mr. Warberton and Captain O'Conner; we we went into a public-house at the corner of Cow-lane between three and four o'clock on the morning of the 3d of September - O'Connor is gone to France. When we went into the house Dillon was standing up before the counter in the taproom; I saw Eagleton sitting in the same room behind her. I had 203 l. 1 s. in notes in a canvass purse in my left hand breeches-pocket. We staid in the house about ten or fifteen minutes, and all three came out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to your going out had Dillon and you any conversation - A. She asked me for something to drink; I observed by her brogue that she was Irish, and referred her to Captain O'Connor, as her countryman - he has but one arm. He treated her - I was perfectly sober. We all three came out together, left Dillon in the house, and had got about thirty yards down Cow-lane, towards Fleet-market - I was outside of the three, about thirty yards from the door. Dillon came up, put her hand on me, and asked me to go with her? in the manner a woman of the town would.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been walking that thirty yards - As fast as we could, we did not stop; I refused to go, but she windled about me, and I stepped into a court on the right hand side of the lane. I talked to her; she returned with me, and walked down Cow-lane to Holborn Bridge with me. I there met a person whom I knew, and as soon as I stopped to speak to him she left, without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120043"></xptr>speaking, and I saw no more of her. Before I got to the White Horse, public-house, Fetter-lane, I discovered that all my notes and bag were gone. I did not see her afterwards until she was in the watch-house on the 15th or 16th of the same month; the notes were traced to Messrs. Jones and Loyd's. 200 l. was of Sir

            . I was examined in October on Dillon's trial - I lived at No. 4, Pitt's-place, with her. On the night of the 2d of September I was at the top of Cow-lane with her in a public-house; one door opens into Cow-lane, and the other into Smithfield. We were there a good bit before Mr. Browning came in with Mr. Warberton and a gentleman with one arm. They did not stay many minutes before Dillon asked Browning for something to drink; he refused, and referred her to her countryman, the gentleman with one arm. Browning and his two friends left the house, she went out directly after them, and I followed her directly - she was talking to them; then Mr. Browning and she went down the first turning - she told me to stop there until they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the defendant there - A. No; I never saw him till I saw him at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he had not joined her company at that time - A. He had not. I was with her in her house all day, and remained with her until nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time she came out of the turning, down to nine o'clock in the morning, was that man ever near you, or in sight - A. Never, that I am quite sure of. I did not leave her a single moment till nine o'clock in the morning. When Mr. Browning and she came out of the court they went on to the bottom, towards Fleet-market together. A gentleman began to talk to him, and she came back to me, shewed me the purse, said she had picked his pocket of a bag, and told me to run, for we should both be hung if we were caught - the bag had a string to it. We ran through a number of courts and places till past six o'clock, then went into Frith's, and got something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what was in the bag - A. She threw the bag away in Shoe-lane, and kept the notes; it was a large roll of notes. She paid Mr. Frith 9 s. or 10 s. which she owed him, with a Cambridge 1 l. note. She shewed me a Newmarket guinea note. I went to another public-house with her, and never quitted her a moment till nine o'clock. The prisoner was never in her company.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant - he stated that he could not ask a verdict of acquittal at their hands, but the best thing he could do would be to apply to the mercy of the Court, as he was informed the defendant had been made the dupe of a man named Duggan, whom Eagleton had said, on her cross-examination, she had seen with Dillon. He would deliver in a statement, written by the defendant himself, and leave him to the mercy of the Court - (read).</p>
               <p>"My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I beg leave to state that my father has carried on an extensive business in the town of Derby, for upwards of forty years, as malt-ster, miller, and grocer, and in his service I continued till he unfortunately became a bankrupt, by becoming security for a friend, and I was consequently obliged to leave Derby in pursuit of a situation. I came up to London, took lodgings at Mr. Corderoy's, in the Strand, and was there for months, until the little money I had was spent, and I was in debt upwards of 5 l. for my lodgings. My landlord became very importunate for his rent, and told me I must either pay or leave, and detained my clothes for his demand. I had now been in London nine months, without being able to get a situation, having been necessitated to pledge my watch, to draw on my existence at one meal per day, and was in great distress. One morning, as I was taking breakfast at a coffee-shop, I became acquainted with one Alder, and making known my situation to him, he offered me a lodging at his house; but humble indeed, as it was, a bed of straw, even this was preferable to the treatment of my own lodging, and which I thankfully accepted. I had been here but a short time before I became a dupe to my landlord and his friends, two of which, viz. Connell and Connor, came to his house in Castle-court, Strand. One day in September he stated that a woman, a tenant of Duggans's, was accused of a robbery of which she was innocent, and that he was afraid she would be found guilty, owing to a gentleman (Mr.

Connel said if Petlay had been in town he could have proved an alibi very clearly, and that it would be a very grievous thing for the woman to be convicted innocently. In farther conversation, they said this Mr.

Soon after, they invited myself, and Alder my landlord, to drink with them at their friend's house (Mr. Roach) who keeps the Black Horse, public-house, in Wild-street. We met them several times; the conversation always turned on this woman - they said she was innocent, and that there would not be the least harm in any one personating the said Mr. Petlay, which would be the only means of saving her from being transported. They all agreed that I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120044"></xptr>the only person to do it, as I was so very like Mr. Petlay, and that they, Duggan and Connell, were to come forward, and substantiate what I had stated, but they took care not to appear. All the parties were entire strangers to me before the present transaction. Being totally unacquainted with the nature of Courts of Law, and its being a crime of such magnitude, and from what they said, believing the woman to be innocent, I agreed to personate Mr.

I am now very conscious of the crime I have committed, for which I have already suffered three months imprisonment in a dreary prison.

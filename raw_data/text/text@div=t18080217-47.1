             coming up to you. - A. Yes, near seven o'clock in the evening. In consequence of what she said I went out with two young men who were in my tap room; I went through the passage of the next door into the Green Man yard. At the time I was standing in the yard with the two young men, we consulted which would be the best way to secure the men we supposed to be in the house stealing of the lead. While I was consulting with them, two men rushed out of the door of the Green Man; we instantly pursued them, they ran towards Whitechapel, and jumped over some high paling into a field; I pursued them, and took the prisoner in the middle of a field; the other got off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him all the while you were pursuing him. - A. Yes, only momentarily; we passed no other person. I am sure the prisoner is one of them that came out of the house. I took hold of the prisoner and brought him to my house; I delivered him to the watchman; he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a police constable belonging to Worship street. On hearing there had been some lead stolen from the Green Man, I and Ray, my brother officer, went to the Salmon and Ball, it was near eight o'clock in the evening; we went to the watchhouse and looked at the prisoner, and then we proceeded to the Green Man. We went up to the second floor, there is a large passage that leads out to the balcony; in this passage we found the lead cut in pieces and rolled up; there is a sack full of it, above a hundred weight, I dare say. We took the lead to the balcony, Ray and I matched it to the balcony, it completely fitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it must be taken from that place. - A I am confident of it; it was fresh cut from the part that was left behind. I have no doubt but it come from that place.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it. - A. It was valued at ten shillings before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not know any thing about it at all; I enlisted for a soldier at the Star and Garter, Whitechapel; I was very tipsy, I did not know what I was doing; they have said the lead was cut; they searched my pockets; they did not find any knife about me.</p>

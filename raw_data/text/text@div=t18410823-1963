                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Alexander Stow, who keeps a cigar shop in Barbican. About a quarter before three o'clock in the after-noon of the 24th of July, the prisoner, with two others, came into the shop—they purchased one pennyworth of tobacco—there was a contention which should make use of it—I turned my back, and the prisoner lifted up the lid of a box, took some cigars out, and put them into his pocket—I turned, and asked him to take them from his pocket, which he did, and said, did I mean to say they belonged to me?—I said, yes, I did, as I saw him take them—he said, "I know the lady will forgive me, as I took them through dis-tress"—I called ray husband, who was in the parlour—he came out and took hold of him—he sent for a policeman—the other two had left previous to the prisoner's taking the cigars.</p>

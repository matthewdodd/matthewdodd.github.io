                  </hi> On Friday evening, the 27th of May, I was in the City-road, in plain clothes, and saw the two prisoners at Mrs. Budd's shop-window—I stood on the other side of the way, when I first saw them, for a little while, and then I crossed over to look at the window, and saw it was cracked—I went over to the other side of the way again, and told my brother officer something—we waited, and presently saw the pri<lb></lb>soners carrying pieces of glass away—they put it down in the kennel, about a dozen yards on—I observed Wright doing that repeatedly—I can<lb></lb>not swear to Davis—they did it several times—I watched them for about twenty minutes—I saw Wright take a bundle out of the window, and hand it over to Davis, and they walked away, they met some one, tuned back to the window again, and stood at the window a little time, fingering about the place where the hole was—another one came up, and stood just by their side, and by the movements of their hands I thought I could see something passing—I saw the third young man put something into his pocket—then they separated for a few minutes, and came on the tame side of the way as I was, and went back over to the same place—we then went over and took them—I have the pieces of the glass here which I picked up.</p>

I was with Davis, and saw the two prisoners—I cannot say that I saw Wright take the cigars out of the hole, but I saw his hand in the attitude of taking something out—I could not see the cigars—I saw them walk away, and meet with the third one—they came back again—the third one came up to the window—they then went away again—the two prisoners crossed to the opposite side of the way, where I was standing, and then directly went across to the window again—we crossed, and I took Davis—at the time the two prisoners were standing together, after they had been at the window, I saw Davis take this apron from his pocket, and put it on, and he went directly back to the window again.</p>

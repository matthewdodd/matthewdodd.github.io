I met the prisoner running, and stopped him; he used a violent oath, and put himself in a fighting attitude, and made a blow at me; I struck him again; he ran off; I pursued with others, and caught him in a court - he got from me again; I still pursued, and secured him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in Soho-square, and saw the prisoner and two others coming from Charles-street - the prisoner left the other two, and went into the road; I followed him till we met the prosecutor; the prisoner went up to him on the side on which the bottle was on his shoulder; he snatched at his watch, and ran off immediately; Coleberd called Stop thief! I pursued, and lost sight of him, as he turned into Sutton-street; I came up, and took him from Bean; I knew him before.</p>

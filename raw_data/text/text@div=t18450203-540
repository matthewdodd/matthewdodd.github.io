                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Stratford, in the parish of West-Ham. On the 5th of Jan. I went to church, at ten minutes after six o'clock in the evening, with my wife, leaving nobody in my house—the door was double-locked—my wife was called out of church—I went home myself at five minutes after eight, and found two policemen and my wife in the house—I missed two waistcoats, a pair of trowsers, and a silk dress that evening, and on Tuesday, two shawls—the value of the whole is about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was all my property, except one shawl, which belonged to a friend.</p>

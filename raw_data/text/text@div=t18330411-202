            . On the 13th of March the prisoner came to my shop, and hired a chaise in the name of Mr. Bradfield, for about three hours; he took it away, and I saw no more of him till the 16th - Mr. Bradfield was not a customer of mine; I found the chaise at Putney, on the 15th of March - it was a black gig; I let him have it, believing it was for Mr. Bradfield - he said it was for Mr. Bradfield, of Ropemaker-street; I believed the story to be true, and I parted with it for three hours only - he had a set of harness also.</p>

            . I am stable-keeper at the White Lion, at Putney; the prisoner and another man came there on the 13th of March, in a chaise - the other man drove it, and said they wished to put it up there for the night; the other man left the same evening, but the prisoner remained till the 15th - he offered the chaise to me for sale, and to several other persons, to two in particular; and one gentleman had the horse out and tried it - when the prisoner left, he told me to sell it if I could get the price for it, which was 13l.; I asked him if the other person, whom he called his master, should come for the horse and chaise, whether I should let him have it - he said Yes, and asked if I should know him; I said I did not know that I should, for I scarcely caught sight of him - he observed, no one would come for it but the right owner, and I was to let him have it; the prosecutor came down the same night and owned it, and I brought it up to the office the next morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. You lent the horse to Macklin? A. They were both together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, and live in Henrietta-street, Manchester-square. On Tuesday evening, the 1st of March, I missed from my stable in Manchester Mews, a collar, a pair of reins, a pair of hames and traces; and from my saddle room, at No. 4, in the same mews, a pad and crupper—I had seen them safe about eleven o'clock in the morning—those now produced are them.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 1st of March, I met the prisoner in Hind-street, Manchester-square—he had the harness now produced on his back—I asked where he got it—he cocked up his face as if he was deaf—I spoke louder, and asked where he got the harness—he said in a country dialect, "I found it in the country"—I asked where—he said he had forgotten the place—I took him towards the station, and told him that tale would not do for me—as we were going along he said, "It is no use telling a lie, I bought it of some gypsies"—I asked where—he said he forgot the name of the place, but it was above twenty miles from London—I asked if he could tell me the name of any village he had passed through—he said he could not.</p>

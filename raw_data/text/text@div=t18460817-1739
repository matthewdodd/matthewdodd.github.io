                  </hi>. In December, 1845, I was managing clerk at Somerset-wharf, No. 58 and 59, Bank-side—it belongs to a coal company—Mr. Gibson is the head of the firm—on the 13th of Dec. the prisoner came to me—he called himself Thomas Roberts, a cooper, of Locks-fields—he asked the price of coals to the trade, saying he had taken a coal-shed there—I told him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a Ion ready money—he ordered some, and pulled out a large sheet of foolscap paper, which was a bill to James Drunkeld, Esq., for cooper's work, saying he was going to get the money—he came back a little before four o'clock and brought this check for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. signed James Drunkeld, on Messrs. Drummonds—I asked him who he was—he said a gentleman he had worked for for years, and he had often taken his checks—I asked him why he did not take it to the bankers—he said there was not time—he gave me the check—I had not money enough—I got it cashed and gave him the full change—he said he had had communication with this Mr. Drunkeld for years, and that he gave it him—I have made inquiry, and cannot find any such person—we did not take the prisoner before because we could not find him.</p>

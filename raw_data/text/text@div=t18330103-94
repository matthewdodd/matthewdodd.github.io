               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say that for about eight months you have been out on these expeditions - whose company did you go in? A. Very often with Smith and Grimbley.</p>

On the day before this robbery I put 125l. in Bank notes into my pocket-book, but it contained other notes to a considerable amount, 30l. at least; there was one 100l. note, and some 5l. notes - I had full 140l. in notes, or more; I had a pencil-case in my pocket-book, which I bought of a jeweller in the Strand - the name of Smith is over the door; I had sent that pencil-case back to him to be repaired - it had a stone in the top of it, with a crest on it; when I lost my pocket-book it was in it - the pencil-case was a particular one; I should know it again: I did not miss my pocket-book for some time after it was gone - I walked that morning near Berkeley-square; I came up Hay-hill, and into Dover-street - this is my pencil-case, but the stone is removed; I took rather a fancy to this case, and had a pocket-book made to fit it - and then I found the head of the pencil-case unsoldered, as I turned it rather sharp in sealing a letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You know nothing of either of the prisoners? A. No, except from having seen Smith at Bow-street; the pocket-book was in my right-hand coat pocket; my handkerchief was not in that pocket - I did not feel any pull at my pocket; my pocket is deep - it was rather a large pocket-book, made to hold this pencil-case; there were some letters in it- I missed it about twelve o'clock - I had left home about ten; I had not seen the pocket-book that day -I had seen it at seven o'clock the evening before, and had put it into my pocket; I had the same coat on I have now- my servant generally brushes my clothes in the morning, but having this money in the pocket-book, I desired him not to take my coat down in the morning; I had not taken the book out of my pocket, but I felt it there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Though you had not seen the pocket-book, had you felt your coat, so as to know that it was there? A. Yes, I had, more than once, enough to satisfy myself that it was there, after I was in the street - I have heard that pickpockets do things very dextrously, but this is the first time I was ever robbed.</p>

             In July last I lived at No. 25, King-street, Drury-lane - I knew Smith, Kennedy, and Grimbley - I washed for Smith and Kennedy; they all three came in together one morning in July - Smith and Grimbley asked if I had the kettle boiling, and they sat down and had some breakfast - I afterwards saw Kennedy poking up the fire, and he poked a pocket-book in, and it was burnt - Smith and Grimbley were having their breakfast, and took no notice of what he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did they all come in together? A. Yes, and in five minutes Kennedy went out and staid three-quarters of an hour - when he came in he produced the pocket-book; Smith and Grimbley remained there all the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see who had the pocketbook before it was in the fire? A. Yes, Kennedy had - he pulled it out of his pocket just as he came inside the door; Smith and Grimbley were sitting with their backs towards him - they might have seen it, but I do not think they saw it put into the fire till I spoke about it, and objected to Kennedy poking up the fire; Kennedy went out directly he burnt the pocket-book, but Smith and Grimbley staid about two hours; they washed themselves, and put on their clean shirts.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to represent that both Smith and Grimbley remained after Kennedy went away? A. Yes, for about two hours - I had not got their shirts ready- I was obliged to iron them and air them, and they remained in the room. I was not examined before the Magistrate.</p>

             was standing in the door-way of the glass door, which leads into the parlour; they were talking - I heard a voice say, "What do you want there? we don't want you;" I retired and went away - I imagine it was Kennedy's voice which spoke to me; I afterwards saw Smith, Grimbley, and Mr. Thomas, in a cab, coming out of Covent-garden - I saw Smith in six or seven weeks after, at the Bank public-house; I heard him talk about some money that Higgins, the officer, had taken from him - I said, "What money is that, Smith?" he said,"The money I was up at Bow-street for, that I got from Mr. Holmes;" he did not say how he got it, but he said it was somewhere in the vicinity of May-fair, or in May-fair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Which did he say? A. I will not be certain whether it was May-fair, or in the vicinity of May-fair; I have been a carpenter and joiner for nine years - I once lodged in Royal-street, Stangate, and worked at that time in the Belvidere-road; I had no shop there - I was preparing some roofs for granaries at Puddle-dock, for a gentleman in Thames-street; it is a dock which leads down to the Thames - it used to be called Pedlar's-acre; I have never been of any other trade - I am not a discharged Policeman; I left the Police honourably - I got my living as a carpenter previous to that, and since; I left the Police on the 22nd of February last - we had a rule of being at the station-house at eleven o'clock at night, but I was at my sister's, and imprudently stopped there all night: I went in the morning, there had been a disturbance at St. Martin's vestry-room, and the men were all called out - I met Carter, who said to me, "The inspector has suspended you," and I sent in my clothes and resigned; I refused to go before the Commissioners when Carter told me to go, but I consulted my friends, and resigned the next morning - my sister then kept the Bank public-house - I did not know the house before she took it - I certainly know it now - I have heard the term, a flash house, but I do not know what it means; a great many bad characters frequented that house - it was not at that sister's I slept the night before I left the Police - I have more sisters than one; I have not got my living as a carpenter ever since I left the Police - I have been living with my sister at the Bank for five or six months; I slept there, and my sister was good enough to keep me; I left it about five weeks before she did - I left it to go to St. Bartholomew's hospital; I have not been in the habit of hanging about at Police-offices - I was not at Bow-street office in July last; I went by, but I was not in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not there with Higgins when Smith was discharged in July last? A. I was not, I knew he was discharged about six or seven weeks afterwards, but I did not hear it from Higgins - I have drank with Higgins, but not in July last - I suspected Smith was in custody when I saw him in the cab with Mr. Thomas; it was not Higgins who was with him, it was Mr. Thomas - I did not go into the office when he was examined - I disclosed what I heard him say in the public-house about a fortnight before the examination at Bow-street - I saw what passed at William Guest's on the 5th of July; I did not think it was all right, but I did not give any information of what I saw, because I thought I had nothing to do with it,; I had no interest in it; I consulted my father and my brother-in-law, who advised me to have nothing to do with it and I did not bother myself with it - Higgins came to me about it in October; I do not know how he knew that I could tell any thing about it; I told him then, because he said it would be the means of bringing the parties to justice; there would be no blame attached to me, and I should be in no danger - I did not tell in July, as I did not know how I might be served by characters of that description; my sister who did keep the Bank is now in lodgings in Bull Inn-court, in the Strand; they have not kept any other public-house since that; she and her husband lived in Royal-street, Stangate, before they took the Bank - and when I got the job in the Belvidere-road, I went to lodge with them - I am not in the habit of removing goods in the night for people - I believe there was a distress for taxes at the Bank public-house, in March or April last; I was living there at the time; I lent the persons who were legally engaged in taking the goods away, a hand to remove them; it was about two o'clock in the day; I do not think there was enough to pay the distress; I never removed goods from there of a night - I do not know Henry Phillips - I do not know a person named Calder, in Wild-street; I have seen a man who goes by the name of Mo; he used to resort to the Bank, when my sister kept it; I do not know what his name is - I believe he assisted in removing goods from there for a lodger up stairs, but it was by day-light, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; that was five or six days before the distress was put in - I do not know whether they had removed all the goods before dark; there might be some left till the next day; they were not my sister's goods, they belonged to the lodger, whose name was Wingate.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was it Smith talked about the money? A. At the Bank, about six or seven weeks after I had seen them in the cab - there might be seven or eight persons in the public-house; I did not think of asking him what he meant by saying he got it of Mr. Holmes - I thought it was remarkable to say such a thing in a public-house, but it was not my business - I thought he had stolen it, but I knew he had been examined at Bow-street, and as that was over, I had no business with it - if Higgins or any body else had come to me, I should have told them; I had told my sister and several persons of my own family, and they advised me to have nothing to do with it - I thought when Smith said it, it was done more out of bravado than any thing else; but I suspected it might be true, from his having been in custody - I did not ask him what Mr. Holmes he meant: I had seen him several times at the Bank, and I think I told my sister the next day, or the next night, after I heard him say it; but my sister had left the Bank then; I think she left it about a fortnight before I came out of the hospital - I think she left it in June.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030060"></xptr>Q. Did you not say you saw the three men at your sister's house in July? A. I meant the house that had been my sister's, and my sister was there that day with me; she only lived about four doors from it - I was there, having a pint of half-and-half; I do not know whether my sister was having any thing to drink - I had been home, and could not get in; I went there, and saw her standing at the bar, talking to Mrs. White, the landlady - I did not stay more than twenty minutes; I left her there, and followed the three persons to Guest's; I certainly thought things were not right, but I did not give any information and thought I had better let it alone - I have known Higgins for fifteen months, I suppose; but have not conversed with him respecting this trial, except when he asked me what I knew of it - when I heard the trial was put off, I asked him why he did not let me know; I was never a witness in a Court of Justice but once, and was once at the Westminster Sessions - when I was at my sister's I did what there was to do, and served in the bar; I knew the house was resorted to by bad characters, but I did not harbour them; the house was not in my control; my sister could not help their coming there - I was there when Higgins took a man named Donovan out of the house; I believe it was about a cloak, but it was not stolen in that house; I believe my sister kept the house eight or nine months; they paid as far as they could, when they went away - I believe they did not pay the rent; I helped the goods away when they were seized - nothing had been removed before but the lodgers' goods.</p>

               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were Smith, Kennedy, and Grimbley among the company who resorted to that house? A. I have seen them there repeatedly; I have often seen bad characters there, and heard them relate their exploits to one another; it was very common - I left the house three weeks or a month before my sister did, and went to the hospital.</p>

            ; we kept the Bank public-house - I did not know it by the name of a flash-house; very indifferent characters came there - Smith, Kennedy, and Grimbley came there very often; on the 5th July, the day Smith was taken, I saw him with some money - I did not keep the house then; I used to go there very often to get in my debts; I saw Smith with some sovereigns in his hand, between twelve and one o'clock; I asked him to pay me what he owed me, which was 11s.; he used some very bad language, and said he did not owe me any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you arrived there before your brother? A. No, I rather think he was in the house when I went in; I am not sure; I used to attend at the bar - I do not know what you mean by calling it a flash-house - I am very sorry I ever saw it; I lost my all there; I did not owe so much when I left it as was owing to me - I had not a good opinion of Smith, though I trusted him; I think my brother left the Police in the latter end of 1831; or it might be February, 1832 - we went to the Bank in November; and it was some time after Christmas he left the Police - he afterwards came to live with me; I kept him; he cleaned knives, and did any thing there was to do - I did not pay him wages; I gave him a shilling or two, now then - when I saw Smith there in July, I stopped about twenty minutes in the house; I think I left the house before my brother, but I can hardly recollect which went first - Higgins, the officer, has been there occasionally, when he came for prisoners; he has not been there every week - I have known him not to call for a month; I knew he took two prisoners there, who were transported, and four or five others; my brother was not there five months; he was there three - he knew of two being taken in the house, because we told him; I do not know whether he was in the house when they were taken; he staid with us till we left the house, or nearly so; I am not aware where he went to; he was ill while he was with us; he had a bad leg, but it got well about a month or five weeks before we left, which was in May - we went to live in Parker-street, which is the next street; my brother lodged with me in Royal-street; he took the lodging the same week I did - I think he was at the Bank at the time we left it, but I took no sort of charge of him, and do not know when he left - my goods were seized for ground-rent, which I imprudently did not see paid before I took the house; we had a lodger named Wingate, who left us about a week before our goods were taken, and in about a week after we left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This house was frequented by bad characters? A. Yes, but I was not aware of it before I took it, or I would not have taken it; I left it very much reduced, because I had given credit to a great many persons - I tried my utmost to let the house before I left it; Smith owed me 11s. for board and for drink - I generally trusted good characters with more, but I stopped at 2s. with bad characters; I did not trust many bad characters - I believe my brother went to the house after I left it; he did not go much there that I know of -I remember Smith going away on the 5th of July, with Kennedy and Grimbley; I believe my brother followed them: I remained there then, but I meant I did not know whether my brother or I left first in the evening - I went there very often; I believe my brother did, though he did not board there; I have drank in the house after I left, but not often - I may have drank half a dozen times there: I generally drank porter; I might have taken half-and-half- I paid the landlady for what I drank; my husband is now very much reduced, and is obliged to work in a brewery - he never was in any trade; he never was a fighting-man: his brother is one.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were any prisoners taken in your house for any crime or misdemeanor committed there? A. No; my brother was not always there, but generally - Donovan was one of those who was taken, there was another taken at the same time; I always gave Mr. Thomas all the assistance I could: my brother went to St. Bartholomew's-hospital with his leg - I think he was there at the time we removed.</p>

            . I live on Holborn-hill; I carry on business under the name of Spratswell: I am a tailor. On Thursday, the 5th of July, Smith came to my house with a taller lad, and then he came again with a smaller lad; he first bought a pair of white trousers - the next time the younger one bought a suit of clothes - I forget whether Smith paid me two or four half-sovereigns; I saw a considerable quantity of money in his hand; I think twenty sovereigns or more, and the other lad had as much - here is my book in which I made the entry at the time; my attention was called to it the same day by the officer.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030061"></xptr>JOSEPH HIGGINS (Police-constable F 35). I knew Smith before the 5th of July, and on that day I met him and Grimbley in a cab, in Holborn; I knew them to be thieves, and stopped them: they had each a new hat on, which took my attention first - it was about six o'clock, or between six and seven; I got into the cab, and saw a little bundle - I cannot say which of them had hold of it; it contained a jacket, waistcoat, and trousers, all new, and Smith had a new pair of white trousers on: I asked what they had in the bundle - they said some new clothes which they had purchased at a tailor's, and if I wished I might go there; I went in the cab to Mr. Spratswell's - I took them in there, and found that they had purchased such articles as were in the bundle; I then saw Smith had a watch in his pocket: I took it out, and asked how he came by it - he said he had bought it; I then searched him, and found in his trousers pocket fifteen sovereigns, and I found on Grimbley three sovereigns, but he had no watch - I left them in the shop, in the custody of a friend of mine, whose name I do not know; and I went to the cab, and found a green purse, containing twenty-five sovereigns under the cushion; I went into the shop, and said, "Here is a purse, do you know any thing of it?" they both denied all knowledge of it - I turned out the gold, and counted it in the presence of the shopkeeper; I got into the cab with them, and told the driver to go to Covent-garden station-house: when we got to the corner of Little Queen-street, I saw Kennedy come up to the cab, and halloo; I put my head out, and the moment he saw me, he appeared to bolt off - it appeared to me that he saw the others in the cab, before he saw me; they had several examinations at Bow-street, and were then discharged - Kennedy was out of the way for nearly a week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you usually found him? A. At the Bank, and I at last found him there, playing at cards with William Guest; it might be about the 12th or 15th of July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known Watts? A. Twelve or fifteen months; I have seen him in the A. division of Police - I have frequently been to the Bank to look for thieves; I have drank there when it is necessary, or we could not find them - I have been there thirty times a week sometimes, and sometimes not once; I cannot swear that I have not been a month without going there - I should think not two months, while Baldwin kept it; when I have been looking after thieves: I have gone in many times a day - I have been in when I was not looking for thieves; my own judgment or my own interest sometimes leads me to drink with thieves - I have never been told, as an officer, not to drink with thieves; I took up a gentleman some time ago as a suspicious character - I did not swear to him as a reputed thief; I charged him as a suspicious character, lurking about Covent-garden, but he turned out to be a respectable person, and I apologised publicly; he was locked up, but bail was taken for him - he admitted that he was in company with thieves, but he did not know them; I do not know his name at this moment, upon my oath - I should know it if I heard it; he told me he lived in a house in a court opposite Drury-lane theatre: he was a theatrical man I believe - I took twenty-five sovereigns to the Stamp-office on the same day that I took Smith; they were what I found in the cab - and the other eighteen sovereigns I have had in my possession ever since; I never offered any money respecting this prosecution - I never offered either of the prisoners any; I went to Smith's mother's house on the 19th of November: I found him in bed - I took him to Covent-garden station-house; I did not take him to any public-house, nor give him any gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell Smith that if he would split and say where the notes were, you would make a man of him, and give him 20l.? A. Never in my life; I have known Kennedy eight or twelve months - I was not in Court when he was tried; I knew he was in Newgate, because he sent for me - I went to him once; I do not know that it is part of the orders to the Police not to visit convicted felons - I never received such an order, nor heard of it; I went to the bulks three times, and spoke to Kennedy, in the presence of the keeper of the ship - he had sent me a letter, and I asked him what he wanted; I believe Mr. Thomas has the letter - I took down an order with Mr. Capper's name to it the last time I went, but I said nothing to Kennedy about a pardon; he might speak to me about a pardon, but not on board the ship, not to my knowledge, not that I recollect; such a word never came from my lips - when I got him on shore I took him to a public-house at Greenwich, and gave him some dinner: I paid for it; I am in the habit of eating and drinking with thieves, but not living with them - Kennedy has no money nor friends; I have been obliged to feed him since I have had him in custody - I expect to be paid for it; I have sometimes sent him his breakfast, and sometimes he has come to my house - I have been once in a public-house with him since I brought him up; I will not swear I have not been oftener - I do not know that I have drank gin with him; if I have I paid for it; I have not drank rum with him -I never employed Watts; I have seen him at Bow-street, and on the evening Smith was under examination I think he came to the office with two or three more, but I will not swear it - there were several examinations, and I might have seen Watts once or twice.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know of any order that you are not to drink when on duty? A. There is an order that men are not to go off their beats to drink - I acted under the direction of the Magistrate with respect to the money - Kennedy was never in my house till I brought him from the hulks; I am compelled to feed him now, or take him to a cook-shop, or do something with him.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Police, division A. On the 16th of November I went to the house of the prisoner Guest, in Belvidere-road - it has the appearance of a shop, but there are no goods for sale; it was about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - I saw Guest at the door; I told him I was an officer, and I had come to search for some notes taken from Mr. Holmes - he said,"Dear me, I am taken very bad in my inside;" he repeated it several times, and said, "Will you allow me to go backwards;" he stepped out towards the back door, and I saw his hand was in his waistcoat pocket - I went to him, turned him sharp round, and took from his hand this pencil-case; I searched his bed-room, and found two boxes, one large and the other small - there was 20l. in money and some valuable articles in each of them - he did not go into the yard after I took the pencil-case from him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030062"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you examined at Kingston? A. Yes - I have always stated that I told him I came to search for notes which Mr. Holmes had been robbed of; I never stated that I said I came to search his house, without stating for what - I was there half an hour or more; Higgins was with me, and he had charge of the prisoner while the search was going on - I sent him in a hackney-coach to the watch-house; a person might have a thousand opportunities of getting rid of a pencil-case between July and November.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Can you, of your own knowledge, state that they were brought in the state in which they are now? A. No, I did not take them in - they were cancelled by one of the cashiers, and are kept in the library; I received them to-day - it is impossible to say who made the memorandum at the time they were cancelled; I can tell by the ledger that gold was given for them.</p>

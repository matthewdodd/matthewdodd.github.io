            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Thursday the 23rd of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Mr. Wood's shop, opposite Mr. Gray's; in consequence of what passed I went out immediately, and saw Jones and another woman in Mr. Gray's shop, and a little child was playing by the door; I saw Sharp by a sadler's shop, about thirty yards off near Devonshire-street; there was a fourth woman, she was standing at the corner of New-street, a few doors from Mr. Gray's; I went behind the carts in the street, and presently I saw Jones come out and the other woman. Jones had a long duffell cloak on; directly these women came out of the shop, Sharp and the woman at New-street followed them; they all four went together up Rose-alley, which is a narrow alley and thoroughfare into New-street, and into Petticoat-lane; when they were in Rose-alley Jones stooped down, and said to Sharp, I want to tie up my stocking, Jones and Sharp turned into the passage of a house, I turned my face as they could not see me; I saw something pass from Jones to Sharp; after that they all four joined together again, and went up the alley together; I was behind them, I could see distinctly a piece of something under Sharp's apron, but what it was I did not then know; after that she rolled it up in her apron and carried it loose; I took hold of Sharp, Jones and one of the other woman turned to the right and the other woman went to the left; I asked Sharp what she had got; I took the print from her; she said she found it in Rose-alley. As I was bringing it back and the woman to the shop, I met Mr. Gray in Rose-alley, he was pursuing the woman. I have had the callico ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Jones. - A. I took Sharp to the Compter, she gave me information; Shepherd and I went and took Jones about an hour afterwards in Rose-lane; I told her what I took her for; I took her to Mr. Gray's shop, and the shopman said that was one of the women that were in the shop, and had seen her in the shop before.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Jones Defence. I am a woman that <rs id="t18070513-18-deflabel116" type="occupation">sells fruit in the street</rs>

I had but eighteen pence, I had been to Orange-lane, to buy some oranges; as I was coming along Whitechapel I met my sister, we went into the Coach and Horses, and had a pint of porter; I had fifteen pence halfpenny then; going down the corner of Rose-lane there was some people a quarreling, they began to fight, they were both parted; I said what an odious thing it was for women to quarrel in the street; the officers came, one took the woman I was talking with, and the other took me; they let the other woman go; he says you have been stealing a piece of print; I never was in that gentleman's shop.</p>
               <p>Sharp's Defence. As I went up Rose-alley I saw the print lay, I saw no one near it, neither man not woman; when I got to the top of Rose-alley, that gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me what I had got, I shewed it him, he said he would take me where it belonged to; he took me into the gentleman's shop, they gave charge of me; as for this woman I never saw her before I saw her in the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Sharp called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

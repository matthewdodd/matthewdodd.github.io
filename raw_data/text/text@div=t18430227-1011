                  </hi>. I am constable of the London Docks. The prisoner was in their employ, as manager of the indigo warehouse—on Monday after<lb></lb>noon, the 30th of Jan., a few minntes before four o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming towards the west gate of the dock from the indigo warehouse—he came up to the gate—I said, "Mr. Goddard, where are you going at this time?"—(it was earlier than he ought to go—he ought to have been at the warehouse to see the men out, and the warehouse locked up)—he said, "I am only going to the Custom-house; I shall be back in aminute"—I said, "The reason I have stopped you is, I think you have got something in your hat, and I must see what you have got"—I got him into the box—he appeared much distressed, and said, "I am a ruined man"—I took off his hat, and found these four cakes of indigo—I felt his pockets, and found he had some more indigo in his under coat pockets—he took that out at my desire—I asked him the reason of his taking that indigo out—he said, "I have got indigo of my own, I am taking that out to test the prices"—I said, "Have you indigo of your own at the warehouse?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What quantity?"—he said, "A 2lbs. sample left last quarter"—I have weighed the indigo that was found on the prisoner—it is 5 3/4lbs.—this would not be taken out of the docks as a sample in this state and manner—it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound before the duty is paid—I left him in the custody of the gate-keeper, Fryer—the prisoner said, "For God's sake don't ex<lb></lb>pose me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse-keeper of No. 1 department, at the London Docks—the indigo warehouse forms a portion of that department. On Monday, the 30th of Jan., there was a considerable number of chests of indigo in it, and there are still—176 chests by the same ship—these were all open at that time, and have been so since—the prisoner had the entire management of that warehouse, and full access to every chest in the ware-house—he was manager of the indigo, and one part of his duty was to take eare that no part of it was taken away—I have looked at the indigo found in his hat and pockets, and have compared it with that in the chests—I am not a judge of indigo, but the stamp on these squares is the same that the exterior of the chests bear, and some of the squares in the chests bear the same mark, A I K—I have got them here—these marks correspond with some of the other indigo left behind, and the marks on the chests.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But we understand he has only been insane since her death, and that is fifteen months ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it is—this has been increased from time to time—I do not know any one living person to whom I have men<lb></lb>tioned it.</p>

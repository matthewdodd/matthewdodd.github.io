               <p>On the 22d of January, about a quarter past six in the evening I was coming up Cheapside, and came opposite the shop of Mr. Jennings the linen draper in Cheapside; I perceived two gentlemen standing at the window, the window had been nearly cleared of the articles it was dressed out with in the day, and I saw the woman at the bar and another woman in the shop with their long cloaks on; the prisoner at the bar had a chocolate coloured cloak, and the other had a red cloak on; these two gentlemen still kept looking through the window; I looked through the other window, and I supposed these two women to be shop lifters, by their appearance, by the appearance of their persons and dress. The young man, who I supposed to be a shop-man or an apprentice to Mr. Jennings, was shewing them several articles in the course of their business; these two gentlemen still kept pointing to the shopman, who was shewing the articles on the other side of the counter, which he kept his eye on them, and at the same time he shewed the articles he put them away on the other side of the counter; they came out, they passed me at the window, and they walked up the right hand of Cheapside from Jennings's shop, about one hundred yards, when they were joined by another woman without a cloak, a taller woman than the other two; I kept behind them, and there was some conversation took place between these three women; I followed them up Cheapside, opposite the shop of Mr.

            . I am the mother of this child. I lost my child, between six and seven o'clock, on Sunday, the 10th of June; I searched for the child above an hour and a half, I could not find it; and when I returned home, there sat a strange woman with my child in her lap, it had no clothes on, the child was quite stiff of the cold; it appeared as if the child had been exposed to the air some time.</p>

            . I live in Whitechapel-road, my husband keeps a clothes shop. About six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner produced to me a child's frock, trowsers, and a shirt, she asked me would I buy them; I asked her how she came by them, she gave no answer; she wanted to go away, my husband said she should not go away. I looked at the clothes again, and thought they were Mrs. Harris's; my husband stopped her with the clothes. There came the news that the little boy was lost; we sent the prisoner to the house where the child belonged to, because of the mob in the street. And Mrs. Harris claimed the clothes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Red Lion, Whitechapel, a woman asked me to go to this shop to sell the clothes; she said, she would go with me to the door, she had quarrelled with the woman a week before; she told me to ask one shilling and sixpence for them; she came with me to the door, I went in and asked her to buy the things; she immediately took hold of me. I never saw the child nor the woman before in my life.</p>

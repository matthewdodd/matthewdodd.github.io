On Thursday evening, the 13th of Nov. about half-past eight o'clock, I was on duty in the Whitechapel-road—I saw a horse and cart drive up to the King's Arms publkshoase, witk two parties in it who I knew to be the associates of thieves—one of them, named Myers, I had in custody about two years ago—I did not know the other man's name, but I knew his person—in consequence of seeing this cart I called Bray, a brother constable, and told him to take charge of the horse and cart, while I went into the public-house—the two persons dismounted from the cart and went into the public-house—I was about four or five yards from the</p>

               <p>cart at that time—I saw in the cart a truss of hay, a bundle of straw, and a sack containing something, I do not know what—a person they call <hi rend="italic">Ratty</hi> came out of the public-house—I knew him to be the associate of thieves—he took hold of the horse by the head—I then went into the public-house, and saw a great number of persons there, from fourteen to twenty, but I did not see the two that had been in the cart—I knew a great number of them by sight, in fact I knew them all, though not by name, but they are all always in company with thieves, a regular gang of them—I then came out of the house and said, "Bray, we must take this horse and cart to the station"—I then took hold of the horse, and Bray also—Bray was standing at the horse's head at the time I came out—he had a view of the contents of the cart—when we took hold of the horse's head from fourteen to twenty persons rushed out of the public-house, and surrounded us—they called out "Don't let the b----s take it"—Myers, and the other man whose name I do not know, but whom I had seen at first, got into the cart—I saw him come out of the house—Myers drove it away—Carney made an attempt to get up, he got on the step but came down again—several of them said, "Whip their b----hands off; cut their be hands off"—I saw all the three prisoners—Barnett said tome," Mr. Burgess, let the horse and cart go, it belongs to him," pointing to Myers, who was in the cart—I knew Barnett before—I said, "I shan't let the horse and cart go, it roust go to the station"—several of them cried out, Don't let it go, don't let them take it"—Carney said, "Won't you let it go T—at the time I saw Lewis close by Carney, at the side of the cart—I was standing close by the horse's head—I had hold of it—Lewis struck me twice or three times in the breast with his fist, not very severely, it did not hurt me much—I con<lb></lb>tinued hold of the horse, and shortly after Carney gave me a blow across the face with a pen-knife—it cut part of my nose off and left it hanging down—I could see the blade of the knife—he gave me a second blow on the left temple, and cut me severely—it bled very much—he also gave me a slight cut in the neck, but not much—I think that was from another blow—I cannot say whether received three blows—I found this slight cut in the neck when I got to the hospital—I was taken away by two men to a doctor's shop and got the wounds dressed—I should say Lewis was standing by me for about ten minutes or better—he was close by Carney at the time I was taken away—I should say he was there at the time the cuts were given, I saw him—he had on a brown coat—the second cut was immediately after the first—as soon as he struck the first, he came back and gave me the second—it was done all in a second—I have known Barnett about three or four years—I have seen him frequently during that period—I think to the best of my knowledge he had on a brown Taglioni coat on this occasion—I have been well acquainted with him, and seen him very often—I have known Carney about twelve months—I have seen him frequently, and have frequently seen him in the King's Arms—I have known Lewis I should say better than twelve months—I have seen him frequently up and down Whitechapel—I have not the least doubt of the per<lb></lb>sons at any of the prisoners—I was ten days in the hospital, and am an out-patient at present.</p>

               <p>I was stabbed—it was when I turned round again—I am sure you are the person that stabbed me—I became insensible after two stabs, and two men took me to the doctor's—they are not here—I suppose there were from 400 to 500 persons round at the time—the street was filled with people—I called for assistance, but no one came to assist me—there were too many of your party there, and the people were frightened to come—I do not suppose any respect<lb></lb>able shopkeeper would venture to come forward, there was such a desperate lot—I drew my staff—I had no opportunity of using it, you took good care of that—I bad it out nearly all the time—I struck no one with it, I could not get an opportunity, you prevented me—I was some time at the horse's else that I know of—I suppose I was from twenty minutes to half an hour at the horse's head—I did not remain a moment after. I was stabbed—it was not you alone that assaulted us, it was all your gang; you had got, I sup<lb></lb>pose, about twenty to assist you, while we only had our two selves—I saw you in conversation with the others inside the house, not outside.</p>

I was called by Burgess, in front of the King's Arms, White-chapel-road, about half-past eight o'clock on the night in question—I saw a horse and cart at the door—there was no one in it when I came up—Carney was standing by it—Burgess went into the house—he might be gone a minute and a half, or two minutes, before he came back—I saw on the top of the cart some hay, a bundle of straw, and a sack full of something, but the bed of the cart was full underneath the straw—I knew Carney before—when Burgess came out he said, "Bray, we must take this horse and cart round to Spital fields station"—Burgess and I took hold of the horse for the purpose of doing so—we were in the act of turning the horse's head round, when Carney seized horse of it—we had not succeeded in turning it round—about fifteen or twenty persons came out of the King's Arms at the time—that was while Carney had hold of the horse—we all three had hold of it—among those who came out I noticed Lewis, and several more not yet in custody—I did not see Barnett at that time—there were cries of" Cut their b----hands off don't let them take it"—that was repeated more than once or twice—I cannot say whether any expressions of that kind were used by either of the prisoners—whilst I, Carney, and Burgess were at the horse's head, I saw Lewis come off the pavement—he was the second that took hold of Burgess and me, and likewise of the horse's head—he struck me two or three tires—I had then hold of the horse's head at the off side—I saw him strike Burgess in the breast more than two or three times—Burgess at that time had hold of the horse's head at the near side—I heard some one say to Burgess, "Let go the horse; it belongs to the person in the cart;" but who said that I cannot say—I did not notice Burgess cut by anybody—after Lewis struck me I still kept hold of the horse's head—I was on the opposite side to Burgess, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184511240064"></xptr>
               <p>at times we were both in front by being pushed about so—Carney was on the near side, the same side as Burgess—I did not notice Burgess after he was cut—while I was standing at the horse's head I was struck a severe blow from behind, between the shoulders, like from a stick or some heavy instrument, and directly after that I missed Burgess from the horse's head—about a minute or two before I missed Burgess I saw Carney take a knife from his right hand side, and open it with his left hand—about a minute or two after receiving the blow between the shoulders, Barnett came from behind the cart, and struck me in the left ear—I was not aware when at the police-court that my hat was cut as it is—had it not been for my hat I should have received a more severe blow—my hat is cut right round—it was done with a stick or a life-preserver, I cannot say which; but I saw Barnett come from the tail-part of the cart with something in his hand a foot or eighteen inches long, and be struck me with that—I have known him about three years—I am positive he is the man that struck me that blow—I have not the least doubt of it—it disabled me from holding the hone—I was knocked right away from the horse—it cut me very dan<lb></lb>gerously—I was carried to the doctor's, from the doctor's to the station, and from there to die hospital, where I remained nine days—my ear was cut from the blow—it was sewn up when I got to the hospital—two of the per<lb></lb>sons that came up, got into the cart, and succeeded in driving it off—I was in my uniform, on duty—Burgess had his private coat on—he is in the habit of being out in plain clothes, but they all knew him—I had my staff out part of the time—I took it out when I received the blow between the shoulders—Burgess had his staff hanging on his arm, and I saw Carney lay hold of it and try to get it from him—I have been into this public-house several times—I was never in the back place, never further than the bar—about half-past ten that night I was fetched from where I reside, to go down to the station to charge Barnett, who had been taken into custody by a sergeant—I saw him at the station in custody—my ear had not been sewn up then—I was taken to the hospital afterwards—some lotions had been applied to it, to stop the bleeding.</p>

On the 13th of April, about one o'clock in the morning, I was in King-street, Snow-hill, going home to Bridgewater-gardens - I fell in with the prisoner; she laid hold of me, and asked me to walk with her, in a lane which runs into <placeName id="t18270531-64-crimeloc324">Chick-lane</placeName>

I took my watch from my fob and put it into my pocket, when I met her; I gave her 2d. or 3d.; she asked me to go to a house with her, but I declined. I missed my watch almost immediately she left me - she went straight down the passage; I went after her, and met a watchman - we went in pursuit, but did not find her, but in about ten minutes I found her in the watch-house with my watch - I am sure she is the girl.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner passed my box in John's-court, as the clock struck one - hearing of this I described her to my brother watchman, who stopped her at the corner of Field-lane, and gave her to me, and as I brought her by the Saracen's Head she took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310039"></xptr>this watch from her bosom; I took hold of her hand, and asked her to give it to me, but she said she would give it to the man it belonged to.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him - he talked with me, and looked at his watch, and all at once said, "Take my watch, and hold it a few minutes, while I go up here;" I waited ten minutes - he never returned; I walked about till the watchman took me - I said I wanted to find the man to give him his watch. I went to the watch-house, and gave it into his hand; he said I had not robbed him; the constable said I might go, and as I came out the gentleman came in, and said, "This shall be made a charge of felony - you must go to the Compter."</p>

I enquired of the constable, where the watchmen were? he told me they had been drinking and quarelling all night; on the Tuesday following I was told the thieves were in goal, and the wigs found; I went and saw the three prisoners in the Court-house, in Well-close-square; the woman at the bar said she found the wigs at the end of Denmark-street; we took them before the Justice, and swore to the wigs, and they were committed.</p>

On the 4th of March I called the maid up as usual at 6 in the morning; she went down stairs, and in less than a minute came up again; I found, by her speaking to my daughter, my house was broke open; I got up and went down, and found a desk was taken away from off the counter that we used to keep money and plate in, and a parcel of cloaths from off a table, linnen aprons, new cloaths, handkerchiefs, and different sorts of things in our way of business, we are pawnbrokers; I missed the till also from under the counter, and a closet was stripped of other goods; most of my loss was in money. On the 10th of March I advertized several things, after I had got the marks from the owners; about a month after that we were beset by eight boys and two men about 11 o'clock one night, Swift that was executed last was one of them. After that I heard that

He went and brought it (produced in court) the next morning, I went to the turnkey of Bridewell, the keeper came to Justice Scott's, and swore to seeing it in Madin's hand, but he is sick and not here. After Madin was taken I went to him at the Tower goal, I asked him how he came by that box? he said it was given him by a young man that is gone to sea; he said the same before the bench of Justices. Jack-above-ground, after taken, made discovery of my robbery; this prisoner was always stubborn.</p>

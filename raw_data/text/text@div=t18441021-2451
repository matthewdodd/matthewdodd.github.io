                  </hi>. I live in Aldermanbury. On the 18th of Sept., about half-past five o'clock, I was standing at my door—I saw the prisoner past from the end of Addle-street, and turn into the lobby of No. 51, Mr. Marget<lb></lb>son's—in a few minutes after, as I was crossing the street, I saw him come out with a piece of carpet on his shoulder—he had a blue bag in his hand—he passed down Aldermanbury, and I, seeing Mr. Margetson at the end of the warehouse, called to him—he came out, and I spoke to him.</p>

From what Oakley told me, I ran down Aldermanbury, and saw the prisoner with a piece of carpeting. on his shoulder—I ran up to him and collared him with it on his shoulder—it belongs to Mr. John Monkton and belongs to Mr. John Monkton and others—I am their agent.</p>

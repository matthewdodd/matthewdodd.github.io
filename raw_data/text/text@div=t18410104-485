                  </hi>. I live in the parish of Heston, in Middlesex. On Sunday evening last I and my wife went to chapel—I left my house locked up quite securely, but nobody in it—we returned a little before eight o'clock—I unlocked the front door, and saw the pin of the back window broken, a pane of glass broken, and the window open—I am certain it was secure when I went out—I missed the property stated, the watch from the dress<lb></lb>ing-table, and the money from the wash-hand-stand drawer—I had left the paper now produced with my writing on it, tied up in the bag with the money, when I went to chapel—I know both the prisoners, one lives next door to me, and the other a few doors off.</p>

In consequence of hearing of the robbery, last Monday morning, I went about a quarter before six o'clock to Deeley's house—I found him in bed—he came down stairs by his mother's order—I asked him if he had seen Barnes on Sunday night, between six and eight o'clock—he said, "Yes, I saw him as I was coming from Hounslow, in the Staines-road, and wished him good night; that is all I saw of him"—I afterwards went to Barnes, and asked if he had seen Deeley between six and eight—he said, "Yes, I saw him, and we went to</p>

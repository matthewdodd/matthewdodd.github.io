                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. George Ferguson. He keeps a shop in the general way—he sells caps and bonnets—I serve in the shop—the prisoners came there about three o'clock on the 6th of feb<lb></lb>ruary, and asked for some women's worked caps without borders—I took a box from behind the counter, and showed them some—Johnson took one cap in her hand, and put several more on it—she showed the cap to Robin<lb></lb>son, and said she thought it would do for her sister—Robinson took it, and put it into her bosom—she then took another and put it into her bosom, and then one of them said it was for another person—I put the lid on the box, and took another box of children's caps to show them, and then Robinson took one of the best caps, and put it into her bosom—when she asked the price of another, I said, "A shilling," but I would say 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—they said no, the party should come themselves, as it was a very un<lb></lb>thankful office—I then came round the counter, and said they had not purchased any thing of me, but I should thank them to give me the things they had taken—Robinson said she had taken none—Mr. Ferguson then came forward, and Robinson took the caps out of her bosom—she threw them on the counter, and I found two more caps behind the counter, which were crumpled up.</p>

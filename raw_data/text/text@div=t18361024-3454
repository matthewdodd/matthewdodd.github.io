                  </hi>. I live at Beals' Wharf, Tooley-street. On the 14th of October I was in Duke-street, Southwark, about eight o'clock in the evening and observed somebody touch my stick with their foot—I turned round and saw the prisoner running away—I put my hand to my pocket and my handkerchief was gone—I immediately pursued him to the first arch-way of the rail-road—he crept under the rail into the street—I col<lb></lb>lared him, but found nothing on him—I took him across to the rains where he had run in, and within about two feet of where I took him I found my handkerchief—there was nobody within ten or twelve yards of him—nobody else could have put it there.</p>

               <p>I am a gunsmith, and live in the Fleet-Market, on the 19th of October, about ten or eleven in the morning, the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy some pistols, I asked where they were? - He took me to the sign of the George, near Holborn Bars; there came in a woman, the prisoner said if I would go along with her she would shew them to me. She took me up a court about fifty yards from the George, and there is a room up one pair of stairs, she shewed me the pistols. She desired I would take them away, for that if her husband came home and saw them, he would kick her out of doors. I went back to the prisoner, who was still at the George; he asked what I would give for them? I said they were worth a good deal of money, and I would give him twelve guineas for them; he asked if I would take them with me? I told him I would come next morning and settle with him. I knew the pistols belonged to Mr. Grice, having had dealings with him: I went to Mr. Grice and told him what had happened, and appointed to meet him at eleven o'clock at my house: about nine o'clock Smith came again, and asked if I would have the pistols? I told him I would: he said they were then at a house in Drury-lane, I went with him to a public house, and desired him to stay there about an hour; I then went to Sir John Fielding's office, and some of his people came with me and apprehended the prisoner.</p>

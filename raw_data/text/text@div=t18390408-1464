                  </hi>. I am a plasterer's labourer. I live opposite Mr. Daniel Smith's warehouse, which is in Woolpack-yard, Kent-street—on the 12th of March, about half-past eleven o'clock in the evening, I was look<lb></lb>ing out of window, and there were some men below—at twelve o'clock some man went from the bottom room of the house I was in, to the end of the court, and some person went past the court—the man who went from the house came back again, and said, "Now then," and immediately something was thrown off the roof of the warehouse—it was white, and I thought it was a dead body rolled up in a sheet—I called Thomas Dennead to look at it—he got out of bed, in the room where I was, and looked at it—there were then two men on the roof of the warehouse—I saw them, but did not know who they were—after that I saw one man drop from the top of the warehouse, down by the water-closet—he came straight across, and to the room I was in—it was Connor—we asked him what it was he threw off the warehouse—he said about 2 cwt of lead—be then borrowed the key of the young man I was stopping with, and went down stairs to the bottom room of the house I was in.</p>

I live in the same room with Cavell—he called me, I got out of bed, and saw two men crossing the road with the lead, and saw two men on the roof—I saw them come down by the spout, and jump on the water-closet—the lead was brought into the room under mine—Sands was one of the men who brought it, and I think that Bratt was the other, but he has a different dress on now—Bratt and Sands live in a room in the next court—I had known them before—Connor then came to me and borrowed the key—he said he turned down about 2 cwt of lead—I saw lead the next morning under a table in Connor's room.</p>

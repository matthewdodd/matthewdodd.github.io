            . I live in Arundel-street, Strand. On the 2d of September, about two o'clock, I was at the meeting in <placeName id="t18190915-250-crimeloc1346">Palace-yard</placeName>

               <p>"Look to your seals." I then saw the prisoner's hand drawing from my flap - I had tucked my seals under my flap; I found my seals were cut off my ribbon - I seized him immediately, and took him out of the crowd. About twenty people attempted to rescue him in Parliament-street, before I had searched him - I received a blow from some of them, and conveyed him to Bow-street. I did not find my seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. The prisoner denied it - A. Yes. The man pointed him out to me - he left us when the mob attacked us.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any body take it? - No, I was in my shop about four o'clock, shutting the door after my husband, about ten minutes after there was a person in my shop, I went out and there was only one card in the window, in ten minutes before there were two; I immediately sent for my husband from the office that he was at, informing him of it; he sent and gave information to Bow-street, and then the lace was stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190064"></xptr>ped by the pawnbroker; I saw it the next day at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody was it you saw it? - At the pawnbroker's,

               <p>The prisoners at the bar came to Mr. Wooding's shop, as near as can be at five o'clock in the afternoon, and this lace was offered by them to pledge, I thought it was not theirs, in consequence of which I sent to Bow-street for an offacer, to take them into custody, and they were taken immediately; that is the lace which they brought.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was not Currie the person that had possession of the lace? - I cannot positively swear.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not Currie the man who asked you what you would give for it? - I believe it was, but they both came together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not Currie who all along treated with you as the owner of the lace? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You often have persons come into your shop together, one as the owner of the goods, and the other as a companion? - Surely so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner White I was going home about five o'clock, and I met the prisoner Currie, and I accompanied him innocently into the shop; I know nothing of the lace, nor had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Currie. I went on some business to Bedfordbury, on my returning to the borough I picked up this lace at the corner of New-street, Covent-garden, wrapped up in a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>The prisoner White called five witnesses who gave him a very good charaster.</p>

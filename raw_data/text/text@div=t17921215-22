               <p>I am a constable. I took these articles from the prisoner, Trimmer: a towel, a piece of green stuff, with two shillings-worth of farthings in it, one half-crown piece, 7 s. 5 six-pences and 9 s. 6 l. in halfpence, together with some pick-lock keys; one of which I tried the prosecutor's door with, and it locked and unlocked it as well as the key the prosecutor has: this was taken from him the day of the robbery, between eleven and twelve o'clock: I, in company with Mr. Cooke, saw the prisoners coming up George-street, in White-chapel. As soon as they saw us, they ran into a house. We pursued them. - I got into the house first, and I met the tallest of the prisoners coming out. We had no warrant. - We did this on our own suspicion. - And if we had not known them that was sufficient to cause suspicion. Mr. Cooke stood withinside the door. I let the tallest pass me, in order that Mr. Cooke should lay hold of him, and I laid hold of the other. Accordingly, I took Trimmer, in a backyard, that was there; and there I found all this property on the prisoner, Trimmer. A shift I picked up in the passage; but cannot take upon me to say which of the prisoners it was that dropt it. - There was no coat found on him - nor sheets. I found this piece of stuff with the farthings, and 9 s. 6 d. in half-pence; and as soon as I had found the farthings, he took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150049"></xptr>hold of the piece of stuff, and shaked them in among the half-pence: with that I secured him, and took him to the office, and advertised the articles, on account of which the prosecutor came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Trimmer. Did you take that property from me? - I took every article, expect the shift, out of his pockets.</p>

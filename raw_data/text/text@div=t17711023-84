On the nineteenth of October my daughter told me she had taken some things out of the house. I asked if she knew what silver spoons were in use; she said, No. I went and looked among the spoons, and missed a silver one marked M N. I then desired my daughter to look over the house, and see whether she missed any thing else: accordingly she did, and on Monday following that silver spoon was brought in, and put into a cupboard, and another was carried out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was brought in?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Because I found it; I missed another that was marked I S C; then I desired my daughter to look further, if she found any thing missing. I did not know that any thing else was missing. On the Tuesday following the prisoner ran away; I got a warrant of justice Sherwood, and she was taken up on Wednesday, I think it was the twenty-third. She was carried before justice Sherwood; the goods mentioned in the indictment were all produced at his house, they are here now in court. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say about it?</p>
               <p>Thomas. She declared the things mentioned in the indictment were my property; that she was in need of money for some debts contracted before she came to me, and took them through necessity; and that she carried them to one Mrs. Hyde, and desired her to pawn them, and that the money was for her own use. Mrs. Hyde is here, and Hyde owned she pawned them for her; she owned they were my property, and she took them for necessity.</p>

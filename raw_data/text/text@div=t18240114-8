             and others, his partners. On the 29th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, we landed three hundred pigs of lend on the wharf - I went there at seven o'clock next morning, but did not miss any till the officer came to enquire, which was in the course of the morning; I then missed five pigs. I have known the prisoner sometime, and saw him standing at the head of the wharf while we were landing them.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JUDGE. I am a Thames Police officer. On the 30th of December, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner at the end of Tooley-street, with something wrapped in a piece of old bag; I asked what it was; he said a piece of lead. I found it was part of a pig of lead, and appeared fresh sawn off. I asked where he got it - he said he was watching Mr. Illman's craft at Dowgate-wharf, and a man gave it him - he could not tell who the man was; and said he was going to sell it. I made enquiry, and found out the prosecutor's wharf. It matched with a piece which was afterwards produced with four pigs.</p>

            . I was with Judge. I went in search of a lighter, and found four pigs and a piece of lead in a barge, called the Jemima, and in the cabin I found a saw, which had lead in the teeth, and lead dust on the floor. I took the lead to the prosecutor's wharf, with a piece of bag which was in the barge, and it corresponded with the piece of bag the prisoner's lead was wrapped in. The lead also corresponded.</p>

            . On the 26th of December, I sent the barge Jemima with three hundred pigs of lead, and saw them all landed on the 29th, and saw them marked on the 30th. I was told the barge was missing; the prisoner had no business with it - I found it afloat half a mile down the river, with four pigs and a half of the same lead in it.</p>

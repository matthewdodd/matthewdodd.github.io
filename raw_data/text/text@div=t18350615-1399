                  </hi>. I am constable of Hornsey. The prisoner was given into my custody on Saturday, the 6th of June, by Mr. Arnold, upon the charge of stealing his mare—I searched him, and found a duplicate and a Smithfield horse-ticket, in a bag containing some linen—I took charge of the mare for the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Old Weston, in Huntingdonshire, seventy miles from London, and am a miller—I lost a mare on the 6th of June—I had seen her safe on Friday, as late as nine o'clock—she was turned into a little paddock—the gate was shut; she could not stray—I missed her about six o'clock in the morning—I came off immediately to London, on the Boston coach—at the Wellington-bar I saw the mare—I knew her immediately—she was grazing, and the prisoner was lying on the grass—she seemed to have sweat a great deal—I took hold of the mare, and he asked what I was going to do—I said if he would come with me I would tell him—he followed me a few steps, then turned into Mr. Johnson's fields—he then ran about a furlong, and was stopped by a person—I accused him of stealing the mare—he said he hoped I would forgive him—it was accidentally that I found her—I did not know the prisoner—I gave the mare up to the officer.</p>

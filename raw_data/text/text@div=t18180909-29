On the 29th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming down <placeName id="t18180909-29-crimeloc168">Fleet-street, near Bridge-street</placeName>

I had not noticed the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>HENRIETTA NEWBURN. I live in Brides-passage; my husband is a tailor. I was going towards Temple-bar, and saw a tall man, in a green coat, behind the prosecutor, and another man behind him - I saw the tall man hand the pocket-book to the short man, who went across Fleet-street - I watched him-the prosecutor turned round, I pointed the short man out to him, and went on.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DEVEY. I am a brass-founder, and live in Shoe-lane. I heard a noise, went to the door, and saw the prisoner, and a tall man, in a green coat, running by; I heard the cry of Stop thief! pursued the prisoner, and caught him by his arms - He made an effort to get rid of something, at that moment a man jumped out of a cart, picked up the pocket-book, and called out, "Here it is!" Mr. Williams claimed it; the tall man was stopped, but got away. We took the prisoner to my house - He asked me to intercede with Mr. Williams, saying, he had a wife and two children. Mrs. Newburn came in, and said she pointed out the man. He said it was a hard thing to have his life sworn away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. My shop is eight doors out of Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOLLAND. I am a grocer, and live in Shoelane. I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner and a tall man, in a green coat, running down the lane, the mob were following them; Mr. Devey stopped the prisoner, the other man was stopped, but got away. I saw the prisoner throw the pocket-book from his hand, it fell against a cart wheel; a man jumped out of the cart, picked it up, and gave it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BIGNAL. I was in a cart in Shoe-lane, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner put his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090013"></xptr>to his pocket, and throw the back away; I jumped down, picked it up, and gave it the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked Mr. Devey to intercede on account of the disgrace; I was walking down Shoelane.</p>

On the 27th of May, three men came into my shop; they asked me if I wanted any wood. I told them, no. They asked me for a halfpenny worth of table-beer. I gave it them. They pulled out a halfpenny. They asked me, if I had any like that. I put the till before them. They began to grasp at the halfpence. I said, do not rob me. I am an alone woman, and I have got a child to maintain. The others made a grasp, and gave them to another, and then they ran away. And the prisoner, he took some of them. I stopped him, and said, he should answer for the whole. They took fourteen or fifteen shillings of halfpence. I only swore to ten shillings, for fear I should do wrong.</p>

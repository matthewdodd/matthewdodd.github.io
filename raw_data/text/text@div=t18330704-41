            . On Wednesday, the 13th of June, I was opposite the <placeName id="t18330704-41-crimeloc212">Mansion-house</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. It is false, I had the handkerchief in my hand; I picked it up before I came into the mob, and when I came into the mob, the gentleman said it was his - I gave it him, and he said no more; but about a quarter of an hour afterwards in Old Jewry, the gentleman came up with an officer, and gave me in custody. Witness. I followed her down Princes-street, and it occurred to me after I had taken it from her, that she might have taken a pocket-book from somebody, I immediately gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she have it in her hand, and give it to you? A. Certainly, she did not; she was concealing it under her shawl - I took it from her; I felt a pressure at my pocket just before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had it in my possession five minutes before it was claimed. Witness. I had not missed it an instant; I had it safe immediately before - I had not left the Bank two minutes; she was tucking it under her shawl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The mob was so great, I was obliged to turn back, and I got into Goldsmith's, at the bottom of Old Jewry. Witness. I let her go the length of Princes-street before I saw an officer - I kept her in sight all the time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JEWELL EDWARDS. I am an officer, and produce the handkerchief.</p>

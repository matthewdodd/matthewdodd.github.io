On the night of the 12th of August, I drove one of his cows into the cow-shed, by the road-side—I fastened the cow with a chain round its neck, shut the door, and the next morning went to the cow-shed, found the door open, and saw the cow lying there dead—it was warm—its belly laid all on the ground by the side of it—its belly was cut open, and its entrails laid on the ground—some of the flesh was carried away—the throat was cut on each side, and a quantity of blood laid there—I found some sacking lying there, and some tarred string—I went and called master up—he lives about fifty yards from the spot—it was about half-past three o'clock in the morning.</p>

I met the prisoner coming from towards Tottenham, with a large bundle flung over his shoulder, and a bottle of water—I asked him what he had got—he said "Water"—I said, "I mean what is in the bundle?"—he said "Clothes"—I put my hand to it, and found it soft and very heavy—I took him to the station-house, and he owned he had some meat—I searched him, and found a sharpening-stone, with tar rope, and smears of blood on it—I found nine or ten pieces of beef in the bundle, and two kidneys—he said a man gave it him on the road—I took off his coat, and found his arms and elbows stained with blood-information came from Tottenham that a cow had been slaughtered—I went there, and found the cow lying with its entrails all out, and the kidneys gone—I compared the meat with</p>

            . I am matron of the Guardian Society's house. I missed four petticoats and two aprons on Tuesday morning, the day after the prisoner and Wood went away. I saw the prisoner after Wood's trial, and told her Wood had been tried, and I hoped she would be punished too; she cried and said she did not care what became of her - I told her any thing was better than being in the street - she then said she had been to the bottom of the garden with Wood, and had taken the two outfits (as we call them) and thrown them over the wall to Wood, who had got over by means of the laundry steps - they were tied up separately but one person might have taken them both - I am certain this Bible was in the house on the Monday at five o'clock.</p>

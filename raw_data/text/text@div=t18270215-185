               <p>JOHN CARNEY. I live in Denmark-street. On the 24th of January I saw the prisoner (whom I knew before) at the top of <placeName id="t18270215-185-crimeloc992">Denmark-street</placeName>

Carney pointed the prisoner out to me, between one and two o'clock; I pursued, and gave an alarm, but lost sight of him; I found him in Fogg's possession in a few minutes, with my till, which contained 19s. in all; there were some shillings among it; it was within another till in the middle of my counter.</p>

            . I heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned round, and saw the prisoner running; I took him, and held him till Evens and Carney came, and said he was the man; as I took him back he said, "I have thrown away the till - here is all the silver - I am sorry I did it - I was in great distress."</p>

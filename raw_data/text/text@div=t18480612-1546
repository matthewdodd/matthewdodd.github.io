                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Smyth, of Middleton-raw, Dalston, in the parish of St. John's, Hackney. On Thursday morning 1st June, I was at the front kitchen window, heard some one at the closet, andcalled to know who it was—the servant answered that it was not her, she wasup stairs—I then saw the prisoner Marshall going out at the front graden, gate—I first heard the noise at the back of the house—there is a sideentrance that leads round to the back—I saw Marshall beckon to Green, whowas on the other bide of the way—they spoke together, and then separated—I ran to the cupboard, and missed the plate-basket, containing fifteen spoonsand a pair of plated nut-crackers, which I had seen safe not five minutesbefore—they were worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the basket was found outside, at the back—thegate was not locked—I called Mr. Saver, a neighbour, pointed out Marshallto him, and asked him to take him—Green, who was on the other side of theway, was stopped by Tyler—Tyler said it was all right, Green had thrownsome spoons over the wall—I found three spoons over the wall of No. 6, among the flower-beds—two were bent, and one straight—they did notbelong to roe.</p>

On Thursday, 1st June, betweenten and eleven o'clock, I was in Middleton-row—Mrs. Smyth called to me tostop Green, who was walking away from the house—I went after him, andtook him—he drew his hands from his coat-pocket, and threw some spoonsover a garden-wall—Mrs. Smyth came up, and I told her to go and get thespoons—she went, and brought them back—when the policeman came, theprisoner denied having thrown the spoons over the wall, and having everseen me.</p>

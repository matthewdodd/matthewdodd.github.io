            . I am going on for fifteen years old. I live at No. 1, Ingram's-buildings, Willow-gardens, Curtain-road. My father is a cabinet-maker - I have been used to work with him - I know the prisoners - on the night of the 14th of March, I went with Mrs. Pickard and Drew from Pickard's house, No. 19, Mill's Court, Curtain-road - I had known Mrs. Pickard about two years, and Drew about two months - I do not know where he lived; but he came from over the water - I used to see him at Mrs. Pickard's - Drew and Pickard asked me to go along with them - they did not say where - I went as far as the corner of Rosemary-lane by the watch-house - it is called Sparrow-corner - we got there about eight o'clock in the evening - we saw a broken window in a clothes-shop - we all three looked at it - Mrs. Pickard crossed over the road, and stood on the other side, and Drew put his hand in and took a bundle of waistcoats - there was a great wire against the hole in the window - it was hard to shove away - it was a very thick wire indeed - Drew shoved it away, and was forced to hold it while he took out the waistcoats, which were tied together, and lay about a foot away from the hole - I heard a lot of glass drop when he took the second bundle - the first were tied together in a bundle - I heard no noise the first bundle which he took - he gave the first waistcoats to me, and I crossed over the road, and took them to Mrs. Pickard, who was near enough to see where we got them, I should think - when I gave them to her, I crossed over, and Drew had another bundle out just as I got to the pavement - I heard a lot of glass fall on the pavement - I heard the noise just as he was drawing it out - it happened by his pulling his hand out - the parcels were both of one size - I crossed over and gave that parcel to Mrs. Pickard, and she said, "Come on" - I crossed over directly to Drew; and just as I got across the road, there was a bundle hanging half-way out of the window - Drew said he heard the man running across the shop, and he left that bundle there - we then went to Mrs. Pickard's house - when we got there we opened the bundles, and found it was some unfinished waistcoats - I did not know how many there ware at the time; but in the morning, a young chap named Morris came and divided them - there was eight in each parcel - Mrs. Pickard agreed in the morning to give Drew 3s. for his part, and me 3s. - I did not see her give Drew any money; but when I came, an hour afterwards, she said the waistcoats were not worth the money; and on Sunday morning she gave me five waistcoats for my share - I went and sold them to Mrs. Elliott for 2s. 6d. - she did not ask me how I got them, or any questions - she lives, I think, at No. 7, Wright's-buildings, Bath-street - they were open - she examined them one by one, and saw they were unfinished - I only asked her if she would buy them, and asked her 2s. 6d. - she immediately gave me half-a-crown - I did not tell her how I got them - she knew I got my living by going out with my father - she knew me - I left the waistcoats on the table; Pickard put the waistcoats which she got into a drawer up stairs - I saw her do so - I was afterwards taken up, and soon told about this transaction - Holland the policeman went to Mrs. Pickard's - I have seen some waistcoats in Attfield's possession since - they appear the same as I had dealt with.</p>
               <p>Drew. Q. Did I go with you that night and get them, or did you not bring them to Pickard's house yourself? A. No; he was the party who took them.</p>

            . I am a police-sergeant. I went with Holland on Monday, the 17th, to Mrs. Pickard's house, and in a drawer, in the up-stairs room, found these nine unmade waistcoats, tied up just as they are now - I saw Drew apprehended in the lower room, at Mrs. Pickard's, at the same time we found him there; it was between nine and ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Pickard. Q. Were the drawers unlocked? A. Yes; one or two of your drawers were locked, and three unlocked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there any lodgers in the house that you know of? A. No; it appears that Drew frequents the house - there were two beds, and a kind of bed for the children - I found no clothes which could fit Drew there - there was one bed up stairs, and another down.</p>

            , who is a doll-maker, and lives at No. 83, Old-street-road - I remember Mrs. Elliott coming to our house, on Tuesday, the 18th of March - she brought these waistcoats, and said, "Billy, may I leave these here until I come back, it will save me the trouble of going home?" it being some work she had to do - I put them under the counter - they remained there until Attfield came.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MARCHANT re-examined. These are Mr. Clark's property - I can swear to them by marks - also the appearance and the style of work and shape - I have examined them all - the other five are also his - I can match the buttons; in their present state the five are worth at least 12s. 6d., and the nine about 1l. - such waistcoats as these were in the shop window; on the Saturday morning I found a bundle of waistcoats partly sticking out of the window - there is a very strong iron bar before the window, and about three inches space between each bar - the bundle might be got through that space.</p>
               <p>Drew's Defence. Ware has brought me into it innocently - he has been convicted here once before, and was here last Session for stealing a gold watch - it is only to clear himself he comes here - he has transported two men, and told two or three people he would soon put some more men away.</p>
               <p>Pickard's Defence. I am quite innocent of knowing them to be stolen, or of being out with them - I was at home all night - he brought the waistcoats to me about half-past seven o'clock, and said a young man who lodged with me sent them to me to stop there until he came home, and I put them into the drawer - on Sunday morning he came and asked me for the waistcoats, and said he was going to give them out to be made - I gave him five of them - he is a very bad boy - Hall and Drake were convicted here innocently last Session, and he was the very one who did the crime at Tottenham High-cross - he is the worst of characters.</p>
               <p>HENRY WARE re-examined. I was acquitted of stealing the gold watch.(Elliott put in a written defence stating the witness Ware had brought the waistcoats to her to make up at a shilling each.)</p>

               <p>SAMUEL JOYCE re-examined. That is the situation of my uncle's shop - it is nearly opposite a passage, and the only watchmaker's thereabout.</p>
               <p>HENRY WARE re-examined. When I got there, I shoved the cracked pane of glass several times, and so did Richardson, and the last time I shoved it, it went in - Richardson took out a gold watch - he crossed over to William Pickard and gave it to him, and they both went away - I stood by the shop till the young man came to the door - I then walked away, and after I got a little way I ran - I lost sight of them till I got home to 19, Mill's-court - they were outside Mrs. Pickard's door - it was then about five minutes to six o'clock - I should think it wanted ten minutes or a quarter to six o'clock when I was at the shop - it is about half a mile from Mrs. Pickard's - I saw the watch directly I got into the court - Wm. Pickard showed it to me, and said he dare say it would fetch 6l. - I went with him to Wright's-buildings, where William Pickard's wife lived - he gave her the watch and told her to take care of it - while I was there he took it from her again - I do not know what became of it after that - I never saw it again till I was at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you begin to rob first?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100076"></xptr>A. About a year and a half ago - I was tried here last Sessions with Hall and Blake - I have not been boasting since that, that I got acquitted, and that they got transported for my guilt - I am sure I never said any thing of the kind - I believe I have been taken up before - I am not quite certain - I have been taken up once before - I recollect once; I dare say it is twelve months ago - I had forgotten it - that was on suspicion of stealing some handkerchiefs out of a house in Sun-street - that was the only time I was taken up except last Sessions - I was never before a magistrate, I will swear - nor ever in a watch-house, only when I was taken for the handkerchiefs - I swear that - I was before the Lord Mayor for the handkerchiefs - that is twelve months ago - I was never tried but once and never found guilty - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not tried here on another occasion besides with Blake and Hall? A. No; never in my life - I am sure of that - I got acquainted with Pickard about two years ago - Hall had been a companion of mine - I had known Blake I dare say three months, and I began stealing about a year and a half ago - it may be two years.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you become acquainted with young Pickard and Mrs. Pickard? A. It may be two years - that was about the time I began thieving - I became acquainted with Elliott by my mother and father living in Mill's-court - Elliott is the son of Mrs. Elliott who was tried just now - he was an acquaintance of Pickard's and his mother.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been asked how soon you began thieving - who was the first person you went thieving with, or that set you upon it? A. I think it was Mrs. Pickard - I have not the least doubt of that.</p>

            . I am a female turnkey of the New Prison, Clerkenwell. Mrs. Pickard came there, and went up for re-examination on Saturday, the 22nd - I think she had come in on the Tuesday - I was informed on the Sunday morning of something, in consequence of which, when she got up in the morning, I called her into my room, and said, "Mrs. Pickard, I must search you" - she said,"What for?" - I said, "You have something wrong about you" - I attempted to search her - she resisted - I said, "I must call the assistance of the male turnkeys" - she took something out of her bosom, and held it in her hands - I said, "That is it, whatever it is" - she said, "Do not take it, my son's life depends on it" - I took it out of her hand - it was a gold watch - I have kept it in my possession ever since, and now produce it.</p>
               <p>Richardson. About a quarter to six o'clock, I was playing in Mill's-court, and saw Ware coming down Curtain Road; I said, "Henry, will you play me at marbles?" He said, "No: I have something else to think about; look here, I have cut my hand." I said, "How did you do that?" He said, "I broke a window in Lombard-street, and took out a watch" - he pulled it out, and said, "This is it."</p>
               <p>HENRY WARE re-examined. I did not tell Richardson that I had cut my hand by getting a watch out in Lombard-street - I did not show him a watch - I had no conversation with him about marbles.</p>
               <p>Richardson. I went into Mr. Pickard's house, and got him a bit of rag to tie up his finger, and picked out a bit of the glass - he said, "It will get well in a day or two."</p>
               <p>Witness. I had not cut my finger, nor did he put any rag round it - there was no glass in it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was your finger examined at the police office, to see if it was cut? A. Yes; the same night, at the station-house - I was taken the same night - Mrs. Pickard said, I had cut my finger in the joint of it - but it was not cut there - there is a vein of my finger now there, and she said it was the mark; but it is not a mark - it is the natural appearance of my finger.</p>
               <p>Richardson. He said he was waiting for Mrs. Pickard to come home, to give her the watch to put away, and he would then give me 1s. for doing what I had. Witness. I did not.</p>
               <p>Richardson. I was going home; I live close by Pickard's, and saw Ware in custody, going towards Pitfield-street. I passed by him, and went home. Witness. He, Martha Pickard, and George Drew, all passed the tailor's shop, when I was taken into custody - they stood at the shop - that was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the watch was stolen - I was taken into custody on a charge of removing a pair of trowsers that evening, about ten minutes after the watch was taken - I gave information about the watch half an hour or an hour afterwards - the policeman went and inquired at the pawnbroker's and places where I stated they had lost the things, and found it to be true - I was not charged with stealing the watch at all - I gave information first about eleven gold rings - the watch was the second thing I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Martha Pickard. Q. Did not you come to my house about half-past six o'clock that evening, with your forefinger bleeding, and ask me to take care of the watch for you? A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now recollect whatever you have done amiss, you are now under the solemn obligation of an oath, and will add greatly to your crimes, if you do not tell the truth. Did you take the watch to that woman, and give it to her, desiring her to take care of it? A. I did not. I did not know that she had seen the watch, but it was found on her.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KEMP re-examined. I examined Ware's finger that night - there was no appearance of a cut or blood about his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What had he been taken for? A. On suspicion of stealing a pair of trowsers.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a policeman. I took Mrs. Pickard into custody - I took her to the station-house and searched her, but she begged of me not to search her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100077"></xptr>strictly, as she was not in a fit state to be searched; and I delivered her over, to a woman who usually searches at our place - she found nothing - she was removed to Clerkenwell - on the night of the 14th, when I took the boy into custody, I examined his finger - there was no appearance of a scratch, or blood, or any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you him in custody when he began to make discoveries? A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JOYCE re-examined. This is my uncle's watch, I am sure, and what was lost on the night of the 17th of March; I value it at fifty guineas or pounds - it is our make - it cost us more than thirty guineas - the number is 1386, I think - it is now quite rusted away, but when it was stolen we should not have sold it for less than fifty pounds - it is on the same principle as a chronometer, and must have had wet on it to rust it.</p>
               <p>William Thomas Pickard's Defence. I know nothing about the watch - I was searched twice by the policemen before I saw my mother.</p>
               <p>Martha Pickard to Ware. Q. You say you came to my house at ten minutes to six o'clock, was it not half-past six o'clock? A. No; I was not taken so late as seven o'clock - the officers examined my finger, because a great many thieves have mermaids and other things pricked over their hands and arms.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KEMP re-examined. That was what I examined his hands for - I always look at the hands of thieves - I looked at their hands again next morning - there was no mark whatever on Ware's - I never had Ware in custody, though I know him to be a bad character.</p>

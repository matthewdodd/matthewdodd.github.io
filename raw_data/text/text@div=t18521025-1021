                  </hi>. I am a dealer in jewellery, and live in Jewry-street. On Saturday, 9th Oct., I was standing near the Trinity-house, in Trinity-square, Tower-hill, a little after 8 o'clock—the prisoner came and accosted me; she asked me to take a walk with her—I said, "No, thank you, I am waiting for a friend"—she came close to me, put her hand round me, and she again said, "Do come with me"—I objected to it—I said, "No, thank you, I am waiting for a friend"—she then walked away, but by taking her hand away she lifted the flap of my coat, and that gave me suspicion—I put my hand to my pocket and missed my purse—I had two coats on—I am not positive whether the prisoner had her hand between my two coats or under them—my purse contained two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or more in silver—I had my purse in my side pocket, on my left hand—while I was feeling my pocket a man rushed from the middle of the square, and got on the pavement—he got fast hold of roe by the collar of my coat—I had missed my purse before he came up—I struggled, tore myself away from him, and followed the prisoner—I overtook her about fifty yards from where I had the struggle with the man—as I was taking hold of</p>

               <p>her I observed the money lying on the ground, and I heard the noise of the money running down—I could only see the gold, not the notes; they were in the purse—I asked her where my purse was, and she pointed to it on the ground—I stood between the notes and the gold—she pointed behind me, and said, "There is your purse"—I picked up the purse—the gold and silver was all out of it—the notes were in it—I called "Police!" before I picked the purse up—a policeman came, and I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

On that night I heard a cry of "Police"—I went to the place and saw the prosecutor, who had hold of the prisoner—he stated to me that she had robbed him—he asked the prisoner where the purse was—she said, "There it is"—he turned round, and it laid on the pavement—the prosecutor picked it up, opened it, and said, "My notes are all right"—this is the purse—the gold and silver was strewed on the pavement, close to where the purse was—the prosecutor picked up the gold and silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and reside with my mother in Lincoln's Inn-fields. On the 14th of November, I was walking in High-street, Bloomsbury, towards Oxford-street, at a little after five o'clock—two young men came up to me, and one of them, which was the prisoner, came from behind me—he asked me the way to St. Giles's-in-the-east—one of them had a Mackintosh on—I did not notice the other—I did not give the prisoner any answer, but I drew back from him, and I found that the string that confined my bag was loosened—I was not aware at that time that there were more than two persons together—when I saw them they had hold of each other's arm—it was when I drew back, that I felt the string of my bag loosened—it was on my right arm, and twisted round my wrist—I looked at my arm immediately, and my bag was gone—no part of the string remained on my wrist—the two persons were then on my left<lb></lb>hand side—I should imagine the person who took my bag must have been behind me—I imagine it was cut from my right arm—I had in the bag a purse, containing two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and some silver, a brooch, a buckle, and some other things—on observing that my bag was gone, I went up to the prisoner, and said he had taken my bag—he said he was surprised at my saying so, as he was quite innocent—as I was speaking, he stepped some paces from the pavement, and across the way—I saw him stopped—his companion passed on towards Oxford-street—my bag was produced to me yesterday, but none of the money was in it.</p>

On the day stated I was in Holborn, nearly opposite Turnstile—I observed three young men walking arm-in<lb></lb>arm, the prisoner was one of them—the prosecutrix was walking before them—I observed the three persons looking all over the lady's person—they sometimes parted, and went before, and sometimes behind her, and looked at her—she did not notice them, but I did—I first noticed them near Turnstile—they went on in the direction the prosecutrix did till they got to the timber-yard, nearly opposite St. Giles's church—I then saw two of them go before the lady as if they were going to speak to her, and the third one stopped at her side on her right hand—I did not hear what they said, but when the two went before her, I observed the third one stoop down, and cut the lady's reticule—the prisoner crossed the road—his companion went straight on towards Oxford-street, and the one that had the bag ran towards Holborn—I did not cry out, nor did the lady, but I observed her speak to the prisoner—I saw Young catch hold of the prisoner—he took him into a shop, and I observed the policeman who came up pick up a piece of black ribbon from the prisoner's shoe—I observed the prisoner</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Marshall-street, Golden-square. On the 14th of November I met the prosecutrix at the corner of Plumtree-street, Holborn—she was going towards the church—I saw six persons about her—the prisoner was one—I think two of them were full-grown men, and the other four boys—I only noticed three in particular—one of them was about the prisoner's height, and he had a cape on the same as the prisoner had—they were walking in a very confused manner, sometimes before, and sometimes behind the lady, and then they were in conversation together——they were walking rather fast—I had a child which I was leading, and from what I saw I suspected the persons, and took the child up in my arms that I might follow them more readily—I was about six yards behind the prosecutrix when I heard her cry out—I went, and seized the prisoner, who had got off the curb, and was going to cross the road—I should think he had got about six yards from the lady—I pulled him against the cutler's shop—he put his hand into his pocket, and swallowed something, which I could not prevent on account of having the child in my arms—the police-man came up, and the prisoner was taken into the shop, but I did not go in—I had observed his companions separate—I could identify two of them if I saw them.</p>

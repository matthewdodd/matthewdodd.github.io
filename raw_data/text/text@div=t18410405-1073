               <p>morning, when I was in bed, I received information that that the butler had let a strange man into the house, and he would not go away—I got up and found the man there—I gave him and the prisoner in charge—in going over the plate that day I missed four spoons—they were afterwards found at the pawnbroker's—these now produced are them—they were manufac<lb></lb>tured in Dublin, and have my crest on them.</p>

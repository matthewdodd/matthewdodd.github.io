                  </hi>. I am a baker, at Harrow, and am a widow. About the 3rd of Aug., the prisoner came and told me he belonged to a new Court opened in the Strand, that it was a Sheriffs' Court to recover debts to any amount, and in any county—I asked if the people chose to go to prison in<lb></lb>stead of paying me, what I should have to pay—he said I should have to pay a deposit down, which he had to pay into Court, and that would clear me of all expences—I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for two bills—one of them was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the other was less—he said that that was a deposit which he had to pay into Court, or many people would be claiming debts that had not any owing them—I paid him the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the belief that he was a Sheriffs' officer, of this new Court in the Strand—he called upon me again, repeatedly, and I took out more orders—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the whole—on his calling afterwards, I refused to pay him any more on account of his neglecting to take out execu<lb></lb>tions against two parties—he did not call again, and I never saw him any more—I got one debt by a post office order—the other people would not pay me—they said he was a swindler—I had asked him if that Court could re<lb></lb>cover a bill of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Yes to any amount"—I should not have paid him any of this money if I had not believed the representations he made to me.</p>

Q.</hi> You say I called on the 3rd of August, was it not on the 30th of July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am certain it was on the 3rd of August—the first time I only requested you to get two debts—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is my writing—it appears that here are seven, but I only gave you two the first time—I did not offer to send the notices myself; of course I expected you to deliver them when I paid you for them—I cannot tell bow many times you called on me—you became quite troublesome at last—I never refused to pay you what you demanded—there were two or three parties who resided in town—those you never went near—I do not know where Foxwell and Wardle re<lb></lb>sided—you told me they resided in town—I authorized you to make these parties' money payable at Mr. Easter's, a livery-stable keeper, at the White Lion, to prevent their trouble in coming to me—Ambridge has not paid me any money—I never said I was satisfied—you said you could make them pay—you had been absent a fortnight when I gave Phillips instructions to take you—a person named Kidney was in my debt—I wrote to a person to employ a solicitor to get it—I was not dissatisfied with that solicitor—I said I believed he had forgotten it, and I gave it to you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Elizabeth Fuller. I was present when the prisoner was with my mother about recovering some debts—he said he was a Sheriff's officer to a new Court in the Strand for collecting debts to any amount, and in any part of the country—he said they had officers in all parts of the country—he said he was paid from the Court, and what we paid him was the mere deposit that he had to pay into the Court—I saw my mother pay him, in different sums, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was always present when she paid.</p>

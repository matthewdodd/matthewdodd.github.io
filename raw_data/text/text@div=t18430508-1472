I left him—he did not say anything to me about his last letter—I met him a few days after receiving a letter by the old woman, on the 25th of January, in Hungerford-market—I spoke to him, on that occasion, about the letter of the 14th, or rather, he first mentioned it to me—he said very little that day—no reference was made at that time to the letter of the 14th—no reference was made to the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. demanded in that letter—the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. mentioned in the letter of the 14th I gave to the old woman, but I gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. afterwards—I had no conversation with him with reference to the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I paid to the old woman on receiving the letter of the 14th—I mentioned to him about receiving the letter of the 14th</p>

               <p>—I said if he sent the old lady with any more letters, I should give her in charge—I did not mention the date of the letter, nor describe it to him—he acknowledged having sent the letter by the old woman—when I taxed him about where she lived, and said he must not send her any more, he did not deny it—he did not say he had sent it—he said nothing about sending any letter to me—I had no conversation with him about the letter of the 14th, except what I said about the old woman—the letter of the 25th was deli<lb></lb>vered to me by the old woman—this is it—also this letter of the 10th of May, that was delivered by the same old woman—I saw him a few days after receiving the letter of the 25th of Jan., about eleven or twelve o'clock—he observed to me I had better let him have the £20, and not trouble me again, as I knew he had a charge to make against me—I told him he ought to know better than to be annoying me as he was—he said I had better have sent him the £20 that was asked for in the letter, and he would not trouble me any more, if I gave it to him—I told him I could not afford it—(I did not show him the letter)—he said, "You had better; you know I have a charge to make against you"—I then told him I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and make it up in a few days, if he would promise not to annoy me again—I appointed a time to pay him the other 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and left him—I saw him again in the Strand, some time at the commencement of April, when he asked me for more money.</p>

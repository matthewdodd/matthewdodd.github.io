               <p>GEORGE FLINT. I am a pawn-broker, and live in Edgeware-road, about two o'clcok in the afternoon, of the 7th of December; I saw the prisoner walking with two others, and watched them; I lost them, and when I got to Fitch's house; I saw the prisoner with one of the others, come down Mr. Fitch's steps with a bundle; I stopped the prisoner, and asked him, what he was going to do with it - He said, do you suppose I am a thief. I told him, I did - He said, he was going to take it to his uncle's. My nephew was with me, I gave the prisoner into his charge, while I went to the house to give information; the prisoner threw down the bundle, and resisted a great deal, and got away; I secured him again before he got out of my sight.</p>

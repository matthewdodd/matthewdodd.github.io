I pursued - a man came up to know what was the matter, and snatched my umbrella away, tripped me up, and ran in another direction. I pursued the prisoner across the fields. I saw him distinctly all the way till Hugget stopped him on the other side of the fields; he was taken to the watch-house, but nothing found on him. Next day I found them thrown under a wall, just at the spot where was he taken.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the East India Docks. and live in Charles-street, Commercial-road. I was coming along the Commercial-road and heard the cry of "Stop thief!" I ran round and crossed the prisoner in the fields; Mr. Price was pursuing him, they were the only two in the fields; he jumped across a ditch, stumbled, and I secured him. Mr. Price came up instantly, and said he was the man. He said he was running after the man, but there was nobody before him. He resisted being taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing the field and all at once heard the cry, and saw a parcel of people coming; a man passed me and got over the ditch, I followed him - lost him - and a gentleman took me.</p>

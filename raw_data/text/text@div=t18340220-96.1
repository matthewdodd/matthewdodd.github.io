             (police-constable G 30). I was coming down William-street at the time - I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner - the prosecutor said, "I shall give you this woman in charge, as she has robbed me of my watch, half-a-crown, and three-halfpence, but the watch I have found again" - I found on the prisoner three-halfpence, a pipe, and some bread and cheese.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me in charge for taking a half-crown and three-halfpence - he took the watch to the station-house himself, and said he found it on the ground, which he did not.</p>

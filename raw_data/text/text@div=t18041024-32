               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Trotman? - A. Yes, very well; I have known him six or eight months; he has been in my service ever since the latter end of May or the beginning of June.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom was he recommended to you? - A. By

            , the other prisoner; I hired him to conduct a bakehouse, in Union street, Kingsland-road.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did Armitage recommend him to you as a servant? - A. He recommended him to me as an honest worthy servant; he said he would be bound for his honesty, he had lived with him for six or eight months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say he was to manage a bakehouse there for you; what wages was he to have? - A. Eighteen shillings per week and the privilege of the bakings; I took the house, and bought the fixtures, and put him in, as <rs id="t18041024-32-viclabel163" type="occupation">baker</rs>, the same as the others; I had one or two more at the same time; I paid every expence of the business; the assize-papers, salt, yeast, and coals, and every individual thing; I paid for the printer's bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into that house, and into that business for you? - A. He did; I from my own stock provided flour; he paid me as he sold the bread for the consumption; we settled once a week, on Thursday; I believe I always went to him; I settled up to the 6th of September, debtor and creditor. (Produces the book.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell the flour to him, or did he receive it as your servant? - A. I never sold to him a sack of flour, but he was to account to me as bread; on the 6th of September there remained twelve sacks of flour on hand; that was on Thursday; on the Tuesday following he came to my house; he said he wanted some more flour; he was getting on famously; he baked a great deal of it, and begged I would send him some fresh flour in; I immediately ordered twelve sacks to be sent to him; this was on the 11th; on the 13th, Thursday, I went, as usual, to settle with him, and very much to my surprize, I found the house shut up, and every thing taken away that he possibly could, and he himself was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner Armitage come to your house at all? - A. Yes, he came to my house on the 16th; he enquired if I had heard or seen any thing of Trotman; I said, I think, Armitage, you know where he is; he declared to me that he had not seen him; he wished he had, for that he had borrowed of him 5 l. the week before, on purpose to make my money up, and he had run away with it; on the 22d I went to Armitage; he lives on Saffron-hill; Mr. Cole was with me; I knocked at Armitage's door; he is a baker; I said, what, Armitage, are you here; I told him I rather suspected he knew something about Trotman, and about the flour, as I had told him at my house; he said he knew nothing about the flour; I told him I believed I should make him know something about it, before I had done with him; I looked round the shop, and could not see any sack belonging to me, but one, and that was marked Hobrey; it was standing with salt in it; I had sent that sack to Trotman with flour in it some time before, and I had seen the sack at Trotman's house with some salt in it, that he had bought of some person, not on my account; he denied the flour; I sent for Mr. Trott, an officer, and when he came Armitage was very much frightened and alarmed; then he acknowledged to have received twelve sacks of flour from Trotman, but he would not keep them; he sent them away the next morning; I asked him where he sent them to; he said, Trotman took them away himself, he did not know where they were gone to; we were altogether, Trott, Armitage, and me; Trott said that he had observed some few sacks of flour go out a few days before, and he could not make out where the flour went to.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did Trott and you go to any person's house? - A. To one Salter's, a Baker, in Leather-lane, and there I found two sacks that I had sent from my own house to Trotman's; it had not been unsewed, it had the appearance of being in the same state as I had sent it from my own warehouse to Trotman's, and there was another sack, marked Man, but I did not swear to that, I had no doubt of it; after this I came back to Armitage, and told him what we had found; then he acknowledged to the receiving of twelve sacks from Trotman.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he produce any bill or receipt to you? - A. Yes, he produced a receipt for twelve sacks of flour, signed by Trotman; D - n me, says he, that is the receipt, you can do me no harm, I have bought the twelve sacks of flour, and paid for it; the receipt expressed twelve sacks of flour: I said to him, that would not account for the 15; Trott took him then into custody, and took him to a public-house; he seemed very much frightened; if this be the case, says he, I will tell you the whole about it; Mr. Tusting, I should never have served you so, if you had not used me ill; I told him that I never had used him ill; he said I had, in not letting Trotman be best for him, in some difference there was between his wife and him; he said, I will tell you were Trotman is; he has been at my house near a week, and he left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240021"></xptr>me on Wednesday last, and he is gone down to the Devizes, but if I would not believe him, if I would go to an inn at the top of Fleet-street, I should find his box, directed Crouch; he had altered his name, for fear I should find him out; I accordingly went to this inn, as he directed me, one of the waggon-inns, just at the top of Fleet-market; I did not find his box; I found an entry of the box, in the name of Crouch; upon this, Trott and I went to the Devizes that evening; we got there the next morning very early, and there I found Trotman in a little room, with his wife, at a public-house, up stairs; they seemed to be repacking their clothes up; Mr. Trott entered the room before I did; I was close by to hear what passed; Mr. Trott said, you are the man that we want; you must pack up your things and go with us; he said he would get packed up directly; I was in the room all the time; Trott asked him if he had any property belonging to me; Trott found some money on him, that he acknowledged to be my money for the bread he had manufactured the week before, and also a debt that he had got from a neighbouring person, it was 11 l. I asked him if he had received any money of Armitage; he said he had not received a single farthing of it, nor for the flour sold, nor the candles; he had borrowed 2 s. of his wife, which he paid him at that time; he told us that Armitage desired him to give a receipt, in case that I should find out the flour, that he might shew the receipt, that I might not do any thing to him; he gave him the receipt, in the presence of Paul Hatton, but it was a false receipt; he acknowledged to being with Armitage, and he had been down a day or two in the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Before Armitage said any thing to you about it, you probably told him, it would be better to confess? - A. I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him you would prosecute him? - A. I meant to do it, if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you threaten him you would prosecute him, if he did not confess? - A. No, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Armitage came to you, after Trotman had gone off? - A. It appears to me, that he was at his own house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. He was gone from Union-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He produced a receipt to you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Trotman was your servant? - A. Yes, he was.</p>

               <p>Q.Henry Trotman, bread and biscuit baker and flour manufacturer, Union-street, Kingsland-road; this is the card he distributed to your customers, therefore he appeared to the customers, and the world at large, as one who had the management of the shop; as one that kept the shop; who made the return? - A. He made the return, but I never charged him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Trotman, as the proprietor, did not make the return in his name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Any body might suppose Trotman was the master; did any body besides Armitage know of the engagement between Trotman and you? - A. It was not likely that any body should know; I do not know that any body knew of any engagement but Armitage and him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You had employed Trotman to open a cheap bread shop; a loaf for three-halfpence less than any body else would sell it for, and he was to return the money of what he had sold? - A. Yes, he had no right to sell a sack of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had sold a sack of flour, he was to return you the money? - A. To be sure he was; he had no right to sell a sack of flour at all.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are an officer of Hatton-garden? - A. Yes, on Saturday, the 22d of September, I went to the house of Mr. Armitage.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard the account which Mr. Tusting gave? - A. Yes, it is true; there is one thing that Mr. Tusting has not related; the prisoner Trotman asked me who had told me where to find him; I told him it was Armitage; he said, he was a d - d rogue; then I put the question how much flour he had sold to Armitage; he said, fifteen sacks; there was an agreement made for twelve sacks, of which Armitage got him to give a receipt for; I said, why not give a receipt for the whole fifteen; I cannot exactly remember the words about the receipt; it was something concerning the receipt-stamp would not do for the whole amount; he said that Armitage said to him, if he had a receipt for twelve sacks that would take off any suspicion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This was what Trotman said; Armitage was not present? - A. No, Trotman said he had received no money from Armitage; he supposed he should be served the same way as he had served Mr. Tusting, get none; I produce the three sacks I received from Mr. Salter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a few days before seen any flour removed from Armitage's? - A. Yes; I live nearly opposite; it might be three or four days before that Saturday; I was coming out of the door, going up to the Office, and I observed a grey horse, which is not able to carry flour a great way, and a very little cart; I observed the sacks being put in in a great hurry; it struck me very surprisingly that he had not been in the shop long, on account of removing the flour; I saw them put it in a cart opposite Armitage's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the flour come out of Armitage's house? - A. I did not take particular notice; I saw three or four sacks put into the cart; on the morning of the 22d, I went and enquired, and these are the sacks I had from Mr. Salter; one of them is marked with a piece of leather, No. 1; Mr. Tusting told me it was marked so. (The sacks produced and identified by Mr. Tusting.)</p>
               <p>Trotman's defence. Mr. Tusting, the prosecutor, employed me to print these bills; he indited them himself at his own house, and what was denominated to me as wages, was in case of fines, before I went before the Lord-Mayor; I told him the consequence, that I was going to do a thing that was wrong; he did not seem to like me to have that shop, without I made an affidavit of the return; he said, you must go and do it; I am sorry he has betrayed me as he has done; he allowed me to sell the flour, I did not do any thing but what he allowed; he said if I had not flour in the shop, to come to his warehouse for it.</p>

               <p>Armitage's defence. I did not know that Mr. Trotman was a servant of Mr. Tusting's; I happened to see a hand-bill - Trotman, bread and biscuit-baker, and flour manufacturer, Union-street, Kingsland-road; bread sold three-halfpence under the assize price; flour sold by the sack or score, at the shortest notice. - There is a hand-bill there of the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called three witnesses each, who gave them a good character.</p>

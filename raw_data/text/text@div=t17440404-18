He bid me go up very still and make no noise. As soon as he thought I was asleep, he took these things. I got up as soon as it was light and charged him with taking them; and he threatened to kick me down stairs. I went next day to the King John in Holloway-lane, and asked the landlord if such a man was not there. He said yes (he had got two pound of beef stakes and was eating them) I asked if he had not pawned something, he said he had pawned a silver knee buckle. I told him if he would help me to my things again I would forgive him, and I would pay what they were pawned for. He went with me to the pawnbroker's where my buckles were pawned. I got one of my buckles again, and I paid 5 s. 1 d. for the other two, [a large pair of shoe buckles.] There was one of the buckles he did not take away, which I suppose stuck in my pocket, for I put the buckles under this pair of stockings in my pocket that nobody should find them. He said before the Justice (as I understood him) that he found them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was another man in the bed along with us.</p>
               <p>Holloway. I went to bed so still that the other man did not know of it, and I did not know that any body was in the bed; I hear the other is as honest a man as any in the world.</p>

            . On Saturday in the afternoon the Prosecutor sent for me to the King John and charged me with the Prisoner, and I carried him before a Justice. The Prosecutor paid 5 s. for these two buckles, and the Justice sent for the other buckle and it was sent to him. - The Prisoner declared then that he did not take them out of the Prosecutor's pocket, but found them upon the stairs when he got up in the night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found those three buckles upon the stairs when I got up in the morning.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who went down stairs first?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I went down first - I went to bed at eleven o'clock, I had them in my pocket then, and missed them before I came out of the room in the morning.</p>

               <p>Holloway. Because he threatened to kick me down stairs, so I went away. I don't know the ways of London. I don't lie in London once in half a year. <rs id="t17440404-18-verdict103" type="verdictDescription">

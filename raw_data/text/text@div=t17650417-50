Yesterday morning we miss'd a china bowl that was generally in the house; I desired the maid to go and look into the closet to see for it, and she miss'd two or three more. I suspected the prisoner, as he used to come backward and forwards. I keep cows, and he is a milkman. I apply'd to one of my men where the prisoner lodges, to ask if the prisoner had brought any thing home over night, he told me, he had enquired of a friend of the prisoner's at Limehouse, and he found the prisoner had left a tea-pot there. I enquired at home, and found there was one lost. I went to that house, and desired the woman to let me have that tea-pot that the prisoner left there. I brought it home, and my maids all knew it to be mine after that I took the prisoner into my parlour; and charged him with taking a china bowl, and china tea-pot he denied it, and said, he had no china at all. I said, Have you no tea-pot? he said, No. Then I shewed him the tea-pot, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170036"></xptr> said that he had left it to be sold for 4 s. 6 d. in Ropemakers fields. He said he had that pot of a woman in Ratcliff highway. She was fetched: she declared she never saw it with her eyes before. Then I got a warrant, and charged him: he then went on his knees, and begged I would have nothing to do with it; saying, it was the first time, and necessity drove him to it: this he confessed before my family, and before the Justice also.</p>

The prisoner came house last Tuesday, between one and two o'clock he said another gentleman was coming to him; there was only one gentleman in the room where he was. I saw him come in, and saw him have the tankard. I went up stairs; my wife sent immediately up to me, to let me know the man was run away with the tankard. I came down and sent my man after him, but he could not meet with him. I went to Goldsmith's-hall and got hand-bills out, and about seven o'clock Mr. Benbrook came and let me know he had my tankard. The prisoner left this coat behind him in a handkerchief (produced in court). I never saw the prisoner in my life before that time, but I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I live in Tothill street, Westminster; the prisoner brought this tankard to me last Tuesday, about five o'clock in the afternoon; he wanted to pledge it for five guineas; I looked at it, and asked him several questions: he said he had had it about seven months, and that it was left him as a legacy by an uncle at the back of Barnet church. I said his account was not satisfactory<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290017"></xptr> to me; if he was agreeable that I should enquire farther, I would lend him money upon it. I went home with him to where he lived; there I had such a character of him from a person that I was satisfied: then he wanted six guineas, saying he was going down on board a ship. After he was gone I received a warning from Goldsmith's-hall, giving an account of it; then I went to Sir

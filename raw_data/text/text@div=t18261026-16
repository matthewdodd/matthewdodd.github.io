I know the prisoner - I used to see him two or three times a day; he brought me a brown paper parcel, which I felt - it was very heavy; I felt something like scallops; I thought it was glass salts - he left them with me: he said he was employed at Mr. Davenport's, to take them to a customer, and would take them when he went home at night; one was directed to Mr. Jones, Portman-square; he called for them in the evening.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors, and was employed in the glass department. I was in the back part of the room, where the glass is kept; the prisoner came in in an anxious kind of way, and said he wished Mitchell would attend to his orders; he slipped his hand down, and I saw him walk out with four salts in his hand - he thought I did not see him; I slipped into the next room, and saw him with it - he asked what I meant; I told him plainly - he then confessed that he had taken them, but said he was going to purchase them - he returned them, and said if I would put by any imperfect ones they would answer the same purpose.</p>

            . The Prisoner came to my Shop for a Bit of Bacon; we could not agree, and by some Behaviour of hers I mistrusted she had got something better; I watched her into Hungerford-Market and there I found this Cheese upon her; 'tis mine, and is mark'd, GB x LH.</p>
               <p>Def. I did go into this Man's Shop for Bacon, and as I stood by the Counter, says he, Mistress are not you with Child? Yes Sir, says I Why then if you will let me feel your great Belly, I'll give you a Groaning Cheese. I had 3 Children, and going to lye down again, and I thought God would forgive me if I let him, and I let him do it; but after that he required farther Favours, which I would not grant him. Customers coming into the Shop, I went away with my Cheese, and I had got but a little Way before he came after me and charged me with stealing it, when I knew I had not stole it. <rs id="t17360721-12-verdict71" type="verdictDescription">

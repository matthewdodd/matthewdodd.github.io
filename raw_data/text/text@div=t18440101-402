                  </hi>. I live at 6, Lower Charles-st., Clerkenwell—it is the dwelling-house of my father, Edward Stephen Jackson. About one o'clock in the morning of the 3rd of Jan., I rEturned home and shut the door after me—the lock catches so as to be secure when I draw it to—the front parlour door was shut when I came in—I slept in the back parlour—I shut that door—between four and five o'clock in the morning I heard a voice calling out, "Thieves," and a noise as if a person was running down stairs and stumbling—I rushed out of bed, and secured the prisoner in the corner of the passage—I found my bed-room door open—it was moonlight—a knock cane to the door—I opened it—the constable was on the step, and I gave him in charge—I found the front parlour door open, and saw that somebody had been sick, and the rim of the prisoner's hat was covered with the same—I was the last person up that night.</p>

I slept in the second floor back room—I shut my room door when I went to bed—it is fastened by a common catch—between four and five o'clock in the morning I heard the door open—I coughed, and on that heard a person walk down stairs, remain there for a moment or two, and then come up again a little way—I jumped out of bed, cried out "Thieves," and slammed the door violently—in about two minutes I went down stairs, and found my brother had hold of the prisoner.</p>

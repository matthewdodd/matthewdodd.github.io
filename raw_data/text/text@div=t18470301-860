                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 72.) On the evening of 26th Feb. I was on duty in Blackfriars-road—I saw the two prisoners together, trying the pockets of several persons—at last they came to a gentleman—Haddon got hold of his right hand pocket and extracted this handkerchief from it—Bell was walking by Haddon's side to conceal him from persons passing—Bell saw me, and he ran down a street—Haddon ran into the road, and threw down this handkerchief—I took it up, and secured him—I do not know who the gentleman was.</p>

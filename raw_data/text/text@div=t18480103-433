                  </hi>. I am a carman in the employ of Mr. Dark, of Robert-street, Grosvenor-square. On a foggy Tuesday in Nov., about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was ordered to go with a covered van to No. 36, Grosvenor<lb></lb>stret—a lad went with me—he knocked at the door, it was opened—there were three men inside, the prisoner was one of them—some bedding, carpet<lb></lb>ing, and pictures, were brought out of the house—the prisoner assisted in bringing them out—the van was about ten minutes loading—when it was completely loaded, an apron was tied round behind—that would conceal what was inside—they all got in the van, two in front and two behind, and we drove to New Oxford-street—we stopped there and had some beer—the two in front, the little one and the prisoner, told me to stop there—the prisoner got out of the van there and brought some beet out of the public-house—he was close to me all the time I was driving the van—and when be brought the beer out I had an opportunity of seeing him—he then walked down Holborn a little way, and said to the lad who had fetched the van, "Give me my handkerchief out, and I will go and get my coat"—I went on with the van, and saw the prisoner again just by the City toll in Holborn—he paid the toll—we went on to a pulic-house opposite Aldgate Church, in the Minories—after calling for some beer, the prisoner and two of the men went away from the van up a lane by the side of the public-house, leaving the boy there—they all came back in about a quarter of an hour—we all went round Tenter-street, I believe, stopped at a house there, and Anderson and the two other men went in there—the boy remained outside—they all came out again in a few minutes, and directed me to go on and turn round the first turning to the left—I got to a gateway, and they told me to wait there a few minutes and they would come back directly—one of the men said, "You had better come up here"—I cannot say which one it was, they were all together—the gateway was not hight enough for the van to get up—the men went up the gateway and remained there about a quarter of an hour—while they were gone a police—sergeant and a policeman came and made some inquiry of me, and as I was talking to them two of the men came down the yard—I do not know whether the prisoner was one of them—as soon as they saw the policemen they ran back again—I saw no more of them—the policeman took the van and the goods to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brush-maker, and live at 3, Diamond-alley, Stepney-green. On Tuesday, 2nd Nov., I had occasion to call on a man named Ray, at 12, Tenter-street, Spitalfields, for a pair of boots, about seven o'clock, or a little before—it was a very foggy night—after I had been there some little time, I heard a vehicle at the door, and three men and a lad came into the house—the prisoner was one of them—they said, "We have got something here for you, and Fanny will be round presently to pay for them," or "fetch them," I cannot be sure which—they said there were ten or twelve feather beds—Ray's wife was there, and said she would not have them there for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they did not consent to have the things left there—I went out into the street, and the lad said to me in the hearing of the prisoner, "The b—won't have them, b—curses to his soul; we have had it all the way from Edgeware-road; we shall have to pay 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the carman for them"—I saw the van when I went outside the door—Ray went out for the purpose of going round to the woman they called Fanny, who lived in Petticoat-lane, not two minutes' walk from where the van was stopping—the van passed the house and went round Shepherd-street, down White's-row, and into Bell<lb></lb>alley, Spitalfields—I went and spoke to Sergeant Barker, and took him to the man.</p>

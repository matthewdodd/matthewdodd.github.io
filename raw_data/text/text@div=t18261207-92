On the 1st of December, between twelve and one o'clock, I was with a shipmate, and met the prisoner at Charing-cross with another girl - they stopped, and asked us for something to drink - my shipmate knew them both before he went to sea; it was too late to give them drink - we went home with them to <placeName id="t18261207-92-crimeloc545">Duck-lane, Westminster</placeName>

            . I am a watchman, and have known the prisoner by sight some time. On the 1st of December I was in Orchard-street, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor in company, at half-past twelve o'clock; I called the hour, and saw them go into No. 20, Duck-lane - the prosecutor came out soon after, and said he had lost his watch - he was quite sober.</p>

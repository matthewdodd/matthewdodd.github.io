               <p>I belong to the office in Poland-street, I produce this knife, which I had of the prisoner on the 17th of March, about two in the day; I searched him in the office, and took him from the pawnbroker's; I have kept the knife ever since.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I came in on the morning that the robbery was committed in the garden, and walking backwards and forwards for some employment, I had been out of place; I found the things between a watch-box and a stand, it was covered with straw, it was this property; I took it to the pawnbroker's, and asked half a guinea for it in pawn.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was a servant of mine, he lived with me about a month, he came out of the country, and while he lived with me he was very honest, but I believe distress and hunger has drove him to this; he left me two months before this happened in a hurry, one morning his father sent up things to market; I owed him a little money, and he asked for his wages when he went away; he assigned no reason for leaving me; I have entrusted him with money at different times.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When did you see these spoons before? - The morning before they were taken, they were used in common; when we get up in a morning this flap door is left open; I do not know whether it was taken before I went out or after; it is a thoroughfare for twenty different people.</p>

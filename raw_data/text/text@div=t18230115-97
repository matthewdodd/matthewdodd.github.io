On the 20th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw my poultry safe in the hen-house, which is fenced in by an hedge, and ditch. Next morning, about seven o'clock, I missed all of them - there were eight geese and thirteen fowls. I found them at Whitechapel Office, on Monday, the 23d, and am positive they are mine. I do not know the prisoners.</p>

            . I am the night beadle of Whitechapel. On Saturday morning, the 21st, about a quarter past six o'clock, I went down Whitechapel-road, and about four hundred yards behind the church, by a bell founder's, I saw a hay cart standing there - Law was walking up and down by it. The cart moved on a few yards at a time. I watched him for half an hour, suspecting he had something in the cart - I waited till he got to the church, and then asked what he had in the cart; he said a sack, but he did not know what was in it - I asked how he came by it; he said he took it up from two men, near the Green Man, public-house, at Laytonstone, who asked him to give them a lift - that one of them wore a smock frock, and the other was a short one. I then told Avis to give me the sack down; I found it contained eight geese, and thirteen fowls, quite warm; they had just been killed. I took Law to the watch-house with them, and sent his hay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150040"></xptr>to the salesman, and then went into Black Lion-yard, public-house, opposite to where I first saw the cart, and in the tap-room there, I found Webb in bed with a woman - I desired him to dress, and told him I wanted him about some fowls; he denied all knowledge of them. I took him to the watch-house, and placed him with six or eight others - then let Law in, and asked if he saw anybody like the men who gave him the poultry - he pointed Webb out as one, and said he believed another young man was the other, but he could not be certain. Webb denied it. The name of</p>
               <p>"Barrell, North Wheel," was on the cart; it would not pass within two miles of Barking side to come to town. The waggon road is more than two miles.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was with Plunkett - his account is correct. I saw Webb with the cart, about a quarter past six o'clock; he came round the horse's head, and went to the cart tail - he then went to a salop woman, and had a bason, and then went up Black Lion-yard. This was before Plunkett came up. I knew Webb before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I stood on the opposite side of the way, when the cart came up to the bell-founder's, about ten minutes past six o'clock, a man was riding on the hay; Law handed the sack down to a man, but he walked away without it; he then laid it on the cart again, moved on a few yards, then got up and moved the sack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man saw you and walked off - A. I think he did; I am well known there.</p>
               <p>LAW'S Defence. As I came along the road, two men asked me to put the sack in my cart. Webb said, they would give me a shilling, and a pot of beer, when I got to town. When I got near the church; he said,</p>
               <p>"Stop we will have the parcel down here." I got up to give it him down; he said,</p>
               <p>"Stop till my mate comes, he is gone up stairs, I will go and see where he is"; he run away, and never came back; I put the sack on again, got down and walked round the cart to look for him, and after waiting till I was tired, I went on and was stopped.</p>

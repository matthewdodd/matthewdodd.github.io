               <p>On Wednesday the 22d of August, I had some business at the Bull's-Head, West Smithfield, myself and three others; going along Long-lane, we met the prisoner; she said she was very much distressed and ill; the prisoner followed us to the Bull-head, and in the tap-room she solicited me very much to give her something to drink, and I gave her two penny-worth of rum; she said she could drink nothing but rum; my company left me, and said nothing to me; on my return home, I found the prisoner followed me, and in Jewin-street, she mended her pace; when I came to the end of <placeName id="t17860830-91-crimeloc454">Nettleton-court</placeName>

               <p>Court. Were the men there at the time? - They were in the dark part of the passage, and I went to the end of the court.</p>
               <p>Did you feel your watch go? - I did my Lord.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A silver watch, with a silk ribbon, with a cornelian seal mounted in gold; I made a catch at her, and was immediately attacked by the men, and they beat me from my hips to my head; in the dark entry, there was a ladder, which I got under, and with much difficulty I got up, and saw the patrol, and cried stop that woman, she has robbed me of my watch; and he immediately stopped her.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of the woman at all? - I did for a minute.</p>
               <p>Now the woman that robbed you, was the same woman you saw at the Bull's-head? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>When you was pushed in the court, where was the woman? - Behind me.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - No, it was a very dark night, but I could see the silver case of my watch as she drew it out of my pocket; I could see her gown perfectly clear, the same as she had on when at the Bull-head; it was a dark cotton, and a dark ground.</p>
               <p>What sort of a cloak? - I think a black silk cloak.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it to be the same woman that you saw before? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she speak to you when you was in the court? - No, they immediately committed their depredations.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not the prosecutor in liquor? - I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Did not you acknowledge yourself in liquor before the Lord Mayor? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol of Aldersgate-ward; on the 2d of August, at past two, I heard the cry of stop thief, at the end of Nettleton-court; the prisoner came running out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300134"></xptr> the court; I laid hold of her by the arm, and the prosecutor said he was robbed of a silver watch, and a silk ribbon, and cornelian seal; he was very much cut in the face, just under one eye, and across his chin; I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and took the watch out of her pocket, which the prosecutor claimed: the prisoner said she did not know what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to ask the patrol if the prosecutor was not very much in liquor? - I believe him not to be perfectly sober; but I believe him to be perfectly capable of knowing what he did.</p>

On 27th Feb., about twelve o'clock in the day, I was in my bar parlour and saw the prisoner standing at the bar—Mrs. Compton was serving—the bar is divided off into two departments, a bottle department and a public department—they are divided by a partition from the wall to the counter—there are separate doors of entrance to each department—there is a smaller door to one, and a larger door to the other—the prisoner was in the small department, the bottle department—I heard him ask for a glass of wine and a cigar—he paid for it with a shilling—I heard him ask for something—I got up directly, and said to him, "What is it you want?"—he said, "Will you oblige me with change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note?"—I said, "Certainly;" and he laid a note on the counter—took it up, looked at it, and said, "Not for this; this is a bad one;" and I said to a man named Wheeler, "Shut the door;" he did so—the prisoner said, "It is of no consequence; I know where I took it"—I told Wheeler to keep the door closed till I came back—I then went out at the other door, and went to the station in Molyneux-street for a policeman—I took the note with me—I saw Beck, gave him the note, and told him to come back with me—he went in at the other door,, and I went to the door that was fastened—I knocked at it, and Wheeler let me in—I went in, and the prisoner said, "You will suffer for this"—Beck then came in with the note io his hand, and said to the prisoner, "Where did you get this note from?"—I asked him myself where he took it from, and he said, "I took it from Mr. Ellison, of Spring-gardens"—he hesitated a minute or two, and then said, "Charing-cross"—then Beck came round and asked him again, and he said, "I took it from Mr. Ellison, 6, Spring-gardens, Charing-cross," mentioning the number—I then said, "That is the name that is marked on the back of the note"—</p>

               <p>this is the note—I know it by this writing, and also by the name of "Clutton, Bristol," on it—Beck asked the prisoner where he came from; if he had tra<lb></lb>velled by the railway, as he bad a bag with him, and he said, "I came by the railway from Birmingham;" giving us to understand that he had come from Birmingham that morning by the railway, and a minute or two after<lb></lb>wards he said it was eleven years since he was at Birmingham—I cannot exactly say what he said that gave me to understand he had come that morn<lb></lb>ing from Birmingham by the railway—Beck said, "By rail?"—he said, "Yes"—I should say he gave me to understand it by his bag—he named Birmingham—he had a small bag with him, and an overcoat on, what is called a sack, and a thickish scarf round his neck—I did not notice his under coat—he did not undo his overcoat while at my place—Beck took him to the station.</p>

            . (City Policeman No. 59) I was passing Holborn at a quarter after nine o'clock - I saw the prisoner and two others behind the prosecutor; the prisoner was the foremost - as I passed he drew the handkerchief, and threw it into the road - I took it up, and took him from the prosecutor - the other two were behind the prisoner when he took it; he threw it behind him, but it missed the boy's hand he intended it for, and fell into the road - I am not mistaken in his person; I had noticed them before they took it.</p>
               <p>CHARLES LANKINHORN. I am a shoemaker, and live on Saffron-hill. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office - I was present at the trial of the prisoner and Murray; I know him.</p>

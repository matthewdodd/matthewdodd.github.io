            . I live servant with Mr. Haynes. On the 6th of April I went to bed very ill; I left the key in the door for my fellow servant to come up to bed; when she came up to bed she awaked me, and said she found all my things gone; I missed my gown that I pulled off when I went to bed, two caps, two handkerchiefs, a shift, a pair of stockings, and a pair of pockets.</p>

             Q. The last witness lived servant with you. - A. Yes. On the night of the 6th of April I found the servant had lost a great many articles of wearing apparel; on the next morning I endeavoured to find the prisoner. From the situation of the chamber I was certain that none but those who knew the house could have gone into the room and taken the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prisoner at the bar to have known the way of your house so well. - A. She has lived <rs id="t18070513-49-deflabel300" type="occupation">servant</rs>

The things were missing on the Monday evening; it was Thursday before I found her and then I took her before Mr. Alderman Hankey; I found nothing on her person nor in her lodgings; the officers and I searched her box and found nothing. I told her I would forgive her if she would let the girl have her things.</p>
               <p>Q. That is very wrong, now, I cannot hear any more what she said. - A. I applied to the person that she had lived with, and through the means of that person she was taken into custody at the next door to Worship-street office. where she had gone to live servant. This was a week or ten days afterwards; the officers searched her box, and found the things laid in the indictment in my presence.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I went to the public house next door to Worship-street office, with Winder and Prince, on Tuesday the 14th of April; the prisoner was a servant there, she had been there about three days. I searched her box; she gave me the key and went up stairs with me. I found these things.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix). On the night you lost your things did you see the prisoner at the house. - A. No. I went to bed between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Haynes). Had you seen the prisoner that night, or at any time previous in the day at your house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live. - A. In Shire-lane. I keep an eating-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course your house is open all day. - A. Yes, till ten o'clock. I went out a little after ten; one of the lodgers very imprudently left the door open then.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the pit of the New Strand Theatre on the 30th of June—I had a snuff-box and cigar ease—I felt a slight tug at my pocket—I placed my hand in it and missed the property—I spoke to a friend—the prisoner was sitting immediately behind me, and asked if I had lost any thing—I told him I had—he said, "Indeed, I lost a handkerchief myself some time ago, and now I carry mine in my hat" I went to the lobby to get an officer, and we met the prisoner going out—I desired the officer to take him and search him—he produced these things, and said he picked them up—I stated that I had a strong suspicion that he was the person who had robbed me, and if he was an honest man he would have no objection to be searched; when he kept back and objected to the officer searching him, I insisted on it, and then he produced the things, <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

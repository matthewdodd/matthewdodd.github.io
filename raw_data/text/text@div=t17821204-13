She said her master had given her a shilling, and she would have a pint of gin, I said, less would do, she sent for some gin, and they drank it at the door, my washerwoman knew her face; then the maid and the prisoner went towards the Adelphi Buildings, and when she came opposite Fleet Market, she bade her go on as she was going to market: when the maid came back, I missed the things.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to the last witness, I went with the prisoner to fetch the linen from No. 9, John-street, Adelphi Buildings, and as we went she stopped on Ludgate-hill, and asked me for a pin, I gave her one, and she bid me stand before her, and I turned my head round, and she was pinning up something, but I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was she pinning it? - Under her coats. We went a little further, and she stopped at the top of the Fleet market, and said she must go the Poulterer's for a fowl, and go to the Grocer's for some tea and sugar; and she bid me make the best of my way to the house for the bundle of linen: when I came to John-street, there was no such name or person: when I came back I told my mistress, and she missed the things directly: two shirts and a gown; they were never got again. I heard the prisoner own to the gown the night she was taken up, which was three weeks after: I never saw her before, but I am sure she is the same person.</p>
               <p>Court. What did she say when she owned to the gown? - She said young woman do not make yourself uneasy, you shall have the gown; and I said, and the shirts too, I did not hear her answer to that.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, would you ask this witness any questions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes my Lord, a great many. This woman I am sure has perjured herself, in regard to her saying I acknowledged the gown at the time I was apprehended on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Court. What shall I ask her about your acknowledging the gown?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her where and when.</p>
               <p>Cope. At the same house in Turnmill-street that the constable took us to: the constable was present and heard her say it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her who was present besides? - There was my mistress's nephew, but he did not hear it, and the washerwoman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. From the first of it to this instant moment, I declare I know nothing of it.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>To answer any question, or demand any question, to a set of people like him who now stands before your Lordship, is in vain; I am at present at your bar friendless, and to a man who gets his money entirely by disposing of the lives of people that come before your Lordship, what have I to say? Redgrave came into my apartment, I had a bad leg, and was making a bandage for it; he was in company with two women; he said, You are my prisoner for robbing the laundress; I said, I knew nothing of it; they never proposed to me neither where did you pledge such things, or had you such things, but you are the person, and they took me to Clerkenwell; on the ensuing day I was had for examination, and this woman, in company with another, which I ordered out of Court, both swore to my being the person by a mark of a man of war on my arm, which arm I am at present ready to expose to the Court: they told me after the second hearing, if I would only acknowledge where the things were, they would forgive me; and the prosecutrix has been with me twice, and sent her nephew; I am entirely innocent, I have nothing marked on my arm but Jesus, Holy Saviour: I am a Roman by profession, or at least of the Church of Rome. I have no money to pay people to go for witnesses, and I trust this is not a land for oppression.</p>

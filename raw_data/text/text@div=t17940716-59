I hired the prisoner at the bar about August last, in the beginning; she had lived in my service twice before; I had missed a variety of silk handkerchiefs and shirts of mine, and a servant of mine that had lived with me a vast number of years, he informed me that he believed the prisoner was the thief; and it was determined that the prisoner should quit my service, in consequence of property that I had missed. On Friday, the 4th of July, I went out in the afternoon, and did not come home very early, it might be between twelve and one o'clock; when I came home I found that she had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160104"></xptr>endeavouring to get away, in my absence; when I came home I found the prisoner up in a room, and I asked her to let me examine her box; this she refused to do; on which I called up one of the other servants, and I asked him to give me the poker into the room; she still persisted, and I broke open the box with the poker; when I had so broke it open, I desired her to let me see what was there; and after she had taken out several things, there were several sheets of paper appeared at the bottom of the box, white fools cap paper, and letter paper; I happened to have a cane in my hand, and I put it down on the paper, and I found it gave way, on which I desired her to take off the paper, which she did, and then I came to a parchment deed, which she had pushed down, round against the sides of the box; I said, I don't believe this is the bottom of the box; on which I put down my hand, and found all these things at the bottom, which I now produce, four silk handkerchiefs, a cotton window curtain, and a linen table cloth; they are my property, the handkerchief was marked W. B. she picked out the B. but it is plain to be seen; the window curtain I know the pattern, I have five or six of them; the table cloth was marked with my name on it, the W is picked out, but it plain to be seen. I called in the watchman, and she was carried to Tothill fields.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. How many curtains had you of that sort? - Seven, I have only three left; we found the fringe of the rest at the prisoner's father's house in Ryegate.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the other servant you spoke of just now, a man servant or a maid servant? - A man-servant, he is not here.</p>

               <p>I was present when the box was broke open; I saw these things taken out of the box, to the best of my belief, they are all my property; as to the curtains I have not the least doubt.</p>

               <p>When the prisoner at the bar was brought to the watch-house, in St. Margaret's Church-yard, about two o'clock Saturday morning, the 5th of this month, by the watchman, attended by Mr. Bryan; Mr. Bryan made a charge of felony against her; at the same time the watchman delivered a key to me; I have not the key now. These things were under lock and key that night, and I went the next morning, unlocked the place, and found this property; I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the watchman; Mr. Bryan called me between the hours of one and two o'clock in the morning, on Saturday the 5th last, I went to him and asked him what was the matter? he said, he had a servant that had robbed him. I went into Mr. Bryan's house, and went up stairs with him, and he shewed me some handkerchiefs, which I believe these are the same, that he said he had taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at that time? - No, she was up stairs above at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you any thing besides? - Not at that present time.</p>

            Did he at any other time? -  Not that night, but he did when the box was opened, and the things were found; that was about eleven o'clock Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know nothing of any other articles till the next morning eleven o'clock? - The over night he locked them up, and gave me the key, and told me there were other things; but I did not see them that night,</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160105"></xptr>Court to Bryan. What time was it you took these things of the woman? - On the 4th of July, between one and two o'clock, between Friday and Saturday. The boxes that the watchman spoke to, were three other boxes, which were not examined that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it all to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Court to Bryan. Had you any character with her? - Yes, I had, of a gentleman, in the Borough, that she had lived with, and she had lived with me twice before, and I always considered her as a very good servant.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the key of the box found in her pocket? - She would not deliver it up, she had it in her pocket; the key I gave to the watchman was the key of the cupboard, where I locked up the things that night.</p>

The prisoner took a lodging in my house on the 17th of July; she had the first-floor back room, furnished, at 4 s. a week. She left on the 31st of July. She owed me a fortnight's rent, and left the door padlocked. I got in at the window two days after, and found these things gone, and a duplicate of a sheet and blanket on the shelf. I met her on the Tuesday following in North Audley-street, and said,</p>
               <p>"Aynt you a pretty creature to pawn my things; I have a great mind to charge the watch with you;" she said,</p>
               <p>"No, pray, don't be so cruel as that; I will call on Friday or Saturday and pay you." I let her go. She did not come, and on Saturday night we found her in Duke-street, and gave her in charge.</p>

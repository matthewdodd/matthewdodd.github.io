            . I am a watchman. On the 28th of September I was going my round, between four and five in the morning, I saw two men come out of a mews, with bundles under their arms. It was in the Edgware-road. I called after them, what have you got there. They made no answer, but went on quicker. One took through Tyburn turnpike, the other took the Bayswater road. I followed the prisoner, and called out, stop thief. The prisoner dropped a bundle. I did not stop to pick it up. I ordered another watchman to pick it up. The prisoner found I was getting ground of him; he took to Hyde park wall: he jumped over the wall. I followed him over the wall. I saw the prisoner running towards Pimlico. I then called out, stop thief. A young man stopped him, and then I took charge of him, and brought him to Marybone watchhouse. I never lost sight of the prisoner.</p>

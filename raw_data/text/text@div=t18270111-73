            . I live with Mr. Gilbert.

I went again, and she gave me a duplicate of a table-spoon; she offered me another of a spoon and a gown of Isabella Kirk's, and said she would give me that, if I would promise to give her the gown which Kirk had got on; but I could not promise that; she said Kirk had left them with her, saying she had left her place and taken no wages, and that her brother Thomas had given her these things, to make a little money of.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden.

               <p>KIRK'S Defence. I took the things from my master's, I asked Driscoll to pawn them and make me a little money, and to keep the duplicates for me - she did not know they were stolen.</p>
               <p>DRISCOLL'S Defence. I am quite innocent of any guilty knowledge - she came to me in distress, and asked me to pawn them for her - Wild asked if Kirk was at my house, not whether I knew her.</p>

I do not recollect that he did; but I am quite sure she denied knowing her, and took her oath to it several times - I went to her by the desire of Mr. Roberts - I found her at her house, No. 3, School-house-yard - I said, "Do you know such a person as

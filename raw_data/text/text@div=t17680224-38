               <p>Q. What part of the shop was the bacon taken from?</p>
               <p>English. It was taken from the window; it was pretty near 200 yards from my shop door where I took the prisoner with it.</p>

               <p>Coming through Wapping, as I was going to see my aunt, I heard stop thief cried; three fellows ran by and dropped this bacon in the kennel; I made a full stop, and this man came and charged me with stealing his property; I made no resistance, but was very willing to go where he chose to carry me.</p>

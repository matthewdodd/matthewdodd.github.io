            . I am a wheelwright, and live at Chelsea. On Thursday, the 8th of June, the prisoner came to my shop with the dashing-iron of a chaise. I first saw him on that day in a yard in Duck-lane; a man called me in, and I found the prisoner in the yard. I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140032"></xptr>a pair of wheels of the man - he said there were more wheels to be sold; that they belonged to the prisoner (who did not deny it). I asked the price; the prisoner said, 2 l. 10 s. for the axletree and wheels. I offered 2 l. - he said I should have them, and offered to sell me some springs and other things for 30 s. I paid him 5 s. in part. We each agreed to give a man 2 s. 6 d. to take them home, and soon after five o'clock they were brought. He came to the Cross Keys, public-house, and I paid him the rest. The splinter-bar was missing; he said it must have dropped out of the cart. The prosecutor saw and claimed all I bought of him - he said it was his own.</p>

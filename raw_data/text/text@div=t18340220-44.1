I live in the neighbourhood of Aldermarston, at Padworth, about a mile and a half from there - on Tuesday, the 7th of January, I was at the Butt public-house, in our parish, about a mile and a half from Hickman's farm, and saw Chamberlain there - I did not know him before - he came there in the morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I think, and he stayed there till a little before ten at night - he said he was going to see his mother-that his name was Chamberlain - I and he came out of the public-house together, about ten minutes before ten at night, and we parted directly - he went towards Aldermarston, and I went towards home - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. Never; we were together for several hours in the public-house - there were other persons there - he made no secret of his name.</p>

            . I am a carman, and live in Harford-place, Fitzroy-square - I have known Chamberlain between two and three years - I always knew him by the name of David, which is his Christian name - I never knew his surname - he rented a stable near to me last January - I saw him on the 8th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening- he had a black cart mare - I did not notice whether he was on the mare, or on foot - I saw him put her into his own stable; in about ten minutes afterwards, I was going up the place, and went into the stable, and asked if he had got an old soldier there - he said, "Yes" -</p>
               <p>"- I found the mare there - I looked into her mouth and said, "She is not a very old soldier - she is not yet three years old," and said he had given her a rare bucking, he must have come a long way - he said he had come upwards of thirty miles that day- the mare looked very much distressed, as if it had come a long journey - there was a sack and collar there, and a cart bridle - next morning I lent him a broom to clean her with, and saw him in the stable cleaning her - on the Friday night, about half-past twelve o'clock, I heard a noise which induced me to get up - I looked out of the window, and saw Chamberlain and two other men with the mare under my place - they took it under the gas light, to look at her in front of my window - I paid no attention to what passed, but went to bed again - I saw Chamberlain on Saturday morning in the stable, Cherry and a man named Hawkins were with him - the tail of the mare was about an inch shorter than when I first saw her - she had been cleaned, and the tail was tied up with straw, as if going to be sold - Chamberlain and Cherry both said they were going to sell her - I saw them take her out of the stable - Cherry led her out into Harford-street, and then mounted and rode her away - Chamberlain was with him - I was examined before the Justice on the business, and was shown a mare in the stable of Emmet, a cow-keeper, on the 17th of January - it was the same mare as I had seen in possession of Chamberlain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not you seen Chamberlain work the mare for two or three days? A. I saw her in a coke cart one morning - Chamberlain has been in the habit of hawking coke about the streets - I have seen him with several different horses - I saw the mare in the cart on the Friday morning, working in the streets - I only saw her that once.</p>

I am the wife of Franks, a carpenter, of Oxford-market; he has a stable and yard in Nutsford-place, and works two horses in a saw-mill there - Cherry formerly lived with my husband as carman - on Saturday, the 11th of January, I went into the City, and returned home between twelve and one o'clock in the day, and found Cherry and Chamberlain in our stable-yard; they had got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200032"></xptr>a horse tied up in the yard; Cherry asked me if I wanted to buy it; it was a black mare; I afterwards saw the same mare before the Justice; I told Cherry I did not want it; that we were not very busy now - he said, "I understand you have sold one on the Thursday;" I said I did not want one now; he said it was a young one; and then Chamberlain came out, and began to whip the mare about, to show her off - I told him I did not think it would suit me at all, it looked in very bad condition - Cherry said it would suit very well, if I would buy it - they left without my coming to any bargain; I was not at the stable afterwards, but I believe the mare went away; Cherry came up to me in the evening, and told me that Chamberlain must sell the mare, for he had laid out all the money he had in change for this horse, which money he ought to have had to buy coke with; he had asked 14l. for it in the morning; he then said Chamberlain would take 8l. for it; he fetched Chamberlain to me, and Chamberlain brought up the horse, and asked then 11l. for it; I at last bought it for 8l.; I paid 5l., and the other was to be paid in a fortnight or three weeks, if the horse suited; Cherry told me the horse had been chopped away at Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. While Cherry was in your employ did he not bear a good character? A. Very good; he lived six years in a situation, after leaving us.</p>

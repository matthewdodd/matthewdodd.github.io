                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Edward Sherman, he is master of the Bull-and-Mouth, Regent-circus. On the 29th of May the prisoner came to the booking-office—he presented this order, and asked for a basket, addressed to Mr. Blandford, of Dover-street, Piccadilly—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Bull-and-Mouth coach-office, Regent-circus,—Please to send by the bearer a basket, that came by the Devonport and Exeter coach, this day, for J. Blandford, 20, Piccadilly—<hi rend="smallCaps">J. SMITH</hi>. 29th June."—I did not notice the date, but I took the order, and gave it to Mr. Sanders—there was a hamper on a box in the office, directed to Mr. Blandford, which had come by the Devonport and Exeter coach that morning—it was pointed out by a porter in the office—the prisoner took it, put it on his shoulder, and walked out of the office with it—two days afterwards I was in Oxford-street, in a cart, and saw the prisoner—I drew up immediately, and laid hold of him—the parcel was directed to No. 30, Dover-street, Piccadilly—Mr. Blandford is a surgeon, I believe—he always used to send for his parcels, and there was no complaint of their not being delivered—he never sent orders before, but this being a fresh person, we thought that was the reason—we knew the person who came before—we did not know How the name of Smith came on this order—we thought it was some assistant or something.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 20, Dover-street, Piccadilly. I have had a basket by the Devonport Subscription-coach, for the last three years, containing butter, meat, and vegetables—my servant was in the habit of fetching it till about five weeks before this, when I told the people to send it by the porter—this order I did not write nor send, nor did I authorise any person to take the basket away—it generally came on a Wednesday.</p>

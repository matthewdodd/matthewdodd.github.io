On Saturday, the 11th of September, the prisoner came to the shop with an interpreter, and desired to see some spoons and forks, and two gold watches; he said he would not decide on them; I saw him again on Monday with a fresh interpreter, when he desired to see the spoons and forks he had seen on Saturday; he fixed on them, and desired to see some plated goods, saying he was going to housekeeping, and could not afford silver. He ordered a sugar-bason, milk-pot, and a gold watch, chain, seal, and key, in all they came to 54 l. He then asked to see some gold watches, and I produced the two he had seen; he said he did not understand watches, but if I would send them to his lodgings, No. 6, Frith-street, he had a friend there, and he would determine which he would take. I took them myself in about an hour, and saw him with the interpreter; I put them on the table. He asked, through the interpreter, if I would allow him to take the watches to a friend in the next room? I said,</p>
               <p>"Certainly," and gave them to him. As soon as he left the room the interpreter asked me if I knew him? I said No - he never returned. I inquired, and found he had escaped out of the house; I did not see him again until the 2d of December, when I apprehended him at Bath. I found one watch in pledge at Bath, and saw the other at Bow-street; I should not have parted with them without the money. He had ordered the spoons and forks to be engraved.</p>

On Friday, the 13th of November, very near three o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in my pantry. I saw the prisoner go up a flight of wooden steps, which led from the area to the back yard. He had something wrapped up in his great coat, which was under his arm. It gave me a suspicion that he was doing something wrong. I immediately followed him across the yard, into Dean-street; there I stopped the prisoner, and found upon him one of these pieces of lead, which is here in court. I brought him back, and kept charge of him, until the return of the master, who was from home at the time, until Sir Joseph returned, to take his advice what to do in the business. He told me to get a constable, and take him up for the public good.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in custody, and took him before the magistrate. This is the lead the prisoner stole. This had been cut off, and this piece was found in Sir Joseph Banks's house; it fitted as nigh as could be. There is forty pounds missing. It is a leaden cistern.</p>

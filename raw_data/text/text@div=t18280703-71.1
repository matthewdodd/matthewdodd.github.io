            . I am a watchman. I heard the prosecutor cry Watch! I went up to the place, and found him and the prisoner in a row with some other persons; he gave charge of her for robbing him of 7s. 6d. - she denied it; she had dropped 1s. before I came up - it was given me to take to the watch-house, and in going along she dropped another shilling from her person - she stooped took it up; I took it from her hand.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that her husband had occasion to step aside for a short time, when the prosecutor, who had passed her with two girls, returned, and accosted her as a prostitute - he continued to follow her, and she could not get rid of him till near the watch-house, when he charged her with robbing him.</p>

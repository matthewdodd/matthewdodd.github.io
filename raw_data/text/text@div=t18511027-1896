               <p>and they were talking together as to what the lady could say, if she was brought before the Magistrate—she had not then been examined—Jones said to me, "If you get the lady, what can she say?" I made no reply; and he said, "If you get her, she can't say how she lost it; the arm is too quick for the eye"—I did not speak to him at all, either before or after that.</p>

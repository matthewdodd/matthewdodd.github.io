                  </hi>. I am in the family of Mr. Wallop, of 23, Rutland-buildings, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. On Thursday night 20th July, about half-past ten o'clock, I went round, and saw the house all secure—I was disturbed a little before one—I heard a great shaking in the hall by the kitchen-door, and the alarm bell sounded muffled—I called Eliza, thinking it might be her—I then laid quite quiet, and three men came up stairs, and came altogether into my room—one came close to my bedside, right round the bed, another stood at the foot of the bed, and the other at the door, but I could not perceive, for I did not rise up—I know Hawkins from staring at him—I could perceive him very well for some time, looking round the room, they said it was all right, and went out—they were not aware that I was awake—they did not look much at me—I swear to Hawkins, but not to the others—Wilson had been in Mr. Wallop's service as page, and left last Christmas—some of them went up stairs, and one went down stairs, and there was a terrible noise up stairs, and shaking of doors—I got out of bed, but could not open the door—I moved the drawers and a table, put them against the door, and then opened the window, and began crying, "Police!" for about five minutes—they all came rushing down, and I kept on at it, and presently a soldier passed, and asked me whether I was mad—I said, "I suppose I am, for I have had three fellows get into my room"—he went and got a policeman—the policeman came, and we went up stairs, and found Mr. Wallop's cash-box that should have been in the top drawer, on the stairs, and Miss Wallop's jewel-case on the ground, and all the jeweiery about the floor, by the bedpost in Miss Wallop's bed-room—the family were out of town, except me and the cook, named Eliza, who was sleeping up stairs in the attic, two stories above me—I was on the first-floor—the things were lying about, as if the place had been rummaged—Mr. Wallop's drawers had been broken open where the cash-box was, it was a patent lock—I went up to Eliza, and found her asleep—I then went down stairs—the kitchen window was open, and the flower-pots removed from the inside to the outside, on the area steps—one flower-pot was kicked down on the inside cill, and the back door, that leads into the garden, was wide open, so that some one must have come in at the kitchen window, and opened the back door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Wallop. On the Sunday before the robbery, Hawkins called, and wished to see the page—I said he had gone to Church, but he would be home when Church was over, and be at home all day, if he liked to call again—he said he did not know that he could—I said if he did not call before next Sunday he would not see him, for he was going into the country with Mr. Wallop on the Tuesday—I had never seen Hawkins before—I asked if he would call again—he said he thought he would, but would I tell the boy when he came borne that John Hawkins called to see him—I observed his shoes—I was awoke on the night of the robbery, I came down into the kitchen, got a light, and saw the kitchen window open, and I found these shoes, which I believe are the shoes Hawkins had on on the Sunday—they resemble them—I had noticed his feet when he called before—I should not have noticed them so much, but he was so shabbily dressed, except the shoes, and he stood in so careless a manner, not knowing what to say, that I noticed his shoes particularly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector, B</hi>). On Friday, 21st July, I ex<lb></lb>amined the house, 23, Rutland-gate—inside the kitchen-window of the area I found a flower-pot broken—two of the iron bars were about 6 1/2 inches apart, from which I conclude that a small person must have got in that way—a person of Wilson or Hugginson's size could have got in there very well, I think Hawkins could not—there was no appearance of breaking in, in any other direction—in consequence of information on Monday 24th I went to the Hampstead-road with two constables and a man named Price, and whilst watching the house, 4, James-street, Camden-town, where Hug<lb></lb>ginson lived, I saw Hawkins walk along the road opposite the Mother Red Cap—I followed him three quarters of a mile, and into a brick field, and when he saw me following him he immediately turned quickly round a brick kiln and was out of my sight about two minutes—I went sharply up and said to him, "I want you, Hawkins"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For a bur<lb></lb>glary at Knightsbridge"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—while search<lb></lb>ing he turned round, and I observed Price pick up four bracelets and a buckle from beside the brickkiln where Hawkins had gone—he had these shoes on</p>

                  </hi>. I saw Inspector Cummings and Chinn pass the brick<lb></lb>kiln—before that I saw Hawkins go up and stoop down as though he were searching for something—he took something from his pocket and placed it there, and I saw him place the pipe on the top of the fresh earth—I saw him disturb the earth—I was not twenty yards off, and saw him clearly—I saw him put something into the earth as if he was hiding it there—I saw Price</p>

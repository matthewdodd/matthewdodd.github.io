As I returned I met Smith again, and took his bundle from him, it was wet - He said he was going to get it mangled; as we were going on with him we met Spyers, without his bundle, and took him; he had a bundle of dry linen when we first met him. We went down to a boat, and found a quantity of other linen.</p>

I saw the bundle taken from Smith-the water was dropping from it-it was dirty; he said he found it in a hedge in the New Cut - He afterwards said he was going to take it to the mangler's. They denied knowing each other several times, and afterwards said they were going together to see who the things belonged to. I found another bundle of linen in the boat.

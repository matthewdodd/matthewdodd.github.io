                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of Addison-row, Ken<lb></lb>sington. I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1834—in 1844 he called on me at my residence, Ryder-street, St. James's, and I lent him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see him again till June last year, when he came to my offices, 3, Parlia<lb></lb>ment-street and said he was in very great distress, and was endeavouring to effect the sale of some property he was possessed of at Wakefield through his solicitor there, and until that was done he had no means of living, and for the last two days he had had nothing to eat, and if I would give him a few shillings he would pay me when he had his remittance from Mr. Westmore-land at Wakefield, and he would pay me what he owed me—on 17th June, a few days afterwards, he called again, and said Mr. Westmoreland had sent him a bill in part payment, and it was of no use to him as be had no credit anywhere; and if I would advance him a few pounds it would be of great service to him—he handed me a bill, and put his address on it, "5, Berwick-street, Oxford-street"—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he asked for, and he gave me a memorandum, putting down the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the following day he came again, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 13th July another 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 30th July another 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he afterwards called, and said he was going down to Wakefield and wanted money, and I gave him a check for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the bill came to maturity I sent it to my bankers, and in due time it came back to me—I wrote to the prisoner and to the drawer, to Norton the ac<lb></lb>ceptor, and the endorser—the letter to the drawer, Wilson, was returned through the Dead-letter office—at the time he passed the bill, the prisoner said Naylor and Co. were respectable manufacturers at Wakefield—I knew the name connected with Wakefield—the prisoner put the endorsement "John Staples" on it at my request—it is his writing—I sent my clerk to the address on the back of the bill, but heard nothing.</p>

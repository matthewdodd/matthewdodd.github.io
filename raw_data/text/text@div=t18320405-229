            . I am shopman to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Brick-lane. At a quarter-past seven o'clock on the evening of Wednesday, the 14th of March, Thompson came to our shop, offered this shawl, and wanted 10s. on it; I asked whose it was - she said Mrs. Smith's, No. 3, over the way; I said there was no such number there - she then said down King-street, No. 3, or No. 9; I put the shawl under the counter, sent: for the Policeman, and gave her in charge - this is it; Blumson came to our house, and said, "Have you not sent a woman to the station-house?" I said Yes; he said, "I bought the shawl about two years ago;" I said, "The pattern has not been up so long;" he then said it was eighteen months ago, and he bought it of a man at his door - he then asked me the value of it; I said about 2l. 10s. - he said,"That is what I gave for it."</p>

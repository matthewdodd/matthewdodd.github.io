                  </hi>I live next door to Mr. Bean, at Ponder's-end, in the parish of Enfield. On the morning of the 1st of January I observed somebody in Mr. Bean's house, soon after ten o'clock—I saw the back<lb></lb>door open, and knowing they were both gone to their work, I called four or five times, "Mrs. Bean's—I received no answer, but the door was then quite closed by somebody inside—I continued to watch, and got up on a fence, looked through the kitchen window, and saw a boy inside the house—I sent my little boy to fetch a neighbour—I saw the prisoner come out of the back-door and climb over the fence—I am sure he is the boy—when I first saw him through the window I was about a yard from the window, close by him.</p>

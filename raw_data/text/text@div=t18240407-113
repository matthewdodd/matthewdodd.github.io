            . I am a carpenter, and live in Tottenham Court-road. Last Saturday week I observed that the pin of the window was out, and on Monday, when the prisoner came I asked if he had taken it out; he said,</p>
               <p>"I recollect that I took it out after you put it in, because I thought the shutter was not closed, and I forgot to put it in again." I left work about seven o'clock on Monday; it was dark; he agreed to go meet me at the Plough, public-house, in Carey-street, to drink. He said he was going to his brother's in Cavendish-square; he owed me 5 s. 4 d., and asked if I would have 5 s.; I said No; he put 4 s. into my hand, and said it was to get something to drink - we went about two hundred yards down Tottenham Court-road; he turned to the right as if to go to Cavendish-square, and I returned to the house - I had the key of the shop door. I went in, and sat by the fire, and in about half an hour heard somebody come to the door - I went on the stairs opposite the street door; the door was unlocked; it was locked before; I heard the lock go. The prisoner came in, and went into the shop, then returned, and bolted the street door, and called out Tom three times (master calls me Tom) he then took a chisel off the bed-rack, and broke open the parlour door at the back of the shop, which was full of beds, mattresses, and cloth; he had told me that he had carried a piece of cloth out of the cart into that room one morning; and when he got into the parlour he brought something heavy out, which I thought was cloth; he tied some cord round it, put it under his arm, and went out; I went to the door, but was so confused I could not open it; he had shut it. When I did get out I saw that he had just crossed the street - I called after him, but he had got too far. I went next morning with Dixon in Bishopsgate-street, and saw him, pointed him out, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He knew that you slept in the shop - A. I sleep on the first floor. It happened at eight o'clock; he could not see me for the door hid me. I was put into the house to look after the house, and repair it. I might have stopped after I had finished the repairs, but I did not intend it. The goods belong to Mr. Dixon. I gave an alarm directly I got out; the watchmen were not on duty; the lamps were lighted; I could not see his face out of doors.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If there had been no lamps could you have seen a man's face at eight o'clock - A. I could not. He could not see me on the stairs. I had been fitting up the house, and if any porter's job was to be done, I should do it. I had been porter at the old house in Barbican, and continued the same engagement.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what capacity were you engaged at Barbican - A. I carried out goods, and had 15 s. a-week. No new engagement was made when I went to this house, but he paid me 20 s. a week then.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Middleton. This cloth was mine, and was placed in the back room - I saw it safe on the Friday previous, and gave nobody authority to remove it. I had the key of the room in my pocket. The prisoner had handed the cloth out of the cart - it was tied up - I cannot say whether he knew the contents; it was in different lengths. I was informed of the robbery on Tuesday morning, and went with Aver to Bishopsgate-street, where he pointed the prisoner out to me; I got a constable, who took him, and found two duplicates on him. I found some cloth like part which I had lost at Sowerby's; it was the same colour, quality, and quantity, but I cannot swear to it. I bought it of my brother Charles.</p>

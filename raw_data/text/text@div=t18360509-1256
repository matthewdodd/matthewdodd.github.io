                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Parker, we live in a house by ourselves on Twickenham-common. On the 26th of April, I went out about three o'clock—I fastened the door and hung the key behind the shutters—I locked the house up—I returned at about five o'clock, and found the key where I had left it—I went into the house and missed a book almanack, a jacket, a razor, and two other books from the back kitchen cupboard—the prisoner lives about eight or nine doors from me with his parents, who are labouring people—I did not find any part of the house broken—I suppose he must taken the key from behind the shutters, and got in—I do not know whether he had ever seen me put the key there—I have never found my property.</p>

I saw him at the back of the house, and told him I wanted him about the jacket and books of Mrs. Parker's—he said he knew nothing about it, that he bought a book of drunken man who had the things to sell—I showed him this almanack, which I found there, and asked him if that was the book—he said it was.</p>

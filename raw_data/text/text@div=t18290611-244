I went into my kitchen on the night of the 17th of April - I found the prisoner there almost naked in the act of putting some clothes on - I got a light, and asked what she wanted there, and whether she had been employed by Mrs. Smith - she said Yes - I was going to leave, thinking it might be so; but I returned and asked if she had been washing; she said Yes; I went and asked Mrs. Smith to come down with me, and they both came down - Mr. Smith asked, what she wanted there - she said a man brought her there - I asked her how she came to be undressed; she said he made her undress - I saw two bed-gowns, a handkerchief, and a cap, on the table; I said "We must make search for this man" - she said,"You need not look, he is not here" - I still looked; she then said, "There has been no man here" - the things were lying together on the table.</p>
               <p>JOHN RIERDON. I went to the house and took the prisoner - she told me she took these things from Mr. Cowen's room, and she was in the habit of taking such things when she was drunk.</p>

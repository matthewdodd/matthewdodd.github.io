The woman at the bar came to my shop last night, under pretence of buying a little lawn; it was to come to 3 d. After I had served her, she said it was not enough, she wanted the same quantity more. It came to sixpence. They were both put up together, and she paid for it. There was a piece, containing ten yards, lying on the compter. I suppose I looked on one side when she took the cotton, and left her lawn. Immediately after she was gone I missed the cotton. I got over the counter, and pursued her. She was got about the distance of three doors, when I saw her turning down a little court. When I came to the corner, I saw her running up the court as hard as she could. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050023"></xptr> overtook her in about thirty yards running, and told her she must go back with me. In coming along she dropt the cotton. I took it up, and brought that and her into my shop. I sent for a constable. She acknowledged the crime, and begged pardon, to be let at liberty, but I would not, being almost sure she had robbed me once before. (The cotton produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I went with a bundle into the shop to buy a bit of frill for my husband's shirt. I laid my bundle down, and took up that cloth by mistake. I have four children alive, and big with the fifth. I know no more of taking it than the child within me.</p>

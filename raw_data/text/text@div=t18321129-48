             (Police-constable C 95.) The proscutrix described the prisoner to me, and told me she had been robbed of her shawl - she was sober when she told me of it; she described the prisoner - I knew I had seen her about an hour before; and I had seen the prosecutrix with the shawl on her shoulders about that time - I took the prisoner in Moor-street, about a quarter-past four o'clock the same morning, with this shawl on; she said it was her own, and she had bought it at a shop in Greek-street three weeks before.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is my own, and my landlady was with me when I bought it - the prosecutrix was drunk, and the officer removed her from several places.</p>

            . The prisoner had no shawl when I saw her about an hour before, but the prosecutrix had one which appeared like this; I saw the prosecutrix sitting at a door in Moor-street, and told her to go home, and the prisoner passed by at the time.</p>

               <p>THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THOMAS LORD FOLEY. On the 16th of February, about five o'clock, I went to the hustings, <placeName id="t18190217-83-crimeloc490">Covent Garden</placeName>

I got near the centre, in front of the hustings, and was hustled; a party rushed on both sides - one arm was held up, and the other quite close to me - the two prisoners were near me. As soon as I could get my hand down, I found my watch was gone; I got out of the mob, and found my pocket-book was also gone - both my great, and under coat were cut through to the pocket. It was a gold watch, and cost me eighty guineas; I had a 10 l. a 5 l., and a 1 l. note in my pocket-book - I have never recovered it. While I was examining my coat Mason came up, and with his assistance Alexander was immediately apprehended, and taken to Bow-street - my right arm was held up. I felt no particular pressure till the prisoners came up.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Jepp, who lives in New Bond-street - I was in the crowd. I saw the prisoners, and some others close to his Lordship; they were all in company together, hustling round his Lordship. I saw Alexander put his hand into his Lordship's pocket; I watched them for ten minutes, and then saw one of them put his hand into the other gentleman's pocket, who was with his Lordship - there was nothing in his pocket. The gentleman turned round, and laughed at them; I heard Alexander say to Phillips,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you make haste." I am sure they were in company; Phillips had been feeling me just before his Lordship came into the crowd. I followed his Lordship out of the crowd, saw him examining his pockets, and told him. I got King and Shaw, the officers, and took Alexander - Phillips escaped, Next day I went into the crowd, with the officers, and took Phillips there; he was then with two or three others, hustling people - a very small knife was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not not know when the robbery was committed. His Lordship might have passed several thieves in the crowd.</p>

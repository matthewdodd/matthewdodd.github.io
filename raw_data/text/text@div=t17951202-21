               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Wilson's warehouse? - A. As far as from here to the bottom of the Old Bailey, or not quite so far; I cannot say exactly; one of the bundles was tied up in a sheet, and the other in a table cloth; we took them to the watch-house, and went back again; at the back of the Barleymow, in a lane that goes to Labour-in-Vainhill, we found a sheet and two table cloths lying loose on the ground, and this iron crow(producing it) lying by them; we took them to the watch-house; they have been in my custody ever since; the two bundles were close to the front door; the others close to the back door; as soon as the Barley-mow was open I went in, and observed Jackson in the Barley mow; he had called for some purl and gin; I asked him what his name was, he told me his name was Thomas Jackson (I should have mentioned before, that when I came to the watch-house; I observed several of the sheets and cloths stained with blood; it appeared to me to be fresh); I asked Jackson where he lived; he came a false direction; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020028"></xptr>said he lived at No. 1, Green-arbour-court, Dowgate-hill; I went and enquired, and there were no lodgers in the house; I took him into custody immediately; in consequence of the linen being bloody, I asked him to let me look at his hand; he told me he would see me damned first, or any bloody constable like me; I did not look at his hand; he said if he must go to the Compter he would have some purl and gin before he went; he took the purl in his left hand to drink, and I observed some blood on his little finger; he said he had cut his finger, and, damn me, what was that to me; he said to the landlord, I am going to the Compter, I may be robbed by some damned rascal of a constable, I will give you what money I have, and he gave him 2l. 9s. 6d.

               <p>Q. How far is your house from Mr. Wilson's warehouse? - A I cannot justly say; it is above one hundred yards, I suppose: they both called me, up; I cannot say th hour; I went down, Jackson said his wife was ill, and desired I would let him have some gin; I think that was nearly about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the third person in company with them then, or were they alone? - A. The third person was not with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where they lived? - A. No; I let them have some gin, and they went out of my house directly; about twenty minutes before six Jackson came in again, at the front door, and asked for some purl; before I had lighted the fire to heat the purl, the watchman came in, and began to speak to him; they asked who he was, and fest down his cloaths; I was about my business, and did not attend much to what passed; he was taken into custody before he went out of the house; I received 2l. 9s. 6d. of him; I put it in my right-hand breeches-pocket; I had nothing in that pocket before but a bad sixpence, and that was done up in paper, and not mixed with the money Jackson gave me; I gave the money I received of him to Willoughby; before I delivered it, Mr. Wilson's son desired to see it.</p>

            (To Mr. Wilson, jun.) Do you know any part of that money? - A. Yes, the sixpence; I saw the money in the hands of the landlord; the sixpence was among it then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. Is there any mark besides its being an old sixpence, and battered, by which you can swear to it? - A. Not that I know of; it is a very remarkable sixpence; it is battered and beat about.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you pick it out from any other money? - A. Yes; I picked it out at the Lord Mayor's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. - Q. Did you pick it out from many other sixpences? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any of the others battered? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that money (shewing her some silver), and tell me if there is any piece that you know? - A. I know that(picking out the sixpence) perfectly well; I took it of Mr. Wilson's son, for fruit; I looked at it, it was very black, I did not like it; I said you will know it again, and put it in my pocket; I had it a fortnight; I had passed it, but it came back, and I returned it to him, and he gave me another for it; I am sure it is the same sixpence.</p>

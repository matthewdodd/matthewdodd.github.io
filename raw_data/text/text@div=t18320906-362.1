            . I am a hatter, and live at No. 22, Cumberland-street, Middlesex-hospital. I know the prisoner - on the 16th of June I was in his company from seven o'clock till twelve; I took a hat home to his brother and stopped there till about nine - Mr. Hagan came in about eight, and we went to the Mogul, where we stopped till twelve.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What day was this? A. On Saturday night, the 16th of June - I know very little of the prisoner, but his brother I am intimate with; he is a fishmonger, and the prisoner assisted him - he was at his brother's when I took the hat home; Mr. Hagan then came in, and we went to the Mogul - his brother mentioned the circumstance to me, and then I recollected it; I cannot tell where I was on the 26th, 27th, or 28th - I suppose I was in my business, but on the 16th I know I took the hat home to the prisoner's brother; I gave him a bill and receipt, and got an order from Mr. 
               <persName id="t18320906-362-person2990">Hagan</persName>

             the next Saturday night - we had some half and half at the Mogul; I do not recollect having any spirits, and we had no wine.</p>

               <p> - HAGAN. I am a tailor, and live at No. 22, Rupert-street, Haymarket. I know the prisoner perfectly well; on the evening of the 16th of June I went to his brother's, in Lumber-court, to give an order to Mr. Highfield for a hat - he had brought a hat home that night for the prisoner's brother; the prisoner was there; I went there about a quarter before nine o'clock, and the prisoner, Mr. Highfield, and I went to a concert at the Great Mogul, in Drury-lane, and remained there till twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you leave his brother's? A. It might be ten minutes or a quarter past nine o'clock- I had gone there about nine, or a little before; I had been to the Mogul once before; the prisoner was at his brother's when I went there - he was serving in the shop part of the time; Mr. Highfield was there when I got there- I do not know Mr. Lloyd, nor Mr. Pontifex; I never heard of Holloway - I have seen the prisoner since the 16th of June, driving a cab and an omnibus.</p>

Two or three days after the robbery, and I looked night and day for him; I took him on the last day of August - he was sitting alongside the driver of an omnibus; he drove a cab before the 16th of June, but I never saw him drive one afterwards.</p>
               <p>- HAGAN re-examined. Q. Who did he drive for? A. I do not know - I really never noticed what sort of a cab it was, nor what number; I did not know any one was looking for him - I saw him twice in Holborn, and once in Oxford-street; I had drank with him repeatedly before the 16th of June - I cannot tell the date; when I saw him driving a cab - I did not take notice of it; I cannot say when I saw him in Holborn - it might be five weeks ago; I cannot tell the month - it must have been in July - I cannot tell what coloured cab it was; I think it was a bay horse - I nodded to him; he had a fare at the time - I believe he never had a cab of his own.

               <p>COURT. Q. What time did he come home that evening? A. About five or six o'clock; he might have been out for five or ten minutes; I do not think he was out half an hour- he was not driving a cab that day - he went out about nine o'clock with these two witnesses; I heard of the charge the night he was taken, and then I recollected this; he had driven an omnibus since the latter end of June, I think - I believe he has driven a cab during that period; he left me about the latter end of June - I did not hear of this robbery till he was taken; I never heard he was being looked after - I do not know what omnibus he drove; he drove one twelve months ago - I cannot tell what time he left me - he had driven cabs and omnibusses before he came to me; I think he had driven a cab since - I cannot tell what coloured horse he drove; one cab may have different coloured horses.</p>

            . On the 9th of June, about twenty minutes before two o'clock in the morning, I was in Crown-street, Finsbury-square - I am a watchman, and was on duty. The prisoner ran up to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Mr. Rice?" I said</p>
               <p>"I was very well." She then said,</p>
               <p>"How does your wife do?" I said she was very ill, and at the point of death; she followed me down the street to the top of <placeName id="t18191027-117-crimeloc634">Long-alley</placeName>

I put my lanthorn on my box - she stood still; I told her to go about her business, and not stand there. A coach came by, and she said there was a coach - I told her to go about her business. The moment the coach passed she ran against me, and took the watch out of my fob - I was suspicious of her; I had known her seven years. I pursued her immediately, but she escaped. Next day I went to look for her, and found that she lodged at No. 5, Cowheel-alley, Whitecross-street. I charged her with stealing my watch, but she denied it. I said,</p>
               <p>"You know you took it in a moment." She said,</p>
               <p>"Well I did take it in a moment, for if I have business to do I don't take half an hour to do it." The mistress of the house said,</p>
               <p>"Give the old man his watch" - she said she had not got it; she would not tell me where she had pawned it. I fetched an officer, returned, and she was gone. I was not able to find her until the 12th of October, when she was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it. I met him that night, and asked him how he did. Next morning I met him, and he asked me about it. I said I knew nothing of it.</p>

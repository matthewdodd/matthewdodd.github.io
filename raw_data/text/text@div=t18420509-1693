                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Archibald Leslie, of St. Ann's Hill, Wandsworth; he dwells there; it is in the parish of Wandsworth. Between three and four o'clock on the 12th of April, I was sitting in the kitchen—I heard a noise—I went to the pantry cupboard to see if the plate was all right, and it was gone—I called the lad to run and see if he could see any one—we both ran, about twenty yards from the gate there were two men running—they had got this plate-tray between them—the prisoner was one of them—they dropped the tray—some man picked it up and gave it to me—it is Mr. Leslie's tray—it contained twenty-five spoons, some ladles, forks, and a butter-knife, all silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, at Wands worth. I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running—I chased him about a mile—there was a ditch—he was on one side and I on the other—I lost sight of him, but I knew him again—I stopped him at last.</p>

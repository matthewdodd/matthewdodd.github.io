                  </hi>. I am clerk to the guardians of the Strand Union. From the year 1828 to 1836 I was vestry clerk of St. Paul's, Coventgarden—there are in that parish several parochial rates collected—poor's rate, church rate, improvement rate, and, under another Act of Parliament, a rector's rate—the rector's rate is raised under 51 Geo. 3, c. 150, s. 2.—tne prisoner was appointed collector of those rates—I have his appointment in the vestry book—he was elected by poll—I was vestry clerk at the time, and was present at the election—he was appointed collector of the poor, church, and improvement rates, on the 13th of June, 1829, for one year—the original appointment did not refer to the period of a year, but it is the custom to renew the appointment annually, and this appointment was renewed annually down to 1835—during my time he acted as collector of those rates—(the witness here read the minute of vestry, declaring the Prisoner to be elected collector of the parochial rates)—he was paid a pound age on the money he collected—1 per cent., which was afterwards altered to 1 1/4 —he was supplied with receipt books to give receipts to rate-payers—when a new rate was made he used to go to the printer's and order the books—there was a form of receipt, and in the margin particulars were printed to contain an abstract of the contents of the receipt he used—this other book</p>

               <p>was presented to the sub-committee of accounts every fortnight, and represented as a correct account of what he had received during the subsequent fortnight—there was a separate account book for each rate in the course of collection—this book is the account he produced, and it was checked with the margins of the receipts which he produced at the same time—on the 27th of October, 1834, I find he charges himself with receiving the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Evans, that is for one quarter's poor rate, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; a quarter's church rate, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; one quarter's improvement rate, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and one quarter's rector's rate, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it does not state up to what time this was due—on the 27th of October, 1834, there is received of Mr. T. <hi rend="smallCaps">EVANS</hi> the sum total, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the receipt book, on the 4th of November, there 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is from Brown and Kay—poor rate, one quarter, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/4 d; church rate, one quarter, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; improvement rate, one quarter, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/4 d; rector's rate, one quarter, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the entry in the book is, Nov. 4, Brown and Kay, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 8th of November there is a margin in the name of Stannard for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—poor rate, one quarter, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. church rate one quarter, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; improvement rate, one quarter, 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; rector's rate one quarter, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the rector's rate is made by the churchwardens for the time being.</p>

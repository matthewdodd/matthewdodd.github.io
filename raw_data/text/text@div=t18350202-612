On the after<lb></lb>noon of the 3rd of February, about half-past three o'clock, as I passed the shop of Mr. Burgess, in Shoreditch, I saw the prisoner haul down this furniture and piece of carpet, he wrapped it up under his arm, and run up a passage with it—I went in, and informed the people of it—I lost sight of him for about half a minute, and he was secured.</p>

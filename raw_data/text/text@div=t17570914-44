She came in the name of <rs id="t17570914-44-alias-4" type="alias">Hetty Pen</rs>. She told me she had brought her husband up to St. Thomas's Hospital, who was a shoemaker, to be cut for a fistula; but now I understand she has no husband. She continued with me three weeks. My husband was call'd to go out of town about business, and I let her lie with me for company for near a week. On the 4th of August I was washing. I went out to buy a bit of something for dinner, and when I returned she told me there had been a gentlewoman, an acquaintance of mine, had sent her maid for me. As I was going out the prisoner said, Mrs. Dawson, where are you going, you had better leave your rings at home, you may drop them off your finger. I said there is no danger of losing them. When I return'd it was near ten o'clock at night. I found the candle (lighted) close down by the drawers where my things were taken from, and my baby in the cradle close by it. I found the outward door shut to, but the prisoner was gone. I had left her in the house to take care of it. I missed eleven guineas, two half guineas, and 28 s. in silver out of the drawer. I look'd about and missed all the things mention'd in the indictment. I got up in the morning and went to a man that used to visit her at my house. He is an ostler at the Maiden-Head at Edgware, who she used to say was her brother; he directed me where to find her. Then I came home and went to justice Welch, and told him the case, and that I was inform'd she was bred at Aylesbury. He said Mr. Woodcock the gaoler there was his brother, and he'd give me a letter to him, who would endeavour to assist me in finding her.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether there was not a strange man lay along with you that night, and you was rob'd by him?</p>
               <p>M. Dawson. No, there was not upon my oath.</p>

            . I received a letter from Mr. Welch concerning the prisoner. I made inquiry, and found her at Missington; that was her habitation. When I took her she gave me these things. (Producing two caps, a handkerchief and an apron ) I ask'd her how she came by them, she said she believ'd they were Mrs. Dawson's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dawson. These things produced here are mine, and were lost that night.</p>
               <p>Woodcock. I brought her to Aylesbury, and confined her; this day sev'n night I brought her to London. I told the prisoner there were eleven guineas and two half guineas taken from the woman; she said she knew nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dawson. She confessed she took only 8 s. I went where she said she had sold the cotton gown, in Cock-Lane, for 10 s. and where she said she had sold my child's ear-rings, to a woman in Holbourn, and she went with me; we demanded them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175709140055"></xptr> but I never got any thing again but these things that Mr. Woodcock has produced.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of these things. She keeps a very bad house. That very night a man lay in the room with her all night; the house is free for all comers and goers. The things here produced were given to me. I make lace, and work very hard for my living. Mr. Woodcock will give me a character. I come from Buckinghamshire.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Woodcock. How long have you known her?</p>
               <p>Woodcock. I have known her from a child. Her father and mother were very honest people. Her father liv'd servant in my family some years, and till now I never heard any thing ill of the girl. I believe, had it been near her friends, she would have many witnesses to give her a character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem to be full of money?</p>
               <p>Woodcock. No, she seem'd to be in a deplorable condition, and had no stockings to her feet; these things here produc'd she had pawn'd for 2 s. and I fetch'd them out for her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find her?</p>
               <p>Woodcock. On the 22d of August.</p>
               <p>John Banbury. The prosecutrix owed me some money, I sent after her for it; one day in particular I went to her, and ask'd her for it; then she said she had been rob'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she owe you?</p>
               <p>Banbury. She ow'd me 13 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Banbury. I am a taylor. I ask'd her who rob'd her, she said the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Banbury. I did, I had seen her there, and they were very intimate. I ask'd what she was rob'd of; several things she said, and 8 s. which 8 s. she said she had saved for me. I reply'd to her, you suffer yourself to be rob'd rather than pay an honest debt. She asked me at the same time to write a letter to her brother that was at the camp, and to set forth the case and circumstance she was in, as to being rob'd; she never mention'd more than 8 s. in money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman?</p>
               <p>Banbury. She is. Her husband is a painter, and was pressed on board a man of war, on an information, and Mr. Welch, upon an affidavit, had him discharged. The man is a very honest man; he was serv'd with four copies of writs, and I lent him ten shillings of the money out of my pocket, part of this that is owing, to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. You hear what this man says, is it true?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never owed him a farthing in my life. I know no more of what he says than the child unborn; upon my oath it is all false. He came to me upon this occasion, and told me he could plead in any court in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell this man you had saved 8 s. for him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever desire him to write a letter for you to your brother?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a brother at camp?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No; he has been abroad these two years. We have heard he was killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not another brother?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix . I had, but he has been dead these two years.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of Mr. Harrison; I went up to bed with my husband, on Friday, the 31st of August, at one o'clock; I am sure he fastened the street door, and I fastened the bar myself.</p>
               <p>Describe the bar, is it a room cased in with a casement round it? - It is separated from the tap by a window, and the door is made to hinge on.</p>
               <p>Was the hinge on, and fastened when you went to bed? - Yes, I fastened it myself; when I came down, there is a little stool that stands in the bar, that was put on the outside of the bar, which I tumbled over, and I said to the girl, I am afraid there has been somebody in the bar: it was between five and six.</p>
               <p>In August, it had been light some time before that? - Yes; I found the top of bar unbolted; I missed my child's things the first thing; next all the things mentioned in the indictment; I brought them down to wash the next day.</p>
               <p>To Dodds. Did you find the articles mentioned in this indictment upon the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The things valued at one pound nine shillings.)</p>
               <p>The street door being unbolted, it must be unbolted within, must it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did there appear any marks of violence about the door without or within? - No.</p>
               <p>I suppose there was a good deal of company in that room that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you walk into the tap room before you went up to bed, to see whether there was any body in the tap-room? - Yes, there was nobody there.</p>
               <p>When once the door that leads to the tap room was open, the prisoner could very easily get to the bar? - Yes, the bar is by the passage before you come to the tap room.</p>
               <p>You are sure no person was in the one or the other that night when you went to bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any part of your house, any window, or any place broke? - No, there was a pane of glass in the bar had been broke some time.</p>
               <p>Was that adjoining to the street door? - Adjoining to the bar, looking into the tap room, and by putting her hand through that pane of glass, she might reach the bolt of the tap room; there was nothing at all broke as I could see; I cannot say how she got in or out.</p>
               <p>How long had this girl lived with you? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Had you lost any thing during that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What servant was she? - In the public way, to get pots in, and clean the house; I only kept one, and a boy.</p>

               <p>Was it a cotton gown? - Yes, it is here; the spoons and the buckles were in her pocket; I told her the gown did not belong to her; she said it did, and I took the gown, and the pocket apron off from her, the next day at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>Were the things in her apron? - Yes, except the coton gown that she had on.</p>
               <p>Was there any linen table cloths in her apron? - Yes, and half a yard of check linen, and the rest of the linen was in her apron.</p>
               <p>What did you do with these things? - I took her to the watch-house, and the patrol searched her, and found the property on her, and he kept them till such time as she was taken before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Court to Deacon. Had she any woman with her? - Yes, and please you, my Lord, I met a woman just before I met her.</p>
               <p>Were they in conversation? - When I met the first woman, she had got nothing as I could see, and I let her pass.</p>
               <p>Answer my question, were they in conversation together? - She called to the other.</p>
               <p>Then the other woman was before her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of her? - She went away.</p>
               <p>Did the other woman make reply at all? No, she went off immediately; she only called to her by her name Bet, to the best of my remembrance, but the other never offered to come back.</p>

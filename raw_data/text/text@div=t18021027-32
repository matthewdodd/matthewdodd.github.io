None; he went down upon his knees and begged forgiveness; he then said he had collected them at different times, as they fell from the cart; he said they were my property; we fell them by weight, and then they are put into a nail bag; he did not say any thing about the steel.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the patrols; on Saturday the 9th of October, between seven and eight in the evening, I was on duty in Old-street-road; I saw the prisoner with this bag on his shoulder; I stopped him, and asked him what he was carrying, he seemed very much agitated; he at last said they were nails; I asked him where he was going to carry them, he said, he was going to carry them to Mr. Gill, in Old-street, and that he brought them from St. John's-street; I told him, I would go with him to Mr. Gill, he refused going to Mr. Gill's, he said, he would go to a Magistrate's, and would tell them there; at the office, I asked him again where he brought them from, and he said, he had them from a man of the name of Houghton, under Charterhouse-wall, and he was going to carry them to Mr. James, the wheeler's; Mr. Houghton and Mr. James are here.</p>
               <p> - HOUGHTON sworn. - I am a smith; I never employed the prisoner to carry any nails; he sent for me to the New-Prison, and told me he was stopped going with some nails to the Curtain-road, and he said, he had made use of my name, he said, he had never taken any.</p>
               <p> - James deposed, that he had not employed the prisoner to carry any nails. (The nails produced.)</p>

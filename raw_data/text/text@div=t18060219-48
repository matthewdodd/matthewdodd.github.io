               <p>Q. On Thursday the 16th of January did you go to Leather lane. - A. Yes, at six o'clock in the morning, and fixed myself at a spot which commanded the whole view of the gates of George Yard; I had not been there ten minutes, before I saw Oney come knocking at the gates in George Yard, and called, Will, it is past six o'clock; then he immediately went towards his master's house, and returned from there with his master with a candle and lanthorn to George Yard; the gates were opened almost immediately after Oney and Baldwin came, by Carr the prisoner; Baldwin; and Oney, went into Baldwin's stable, and Carr went into Baldwin's stable for a light.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Carr come out of Baldwin's stable. - A. He came out immediately with a light, and went to the corn bin on Mr. Fagg's premises; I was then standing in George Yard, where a hackney coach was standing, I could command a view of the corn bin.</p>
               <p>Q. When Carr came out with a light he went to Mr. Fagg's corn bin, what did he do. - A. He filled a nose bag full of Mr. Fagg's oats, beans, and chaff; he returned from thence through the stable to Baldwyn's stable; I was following of him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he got that nose bag from. A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How close did you follow him. - A. As close as convenient, he did not see me, he went into Baldwin's stable, I went in after him, I saw him give it into the hands of Baldwin, I got hold of Baldwin's collar, I looked at Carr, I said, you villain, I have detected you; Baldwin said, as near as I can recollect, I beg you will forgive me, consider my wife and family, I told him he had sufficient warning before, as I had detected him I must do my duty and inform Mr. Fagg.</p>
               <p>Q. You brought away the bag with the corn in it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did the bag contain. - A. The bag was full, it contained near half a bushel.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was Baldwin and Oney taken into custody. - A. Oney was taken into custody about an hour afterwards, Baldwin was taken into custody at the time, Carr was taken on the Sunday following; I let Oney go to his own house, and I went with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Carr. - A. I do not know; there was a reward offered for him; in a day or two afterwards he was taken.</p>

I was opposite the Horse Guards, standing on the pavement, at the time of the Coronation; the Policeman came to me, and said, "Do you know you are robbed?" I said No - he said, "Look at your pocket;" I looked - my pocket was turned inside out, and one shilling and one sixpence, which was all I had in it, was gone - the prisoner was close to me; the officer had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Was there not a great crowd? A. Very little - it was just as the King was returning; I thought if I was robbed, I would not lose all my money, so I divided it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty about a quarter before four o'clock, as the King was returning - I saw the prisoner busy behind the prosecutor's back; I watched him, and saw the four finger and thumb of his right hand take the 1s. 6d. out of the pocket, which was turned inside out - he put the money into his left hand; I seized his left hand with the money in it - he struggled to get away, and in the struggle tore his coat: I did not lose hold of him - he threw the 1s. 6d. on the pavement; I took it up, and this is it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am positive the officer must be mistaken - I heard some money fall, and he accused me of stealing it.</p>

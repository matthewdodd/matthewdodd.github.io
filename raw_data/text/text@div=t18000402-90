             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live next door to the Pantheon, in Oxford-street; Henry Nowland has been in my service about sixteen months, and Bryan came a few months after Henry: On Monday the 24th of February, in consequence of information, I went to their lodgings in Adam and Eve-court; Boswell went up with me into the back room up one pair of stairs, where I saw a bundle tied up in a coarse cloth, containing twenty-four blue and white plates; I found it near the bed, rather under it; there was a box in the room, which I just poised, and found it excessively heavy; I then went to Marlborough-street for a search-warrant; I then went again with an officer; I called at home and desired the prisoner, Bryan, to take a basket, and follow me; when we had got over the way into the court, I told him a discovery had been made of some earthen-ware in his apartments, and it would be necessary that he should give an account of it; the officer untied the bundle, and took out the plates; I then desired Bryan to open the box; and he said it was his brother's, and he had not the key; the officer then broke it open, and we found in it all the rest of the articles mentioned in the indictment, except the pen knife, which was in a bundle of dirty linen upon the box; the officer took possession of the property; they were all new plates, quite bright and clean, they had not the least appearance of having been used, but they were interspersed with small straws; we had unpacked, within a few days, a great many goods from both our manufacturers, and on account of the quantity, they were put upon the shelves without wiping them, as we usually do; I have no doubt that they were a part of my stock; there were two cut glass salts, and a plain one, the cut glass salts were of the same pattern, but different in size from each other; with respect to the large one, I had, a little time before, written to my manufacturer to send me twenty-four a little larger, and they had arrived three or four days before this discovery; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020080"></xptr>put them in a glass case in the accompting-house; the prisoner, Bryan, used to light the fire in the accompring-house before the clerk came; I had not sold any of them; I went home and examined the cut glass salts, and found but twenty-three instead of twenty-four; they were wrapped up in a greyish kind of paper, very different from any paper used in our shop; and the one that I found in the prisoner's box was in a paper exactly resembling that paper; I have no doubt but that was one of the twenty-four; the pen-knife I had missed about ten days before, and made a good deal of inquiry after it but heard nothing of it. (William Jackson, the offer, produced the property).</p>
               <p>Phillips. I am sure this knife is mine, there is a small bit chipped off the end of it on the ivory part; after I had returned home, the other prisoner came in; I told him some earthen-ware had been found in his apartments; I asked him for the key of the box; he said he had not had it, for several days past, and appeared exceedingly confused; I desired him to go with me over to his lodgings; he went with me to the door, and there he ran away; on the Wednesday following I took him again at the lodging; he was taken before a Magistrate; Bryan had declared, with many oaths and imprecations, that he knew nothing about it, and wished his brother at the devil for running away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe one of the prisoners had lived with a Mr. Minton, in the same business? - A. He had; that was Henry.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not counted over the number of plates in your house? - A. No; I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have been stolen from Mr. Minton for any thing you know? - A. No; Mr. Minton's brother supplies him entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took up Bryan first, did he not say, that his brother Henry was totally innocent, and knew nothing of the transaction? - A. He did.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner, Henry, lived with me formerly, he went from me to Mr. Phillips's; Mr. Phillips did not ask me for a character of him, if he had I should have given him a most excellent one; after this discovery was made, he called at my house, and told me that there had been some things found in his brother's lodging, and his; I then asked him if he knew any thing of them; he said, no, he did not, and wished me to go to his master; I told him if I could be of any service to him, as an honest man, I would; but if he was guilty, I would certainly assist in bringing him to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those plates, have you any patterns of that sort in your stock? - A. Not exactly; my brother, and several others, make of the same pattern, with the only difference of their being different manufacturers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. He might have stole them from you? - A. He had opportunities enough.</p>

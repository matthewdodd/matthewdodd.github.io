            . I live at Mr. Debatt's, the pastrycook, near the Mansion-house. I was looking out of the door - I saw the prosecutor go by; the prisoner and another were behind him, in the act of taking the handkerchief out of his pocket - the prisoner held up the tail of his great coat, while the other took the handkerchief from the other coat pocket; I ran out and told the prosecutor - I pursued the prisoner; - he was stopped by another person; I am certain of him.</p>

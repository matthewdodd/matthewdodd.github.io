I do not know that the prisoner took the things, they were brought to me after the prisoner was taken up; (the things produced). I am pretty positive as to the counterpane, that that is the counterpane that lay on my bed at the time of the fire.</p>

            . I am a constable: the fire was on a Saturday; on the Tuesday following I was going along Great Earle-street. I saw, about noon, the prisoner talking to a Jew; the prisoner said the people where they are, are in want of money, I can let you have them a bargain for ready money; hearing this conversation it took my curiosity; I followed the prisoner and the Jew; at last they came to an old iron shop; the prisoner went into that or the next house, and left the Jew into the street; I went into the public house and watched them; at last I saw the prisoner beckon the Jew; then I came out of the public house; the Jew was gone; I went up to this iron shop, and there I saw the prisoner in the back part of the shop packing up some things of this kind; I went to him and asked how he came by those things; he without making any answer flung by me, and ran out of the shop, and almost knocked down Martin Hossman, who I desired to observe what passed, and ran away; we pursued him; he was taken a little while after, and was brought back; he said then, these things had been bought by his wife; before the Justice of Peace he declared where he lodged, but we found nothing of these things at his lodgings; these things now produced I saw this man packing up in the iron shop.</p>

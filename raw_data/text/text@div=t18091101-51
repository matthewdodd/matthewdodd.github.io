               <p>Q. How much did the callico cost. - A. Eighteen pence, they bought a yard and a half, they were going out, I stopped them by the door, I told them why I stopped them; I charged them with having stolen the shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you found the shawl. - A. I faced them going out, taking King in my right hand, and Smith in my left, she had the shawl under her right hand, and at the time I took her to walk back in the shop, she dropped it at the door; I sent for a constable, they were secured, I delivered the shawl to the constable, the shawl cost me fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about their persons. - A. No.</p>
               <p>SMITH. Q. I wish to ask him whether he saw me drop the shawl. - No; I did not see her drop the shawl, it was found at the door where I first stopped her, I am quite sure I saw her lay hold of it while she was at the counter.</p>

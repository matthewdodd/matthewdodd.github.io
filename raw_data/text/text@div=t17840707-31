               <p>I was in the bar, and some person ran in very fast into my house, directly after that there was a hallooing of stop thief! I ran to the back door and secured it; I followed Mr. Ross and our hostler into the yard, and when I came up two pair of stairs to the landing place, they had the prisoner by the collar.</p>

               <p>The evening the robbery was committed I had been over Westminster-bridge to see a friend, and was going home to my lodging in the Haymarket, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man run across the way, and went up to him, he knocked off my hat, he ran into a publick house, I could not be sure whether he went up stairs or strait forwards into the yard, I went up stairs to see for him and I was taken; they searched me immediately and found nothing upon me, the gentleman of the house then said that he noticed a man standing in his passage at the same time; there is a man that can witness that I was talking to him at the time there was a cry of stop thief; he was here this morning, and he will be here again at four o'clock, he heard I was in Newgate, and he came to see me.</p>

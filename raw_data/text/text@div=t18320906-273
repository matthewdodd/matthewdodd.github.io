            . I am now living with my friends; I have left the course of life I was in - I was an unfortunate girl; I was acquainted with the prisoner Austin - he was a clerk in the East India-house; I heard him say he had been a clerk before, but I do not know to what - he came to live with me at my lodging in York-square; he came there the beginning of June, a little before Greenwich fair - I afterwards lived with him at Harrison-street, Gray's Inn-lane, and at Easton-street, Clerkenwell; when we lived at Harrison-street, I pawned a coat for him with a velvet collar, at Mr. Loveday's in Gray's Inn-lane - I knew Davis while I lived in Harrison-street; I had never seen him before - he gave me a coat to pawn at the same time that Austin did; that had not a velvet collar - the prisoners were together when they gave me the coats; they took them out of the house, and gave them to me in the street - they had brought them into the house: one of the coats was tied up in a green silk handkerchief, but I do not know which - I received a mourning-ring about three weeks afterwards, at the Cheshire Cheese, publichouse, to pawn; I looked at the name on it, but could not tell what it was - it was after that that Davis and two other men went with me to the public-house, and the officer came and took us; when I went to Hatton-garden, I told what I have stated now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But you never said any thing about it till the pawnbroker had identified you as the person? A. I did not know they had been stolen - I did not make the statement to save myself; Mr. Newton taxed me with it, and said I had better tell what I had done - I was frightened; I never was in trouble before, but I stated what was true - I have gone by the name of Jager, and Austin told me that his name was Copeland, and authorized me to go by that name; Mr. Jager has been transported - I have gone by the name of Bouverie and Knapp; I lived with a tradesman of that name - some people have called me James; I never went by the name of Briant - people have called me Sidworth, but I never gave my name as that; I went by that name when I lived in Lancaster-street - I never went by the name of Bland: my sister has gone by that name - I have not had another friend of mine transported; I was taken once for being out late, but I positively swear I never was taken on a charge of felony - I have worked at dress-making; I have been in town ten years - I was getting my living in the street when I lived in Lancaster-street; I was there four or six months - I had before that worked for my living, but when I had no work, I was obliged to go in the street: when I went to Easton-street, Austin told me to take a lodging, and he would pay for it - I went by the name of Bouverie when I lived in York-square; I used then to work when I had it to do, but I had not been there long before Austin spoke to me; when I first came to London I lived with my aunt, who was a dressmaker: I did not live with her long - Hollman, Smith, and Davis were with me when I was taken; I was not at home when the coats were brought to Harrison-street; I did not see them brought; Smith and a female he lived with lived in that house, and I believe no one else but the landlady - I know it was in July that the prisoner took the coats from the house, but I cannot say what time, only I know I was not there in June, and these coats were brought about a week before I left, but I cannot say when I left; the coats were wrapped up when I received them, and it was candle-light - Austin told me that the coat he gave me had a velvet collar, and I was to ask 30s. for that; I did not see them till they were opened at the pawnbroker's- I had never pawned any coats before.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Neither of the coats had been in wear to your knowledge, in Harrison-street? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you been out before they were given to you? A. Two or three hours -Austin came to me, and asked if I would go and pawn his coat for him, as he wanted some money, and Davis said,"Perhaps you will take mine at the same time;" I do not recollect when it was, but I was only there a fortnight altogether - I never lived but with three men; I sometimes took their names - Mr. Jager was a boot and shoemaker, a respectable tradesman; I believe he was transported because a parcel was taken from a cart, and found on him - I was not taken up for that.</p>

             (Police-constable E 32). I apprehended Austin on the 17th of August, in Shire-lane, near the Temple, and he was let out on bail - I took him in a common brothel; I did not say any thing to him about what had happened at the Temple, but he knew what I took him for, and asked who had told me where he was -I said I should decline telling him; I have known him two years - I knew Davis; I had seen them together very often in July, and for eighteen months before; they frequented Sion-terrace, near Judd-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that Austin has not left his ship fifteen months? A. When I first knew him he lived in Cromer-street, it must be nearly two years ago - I have not the exact date, but I have known him a long time.</p>

            . Austin brought a watch to me about the middle of June, while I was living at Mr. Cope's - it hung over the mantel-piece for three or four days; he then had it himself - when I lived in Easton-street he gave it to me to pawn, and told me to ask 1l. on it; they offered me 10s. - I went back to him at the Cheshire Cheese, and he told me to go to the corner of Wilson-street with it; they there lent 14s. on it, which I gave to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR LEE. Q. When did you begin to live with him? A. The beginning of June, about Whitsuntide; I did not live with him more than ten weeks altogether - he had but very few things there; he said he lodged over the water; I pawned the watch after the coats and the ring - I had no suspicion that these articles were stolen; I pawned them in different names, but they were the names he told me - I had seen Austin's brother and sisters, and they and he all appeared very respectable.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Austin go out at the time that clerks do? A. Yes; I pawned the watch in the name of Copeland; I did not know him by the name of Austin.</p>

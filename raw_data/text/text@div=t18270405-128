I was coming up Durham-street, into the Strand, and saw this gentleman passing the top of the street - the prisoner had hold of his coat with one hand, and drew the handkerchief out with the other; he put it into his own pocket, and passed by; I told the gentleman, and said that was the boy - he ran, seized hold of him, and said he had robbed him; he then took it out of his pocket, and threw it into the kennel, behind him - a little boy picked it up, and gave it to the prosecutor.</p>

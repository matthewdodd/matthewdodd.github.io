               <p>Q. It was not day-light then? - A. No, it was dark; I observed a small hole in one square of glass, and the prisoner at my shop-window making several attempts; I cannot say what with, but I think it was a knife, making the hole larger to convey the roll through, which at last he did, and instantly put it into his bosom.</p>

No; I immediately caught him as he was running away, and secured him; he took it out of his bosom, and dropped it on the ground, with a knife, which I afterwards found; I took him to my own shop, and called for assistance; I sent for a constable, who lives next door to me, and he searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear, that at the time you left the shop, there was room enough to get the ribbon out? - A. By no means; but as I was watching him all the time, I can swear that no other person had been near the window.</p>

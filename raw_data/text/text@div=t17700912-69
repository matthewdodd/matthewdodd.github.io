I had the purse in my hand not an hour before I went to bed; after I was undress'd, I let him out, and fastned the door; when I got up in the morning, I missed my purse, and the guinea that was in it, out of my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Poole. I had been drinking, but I was quite sensible of what I was doing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prisoner to undress you?</p>
               <p>Poole. He came with me from Chelsea. I was going into Somersetshire; I saved the guinea to carry me home next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss your money before you unlock'd your door in the morning?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull your waistcoat off before he went away?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes, every thing.</p>
               <p>- Franklin. I keep the White House at Hammersmith. The prosecutor and the prisoner came into my house a little after four in the afternoon; the prisoner wanted a dram, but he said he had no money, and the prosecutor treated him; when he went to bed, I ordered my girl to go and put him to bed, but the prisoner was very officious, and said, he would; he staid some time with him; when he came down stairs, he said to me, call up the old pensioner early, he wants to go on his journey; he said he was obliged to be at Chelsea by nine that night, or he should get ill will. I saw him the next morning about six o'clock, very much in liquor; his face was bruised; I thought he had fell down. When the prosecutor came down in the morning, he said, have you seen any thing of the man that was with me last night? I said, I had; he told me that he had picked his pocket; a man gave us information where the prisoner was, and we took him at the Rose and Crown about nine in the morning; the constable search'd him, and found a quarter of a guinea, and silver, and half pence, to the amount of 16 shillings and two-pence farthing; the prisoner said before the Justice, that he had the money sent him from Yorkshire, and afterwards, that it was sent him from Carlisle.</p>
               <p>- Meredith. Upon the application of Mr. Franklin to me, I told him it would be proper to make an enquiry where the prisoner lay that night; we found that he lay at one Mrs. Waites, a mantua maker, along with one Barnard, an old fellow soldier. I had this purse from Mrs. Barnard, (producing a green worsted purse.)</p>

            . The prisoner lay that night with my husband and me, and he made me a present of that purse, and my husband said, that he had made such things in North-America. We met him upon the road at Hammersmith, about half an hour after five in the afternoon; we had a shillings worth of rum and water, and two shillings worth of brandy and water; the prisoner paid for it; he paid a shilling for the first, and changed two 5 s. 3 d. to pay for the last two shillings worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think he was very rich?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I did not know what way he was in; he told us he had received his pension money.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor. There is no particular mark to the purse, but it is just such a one as I lost.</p>

               <p>I never robbed him. I came from Yorkshire the 29th of May. I had a family there. I was so bad I could not work; the master I work'd with sent me to Hull. I got five guineas paid me for my half year's service, then I got a passage from Hull. I was at Chelsea from the 29th of May to the 22d of June, before I got into the house; I had two guineas and eight shillings in silver when I went into the house. I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120030"></xptr> my comrade I would put this money by; I sewed up a guinea and a half in the waistband of my breeches, and a 5 s. 3 d. I never saw a farthing of what this man had, except what he had in a little leather purse.</p>

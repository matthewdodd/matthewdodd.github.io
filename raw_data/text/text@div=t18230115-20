Next day I went into the City, and on returning about half-past four o'clock, my wife informed me of something, and I missed the bag of money from the desk, containing 7 l. in silver, and twenty sovereigns. On the Saturday morning I missed two silk shawls from my windows, early in the morning, before I got up; and on Sunday, when we went out to chapel, my wife locked the shop door, and on returning we found it had been opened by some means, and found it open again in the afternoon. I immediately questioned the prisoner who had been left in the care of the house; she said no person had been in, and she did not know how it came open. I looked round the shop and found several things misplaced; she persisted that she knew nothing of it. I demanded to search her box, which she willingly acceded to. My wife went up stairs, and brought down a piece of flannel, and a piece of Irish; she said she bought both at Todd's, in Fore-street, and that her mother was with her at the time; she said the flannel measured two yards and a quarter wide, and a thumb over. I found there were two yards and a half; I cannot swear to the Irish, having no mark on it - there is a piece of dirt on one end of the flannel, by which I know it; she persisted that it was not mine. I sent my wife for a piece out of the shop, which had been cut off for a customer; I matched it, it tallied exactly - it must be mine.</p>

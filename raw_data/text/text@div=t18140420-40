On the 21st of November, I made up my letter; I kept the particulars of the notes that were in the letter. Mr. Wheatley made payments for us in Town; it was not an order from him or expected by him; it contained the bank notes already stated in the former case. I sealed the letter, and directed it to Mr. Wheatley, No. 7, Gough-square London; I delivered it to my brother, and told him to deliver it our servant. I dated the letter the 21st of November. I have no other partner.</p>

            . I am an inspector, of letter carriers in the General Post office. The letters are sorted into twelve divisions; the separation takes place in the Inland office. Letters which belongs to the sixth division after they are sorted in the Inland office they are carried into the letter carriers office. The letters of No. 6 are re-sorted into nine walks, or divisions; each carriers duty to sort the letters. The prisoner is not a sorter, but he occasionally would sort. The arrangement of each letter is made by two letter carriers. A letter carrier may take out a letter that does not belong to his walk by mistake. There is an order by the Post-master to endorse the names on notes of the person from whom they receive the note, and to put their own name upon the note when they pay it, and this is signed by the prisoner; a bill not so endorsed would not be received by the receiver general of the Post office. There are nine walks in No. 6. The prisoner has been employed in the Post office twenty-five or twenty-six years; his character up to this period has been correct and honest.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the house of Anstice and Cox. On the 8th of December last, I paid Mr. Williams, at the Alienation office, a five pound note, I received it of Mr. Swainson, the managing clerk. I paid it on the same day I received it. I am sure the note I received of Mr. Swainson I paid the same day to Mr. Williams. I had no particular mark on the note. I made no other payment at the Alienation office on that day.</p>

            He had. He delivered letters at Mr. Anslice's office for a considerable time. There was a week's passage due to him; it amounted to three pounds twelve shillings and sixpence. I gave him a ten pound note; he gave me change, a five pound bank note. I delivered the note to Minton, to make a payment at the Alienation office. I had no similar change at the time to my recollection; I had no other five pound note.</p>

It has; I have marked it with the name of Mr. Wood; I received it of some of Mr. Woods family; most likely from some of his children. I have marked in with the name of Wood, and I, G, my own initials. I paid it to my distillers, Wilson and Hill, Piccadilly.</p>

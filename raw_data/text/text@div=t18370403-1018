                  </hi>. I keep a chandler's shop in Lower Edmund-street, King's Cross. On the 3rd of March I was in my back parlour, between seven and eight o'clock, and heard a noise—I looked into the shop, but saw no one—(I could see a person if they were standing up, but not if they were creeping)—I listened again, and heard something else—I then saw something like a boy's cap rising up near the counter—I went into the shop, and looked round—I did not see any thing—I went out, and looked down a court by the side of my house, and saw two persons walking down—I did not notice what they were, but I think they were men, or it might be a man and a boy—I then came into the shop—a person came in for something—I went to the till, and found it was gone—I had seen it safe six or seven minutes before—it contained about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in half pence and pence, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in farthings—the next day I beard there was a till found at Islington station-house—I went, and it was mine—this is it—the money was not found—before I heard this noise the till was secure, and nobody else had been in the shop.</p>

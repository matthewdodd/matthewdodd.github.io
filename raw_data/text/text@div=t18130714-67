            . I am a servant. On Whit- Monday, the 7th of June, I was in Mr. Cave's yard; the prisoner came down, and asked me if the sawyers had been at work; I said, yes, they were breakfasting. The prisoner then said he supposed they were gone holiday keeping. I said I believed not, they would be there by-and-by; he then went into Mr. Cave's shop; the prisoner went in without any thing; he came out with a saw; he then came up to me and said if the sawyers come tell them I want saw to cut one cut down; he said he was at work at the corner of Red Lion-passage, in Ormond-street. That is all that past. I rather suspected it was not an honest thing. I saw no more of him until the owner of the saw apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did this man work in Ormond-street - A. No; I understood he is a sawyer; he has not been at work for many years. The saw has never been found; from the description of the man I took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Gibbs. I am sure he is the same man.</p>

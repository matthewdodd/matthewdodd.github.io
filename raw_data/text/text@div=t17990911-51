               <p>Q.What time did you arrive in the market? - A.About six o'clock; I supposed I had sold them all; the prisoner asked me if I would have all the geese up; and he told me I had got every thing up when the cart was unloaded; between seven and eight in the morning, the prisoner asked whether I had done with him; he said, if I had done, he would fetch his horse and cart and go home; I told him he might go; then he took hold of a basket that was in the shop, and took it out to the door with him; I asked him what he was going to do with that basket; he said, to carry it to Lime-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any directions to go to Lime-street for any purpose? - A. No; I desired him to leave his basket behind, or it would get lost, while he went for his horse and cart; it was the same basket in which I had brought the sixteen; I then ordered a person to look into the basket, Mr. Clark the poulterer, at Islington, and he searched the basket, it was then outside the door, in Leadenhall-market; when I opened it, I saw two dead geese lying at the bottom of the basket, but I did not touch them.</p>
               <p>Q.Looking at those two geese, will you venture to swear they were your husband's property, and part of the geese you had brought to London? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You opened the basket? - A. Yes; they are baskets made on purpose; it was a square basket, with a lid to it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mr. Clark fasten the basket? - A. No; I went and called another gentleman to see the geese, Mr.

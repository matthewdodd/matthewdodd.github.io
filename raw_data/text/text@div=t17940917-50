I was in the counting house, which lays at the back of the warehouse; I did not hear the door open, but hearing the russling of paper, I ran forward, and see the prisoner go out at the outer door; the door was shut when I left it. As soon as I had got to the front of the warehouse, I see him go out at the front door, and see goods under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - Between the hours of nine and ten in the morning. I called out stop thief! and ran after him, till I came to the Old Jewry; and when I came to him, he threw down the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the warehouse before you heard the rustling of paper? - I was in the warehouse, in the counting house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you left your other part of the warehouse, to go into the counting house? - Not ten minutes. When he chucked the goods down. William Batty and I stooped down together to pick them up; William Batty seeing me so near to them, he chucked them down again, in order for me to take care of them. I took the goods up again, and William Batty ran after the prisoner; I did not see any more of him till he was taken.</p>

            You did not see his face before he was taken, therefore how can you possibly swear that the young man is the person that you see with the paper under his arm, in the warehouse? - By the colour of his hair and coat.</p>

            Are you sure that the man Batty went in pursuit of, and who threw down the muslin, is the man that you saw in your shop? - I did not see him in the warehouse, I see him go out, and I saw the goods when I got out, I did not see it before, on account of the wainscot being so high. I am sure that the door was shut, and I heard the rustling of paper; and when I went forward I saw his head, and when I got to the door I saw the; muslin under his arm; and he still kept the bundle under his arm, till I see him in the Old Jewry, and see him throw it away.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; I was present when Mr. Bradley came out in pursuit of him; he had a bundle under his arm, he threw it down; I was close to him when he threw it down; I got the bundle immediately, and gave it to

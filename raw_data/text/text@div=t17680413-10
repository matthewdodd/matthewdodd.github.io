On the 5th of March I was in a little back room, I heard the money rattle; I looked into the shop, and saw the prisoner with my till in his hand; I ran after him, and called, stop thief; I got up at him, but missed my hold, and fell down; he was pursued and taken by a watchman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176804130006"></xptr> who was standing at his own door as he was running by.</p>

               <p>S. Shotton. This was between nine and ten in the morning; when I fell down, the prisoner flung the till down in the street, this was about three doors from my house; I cannot say what money was in the till, but I know there was more than 18 d.</p>

            . I keep a pork-shop next door to the prosecutor. I was coming down the street, I saw the prisoner and another man coming together; they first stopped at a baker's door, then at my door, then they went to the prosecutor's; I saw Pump the prisoner go into his shop, the other stood without, I soon saw them both running away; I saw Pump throw the till down, what was in it I do not know, I pursued him; I ran through my own house, expecting he would have gone down an alley, but he did not; he was soon taken.</p>

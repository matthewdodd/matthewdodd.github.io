These six pairs of trowsers and four small pieces of cloth are my master's—I am sure of that—on Thursday the police<lb></lb>man came, and I gave the male prisoners into custody—John Cochrane, Jun. was only given into custody on suspicion—the elder Cochrane came in, and on undoing his trowsers he pulled out this piece of unmade trowsers from between the waistband of his trowsers and handed them to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soap-manufacturer. On 28th Feb., this order was brought to me by a carman—I declined to act upon it, bat I directed the carman to come on the following morning—he came about eight o'clock, and I caused three empty boxes to be put into his cart, and sent an officer to watch it—I do not sell any goods to Messrs. Knight's—I do not know anything of William Brown, a man of theirs.</p>

                  </hi>. I do not know the prisoner, but he employed me—I cannot tell on what day it was, but the day before I went out with the goods, he came to my house directly after dinner and gave me this document—he told me to go to Mr. Hunt's and give the paper, and they would deliver the goods to me—I went and gave it to Mr. Hunt—he told me the goods would not be ready for four or five hours—I came away and went to another job, and during my absence the prisoner came again to my house, and left word for me to go for the things next morning—I went for them, and the three cases were put in the cart—I got about 100 yards from the place when I saw the prisoner—he touched me on the shoulder, and asked me whether I had got the goods—I said, "Yes, quite correct"—we were going along in conversation, and he asked me whether I would have anything to drink—I said, "No"—the policeman came and took the prisoner and the goods.</p>

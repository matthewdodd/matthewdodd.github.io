            . I am servant to the prosecutor. One Monday night, I was setting things to rights in the club-room; I heard somebody come up stairs, and master's room door open; I thought it was the maid; I went and saw the prisoner come out of master's room, and run up stairs to his room. I stood at master's room door; he came down, and said, Daniel, will you please to have a half-penny: to buy some nuts; he gave me a half-penny: at night, I told my master's daughter of it, and she told my master; then master asked me about it, and I told him: and on Wednesday at night, my master sent me up to see if the prisoner's partner was in bed; coming down again, I saw the prisoner standing behind the door, with his knapsack on the bed, with a piece of linen sticking about three inches out of it; I went about half way down stairs, and he called me up again to bring the light: when I came he said, I have got it now; so I went down. (A piece of linen roll'd up, produc'd in court.) This is like the piece.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the linen I saw the prisoner throw down on his bed; it is my property, and was taken from out of my room.</p>

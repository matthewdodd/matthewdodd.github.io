            . The last Day of May, I was in my own House, and a Neighbour came and tole me that a Woman in a red Cloak went into Mrs Cope's House, and came out with a Bundle, under her Arm; I asked him why he did not follow her, and he said he had a Reason for it; but he did not give me any Reason; I followed her, and seized her in Great Russel Street; and asked her what she did in the House she came out of; she made a trifling Excuse, and said, if she had done me any Damage she would make me Recompence; and she pulled this Gown from under her Arm, and gave it to me; she owned she took the Gown, and asked Pardon.</p>

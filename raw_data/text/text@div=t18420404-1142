                  </hi>. I am servant to John Irving, Esq., of Ashford, near Staines, Middlesex. In consequence of directions I received, I watched the premises, and on the 2nd of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, in consequence of what Mr. Dickens told me, I went into the rick-yard, and heard footsteps before me, of two men walking—I followed them, and as I thought, they got over some palings—I put my hand on one of their heads, and said, "Who are you?" but they got away directly—I went a doors and told my master, then went into the rick-yard again, and at the back of the barn there is a door opening inward—as soon as I pushed my back against the door, a man ran out—I found the prisoner coming out of the barn—I am certain he is the man—he had a sacking smock-frock on, and a red cap lined with white—this was half an hour after I had seen the two men—I pulled his cap off, and in the scuffle with him we both went down—he was at the bottom, and I on the top of him—he got away—I had known him long before, and am quite sure he is the man—he snatched the cap out of my hand—I searched the barn, and found two empty sacks, and two which had about two bushels and a half of corn in them—there was a good deal of master's corn in the barn—the sacks did not be<lb></lb>long to master, but I believe the corn in them to be the same corn—I went with the policeman to several places, and at last found the prisoner.</p>

               <p>consequence of the communication he made to me, I went to the barn and found two empty sacks, and two others with about five bushels of corn in the two—they were tied up in two places—I examined the wheat in the sacks—it corresponded exactly with that in the barn—I believe it belongs to master—I found two bludgeons in the barn, and a lantern—the sacks are not master's.</p>

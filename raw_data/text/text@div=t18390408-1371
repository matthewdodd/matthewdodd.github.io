                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, St. Giles's, in the same house as Elizabeth Marshall. I received information from her, yesterday three weeks, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, and went after the prisoner, and stopped him, about twenty yards from our door—I asked him if he had got the young woman's shawl—he denied having it—she came up, and said, "Have the goodness to give me my shawl"—he denied several times having taken it—she stopped with him about twenty minutes, or half an hour, asking him to give it up, but he would not—the policeman then took him to the station-house, and found the shawl round his body—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

               <p>LOCKINGTON ST. LAURENCE BUNN. I live at the Assay-office, in Hatton-garden. On the 1st of April, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was going through <placeName id="t18310407-67-crimeloc381">Smithfield-market</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking just behind the gentleman; two young lads were behind him - they ran back as soon as they took the handkerchief, and dropped it- I took it up, put it into my pocket, and walked by the gentleman's side, which I should not have done if I had picked his pocket.</p>

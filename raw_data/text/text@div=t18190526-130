I laid my head down on the table, and fell asleep with my hands under my head; the prisoner sat on my right side on the same bench. I had 46 l. and about 8 s. in a small bag. I had been paid off that day - there were 5 l. and 10 l. notes among the money. I had just come from Portsmouth - my hat was on the table before me. I was awoke by feeling the prisoner draw his hand out of my pocket - I heard money jingle when he put it into his own pocket. I missed my bag of notes and silver; I seized him, he escaped from me, and got outside the door. I had taken my bag of money from his waistcoat-pocket before that. I got an officer, he went and secured him, and found my hat on his head, and my discharge in his pocket.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell; the prosecutor fetched me about one o'clock - I went to the public-house with him, we met the prisoner coming from the house, the prosecutor said he was the man who had robbed him, and he had got his hat on now; he said he had taken his bag of money from him. I found his discharge in the prisoner's waistcoat-pocket, and 9 s. He said he did not know how it came there. I had great difficulty in securing him. The prosecutor knew what he was about.</p>

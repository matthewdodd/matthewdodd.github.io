             M'Clement. On Tuesday night, the 17th of November, betwixt 10 and 11 o'clock, I was going along George-yard, Whitechapel; I saw a window open and a sash up, and no light in the room; I call'd out, was any body in the room; there was no answer, but I thought I heard a little noise; I went and knock'd at the door, and the people above look'd out; I ask'd, if the people below were at home, saying, the window was open; then the prisoner jumped out at the window and ran; I kept my eye 'till I catch'd upon her, and when I stopp'd her this counterpane was lying by her feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did she run before you stopp'd her?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060032"></xptr>M'Clement. She had ran about forty or fifty yards, then I led her to the Watch-house, and the beadle search'd her, and found these three brasses upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Do you rent the whole house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I do: and let the other parts of it out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I hope the Court will take it into consideration: I never was in confinement before.</p>
               <p>Court. Have any of these witnesses known the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Blacket. I have known her some time, and always took her to be of good character.</p>

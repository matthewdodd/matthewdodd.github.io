                  </hi>. I live in Brydges-street, St. Paul, Covent Garden. On the 11th of April, about a quarter-past one o'clock in the day, I was in my parlour—I saw a mob about my window; and on coming from the parlour, I saw the prisoner's hand lifting a watch from, the window—I sell watches and curiosities—I ran out; and seeing the prisoner run away, I seized hold of him, not eight yards from the shop, and accused him of taking a watch from my window—he said he had not done any thing of the sort; but in less than half a minute, I saw him take the watch from his coat, and throw it across the road—I kept him in custody—the watch was picked up, and was mine—tht window was broken—it was whole at that part before, it had been broken at the bottom of the same pane, but was secured by putty—it was mended, and there was no hole whatever—that is the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Being in liquor yourself? - A. Yes; this woman, the prisoner, sat down in the same box where I was sitting, and when I came out of the public-house to go home, Mr. Scholey asked me if I had my property about me; I put my hand to my sob, and found my watch was gone, and my money out of my pocket; he wanted me to go back; I, being in liquor, did not, but desired him to look after it, and the next morning I found the prisoner in the watch-house; I did not know that I had lost the watch till I came out of the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you felt your watch was safe? - A. When I was in the public-house I looked at the watch, I was fearful of being too late for going home.</p>

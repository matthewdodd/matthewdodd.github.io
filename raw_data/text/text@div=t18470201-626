                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable.</hi>) On the 22nd of Jan., between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners and another in the old Kent-road, near Mr. Linsdell's shop—I followed them, and saw them go to the window—the other man was walking by the door—he then left, went, to the window, and looked in at the window—they all left the window—I went by, and saw that it was cracked—I went away to the same place where I had watched them previously, and saw them go three or four times more to the window with the other man—I went to the window, and saw part of the pane had been taken away—I went back again to where I had been watching them, and saw them go there again once or twice—they left—Lennox left first, and it seemed as if there was something bulky under his coat—shortly afterwards Jones left the shop with the other man, and joined Lennox a short distance; before he got to the cab-rank—they stopped at the cab-rank, and got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the door was closed—I went to the off-side, and opened the door—as soon as I did so, Jones jumped out, and struggled to get away—he was sitting at the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I pushed him into the cab again—I saw him in the act of putting his left hand into his pocket—I took his hand away, and felt a bundle of cigars—Lennox was handcuffed, and taken through the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the other prisoner—I found two bundles of cigars on the ground, and three or four bundles inside, broken up—another bundle was brought to me by another person—it was picked up where Jones jumped out—I took the prisoners into custody—I had seen Mr. Linsdell's window furnished with cigars before it was broken, and after it was broken I saw there were less cigars—I and another constable watched the window closely—no persons but the prisoners went up to the window, so as to be able to break it—a person went up once, but not near enough to break it.</p>

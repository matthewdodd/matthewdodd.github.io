I was coming from Kensington about eleven o'clock at night, on the 18th of March; I met the prisoner by Tyburn turnpike - she asked me where I was going; I said to Westminster; she asked if she should go with me; I said I had no objection. We came down Park-lane and went to <placeName id="t18270405-99-crimeloc563">Wood's mews</placeName>

I did not lay down - I was standing up, but my dress was loose. I picked up my watch, and put it into my great coat pocket; I remained with her two or three minutes after this - there was no bargain made, but I gave her 1s. 6d. - I cannot say whether that was before I dropped my watch. I then missed my watch, and told her she had got it - she denied it, and I gave charge of her; she was examined, and the watch could not be found - we then went to the place where we had been standing, but could not find it. We went to the watch-house again, and found it on her.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I received her in charge at the watch-house; the watch was not found on her, and she denied having any thing - the prosecutor said, "If she has not got it, one of the watchmen has;" I searched the watchmen, but none of them had it. I sent the beadle out with a light, but he could not find it; I then searched the prisoner again, and found this watch in the small of her back, under her shift.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was going along Park-lane, and the prosecutor met me; we went down the mews, and he gave me 1s. 6d.; the watch fell from him, he took it up, and put it into his pocket; he gave it me to hold afterwards, and I would not give it him, because he would not give me another 1s.</p>

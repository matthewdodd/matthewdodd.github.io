On the 10th of October I had my purse, containing nine sovereigns, in my watch fob. Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening I met the girls Mills and Williams in Brydges-street, near Drury-lane. They asked me to treat them with something. I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, my girls, what will you take?" They said they would have some apples. I treated them with some at a stall. I asked them if they would have any gin, and I went with them to have it at the corner of White Hart-yard.

In three or four minutes I pulled out a crown, and Mills snatched it from me. I did not then take out my purse. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you act in that way? Do you suppose that I have no more money?" and pulled out my purse at the time. I was rather fresh. She did not return the crown-piece. Williams snatched the purse from me. I then remonstrated with her, and while I was making a piece of work about it, the servant (Collins) came up stairs, and demanded 2 s. for the room. I told her what had happened, the girls then run down stairs. I attempted to follow them, but was prevented by Collins' laying hold of the collar of my coat; she stopped me on the landing of the stairs. I got from her in about a minute. When I got to the door, the two girls were out of sight. I called out, Stop the two girls! When I got to the bottom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220051"></xptr>of the stairs, Haynes threw me on the stairs. He got his hand in my neckcloth, and attempted to throttle me. I struggled with him for a quarter of an hour. Some boys, seeing us struggling, gave information to the Police, and the officers came to my assistance, and Haynes was taken into custody. They searched the house, and found the two girls hid in the cellar. Collins was not taken at that time. I have not seen the purse since, but I hear it is found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you rent a house - A. Yes. I have a lodger, and a wife and child. This happened between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. I went for the purpose of prostitution, no doubt. I made the excuse for not paying, because the other girls had robbed me. I was going after them when Collins stopped me. She was not in the room when the purse and crown was produced. It was my intention to give

They pulled each other down stairs. They were up five or six steps when I first saw them - the door was then shut. I stopped in the court until the constables came. I am quite sure the prosecutor said he was robbed of a 10 l. note. I did not tell the Justice so, because I was not asked the question.</p>

            . I am beadle. I went to this house a little after nine o'clock, in consequence of information. I found the prosecutor sitting in a chair in the parlour. Haynes was sitting near the fireplace. The prosecutor was in liquor, but was aware of what was going on at the time. He said he had been robbed of a purse and eight or nine sovereigns, and that he had been ill-treated by Haynes, and shewed me marks on his neck as if of knuckles and nails; blood also appeared. He said Haynes did it, which he did not deny. Haynes is not the keeper of the house. Abel described the two girls; I had seen them before. During the time I was there, two officers came to my assistance. I saw the two girls brought up out of the cellar. Collins was afterwards brought up. Abel did not make an accusation against Collins until he got to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. In consequence of information I went to this house. Abel said he had been robbed of eight or nine sovereigns and a purse. I asked him if he should know the girls? - he replied that he should. The women quite corresponded with his representation. He charged Haynes with using him very ill, but did not say in what way. I did not look at his neck; his clothes were dirty, and his neckcloth turned round. I went into the cellar and found the two girls. We brought Mills and Williams up stairs, and the prosecutor said they were the girls that had robbed him. - Saunders found a dollar on Mills. They both denied it; Mills did not say how she came by the dollar. Collins was afterwards found by Saunders in the dust-hole. Abel made no charge against her at that time. He said she had very ill used him, and she ought to be taken up. I afterwards went and took her into custody.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. Haynes sat by the fire with a child on his knee, when I went into the house; Abel stood by the fire. He said he had lost a purse containing eight or nine sovereigns - it was made of chocolate print, in the shape of a bag - that the prisoner Haynes had stopped him from running after the girls. Haynes said he would not tell us why he treated him so; he said they had been scuffling together, and asked him if he belonged to the house? he said</p>
               <p>"No." Another person came in and said he belonged to it. I found Williams first in the cellar; they were part of the way up stairs. The two girls answered Mr. Abel's description. I found Collins afterwards. I asked her what she did there? she said she was frightened. I searched the cellar, but did not find the property, and only found a dollar on Mills, which she said Abel had given her. Abel said that she took out his purse, and held it up to let them know that he had more money, and would not act dishonourable. I found about 7 s. on Mr. Abel, and a cheque for 10 l. or 12 l. in his pocket-book.</p>

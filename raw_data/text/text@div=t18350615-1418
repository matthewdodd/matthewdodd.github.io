                  </hi>. I live in Euston-square. Davis lived with me in May, as footman, and had been so about three months—I have seen Shearing repeatedly at my house—I conceived he was aasisting Davis—he did not attend at table, nor was he a servant of mine—I heard Mrs. Newen ask Davis for some dessert-spoons, as there were not sufficient on the table on the 22nd of May—he replied that there were none—he had the charge of the plate—after dinner, I examined the pantry, and there was a deficiency of eleven dessert-spoons, three table-spoons, six tea-spoons, and three egg-spoons—I told him he must know where they were—he said he did not—I sent for an officer directly, and put him into custody; and before the officer took him away, he said he had pledged two of the spoons in the New-road, at Lance's, I think—he said he knew nothing of the remainder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called into the prosecutor's house on the evening in question—he said he had missed a quantity of spoons, and wished me to question his man-servant and the females concerning it—I asked Davis if he knew any thing of the plate that was missing—he said he did not—I asked him when any of them were missed—he at first said the night before, and then the next morning—I asked him if he had had any person there—he said he had had a friend the night be<lb></lb>fore, and the cook had had a friend likewise—I asked him if he had any reason to suspect his friends—he said he was certain they would not be guilty of such a thing—I asked him their residence—he said he did not know where they lived, nor their names; but he knew them at fellow<lb></lb>servants</p>

               <p>in some place—he mentioned the gentleman's name where they had been living, but I do not recollect it—I heard him tell Mr. Newen he knew four of the dessert-spoons were at a pawnbroker's, in the New. road—he did not give the name—he said he gave them to a friend of his, who was there the night before, to pawn them—I asked him about the duplicate—he said he knew nothing about the ticket—Mr. Newen was writing down, in his presence, what plate was missing—the prisoner took the pen from Mr. Newen's hand, and wrote down the name of "Robert Shearing," as the person who had pawned the plate, on the back of the paper—I asked him if he knew where he lived—he told me he did live at a coffee-shop in Soho-square, but he believed he had removed from there a fortnight before: and I had no occasion to go after him, because he would be there at eight o'clock that evening, to spend the evening with him—I placed another officer to wait for him at the door, and I took Davis to the station-house.</p>

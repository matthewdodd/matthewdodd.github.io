He said, who is that sitting in the parlour; I said, my husband; (he was sitting in a chair in the parlour.) He said, what is the matter with him; I said, he had a paralytic stroke, and he had been twelve weeks wrapped up in blankets. He said, why, did not I apply to a Society for relief, he said, I know a good many Societies; I said, I will work for him as long as I am able. The prisoner said, he was commissioned by the Prince Regent to find out afflicted people, that he might relieve them; I said, I was glad he was go generous to poor people. The prisoner said, what money have you in the house; I said, I had two one-pound notes, and two pounds about me in silver. He said, give me a sheet of paper; he pretended to write; he asked me my husband's name; I said,

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not promise if she would confess, you would not be severe with her? A. I said if she had not taken any thing else- she told me about the boa after a long time.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of November I went with Mr. Humphreys to No. 60, Snowhill - the house was to let; I saw Mury McCarty, and asked if she had a daughter living in Oxford-street, with Mr. Humphreys; she said she had a daughter living in Oxford-street, but she could not tell the person's name; I said I came to search the place; she said I was welcome, that her daughter brought a bundle of things the day before to wash, and they were in the wash - I found some stockings and other things; I went a little higher, and broke open a box, where I found the goods, some glasses, two china dogs, an India handkerchief, a cambric handkerchief, a waiter, a scarf, two crape handkerchiefs, two pairs of slippers, and other things - I asked

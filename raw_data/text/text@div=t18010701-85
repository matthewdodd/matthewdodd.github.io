               <p>Q. Is your shop and premises under the same roof? - A. Yes; on the 4th of April, the premises were safe at nine o'clock at night; I was up that night till twelve; the next morning, Easter Sunday, about nine o'clock, I perceived the lead-work of two windows cut; they were half-circle windows, to let light into the warehouse; it was perfectly safe the night before; it was so conspicuous a part of the shop, that if it had been broke before I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the rest of your premises safe? - A. Yes; I then examined the warehouse, and found all the goods taken from the window; the whole window was cleared; there were between nine and ten dozen of boot-legs, I cannot speak to the quantity exactly, but I think thereabout, and some calves-skins, and sheep-skins, and two graining boards.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the use of a graining board? - A. It is to raise a false grain in the leather before it is dry.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the amount of your loss? - A. It was under 20l. I think.</p>
               <p>Q.Would it amount to 10l? - A. Yes, and upwards; I received no information till the 18th of May, I then received information; in consequence of which I took out a search warrant, and went with the officers

               <p>Q.What did the prisoner say about it? - A. He said he met a person near Whitechapel, and asked him if he wanted to buy some leather; that he asked him, what leather it was, and he told him boot legs; he asked him how much he wanted for them, he said 15l. for the lot; he said he would have them at that, that he had not money enough in his pocket; if he would call on him he would pay him what he could; the person called on him, and he paid him 5l. or five guineas and a-half, I cannot say exactly, and the prisoner brought a man forward to prove that he saw him pay the money, and produced the receipt.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Queen-square, Westminster; I went with Mr. Fell to the prisoner's lodgings, where I found seventy-one pair of boot legs at the top of the house in the back garret, and five pair in a cupboard in the same room; I did not find the graining boards; I have had them ever since. (Produces the property.)</p>
               <p>Q.Did you afterwards apprehend a person of the name of Beetle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any note in your possession? - A. No; Marlden has it; I saw it delivered to Beetle at the office by a woman, and by the desire of the Magistrate I went after the woman, and I was obliged to bring her back by force; I took her to Tothil-fields Bridewell and shewed Harris to her, and she said he was the man that desired her to deliver the note to Beetle. Harris at first said, he did not; she said, do not deny it, for he had got it; I held it up in my hand, and then he said he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing respecting these things? - A. Yes; he said he could bring a person forward that could speak concerning purchasing these things in Whitechapel; I did not know he was a shoemaker; I know the man very well, he used to go about with a horse and cart selling potatoes and such things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. I believe he not only said that he had bought them in Whitechapel, but produced a person to prove it? - A. There was a person there, but I did not hear him examined.</p>
               <p>JOHN MARSDEN sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010073"></xptr>Knowlys. - I am a police-officer; I went to the prisoner's lodgings; I was at the apprehension of Beesle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of any note? - A. Yes; in consequence of what Messenger told me, I took this note from Beetle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before he was examined? - A. I believe it was the prisoner owned it to be his writing (it is read) "You know nothing, for nothing has been said about you."</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Fell.) Look at these things, do you know that any of them are your property? - A. Yes, they are all mine; the sheep-skins have had the mark cut off; here is one of these boot-legs that I can speak positively to; it is my man's dressing, and has his mark upon it; I have no doubt, from their appearance, of their all being mine; the growning boards I buy of a person of the name of White, and his name is upon the side of them; Martin Bignell is the man's name who dressed this skin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Did you manufacture these bootlegs yourself? - A. I did; part of these I had bought of a shoemaker, and part I manufactured; my man was a young beginner, and spoiled best part of them; this is one that I gave him to try.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever sell any boot-legs of his dressing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were sold with the mark on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This graining board is just the same as every other graining board that any other currier might have? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Every graining board made by White would have his name upon it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A graining board is an instrument used in your business as a currier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an instrument made use of by shoemakers? - A. No; they cannot use them.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that the night of this robbery you lost two graining boards of that description? - A. I cannot say that I did, for there were more in the window.</p>
               <p>MARTIN BIGNELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a journeyman to Mr. Fell; this boot-leg I know to be Mr. Fell's; it has my own mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you make any more at the same time? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. A dozen or more? - A. Yes, about a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of them? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BIDDLE, sworn. - I am workman to Mr. Fell.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at these boot-legs. and tell me if they are your master's? - A. Yes, I believe them all to be my master's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Your master is in a good line of business? - A. Yes; he is in a capital line of business.</p>
               <p>Q. And makes a great many of them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear that a great many more bootlegs like them have not been sent out and sold within these two years? - A. No; these are what are called Basil legs.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never sold any since Christmas? - A. I cannot say; Basil legs are very uncommon; I never saw any Basil legs in any other currier's shop in my life but Mr. Fell's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Do you mean to say the whole seventy-one are your master's? - A. I really believe they are.</p>
               <p>Court (To Fell.) Q.How do you deal in these things? - A.These Basil legs are what I bought of a shoemaker; he bought them at a sale, thinking he was buying a bargain, and was taken in, and I meant to cut them up as useless things; they are cut out of sheep-skins, and, upon my oath, I never sold a pair in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever sell to shoemakers? - A. Yes, I have sold twenty dozen at a time.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAVIES sworn. - I am a journeyman to Mr. Fell.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at these boot-legs? - A. I believe them to be my master's; I have worked for Mr. Fell two years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Are you a journeyman in the retail way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. About the beginning of March, I was going through Whitechapel, with half-a-dozen pair of men's shoes to Mr. Philips's; a little below Whitechapel-church, on the opposite side going down Whitechapel, I met with Mr. Philips, who returned back with me, on account of saying me for the shoes; Mr Philips stopped to make water, I stood on the pavement, a man came up and pitched a bundle of leather on the pitching-block that stood there; seeing me with shoes in my hand, he says, Well, Mr. Shoemaker, how goes trade? my answer was, middling; he then asked me, if I was a master or a journeyman; I told him I was a master; he asked me what I gave a pound for cordovan; I said it was according to the quality of it; he said he could tell what he had for more money than I said; he then asked what I gave for wax-leather bellies; I told him I very seldom used any thing of the kind; he then asked me if I would buy some calf-skins, he said he had got a dozen and a-half of small ones; I told him I should like to see them, if they would come reasonable; he said they would; I then proposed to go back to his shop or house to look at them; he said, they would be ready for sale in a day's time and I might call and see them if I would give him my address, and that he would go back with me then, but the load he had was heavy, and he was going home with it to a man that had bought it at his shop; I then gave him my address and he called; when he called at my house, I agreed with him for the skins,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010074"></xptr>and paid him part of the money; he called in a few weeks after that for the remainder, and then said he had got several pairs of boot-legs to sell, if I would like to see them; I told him if he would let me see them, if I liked them I would buy them; I told him I had been spoke to by several of my masters to make them boots; it is a common thing were a shoemaker keeps a shop, for masters like me to serve them with both shoes and boots; after this he came according to his promise with the boot-legs; that was on Friday the 10th of April, he brought the boot-legs, and I bought them of him, and paid him 5l. in part of the money; I bought them at 3s. a pair; there were eighty pair of them; I do not immediately recollect what they came to; it is in my pocket-book, but my pocket-book is not here; he called afterwards, and I paid him 5l. more, and after that he called again, and I paid him the remainder, but I do not recollect how much it was; the officers took my pocket-book while I was not at home, and they looked over the things in it, and I suppose the receipt was rather torn, but I found afterwards but one receipt and half another; the one that was ripped in two was the first; they took away some duplicates too from my pocket-book; I was not at home when the officer came; when I came home, I saw two men on the stairs loaded with leather; I might have made my escape if I chose; when I came in, Mr. Marsden said, well Mr. Harris, we are come to borrow some leather, I told him, if they had more right to it than I had, they were welcome; as to these graining boards, I was at one time intending to get up my own leather; I dare say Mr. Fell knows I had a convenience for currying my own leather by one man.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Fell.) Q.Was there any appearance of currying going on? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see a currier's beam? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Messenger.) Q.What sort of a shop does this man keep? - A. He has had several apprentices; he gets apprentices, and after he has had them sometime he sends them off for sailors and soldiers.(For the Prisoner.)</p>

               <p>Q. Now write Joseph Reeves. (The witness wrote it.) - A.When I came in, he said, gad, shopmate, you are just wrong; why, says I master, I think I am just right, for here is plenty of leather about; ah, says he, but there is not money.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a man is this Reeves? - A. A tall stout man; I do not recollect particularly how he was dressed.</p>

               <p>Q.Then from the 10th of April, to the time of his being in trouble, he did not employ you to make any boots for him? - A. No; I work chiesly upon men's work.</p>

               <p>Q.How soon was it before she came in? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I don't know that she was there during that time, but once; she might come in again, but I do not know whether she did or not.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was it before you had that pot of beer, after you went in? - A. It was not four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you stop there? - A.Perhaps fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go to Harris when he was under confinement? - A. Yes; I have worked for him since.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it customary for men who take piece work, to put the work out to other piece workers? - A. Mr. Harris used to put out half a dozen pair of shoes to each of his workmen; he buys the leather, makes up the shoes, and sells them to a wholesale shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Then the shops employ a man to find leather; who is to find other men to do the work? - A. Yes, he goes to the shops, and gets orders, and then buys the leather, and gets them made up.</p>

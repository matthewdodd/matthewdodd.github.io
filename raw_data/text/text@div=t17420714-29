            . June the 6th, I went out into the Fields, and fell fast a sleep, and lost all the Things, (which he mentioned ) they were all found upon this Woman except the Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these Things in your Pocket when you went to sleep?</p>
               <p>Read. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it?</p>
               <p>Read. It was one Monday Morning, about 5 o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be asleep at that time in the Morning ?</p>
               <p>Read. I ought to have been at my own House; but I was overtaken in Liquor, and fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know when the Prisoner took these Things from you?</p>
               <p>Read. I do not know exactly when she took them from me. She followed me up into the Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she followed you up into the Fields, when you were so much in Liquor and fast a-sleep?</p>
               <p>Read. I do assure you she did follow me into the Fields ; the first Place I happened to meet with her at, was in Holbourn, behind Gray's Inn Gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to her Lodging with her?</p>
               <p>Read. Yes, Sir, I did: She asked me to go in? I told her I wanted to go home; she insisted on my going in; I was coming out again, she said, pray, Sir, have patience; but I came out directly, accordingly she followed me into the Fields, up by the New-River-Head. I was much out of order. I did not want her much: She sat down by me, and I fell fast a sleep: I do not believe I had been a-sleep above a Quarter of an Hour, but I started up, and the first thing I felt for was my Watch. I happen'd, to have two Guineas and a Half in my Waistcoat Pocket. I missed my Watch, and the other Things out of my Pocket, and 2 s. 1 d.</p>
               <p>[The Things were produced in Court.]</p>
               <p>Read. All these Things are mine. I lost them.</p>

            , Constable. They brought this Woman, as a Prisoner to me, in the Morning, and I took her into Custody, the Keys and the Watch they told me, were found upon her; but I did not see them found. I told her if she did not let me have the Watch, it would be worse for her; she said the Watch should be left at such a Place, and I found it there. -</p>

               <p>Q. Who took the Things from her?</p>
               <p>Read. I took all but the Watch, out of that young Woman's Pocket; the Watch she had conveyed away. <rs id="t17420714-29-verdict140" type="verdictDescription">

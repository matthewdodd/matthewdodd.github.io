               <p>I am shop-woman to Mr. Chipchase: On Monday last, about half after ten in the morning, the prisoner came in to the shop; there was nobody there but myself; I had just left the counting-house, and seeing a back door open, as I was coming back to my seat, I went to shut it, and saw the prisoner come in from the street, and take a carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prosecutor's property? - A. Yes; he put it on his shoulder and left the shop; he was about a dozen yards from me; I believe, he did not see me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there between you, to conceal you? - A. Nothing; the carpet stood very near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the shop? - A. Not a minute; only while he put it on his shoulder; I followed him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go leisurely, or fast, or how? - A. Very leisurely, till he was out of sight of the shop; he then began to hasten his pace; he went up a street opposite the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you raise a cry against him? - A. I did not suspect him to be a thief, till he mended his pace; I saw a chairman, at a house adjoining; I desired him to call stop thief, for he had stole a carpet; he called after him, and he began to run he threw it down, and I staid with the carpet while he was pursued.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man taken? - A. No; he was brought back again in about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you when you saw me come into the shop? - A. I was shutting the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you ask me what I wanted? - A. I did not suspect him to be a thief; we have a number of men at work in our house; and there had been a man in, just before, with just such a coloured coat.</p>

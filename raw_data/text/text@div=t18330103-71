             (Police-constable H 150,) I was in Montague-street, Spitalfields, on the evening of the 16th of December - I saw my brother officer Reynolds there, and went with him to a house in <placeName id="t18330103-71-crimeloc419">Pelham-street</placeName>

             (Police-constable H 138.) I was with Seaman, and assisted in detaining the prisoner; here is the glass which was in the basket - some of the squares fit the sash window, some the shop front, and some the door; I found on the prisoner two knives, the handles of which are plastered with putty, and they are bent in the blade.</p>

            . I live in High-street, Wapping, and am employed by Mr. Ireson in the house in question. I had fastened it up the day before, and taken away the key; the prisoner had been employed there as a bricklayer's labourer, but had nothing to do with the cellar - I had fixed the glass in the sashes myself.</p>

            . I live in Whitechapel. The house belonged to me - it was nearly finished; I missed fifty-one squares of glass, which had been taken out, as it appeared, with a knife; I think they were worth 5l. or 6l. - they cost me 5l. 18s. to put in again; the house was let, and the tenant was to have gone in on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The cellar is not under the house. Witness. It goes down a step or two, and is partly under another house; the prisoner had no business there at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that having differed with the prosecutor on the subject of wages, and hearing of another job, he had gone to the premises to fetch his tools, and on the Policeman making his appearance, he stumbled against the basket, and was accused of stealing it.</p>

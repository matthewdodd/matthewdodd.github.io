            . I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought there - he had these boots on, which he said were Mr. Opperman's; he owned that he had taken two coats, a looking-glass, a set of fire-irons, and several other small things - there was no promise or threat made to him, but he was asked what he had done with the things;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160014"></xptr>he said he had taken them, that he had sold them, and was sorry for it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a wheelwright; I work with Mr. Eldridge, a farmer; his house was broke open, and I was at work at the house about ten yards off; a man came down to Edmonton, and said, there were some things found that had been stole from there; and we found a pair of stockings, marked R. C. in a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they found? - A. Upon the prisoner, in Mr. Rombold's out-house, on Friday the 8th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken up before you found the things? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell how that bag came there, of your own knowledge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found in that bag, however, a pair of stockings? - A. Yes; and a white handkerchief, or a neckcloth, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any pawnbroker's duplicates? - A. Yes, after that, at the Rose and Crown, at Edmonton; we watched in the shed, to see who would come for these things; and we saw him come in about half past eleven.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body with him? - A. No; as soon as he came in, a man laid hold of him; he said, don't hurt me, I will not resist; I caught hold of him by the collar, and told him, if he did, I would knock him down; I took him out of the shed, to a gate; a man said to him, he had got himself into the worst hobble he ever had got into; he said, he could not help it, he should be transported for it, he supposed; I had known him a great while, but never heard any thing ill of him before; I asked him what he had got about him, and he pulled out a red-morocco pocket-book, with five duplicates in it; (producing them)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Needes.) Look at these duplicates, and see if any of them correspond with your's? - A. Yes; here is one for a smock-frock.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Tyler.) Look among these duplicates, and see if you know any of them? - A. Yes; two of them, a shirt and a pair of stockings, 4s. 31st October; a waistcoat, 2s. 28th of October; both in the name of Hotham.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROOKES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker, this bag (producing it,) was pledged at my shop, but the person that took it in could not swear to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Trimmer. I have the duplicates that were found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brookes.) Look at those duplicates, and see if there is one for that bag? - A. There is a bag, sixpence, the 17th of November; this corresponds with the duplicate that was upon the bag; it is in my mistress's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Horn. This is the bag that the clothes were in; the waistcoat is mine, it is marked R. C. I bought it of the person that gave me the stockings; these stockings I cannot swear to, there is no particular mark, but they are very much like mine; this shirt is mine, there were a pair of silver buttons in the sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not there now, I suppose? - A. No; this is my frock, it has a stain behind the collar, and is worn at one wrist.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. They took away a handkerchief, and a pair of stockings from me, that are my own property, I hope I shall have them again.</p>

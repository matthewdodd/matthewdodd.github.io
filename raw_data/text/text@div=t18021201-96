             sworn. - I am a furnishing-ironmonger, the prisoner worked for me on the 10th of November; on Saturday the 13th, he brought a set of fireirons, and asked me to buy them, for which, saying, he would take twenty-four shillings; I asked him how he came by them, he said, he had raffled for them, and won them; I thought they were not honestly come by, because the price was too small; I enquired where he raffled for them, he said, the King's-arms, in St. George's-fields, I went there to enquire, and many other public-houses, but it was not so; it struck me then, that he had been servant to Mr. Stratton, and a few other circumstances led me to suppose they were his irons; I went to him, and he saw the irons, which he owned, and the prisoner was then apprehended, (the irons produced, and identified by Geddard;) I should have been glad to have bought them at 40s.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JOHNSON sworn. - I work with Messrs. Stratton, and know the prisoner; I went to work on the Thursday morning, about half past five, and found a hat with the him cut off, behind some sender plates, which I believe to belong to the prisoner. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Parker. The prisoner worked in that hat in my shop, he lost it the day of the robbery, and came in another the next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not steal the irons, they were given to me by a man, looking like a porter, in a blue jacket and white trowsers, on London-bridge; I took them to my master, and asked twenty-four shillings, and he said, he would give a guinea for them at night.</p>

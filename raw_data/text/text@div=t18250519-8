            . I work at the Three Cups, Aldersgate-street. On the 15th of April, between five and six o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Wood-street - another man was with them; they were following the prosecutor's waggon, on the pavement; Warren stopped, and pointing to a house, said to the third person. "I am going there on Saturday morning;" I had seen them all three before. I told the carman my suspicions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon afterwards did you see either of the prisoners? A. About half-past six o'clock, and on the 26th I saw Warren in Goswell-street - I did not know where he lived; he was moving goods in a truck, and was taken that day.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutors' service. I was following Hitch's waggon, and met Thrale in Wood-street, and from what he said I followed the waggon down Wood-street, and before I got to London-wall, it turned into Whitecross-street; I had a cart myself, and when I came into Fore-street I saw a man going down the street with a truss; Warren came up, hit him on the shoulder, and told him to go on; I kept running after the man with the truss, and at the corner of Grub-street he threw it down and got away. The prisoner Henry came and shoved me away from him, to keep me from catching him; I am certain of Henry - he said, "You *** what have you to do with it?" I turned round, and secured him directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain of Warren? A. I really believe him to be the man.</p>

            . I live in Weymouth-street. On this evening I saw the prisoners in Fore-street - my attention was first attracted by Warren saying to another man, who had a truss on his shoulder, "Go on," in a hurried manner; I looked at them, and as I turned to go on Underwood was in pursuit, and Henry was behind him; Underwood got up, and a scuffle ensued between him, the man with the truss, and Henry; the truss was thrown down - the man got away: Henry was scuffling with Underwood. I cannot say whether Warren was near then.</p>

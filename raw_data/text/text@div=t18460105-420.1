                  </hi>. I live at No. 60, New Church-street, St. Marylebone, and am a shoemaker. On the 26th of Dec. I lost four pairs of boots, between one and two o'clock in the day—they had been hanging in front of the shop door—I saw them safe at one o'clock, and missed them about half-past one—I afterwards found one pair of them at Mr. Trail's, a pawnbroker, in Church-street—the others are not found.</p>

I live in Exeter-street, Lisson-grove—a little after one o'clock, on the 26th of Dec, I saw two persons, one of whom I firmly believe was the prisoner—I would not positively swear to him, but I have no doubt about its being him—they were at Mr. Flight's shop window—soon after that my attention was called by my wife and they were both running away—the one who I believe to be the prisoner stopped in Church-street and pulled out Mmething from his jacket, which I saw was either boots or shoes—I saw the soles of them, I did not Bee what he did with them—I went to Mr. Flight's and gave information.</p>

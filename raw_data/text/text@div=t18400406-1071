                  </hi>. I am single, and keep a preparatory school for young gentlemen, in Canonbury-place, Islington. On the evening of the 5th of March, about seven o'clock, or a few minutes after, I was walking with two of my pupils, Wilkinson and Fortescue, who are both eleven years old, through Canonbury-field—it is a regular highway—I overtook a man, who stopped when I came near him, drew a little on one side, and said, "I will thank you for some money"—I said, "I have none to give away"—he then went behind me, and on coming to the other side he said, "I have been told you have, and I must have some"—I said, "I have a few shillings only in my pocket," and felt in my pocket—he came close to me, showed me a pistol in one hand, and held the other for my purse or whatever money I had—I gave him my purse, on seeing the pistol, from fear—he held the purse up on my giving it to him, went behind me, and went away—it contained half-a<lb></lb>sovereign and two or four shillings, I am not certain which—I had not the opportunity of noticing his face, but I noticed his figure—I did not notice his voice particularly, I was too much frightened—the prisoner was thinner when I saw him at Hatton-garden than when I saw him in the field, but from his general appearance I then thought it was him, and I am of that opinion still—I did not see his face, as I had rather a thick veil down, and he kept rather on one side.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A few minutes after seven o'clock on Thursday, the 5th of March—I am quite sure of that—he held his hand for the money—I did not recollect at the moment whether I had my parse, or my money loose in my pocket, but I felt my purse, and I gave it him, which I should not have done but for the pistol—he did not threaten me, but he frightened me as much as if he had threatened me—he did not say he was distressed, nor any thing like it—he stood by my side, and held the pistol in his band—I only saw the barrel of it—I saw the whole of the barrel, not the stock—I did not see the lock nor the handle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could you tell it was a pistol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From my observation of it—I saw the barrel and the mouth—there are other tubes like a pistol<lb></lb>barrel, but I think decidedly this was a pistol—he showed it to me to in<lb></lb>timidate me—he did not tell me it was a pistol, nor tell me he would do any thing to me with it—the mouth was not turned towards me—I saw the wood that supports the barrel—I bad my veil on at the time—It was not a very indistinct view that I had—my veil is not a very thick one—I have the same on now—I wear it to exclude the air, being subject to a cough—it was dusk—I will not swear it was a pistol-barrel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old—I am a pupil of Miss Nainby's, and live with her. I was with her on the 5th of March in Canonbury-field—we passed through Paul's-terrace in our way—I noticed a man in Paul's-terrace, it was the prisoner—I am certain of him—he turned</p>

               <p>round and looked at us, which made me look at him—when we were walking across Canonbury-field he was walking before us, then he went behind, and said he would thank Miss Nainby for some money—she said she had none to give him—he then came before her, and showed her the pistol, and she gave him the money—I saw the pistol—I noticed the barrel and the lock—I noticed his features—I had seen him before on Paul's-terrace, and knew him to be the same man—I was noticing him when he produced the pistol, and had the purse from Miss Nainby—I was alarmed, which made me look at him more—it did not take long—I positively swear he is the same man—I have no doubt about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross'examined.

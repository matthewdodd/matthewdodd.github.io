             sworn. I am an officer of Bow-street; I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of this month, I took from her all the duplicates that I found of these things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, let me beg leave to lay my case before you. The prosecutrix and me having lived together in habits of intimacy for several years; my mother died; leaving me a legacy to be paid at a future period, which the prosecutrix knows, she living at my mother's when she died, and afterwards with me; she having occasion to leave my lodgings, left her box with me, and knowing that I was subject to fits, gave me leave to pledge some of her articles, which were to be restored when I got my legacy; a difference taking place between us, she thought proper to bring me before the justice at Hatton Garden, and the said prosecutrix there promised to take the duplicates, and I should pay her the money by instalments, but instead of taking the duplicates she appeared at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix) At whose house did you lodge in - A. At Weldon's mother's room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160052"></xptr>Q. Do you know of any legacy. - A. She had something left in a gentleman's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her leave to pledge there things for her or you. - A. Never in my life, I had left them in the same room for three or four years, and I had the key of the trunk with me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Orme, a botcher, in Muns<lb></lb>ter-street, Regent's-park—my master's house is near the barracks. I bow a dog belonging to the Marquis of Worcester—about nine o'clock in the morning, on the 27th of June, I saw that dog at my master's—it then had a collar on—I had noticed that collar before*—it had on it the name of the Marquis of Worcester, 1st life Guards—I was caressing the dog on the Doming of the 27th, and I saw the prisoner standing near the curb-stone—he said if I did not mind the dog would have something off the block—I said I did not think he would, as I knew the dog before—in two or three minutes I noticed the dog go away, and the prisoner follow him—the; went towards the New-road—I was going on with my business, but continued to watch them—I had them in sight about ten minutes—I lost light of them first by their going into Clarence-gardens—I saw them come out on the other side, and the dog was following the prisoner—I could not see at that distance how the dog acted, but I had before seen the dog pleated with the prisoner, and look in his face and wag its tail—I know a butcher of the name of Matthews—I saw the dog go inside his shop, and the prisoner waited outside—the dog came out, and they went on together till I lost sight of them—I could not see whether the dog bad the collar on when they came out of Clarence-gardens.</p>

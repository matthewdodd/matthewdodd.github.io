               <p>Q. On the 28th of March, did you meet with the prisoners any where. - A. Yes, both of them. They were standing at a door No. 5, Dyot street, about half past three o'clock in the afternoon; they laid hold of me by the collar and asked me to come in.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them laid hold of you by the collar.

            . Upon her taking hold of me by the collar I went into the room with them; when I got into the room they began shoving me about and putting their hands in my pockets. I gave them a shilling to get rid of them; they shut the door and robbed me of three half guineas and six shillings; they unbuttoned my small clothes by force.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of them did. - A. Both of them. One of them put her arms around my neck, and Grace took the money out of my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let her do that. - A. The <rs id="t18080406-50-deflabel279" type="occupation">black girl</rs>

               <p>Q. What did they take out of your pocket. - A. Three half guineas and six shillings, my pocket was turned inside out, and she had the money inside of her hand; I laid hold of Grace's hand and got two half guineas out of her hand; she called out to the other girl and said he has got some of the money, and he will have all the money back; while I was getting the money out of Grace's hand, Mandeville bit my wrist, cut the side of my head, tore my shirt, and gave me a black eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Grace give any money to her. - A. Yes, half a guinea and six shillings, she gave to her all the money that I had not got back; I stood with my back against the door to prevent them going out, thinking I could get some assistance to have them taken up; finding no assistance I went to a public house, the next house but one to it, to wash my blood off; a constable was in the house, the constable went with me to the house to take them up, they were gone out of the house; we returned back to the public house, looked out of the window; I saw Grace walking up the street; the constable went and took her to the watchhouse; Mandeville was not found till the Thursday following; here is my shirt tore all to pieces.</p>

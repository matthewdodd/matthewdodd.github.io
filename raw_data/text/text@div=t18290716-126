On the 12th of April, 1819, Elizabeth Briggs, the prisoner, was in our service - I knew all the rest of her family, but not her father, who is the other prisoner; I had another servant at the time - on that day, we were at dinner about four o'clock, and I heard Elizabeth scream on the stairs; we all ran out, and saw her screaming, and very much terrified - I asked what was the matter; she said there were thieves at the top of the house - we ran up stairs, and found the wardrobe open, and every thing in the bed-room in disorder; I eventually missed all the property stated: I have found a black square veil, a brooch, a spice-box, and a pair, of black ear-rings, which are now in Court - they were found on the 30th of June last; I had left my articles all safe at two o'clock on the day they were stolen - I had been very unwell, and had not left my bed-room till that time: I had no suspicion at all of Elizabeth Briggs - she remained in my service from six to nine months afterwards - I never discovered who the thieves were; I lost a 30l. note and some medals in a mahogany case.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mile-end Old-town. I have known Thomas Briggs about six months - he is the father of the other prisoner - he came to me on Monday, the 29th of June, respecting a warrant which he wanted against his son George for striking him- I said he must apply to the office; he then said he wished to speak to me respecting a robbery which took place ten years ago; I told him to go to the watch-house, and said I should be there presently - he went to the Hay Field public-house, and I found him there; he told me his daughter had committed a robbery on a Mr. Taylor, of Fleet-street, and among the other property was a 30l. note; he said that note had been changed at Mr. Manning's, a linen-draper, at Aldgate, and with the produce of it he had built a cottage in Pocock's-gardens, Bethnal-green - he said there were a number of medals which he had pawned at a pawnbrokers's, in Church-street, Mile-end, New-town, and that the property was brought away in a mahogany box, and the box was sawed up for fear of a discovery; I went to Mrs. Taylor's, and found the robbery had been committed at the time; I found Elizabeth Briggs by the direction which her father gave me in writing, at No. 34, Union-street, Well-street, Oxford-street, where she was living with her uncle, who is a shoe-maker - I said I wished to speak to her; I went upstairs with her and Mrs. Taylor - I asked her if she knew any thing of the robbery - she burst into tears, and said she did; I asked if she knew any thing of the mahogany box - she said she did; she at first said she found it on the stairs, but afterwards said she did not, and admitted that she took it home to her father and mother, then living in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, but could not recollect how she took it - I asked if she knew the contents - she said she did not, it was not opened in her presence; I searched her box, and found this lace square, and after her examination she told me I should find these other articles at her brother's - I went there, and found two boxes which were sealed and brought away - these things were in them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ask how she came to do this? A. Yes, and she stated that her friends were in great distress, through her father's miscorduct and drunkeness, and she had never had a day's health since; she was in great distress - I had her in my arms for nearly two hours at the office; she said she had many times thought of going to divulge it to her mistress - I have heard a very good character of her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. James's-grove, near the Rosemary Branch, in the Commercial-road. I am a traveller—on 21st Sept., 1849, I was in Prospect-place—I lived then in Charlotte-street, in the Kent-road—I was at the Royal Fort, beer-house, in Prospect-place,</p>

               <p>between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I saw a cart drive up with two men in it—it came in a direction from the canal-bridge, and stopped opposite Mr. Kedge's door, between that and the wheelwright's on the other side Mr. Kedge's door from me—I saw the prisoner—he came and looked me in the face—he was walking on the pavement—I had never known him before—it was about half-past seven—it was rather dusk—the lamps were lighted at the Royal Fort beer-house—the prisoner came right up to me—he did not speak—I had a good opportunity of seeing his face—I am quite sure he is the man—after he looked roe in the face he went to Mr. Kedge's shop, and I saw him take an easy chair and put it over the back of the cart—he then got over the back of the cart, and got into it, and they drove away very fast indeed—it was a light spring cart—I gave information to Mrs. Kedge immediately—I saw the prisoner again on the 6th Nov., 1849—he was in custody at Marlborough-street—I pointed him out.</p>

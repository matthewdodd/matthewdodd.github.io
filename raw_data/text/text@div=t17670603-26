               <p>Q What money did he produce?</p>
               <p>Steward. He pulled out two or three shillings, and a sixpence or two; my master charged a constable with him, and took him before my Lord-Mayor.</p>

               <p>I had been ailing a long time of the ague and fever, and I took two loaves out of the basket; I was almost starving, and the prosecutor was so good to give me one of the loaves.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you give the prisoner any bread?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did, after he was committed; he asked me for one, and I gave him one. I should not have given the Court this trouble, only within about six weeks I have lost twenty-two quartern loaves.</p>

                  </hi> (the younger.) I live in Wellclose-square. On the 25th of March, a little before five o'clock in the evening, I was in East Smith<lb></lb>field—I felt something shake my pocked—I turned, and no one was near me within half a yard—I had passed the prisoner, and he could not have been then half a yard from me—when I turned he was about a yard from me m and I saw be was eyeing me very attentively—I went to him and saw that his pocket pro<lb></lb>jected—I opened his pocked—he resisted, and I tore his pocked—I found my handkerchief in it—when I produced it, he said it was his—I know it is mine by the private mark.</p>

                  </hi>, I live at 25, Queen's-road, Chelsea. On the afternoon of 28th Feb. I went to a watering-place in Exeter-street, Lisson-grove—I heard some one say it was his turn next—I turned, and saw the prisoner standing about a yard from me—I came out, went up the road a little way, and then found my handkerchief was gone—I had seen it safe just before I went to the watering-place.</p>

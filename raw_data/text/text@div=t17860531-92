               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Was it a pattern you kept for sale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You now are a bankrupt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long is it since the commission issued? - The 2d of last month I think.</p>
               <p>Your time for passing your last examination is not expired? - I surrendered the first day of meeting; I have not undergone any examination.</p>
               <p>Was it a friendly commission? - No, I do not suppose it is, at least I hope it will be friendly to me; I have been very much ill used by the world, in consequence of a partnership I had; my partner having left me, my attorney told me that nothing but a commission of bankruptcy would clear me; and ever since that I have been endeavouring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310113"></xptr> to bring this partner forward; it has cost me a great deal of money in law; I suppose I broke for about a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>You kept an auctioneer's and upholsterer's shop in Holborn? - I did.</p>
               <p>May be the bankruptcy came upon you by surprise? - I was out of the way; I was confined.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to be at home on Sunday the 23d of April? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect about that time giving the prisoner any orders to draw any cyder for any body? - No; I will tell you the whole of that.</p>
               <p>Did you on that Sunday 23d of April cause the prisoner to draw any large quantity of cyder? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him to carry a quantity of cyder to Mr. Wordsworth? - I told him to bring it to me; the cyder was very flat; it was seventy-two gallons; it was sent to Mrs. Ayres.</p>
               <p>Did you give this man directions to take sixteen gallons to Mr. Wordsworth on Sunday morning? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Ayres desire him in your presence? - I do not recollect; but I drink it now every day; there were no orders.</p>
               <p>Did he bring you any champaign? - Not that I know of; the prisoner continued in my service till my bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>From the time of the prisoner's marriage, you began to suspect him? - Upon my word, and my oath, the reason why I did not take him up, was because of my respect to him.</p>
               <p>For what purpose, and under what pretence, did you order the carpets to be sent to Mrs. Wordsworth's? - To cover a debt of Mrs. Parr's, my mother-in-law; she is a poor woman.</p>
               <p>When were these removed? - Much about that time; the order was not given at the time that the order for the cyder was given.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after? - I do not know, I cannot say, I will not say; I can say it was not at the time.</p>
               <p>What might be the amount of Mrs. Parr's debt? - Twenty-one pounds.</p>
               <p>What became of the carpets after they were taken to Mr. Wordsworth's? - Mrs. Parr had them; they were under twenty pounds; there was some carpets and ticking; I understood afterwards that it was not right, and they were returned.</p>
               <p>What was it you understood, that it was wrong to pay your mother in this way? - It was before the first meeting, I mentioned it to the assignees, and they were very sorry it should appear that I had endeavoured to cover one more than another, as I had a partiality for her.</p>
               <p>Who told you this was a wrong thing? - I cannot tell; I did not think it of any consequence to keep in my head; I cannot tell who told me so.</p>
               <p>Did you pay any body else in this way? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not to any body? - I beg your pardon; my Lord, I think this interferes with my last examination.</p>
               <p>Court. I have been very attentively watching his questions, with a view to stop him the moment any thing tended to criminate you; the removal of your effects before bankruptcy, and giving a preference to creditors, though an improper one, is not such as will hurt you, provided you make a full disclosure on your future examination.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, I stand here without accounts; Mr. Garrow comes to question me about circumstances; I can go no farther than my recollection; but upon my word and honour, every thing that comes to my recollection, I will bring forward.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Ayres, if you are unintentionally incorrect, from not having your accounts and papers with you, that cannot be imputed to you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You cannot fail to recollect to whom you have delivered goods; now, tell me to what other creditors you have delivered goods about that time? - None, as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear, upon your recollection, that you have not delivered any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310114"></xptr> goods whatever to any person? - I will swear that I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively that you have not done it? - I will swear that; but goods sent to my warehouse on commission, I have a right to sent back.</p>
               <p>That has been since the commission? - I think it was; an attorney, I forget his name now, in Bartlett's Buildings, sent me some pictures, upon commission; these pictures I was to sell for him on commission, and those not sold, returned; I believe I returned them somewhere about that time, which I am sure I had a right to do; it was before I surrendered myself to the commission; it was while I was at the officer's house, that I gave the orders about the cyder; it was before the docket was struck; the prisoner continued in my service till the commission issued.</p>
               <p>What wages were due to him? - Twenty-eight shillings; he claimed four pounds.</p>
               <p>Where did he apply to you for it? - In Ivy-lane, at Mr. Wordsworth's.</p>
               <p>Did his wife apply to you too? - Yes; it was before the search-warrant; his wife came and behaved impertinently to Mrs. Ayres, and I came and gently put her out of the room.</p>
               <p>What sort of impertinence was it? - She said enough to hurt the feelings of any woman in that situation; and told Mrs. Ayres that now she was but a little better than herself; I could not bear it; I did not mind it to me.</p>
               <p>Was this before the sale of your goods? - Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>And before the search-warrant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And three months after your suspicions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner had the impudence to come himself after his wages? - He did, and he was not a little saucy; he said he must have his wages.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not the prisoner threaten at that time that he would disclose your concealments? - No, I do not recollect he did; he did not, I swear positively; when I spoke to him, and told him he must go to the commissioners, he said no more, but went out of the door.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, before the search warrant was obtained, did not the prisoner threaten you that he would disclose your removal of the property in the way you have stated? - He never said any thing of the kind to me upon any occasion.</p>
               <p>Did he to Mrs. Ayres? - I do not recollect; I heard something of it.</p>
               <p>Did not your wife tell you of it? - Upon my oath, I do not recollect it; I have heard it, that is sufficient.</p>
               <p>No, it is not sufficient; upon your oath, did not your wife tell you of it? - I do not recollect she did; I will not swear she did not; there was a deal of conversation.</p>
               <p>What do you believe? - I do not believe any thing about it.</p>
               <p>But I will make you say something about your belief? - It is very probable she might.</p>
               <p>Did not she, upon your oath? - I will not say, upon my oath, because I cannot.</p>
               <p>You shall say whether you believe she did? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What do you believe? - I believe she did.</p>
               <p>What do you believe she said to you about it? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Where do you believe it was that she told you? - I do not recollect any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Ayres tell you that a man threatened to charge you with concealing your effects? - I believe she did.</p>
               <p>How long before the search warrant was applied for? - Upon my word, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it a week, or two or three days? - Oh, it was more than that, it was a fortnight; the prisoner came to me some time before the bankruptcy, not a fortnight; he said he wanted his wages; I told him he should be paid; he immediately said to me, very well, I am satisfied, and went away; then he came down a day or two after the bankruptcy, and said he wanted his wages; I told him it was entirely out of my power; then his wife came down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310115"></xptr> and behaved so ill to Mrs. Ayres, I could not bear it.</p>
               <p>Was it at that time that the wife had threatened you with discovering the concealing of your effects? - It might be the same day.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it was? - I cannot keep it in my head.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it was not? - I do not believe any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Oh, but you must believe one way or the other? - I do not believe it was the same day, and I have no reason to believe the contrary; I do not recollect when it was.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Parr present when your wife told you that? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Within the last two months, what other persons had you delivered your goods to, either as returning them as belonging to them, or as paying off a debt, or any other way? - To no one; I do not recollect any thing of the kind; I am pretty sure, I think I can swear.</p>
               <p>Mrs. AYRES sworn.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Garrow desired Mr. Ayres to remove out of the view of his wife during her examination; he went out of Court.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner was a servant of our's; I never had any suspicion of him, till I saw a neckcloth of mine about his neck; it was one of my habit neckcloths; it was a week or a fortnight before I discharged his wife, and that was about the 1st of March; I think that was about the 10th; the next day, he came in a silk handkerchief, which increased my suspicion; I said, Harry, I should be glad you would ask Ann whether she has mislaid any neckcloth; he took no notice of it; I never learned where he lived from himself, but I enquired, and found it out; and when the search warrant was taken out, I went with the officers, and it was in Angel-street, St. Martin's le Grand, in a two pair of stairs fore room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is it the same street that Mrs. Wordsworth lives in? - It is; I found two China plates, and a Chinabowl; I said, there is some part of my property; he fell down on his knees two or three times, and said, Mrs. Ayres, for God's sake, do not hurt me, I will deliver you up all your property, but do not take me to prison.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the officer present when he said so? - He was, and likewise the porter who fetched the things, his name is

Here is the fellow to the handkerchief, they are remarkably fine, I do not think there is such another handkerchief; I did not mark it myself; these other things are all fresh marked with the prisoner's mark; says I, Harry, this is the very handkerchief I have been in search after; says he, Madam, I do not know how I came by it, I believe it is your's.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did he say? - I asked him how he came by that bowl; says he, Madam, I took it; he fell on his knees, and said, I will pray for you as long as I live, if you will not send me to gaol; I said nothing to him, before he fell on his knees.</p>
               <p>How long did the wife of the prisoner continue in your service, after he ceased to be in the house? - I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Was it a considerable time? - He was our servant to the very last; but I really do not know; I cannot give you a full answer, I believe it may be about two or three months; I suspected him from the time he would not tell me where he lived; I had communicated my suspicions to most of my friends, and I mentioned about the handkerchief to every body that knew me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, after your husband became a bankrupt, any application being made by the prisoner and his wife for the wages that were due to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was that before the search warrant? - Why, Mr. Garrow, I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310116"></xptr> say; I believe it was about a fortnight before the search warrant.</p>
               <p>The man came first, and then the wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>His wife behaved very rudely to you? - She did.</p>
               <p>She was turned out of the room, I believe? - She was.</p>
               <p>What did they threaten to charge your husband with? - I never heard them say any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>At no time? - At no time.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect yourself, and do not be hasty in answering the question, nor be entrapped by it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am sure, my Lord, I do not wish she should; my question to you, Mrs. Ayres, is, whether at any time they made threats of charging your husband with discovering any concealment of his effects? - I never heard it from either of them.</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear of it, till now that I mention it to you? - No, Sir; I never heard of it till the day before yesterday; I never heard of it before the search warrant.</p>
               <p>Then, of course, you are sure you never told Mr. Ayres that they had made such a threat? - I do not think I ever did say so.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure that you never did? - I cannot be sure that I did not say it since, but not prior to it; I was under no fear of any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Had you ever, before the day before yesterday, or before last Thursday, told your husband that you had heard that they had made such a threat? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of it? - I believe I may say I am quite sure of it; I am, till within this week.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear any body else tell your husband that such a threat was made? - No, Sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>So, after waiting March, April, and May, at last, in the latter end of May, a search-warrant was applied for? - After I missed this handkerchief, I asked Harry where he lived, and he refused to tell me; says I, in case you are wanted, it is very odd you do not give me a direction where you are to be sent for; I asked one Waiter that lives at No. 45, and he did not know, and I asked another person, and he did not know; I made several enquiries, and I was told that Nanny had been seen go in at the green stall; I enquired there about a month ago; I said, Harry, I desire I may know where you live; says he, I live up in the Upper Turnstile, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did you apply for a search warrant as soon as you knew where he lived? - I certainly did.</p>

               <p>How did you find out where he lived? - It was by mere chance that a gentleman saw him go in with a box; had I been to have acted for myself, I should have been after them at any rate; Mr. Ayres would not suffer me to entertain the idea that they were dishonest.</p>
               <p>Did you ever apply to a Magistrate for a search warrant before? - No.</p>
               <p>About what time was it that your husband was arrested? - About the middle of April.</p>
               <p>He was in custody about a week, and then discharged? - I cannot say whether it was March or April.</p>
               <p>How long before the bankruptcy? - Above a month.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect being at your house in Holborn, and giving any directions about cyder, and champaign, and carpets, any time about the 23d of April? -</p>
               <p>Court. The only defence would be, that these identical things were sent.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ask the prisoner where he lived, and he denied telling you? - He would not tell me where he lived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect giving any orders for the removal of any of the goods, after your husband had been arrested, and after he had been in the custody of the officer? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect ordering some carpets and some ticking to be carried? - I do not believe I ordered them; there were such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310117"></xptr> things came down to Mr. Wordsworth's; we had an apartment there.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any champain and cyder carried any where? - There was some cyder that was sent me out of the country.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect giving such orders? - I desired him to carry about a couple of dozen to Mrs. Wall, as a present.</p>
               <p>Was none carried to Mr. Wordsworth in Angel-street? - Yes, there was, but not by my orders.</p>
               <p>Without your knowledge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were your orders? - To take about a dozen and an half, or two dozen of the cyder to Mrs. Wall.</p>
               <p>Had he orders to bring down the carpet and the ticking, or did he bring them without orders? - He had orders to bring them down.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him when you gave him the orders? - It was, Harry you must take that carpeting down to No. 9, Ivy-lane.</p>
               <p>What had passed between you and him about removing things? - I will be upon my oath he never had any general order; he had no orders; he never brought any thing down to me but these things; he never removed any thing to another place by my order, or Mr. Ayres's to my knowledge; I do not recollect giving him the order about the pictures to Bartlett's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you gave any particular orders to the porter, you thought he was bound to obey them? - As a servant he certainly was.</p>

               <p>Did he say he had any orders to bring them away from her house? - I did not hear him say any thing of that sort, he said, the things were hers.</p>

               <p>How came you to conceal your lodging from your mistress? - I did not conceal it; because when the commission was taken out, I left my number where I lived with Mr. Naylor the attorney, I told him to call on me.</p>

               <p>When was the search warrant? - The 25th of May; this was before the search warrant, because they came to me again when the warrant was taken out; it must be the beginning of May that he applied to me first, to know how he could recover his was wages; I told him I would mention it to the assignees; he then mentioned his having threatened Mr. Ayres with respect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310118"></xptr> to the concealment of his effects; he said, in plain terms, that he looked upon it to be concealing of his effects from his creditors; I told him I hoped Mr. Ayres, and those people that took them in, were aware of the consequences; it was a capital offence in Mr. Ayres, and in the people that received them, it was a very heavy penalty; that seemed to deter the young man from going any further in a disclosure, excepting that he did mention a place in Ivy-lane; I told him it will not be very material at present, if Mr. Ayres discloses these things at the time of his final examination, it is very well; if not, you will recollect what things you have carried, and we will see into them; upon the second meeting when the assignees were chosen, Mrs. Parr appeared, and proved a debt of twenty pounds, and on that occasion, she told the assignees that she had some goods in her possession.</p>

You have been convicted of a felony on very clear and satisfactory evidence, and after a very minute and attentive examination, and under circumstances of as great aggravation as I remember to have occurred in any case; your crime is that of a servant robbing his master, and not content with plundering him in a time of distress, robbing him also of his character, and setting up a charge against him that might ultimately have affected his life; under such circumstances, therefore if you had been capitally indicted by your master, who in this case has proceeded mercifully; there appears to have been very little reason to conclude, that his Majesty, (however in general inclined to mercy) would have thought your life one worthy to be spared: the Court therefore think it their duty to pronounce upon you as severe a sentence, as the law enables them to do, which is, that you be</p>

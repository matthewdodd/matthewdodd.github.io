               <p>Q. Did you ever find your clock. - A. Yes, it was found at Mr. Lightfoot's the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>- LIGHTFOOT sworn. This clock was pawned at our house on the 13th of February, for 3 l. by the prisoner, he came again in March, and borrowed another pound on it, I was present both times, and made out the ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the same man. - A. I am positive that he is the man.</p>

             sworn. On the 12th of March, as I stated before, the prisoner applied to me to know if I would buy a clock at Mr. Lightfoot's, I had every reason to believe that he had got this clock as he had the other; I went round to several clock makers to know if they had lost such a thing, I heard Mr. Bishop had lost it; I had the prisoner apprehended.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect the faces of the other three? - Yes; one of them, Denby, he had not so good a coat on as he has now; I cannot be sure, because by moon-light one cannot so well see the colour.</p>
               <p>Had you more than a momentary view of his face? - Yes; I can undertake to swear to him: I had been on the top of the buildings about six in the evening; I saw the state of the buildings then; and when I went up again, I examined, and found a great deal of lead was gone, which, when weighed, weighed four hundred and fifty-eight pounds; that was during the time these boys were on the top of the house: I found all the lead moved inside the roof, upon the cieling; I matched it, and it corresponded: it was from the gutter.</p>

On Thursday night, the 4th of March, me and the three prisoners, all four went up a-top of the house in Hyde-street, and ripped off a great quantity of lead, and moved it out of the gutter: the three prisoners were all with me; they were inside when I was taken; I had just settled the lead.</p>

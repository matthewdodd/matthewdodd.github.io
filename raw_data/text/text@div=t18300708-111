            . I am a saddle and harness-maker, and live in South Molton-street. I had known the prisoner some time - he brought me a saddle on the 22nd of June, in the morning, and said the groom had sent it for me to buy, if I pleased - he asked 15s. for it; I gave him 10s., and said I would return it if the groom did not like that money - I have known the prisoner two years, and knew he was employed in the stable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The groom authorized me to sell it, and asked what it was worth; I said, "I don't know, but Collis will give you as much as any body," and I took it there.</p>

             re-examined. There is no truth in that - I never said so; I sent another saddle to be repaired a week before, which he paid 7s. 6d. for; I had said before that I wanted a saddle - the prisoner took me to Collis', and I saw one which they wanted 3l. for; I left 2l., and said if my employer liked it I would return and pay for it, or pay for the use of it - I took it to the stable; I sent back for the stirrups and girths - my master rode on it, and approved of it; I called in the evening for some longer stirrup leathers - Mr. Collis' man said he was gone out, but would soon return; this was on Saturday - I did not call on Sunday or Monday, but on Tuesday I went to clean my harness, and missed my new saddle; I asked a man where it was - he said the prisoner had taken it to be altered; I went out, and saw the prisoner intoxicated, eating some wilts - I asked him whether he had got the leather to the new saddle; he said, "It is all right;" I then went to Mr. Collis', and saw the saddle on the horse- Mr. Collis said the man had brought it back, and said the gentleman did not like it; that he had given him the 2l. back, and he had paid 7s. 6d. for the use of it for the three days - I then went after the prisoner, and found him in Marylebone-lane; I asked him if he had spent the money - he said Yes, and was very abusive; I had him taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did your master and you mean to keep the new saddle? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLIS. He settled with me for the new saddle, then the brought the old one, and I bought it of him; he said the groom sent it - I thought it belonged to the groom.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner - he was quite intoxicated; he said if he had not been drunk I should not have found him in London.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PITCHFORD. I was in the stable on the morning of the 21st of June, I believe; I was in Lord Winchelsea's brother's service, and since then have been to Melton Mowbray - since then I have been helping in different yards; I went to the Golden Cross yard to see a man named Fisher, who has some horses standing there- I saw Warringe there, and the prisoner was asking him for some money for the work he had done for him; he did not mention any sum, but said, "I want some money to get something to eat and drink, and to get a clean shirt" - Warringe said he had no money, but there was an old saddle which belonged to him, and he would get him to sell it for him; we then went and had some beer - I went before the Magistrate, and stated this; this was between twelve and two o'clock - it was not on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLIS. This saddle was brought to me on Tuesday morning, between nine and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WARRINGE. I never at any time said,"Here is an old saddle belonging to me, go and sell it;" he did ask me for money - I cannot say that I owed him any thing, for I sometimes gave him a pot of ale for any thing he did; I believe he did tell me on Saturday evening that he wanted a shirt; I gave him 1s. now and then when I had it - the new saddle suited my master, and we intended to keep it; we have bought it again; there was 1l. 7s. 9 1/2d found on the prisoner, which the Magistrate ordered to be returned.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made a long Defence, the only part relating to the case was, that the prosecutor had sent him to dispose of the saddle.</p>

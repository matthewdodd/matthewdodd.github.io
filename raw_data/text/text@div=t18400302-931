                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Christian Hinrich Fruchtnicht—he lives in Catherine-street, Limehouse. I was returning home about eight o'clock at night, on the 11th of February-just before I got home I saw three boys standing at the corner—I heard one of them say, "Don't be a fool;" and then the prisoner, who was one of them, and had a flannel jacket on, went to our window, and I saw his hand on the window-frame—I went in and told my mother, and when we came out they were gone—I am sure that the prisoner is the person who had his hand on the window-frame—I watched him five or ten minutes, and that enables me to speak to his face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Christian Hinrich Frucht<lb></lb>nicht—he lives at No. 2, Catherine-street, in the parish of St. Anne, it is our dwelling-house. On the night of the 11th of February, my little girl told me something and I went out into the street—I saw no one, but I saw that some of the things had been taken from the shop window, and that the whole of the pane of glass had been taken out—the window was all in confusion—I had seen the scarf and the other articles mentioned safe about a quarter of an hour before, and the window was then safe—I sent a person round the corner and she came running back and fetched me—I went out and went round to a cart, which was round the corner in James's-street, two doors from our house—I found in the cart this scarf, these four petticoats, five frocks, and six pairs of stockings—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—they are all new, and are the property of my husband, they had been safe in the shop a quarter of an hour before the child came in—when I was in the street I saw the prisoner pass the turning, and Mr. Baker, who was with me, went up to him and said, "Is it you who can't keep your hands to yourself?"—the prisoner said, "I have not been doing any thing to-night"—MR. Baker brought him to the shop and sent for a policeman—while the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the shop he leaned up against the counter, and the next morning when I was patting the shop to rights I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) under the gowns on the counter where he had leaned—the knife does not belong to me.</p>

Q.</hi> Had your window been broken before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a small piece out, and there was some paper behind it which was cut through with the knife—I had not been in my shop all the afternoon, but I served a gentleman with something not a quarter of an hour before—I was not in the shop during the remainder of the quarter of an hour—I did not see the prisoner till I saw him pass the end of the turning—he was not with the cart at that time—the cart was round the turning in a by<lb></lb>place.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the prosecutor's shop when the little girl came in—I ran into the street, and saw the window was out—MRS. Fruchtnicht told me to go round the corner, which I did, and saw the prisoner, who had a flannel jacket on, in the act of putting things into the cart—I swear he is the person—I have no doubt of him—I walked up to him, and passed him, and looked in his face that I might know him again, but I could not take him, being by myself—he ran away from the cart, and I went after him—he did not see me when he put the things into the cart, but he did when he came from the cart—I afterwards took the things out of the cart, and gave them to Mrs. Fruchtnicht—they were her pro<lb></lb>perty—I had seen them before—I told what I had seen, and Mr. Baker went with us, and while we were in the public-house I heard a whistle—we came out, and saw the prisoner pass, and he was taken.</p>

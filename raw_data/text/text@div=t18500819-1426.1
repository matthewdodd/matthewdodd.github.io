My Lord, I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge; I have only been six weeks discharged from the strong-room in the Infirmary of Greenwich Hospital, which can be proved by Sir John Liddell, the doctor of Greenwich Hospital; I trust in God, my Lord, you and my prosecutors will show me mercy, and send me down to Greenwich, and they will keep me confined at the hospital; I have an only daughter; I am afraid it will break her heart if I am sent to prison; I hope, my Lord, you will show me mercy for God's sake, as we all expect mercy from God; I can assure you I know not what I have done, or what has been done.—Your humble petitioner, Dixon Dawson. My Lord and Gentlemen, your most humble petitioner states that it is upwards of sixty years ago since I first went to sea; the first engagement I was in was the landing of the British troops in Egypt, in 1801, when Sir Ralph Abercrombie lost his life; the next was in the year 1803, in cutting out of Cape Legat a large armed schooner full of Spanish and French troops, and I received many severe blows on the head, which caused me to be in a deranged state of mind now I have advanced in years, and at times to be very troublesome; I likewise was on board the <hi rend="italic">Victory,</hi> in the battle of Trafalgar, with my Lord Nelson, when he fell wounded; I likewise was wounded at the same time, and fell close to him on the quarter-deck of the <hi rend="italic">Victory,</hi> on that glorious day, 21st Oct., 1805; and in 1807, I was in Gaeta, in Italy, when the French army stormed the fort I was in, and there I was slightly wounded in four places; and was at the taking of the Island of Capua, the mouth of Naples Bay; from there went to land Generals Moore and Fox on the Calabria shore, and beat the French army</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190047"></xptr>
               <p>back into Naples; from there I was sent with Sir Samuel Hood, to take Madeira, which we did succeed; and was engaged off Guadaloupe, in the West Indies, with two frigates, French, and seven batteries on our ship for two hours and forty minutes; and likewise burning two frigates be<lb></lb>longing to the French, and taking the island of Martinique, in 1809; came home to England, and was sent on board the <hi rend="italic">Fatale Minotaur,</hi> seventy-four guns; I was one of the first men on board the eleven Danish gun-boats, that our ships destroyed by fire under the batteries of Copenhagen. In coming to England our ship was lost, and 600 men with her; I had to swim three miles, and was two hours and three-quarters in the sea before I got on Camperdown, made prisoner-of-war of, and sent to France; remained nearly four years in Valenciennes, half-starved, and when the French were in full retreat from Moscow we were marched 600 miles in that dreadful winter in 1814, through frost and snow, and almost naked, and nearly starved. My Lord, I was never in prison in my life for any crime till now; I hope and trust in God that some humane gentleman will come forward and plead my cause, and snatch two human beings from the brink of ruin; the daughter from a broken heart, and the father that will never be able to look up any more through disgrace; if Mr. Hawes is in Court, I call on him to be so kind as to give me a character since 1816 to July, 1850, and I will for ever pray for all. My Lord and gentlemen, I hope you will help me in the means of procuring a gentleman of the law to plead for me; I am afraid, if I am found guilty, of losing my home for life."</p>

I now live at 48, Roupell-street, Lambeth, and get a pre<lb></lb>carious living by washing and ironing—the prisoner is my father—I have heard him say that he has received wounds in his head—on 23rd February I received a letter from him, an invitation, and went down to Greenwich and met him at the terminus—he said he had been waiting since ten o'clock—he threw his arms round my neck, said "God bless you," and began to cry,—I felt ashamed, and endeavoured to soothe him—I had seen him two or three weeks before—I went with him to the hospital, but could not prevail on him to sit or stand still a minute—he said he had been very bad since he saw me; he had a burning pain in his head, and he had not been to bed for three nights; and that they had kindly accommodated him to sleep on the benches, as he could not sleep in bed; and as it was cold they had been kind enough to light a fire at five o'clock, to make him more comfortable—he said if the pain in his head continued he should go out of his mind—he got very much worse in the evening, and I felt very much alarmed—he said he was so sorry he could not go with me, but he could not hold his head up; he sat on a bench, resting his head on his hand—I do not remember seeing him again before 11th March; my business would not allow me to go down—on 11th March I received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Greenwich Hospital, March 11th, 1850. My Dear and only loving Daughter,—I am happy to inform you that the Lord of Hosts has been pleased to hear the prayers of a poor penitent sinner; the Lord has healed your father, restored his sight and hearing, and has granted me wisdom, knowledge, and an understanding, and loving and forgiving heart to all man<lb></lb>kind upon this earth; and I trust that the Lord will continue to grant us his mercy, and pour down his blessings on all in this world, and to dwell with our blessed Lord and Saviour in the world to come.

My dear, I do not stand in need of a schoolmaster, nor a physician, I have applied to the Great One. To Miss Dawson, No. 24, Roupell-street, Cornwall-road, Lambeth, Surrey")—at the time he wrote this, his hearing and sight were not restored—he is deaf now; I have been obliged to get permission to have him close to the rails of the prison, to make him hear—a fortnight or less after writing that letter, he came to my house, and said he was quite in want of refreshments; he had come up for four days, and mast be nursed like a baby, and I must do it—he raved so for different people to be fetched that I thought it best to send for them, and when they came he scarcely spoke to them—I tried to get him home at the end of the four days, but he would not go—he went out for an hour or two, to go to Chelsea, and lost him<lb></lb>self, and did not come home till six o'clock at night; next day he was so much worse, his face was so red, that I was afraid he would go raving mad, and got him out—he said he had met with an omnibus-man who would take him down to Greenwich for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I wanted to see the man, and he got in a passion, and set out to go by the train; then he said he would walk—I got him to a public-house in the Kent-road, and when I told him he must go home, he stamped and raved, and the police came; he went through the pub<lb></lb>lic-house out at the other door—I got him a good way down the Kent-road, and he would go no further, and I was obliged to go to Walworth with him to see a person to get him borne, and we went by the train to Greenwich-Hospital; I was from eleven o'clock till four getting him home—shortly after he came to me again, and said he had come for four days more—I was very much surprised, as I knew if he had his senses he would know I was not able to keep him; he came on Wednesday and staid till Thursday afternoon—he made this paper out at my house (<hi rend="italic">produced;</hi>) it has the name of Mr. Rivers on it, he is a lieutenant—I thought it was a forgery, and sent it to Mr. Williams at the Discount-office, and told him to take no notice of it; he said he would not—that was about the middle of May—he once sent me two looking-glasses and a pair of plated candlesticks, and said that he should come home with his pockets full of gold, and then how I should smile—"Mary," he said, "you will never believe me, but you will see what I shall give you. I will take a farm; what would you like?—should you like a farm? we can get one for eighty pounds a year, and you shall have a servant to wait on you, and nothing to do but to ring the bell; for you have worked long enough and hard enough"—at that time I am sure we could not produce five shillings between the two of us—when the man brought the glasses I said, "I have my bonnet on now to get him confined at Greenwich; take them away, do not let him see"—I went to Mr. Williams again, and got the loan-paper to take to Greenwich, to show that he was not in his right mind, but was too late to get it—I was told I must send him down by a policeman, for they could not interfere—I did not do so, because I was afraid he would be worse—I came home and found him stretched out in the passage, across the door<lb></lb>way, with his hat doubled up under his head, and he wanted to stay there all night—in the morning I persuaded him to get up at seven o'clock, and get off, and I understood from him that he was called before the council, but he came back the same day; one of the neighbours ran to tell me he was in the streets again—I ran after him, got him home, and kept him that day and part of the next—he kept wandering from one doctor to another, saying, "What</p>

               <p>a dreadful state my head is in, all faces coming before my eyes!"—after chapel on Sunday evening I heard he was driving about in a cab—I conld not find him—I went to Tower-street station, and told the police to take him up, and take him to Greenwich—they sent for me, and I found he was started off to Greenwich—I followed and found him in the guard-house; he had been away all Saturday, Sunday, and Monday night (Whit-Monday)—I saw him again on the Sunday after—he said, "What a while you have been coming! have you got the money? if you had only let me stop in town I should have got the money"—he said to Mr. Williams, who was going to London, "Will you send me the money?"—Mr. Williams said, "Yes"—at the time he wrote the paper proposing the repayment in two months, he had not the slightest means of repayment—on the Sunday week, after Whit-Monday, he begged me to give him some money; I gave him twopence—he seemed thoroughly rejoiced, and said, "Now I have got money"—next day he sent me a letter, but I did not take it in; I knew there was nothing of importance in it—I asked him afterwards what he sent the letter for; he said he wanted some money—three weeks after I had him confined I found him standing in my street, in a pouring rain, looking for me; he went wandering about to see if he could get some money—I never knew him signing people's names before he got bad in his head; a stricter honest man never was, he used to take my clothes home—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his writing; it is from another loan-office (the Waterloo)—I sent to them and told them he was insane, but they took his money, three shillings, and told me they should give me in charge of the police if I insisted on having it back—I never knew him apply for money before he got bad in his head—he was very contented, and when he obtained the situation of mate in Nelson's Ward, he rejoiced because he could help me.</p>

I said, "Being so far off, business has prevented me"—he said quickly, "You could not let us have a sovereign on account, could you?"—he asked if a young woman had been there about him—I said, "Why do you ask?"—he said, "My daughter will come about me, but take no notice of her, for she is as mad as a March hare"—he appeared to me to be not in his right mind—the form has never been filled up properly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, and medical-inspector of Greenwich Hospital. Mr. Littleton was the gentleman in attendance when the prisoner was brought down—I did not see him for four days after his arrival—he was then in the strong-room, which would be appointed for a madman, but it is a ward like the others—I questioned him repeatedly—he said his father had left him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said nothing about 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it would be very diffi<lb></lb>cult for me to give an opinion whether the evidence given to-day indicates insanity upon some one point, because the whole of it might have been produced by intemperance—if he was proved not to be intemperate, then I should have a greater suspicion of insanity—I cannot discover any wounds on his head, but they may have existed previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was reported to you, on the authority of the daughter, that he was out of his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she did not say so; she said he behaved so wildly that she was afraid of him, and had brought him down to me—I placed him in a part of the building which would give me faci<lb></lb>lities for watching him; it is a case of daily occurrence in the hospital—I saw no indication of his having suffered from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—it would not be apparent, except when the paroxysms were on him—it is the result of pro<lb></lb>tracted intemperance generally, and from accidents—I had not known him before in the hospital—if he had had any attack of any kind he would have been brought to me—I discharged him from the Infirmary.</p>

             . Was your House broke open? And, What time of the Night?</p>
               <p>Akens. I can't say positively as to the Time, but it was shut about nine o'Clock. I have a Kitchen next my Shop. I had left the Shop but a few Minutes , but I heard the Sash go up, it might be about ten o'Clock. I came into the Shop, and miss'd the Stuff, and cry'd out I was robb'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of Stuff was it?</p>
               <p>Akens . It was a brown Cloth Sattin Stripe, twenty eight Yards, it cost me 1 l. 12 s.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it before?</p>
               <p>Akens . I saw it an Hour before. There was fortyeight Yards of Flanders Lace I lost besides.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your Window fasten'd?</p>
               <p>Akens. My Sash was down.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you suppose they got in by lifting up the Sash.</p>
               <p>Akens . Yes; and I cry'd I was robb'd, and the Evidence stopp'd them .</p>

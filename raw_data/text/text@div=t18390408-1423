                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you a moral certainty in your own mind that that is the same bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have; I must have had it at the time I took the instructions, or shortly after—my attention was not called particularly to it more than to any other transaction—the prisoner was in the habit of tending from the Bench to me—I have, received letters from Mm, in his handwriting, by French—I sent the money to the prisoner, I think, by my clerk, in February—and in March, 1837, I received a communication from him, and I sent him, by French, the bill on which the action was brought, and some cheques—I believe I sent the bill on which the action was brought—I had no other, but I have said that I am not certain that this is the bill.</p>
               <p>Q.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said you had a moral certainty, what did you mean by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will give you my definition of it—that while there is a possibility of its not being so from some exact imitation of it, still, as there is no ground for believing it has been imitated, I believe it to be the same—when we see a bill we sometimes see it only once—I saw that perhaps half-a-dozen times—I believe there was no other indorsement on it—I will not say my recollection of it must have been very slight—the reason I will not swear positively to it is because I have not seen it for three years.</p>

               <p>In the first affidavit, dated 13th September, 1838, the defendant de<lb></lb>posed that Lady Parker was not detained in the King's Bench on or about the 14th July, 1836, on the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on which the present action was brought, but on another bill of the same date and amount, which the said Lady Parker had accepted in addition to the first—in the second affidavit, dated 20th October, 1838, he deposed, that when he first instructed his attorney, Mr. Hudson, in 1836, he delivered to him a bill of exchange for £40 on Lady Parker, and that he never bad the said bill back from Mr. Hudson, nor had he, to the best of his recollection, ever seen the same since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Camden-town. I am a client of Mr. Austin's, and know him—in consequence of what he wished me to do, on the 17th of January last, I saw the prisoner, I think it was in Braddam's-row, Newington Causeway, I believe it was his house or lodgings—I had received instruction that he was to be found there—I had never seen him before—he asked me if I was aware for what purpose I had come—(he expected me to come to be a witness on the trial, as Rafter's action was then going on)—Mr. Thompson took me there, and introduced me to the prisoner as Mr. Buckingham—the prisoner asked Thompson if I was the person whom he (Thompson) had mentioned to him—Thompson said, "Yes," and that I was a friend of his, and I had come relative to the matter of which they had been speaking—I asked the prisoner what it was he wanted me to do—he said, "I want you to swear that you went with Thompson to Pitt-street"—(it afterwards transpired that Rafter lived there)—he said I must swear that I went with Thompson, and presented the bill at Drummond's, at Charing-cross—that I was to swear that the bill was not paid—that I then accompanied Thompson to lady Parker's house, which he afterwards told me, was No. 13, Park-lane—he told me that was all he wished me to swear—he then addressed Thomp<lb></lb>son, and told him that he must not only swear what I have mentioned he told me, but that he went afterwards to the King's Bench by himself, bringing the bill, which had been dishonoured, back to Lady Parker, and that it was presented at Lady Parker's, in Park-lane, for payment—after seeing the prisoner in Braddam's-row, I saw him at a coffee-shop, in Newcastle-street, Strand, on the 28th of January—I had appointed to meet him there, through Rafter, whom I had met the previous morning—I was at the coffee-house before the prisoner was—he came in and wished me to accompany him to Mr. Kirk, who, I believe, was his attorney, and was bringing that action—I was to go to have the evidence taken, which he had detailed to me, and he gave me this piece of paper as instructions to swear—he brought the paper written, and I indorsed it within a few minutes—a person of the name of Jenkins was at the coffee-shop, for the purpose of detecting this scheme—I</p>

               <p>read this paper over several times, and asked the prisoner particularly if it was his writing—he acknowledged it to be his writing, and said that was what he wished me to swear—he had previously said he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if I would swear, in the Court of Exchequer what he had stated, and when he gave me this paper he said he would give me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>(The instructions were as follows:—" <hi rend="italic">Went with Mr. Thompson to Drum<lb></lb>mond's the bankers, at Charing-cross, to present bill of exchange,</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three <hi rend="italic">months, drawn on Parker, paid to Mr. Clifford, endorsed over to Gibbs, and paid to Rafter—have been at Rafter's house in Pitt-street, have seen Gibbs there several times, and know his hand-writing."</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am an appraiser and broker, and live in South<lb></lb>ampton-street. I do the business of Covent-garden parish—I went, at the request of Mr. Austin, to a coffee-shop in Newcastle-street, but I cannot say when—I went by myself, and met Mr. Buckingham there—after he had been there some time, the defendant came in, and sat in the next box—the purport of my being there was to overbear what passed-a conversa<lb></lb>tion took place between Clifford and Buckingham respecting a bill of ex<lb></lb>change, which Buckingham was to swear he had protested, and Bucking<lb></lb>ham wanted to know what he was to be paid—Clifford said 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that would not pay him, he must have more, and Clifford agreed to give him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave him a paper of instructions, on which was written what he was to do—this is the paper—Buckingham read it over and said, "This, I understand, is what I am to do"—Clifford said, "Yes"—Buck<lb></lb>ingham then went out, and I went immediately after—I was in Court when the cause came on to be tried, and I heard the defendant deny that this paper was his writing most distinctly, or that he had given it to any one.</p>

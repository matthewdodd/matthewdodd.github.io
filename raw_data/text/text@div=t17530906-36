            ; I was in bed and asleep when these thing mentioned in the indictment were missing, the prisoner was taken up in St. Giles's, with the things upon her, except the shoes; I had word sent me of it, I got some other cloaths of a friend and put them on, and went and found the prisoner and my things which were taken from off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came by them?</p>
               <p>Rorke. She said she gave half a crown for them to a person in the street who had them to sell.</p>
               <p>Catherine Robertson. The prosecutor lodg'd with me, there was a young man lay with him, and a market woman lay on the other side of the room; I know nothing how his cloaths were lost, but I was by when the prisoner was taken with them upon her, except the shoes; we took her before the justice, there she said she bought them in the street for half a crown, but did not know the person she bought them on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I deal in old cloaths and was crying them, a woman brought the things to me, and asked me if I would buy them; which I did, for half a crown, and hung them on my arm, and a woman going along said, a man had lost them.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday afternoon, the 5th April, I was crossing the Minories to the corner of George-street—a gentleman spoke to me, and I missed this handkerchief.</p>

I was at my brother-in-law's drawing-room window, about three o'clock—I saw the prosecutor walking with a lady—the prisoner followed him and pulled out a handkerchief, which I believe was this—I opened the window, and called to the prosecutor that he was robbed—I shouted, "Stop thief, stop thief"—the policeman took the prisoner before he got out of my sight.</p>

I was on duty, and took the prisoner—he attempted to rush by me—I took him by the collar—he asked me two or three times to let him go—I got him on the pavement when the last witness came up—I looked into his right-hand pocket, and saw this handkerchief—he did not say it was his then.</p>

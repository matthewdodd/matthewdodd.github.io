            . I live in Charles-street, Westminster. On the 9th of September, in the evening, about nine o'clock, I was in the <placeName id="t18170917-170-crimeloc860">Hay-market</placeName>

I saw that she was about two paces from us, she got behind me-the prisoner made a motion as if she had thrown the watch away, and on my stooping to look for it, she ran off, I followed her, calling out stop thief; I turned again to look for it, not finding it, I returned to the place, and had her taken into custody. I have never found it; she said she never saw me-it was worth seven guineas. Next morning I saw Jones at the office.</p>
               <p>JAMES CLARKE. I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoner, Hunter, as she ran through St. James's-market, hearing the cry of stop thief, Mr. Dupont came up and charged her with the robbery; she said she did not think he had a watch about him; the other prisoner came up, and tried to rescue her.</p>

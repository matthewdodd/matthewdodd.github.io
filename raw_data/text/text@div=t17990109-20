               <p>Q. Did you see any body run out? - A. I did not; after I had picked up the pieces that were on the ground, I thought I saw a person running down Argyle-street, which is about two hundred yards from my shop; I pursued him into Marlborough-street, where I saw a mob; I went into the mob, and saw some watchmen had hold of the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090028"></xptr>at the bar, with my prints all over dirt; a piece was cut off and delivered to me, I have had it ever since; it was cut off in order to match it.</p>
               <p>Q. Independent of the circumstance of the prisoner being stopped by the watchman, should you have known the prisoner to be the person that came into your shop? - A. Yes; I was sitting in a very dark room, and there were a dozen candles in the shop; I am sure he was the same person that came into my shop.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: After calling the hour of seven o'clock, as I was in my box at the corner of Little Argyle-street, about three hundred and fifty yards from Mr. Hannam's, I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner coming from Great Argyle-street into Little Argyle-street, with something under his arm; upon my making towards him, he dropped these two pieces of calico, I was about two yards from him when he dropped them, or rather closer; my partner pursued the man, and I took up the pieces; I then went to my partner's assistance, he had got hold of the prisoner by the collar, and we took him to the Justices in Marlborough-street; Mr. Hannam then came in, and said, that was the man that had robbed him; and we cut off a piece of each.(Produces them).</p>

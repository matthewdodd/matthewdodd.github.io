            . I am an officer. On the 1st of December, I went to search Harrison's premises, No. 1, Back-hill, Hatton Garden; I found Harrison and his family there at breakfast; it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; afterwards I saw Chilvers coming down stairs. Mr. Harrison came out; I told him Mr. Dawes had lost some mahogany, he had some suspicion it was on his premises; he said I was wellcome to look. Mr. Dawes went first up stairs, as soon as he got to the top, he said here is my property. I then told Harrison he must go with me to the office; I took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the property that you found that Dawes owned - A. Three large mahogany and two bed-pillars unturned; the two bed-pi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120040"></xptr>here; the planks are too large to be brought in here. At half after eleven o'clock at night I took Chilvers; he was in bed with his clothes on, except his shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search any other place - A. Yes, I had a search warrant and searched No. 47, Seward-street, Brick-lane, Chilvers and Harrison's premises; we found nothing there belonging to Mr. Dawes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, bring in one of the pillars - A. This bed-pillar was fourteen feet long; it has been cut in two.</p>

My father told me he had let the shop to Harrison and Chilvers, on the 24th of October they took possession; they took it at three shillings a week; they carried on the business of carpenters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any property there - A. I did, I saw pannel doors, mahogany planks, and bed posts there. I do not recollect the quantity; they were unturned; I saw them in the shop. Chilvers paid some rent in advance; they both took it, and they were joint tenants there. I saw them at work there once; they kept the shop until they were apprehended.</p>

            . I am a mahogany-turner. On the 24th of November, Harrison sent me ten or eleven pair of bed-pillars to turn; he told me to sell them for him if I could at twenty-four shillings a pair. I applied to Mr. Blackhall; he refused buying them, he said they were worm-eaten. He then told me to turn them, and he would sell them. On the 1st of December, Cook and Mr. Dawes came, Mr. Dawes claimed them; he said they were stolen.</p>

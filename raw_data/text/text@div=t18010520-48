               <p>JOHN-CHRISTIAN WEPPLER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. On Wednesday, the 29th of April, I believe you arrived at Billingsgate, from Gravesend? - A. Yes; about six o'clock in the evening I got a cart procured for me to carry my luggage and my trunks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the trunk in question put into the cart? - A. I did; it was put at the tail of the cart; I ordered the carman to proceed to the York Hotel, Blackfriars; I went up to the Monument with my wife, and a young lady under my protection, and procured them a coach; I went down with the cart to the York Hotel; the house was full, and I could not procure lodgings; I ordered them to go on to Adam-street, Adelphi; I was obliged to leave the cart to go after lodgings, and when I got into Covent-garden, where I got lodgings, I missed my trunk; I don't think I saw it after I left the Adelphi; it was then near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of trunk was it? - A. A red leather trunk, under a black cover, marked J. C. Weppler; it was made in St. Paul's Church-yard; it had brass nails to it; the trunk contained all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a gold snuff-box set with diamonds, value 400l.? - A.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You are quite sure this trunk had your name at lenght, J. C. Weppler, upon it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You advertised your loss, offering a reward, did you not? - A. Yes; one hundred pounds at first, and afterwards one hundred and fifty guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. In any of your advertisements did you describe cambric? - A. No; it was omitted, and there are some articles omitted now.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not certain that you saw the trunk after you left the York Hotel? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the city of London? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, eight or ten days before you left Hayes's, seeing the soldier at the bar? - A. Yes; he came in on the Wednesday night, I left them on the Thursday in the week following; on the Wednesday night, about eight o'clock, he came in, and asked Mrs. Hayes to lend him a half-crown piece directly; he went out directly and came in again with a red leather trunk, with a brass plate at top; I saw J. C. and a W.; I did not see the other letters, for they were small; my mistress and the man then went up stairs directly; my master was not present; he might be up stairs, but I cannot say whether he was or not; there was company up stairs; I believe he was, but I cannot swear it; my mistress was up stairs with the man, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; they came down stairs together and went into the bar; I heard him ask my mistress what she would give; my mistress offered him five pounds first, then he wanted more; then they bargained six guineas; the money was paid the next day; she said the mother of pearl was not of so much value as the gold and silver; I did not hear any more conversation; then I went into the tap-room, and he called for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the bargain for six guineas made that night? - A. Yes; six guineas and a pound in halfpence, it was to be seven guineas all but one shilling; after he was gone, I went into the taproom, and saw some silver and other articles lying upon her lap; there was a diamond necklace and a pearl necklace, they were lapped in wool or fine cotton; I made the observation to my mistress when I was drawing the beer, I said, Lord, ma'm, what a handsome diamond necklace that is, and she bid me go into the tap-room, and mind my business; the child was looking over them while her mother was in the bar; when they came in again, the child had the pearl necklace in her hand, and a pair of ear-rings, a pair of pearl ear-rings and diamond drops; I saw no more that night; the next morning, about nine o'clock, Mrs. Hayes sent her child to Mrs. Hinton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, that evening, observe the husband looking at any of the things? - A. No, I did not; the next morning, Mrs. Hayes sent the pearl earrings, and the pearl drops to Mrs. Hinton, which she returned again in a few minutes, saying, none of them would suit her; them Mrs. Hinton came to our house soon after, she was looking the goods over upon my mistress's knee, in the bar, but whether she said any thing, I do not know.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Should you know him again? - A. Yes, that is him; I went to draw some more beer for the tap-room, and I heard her pay down the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Where did you draw the beer? - A. My mistress said, come, Mr. Putty, you had better take your money, that was a nick-name that he had; I did not know his name was Collet, till he was taken up; my mistress gave him six guineas in gold and silver, and a pound in halfpence; he tied them up in a silk handkerchief; my mistress asked him if he would not have a bit of something to eat, he staid about half an hour after he had his money.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time your master never was present? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this on the Thursday? - A. Yes; on the Friday I saw some napkins on the table in the bar, my mistress was there, and Nathan the Jew, was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Had there not been some quarrel between you and your master, before you left the house? - A. All the quarrel my master and I ever had, was, that I put too many coals on the fire; he said, why did I not go and sift the cinders; he wanted me to go and do it after I was clean, and I said, if he would buy a riddle, I would do it every day, properly.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was no other ground of quarrel but that? - A.No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Clifton. I am a officer of Bow-street; on the 8th of May, I went, in consequence of a search-warrant, to the house of the prisoner Hayes, in company with two or three other officers; Mrs. Hayes was in the bar; I immediately desired her to walk out of the bar and go up stairs with me, which she did; I asked her to be so kind as to pull the things out of her pocket, and lay them upon the table, and either the prosecutor, or one of the officers, I am not certain which, pulled this handkerchief off the table; the prosecutor said, that is my handkerchief; I immedaitely desired him to put it down upon the table, and to middle with nothing there; upon going further I found this rose, wrapped up in a small bit of paper; afterwards we proceeded to search the house, and we found nothing else, but, at Bow-street, it struck me that the child, Mrs. Hayes's daughter, had not been searched, and upon her I found this little bit of money, which the prosecutor said he believed to be his; I also apprehended Collett, and afterwards searched his lodgings, before we went to Mrs. Hayes's; I went to Knight bridge barracks with his serjeant, where I apprehended him; he took me to his own lodgings, in company with Gibbs, one of the patroles; we searched the lodgings in company with the prosecuter, and found nothing but some money in box, which was brought away, I believe twenty-two or twenty-three guineas, or thereabouts; I afterwards took Mr. and Mrs. Hayes.</p>

               <p>Henry. These are the napkins I bought of Mrs. Hayes; when I went to pay her for the napkins, the asked me if I wanted to buy a piece of cambric; I said, I shall see, if I can agree with you I will buy it; I went up stairs with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her husband up stairs? - A. No; she called him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who measured the cambric? - A. I cannot recollect; she said, there were fifteen yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the husband there when it was measured? - A. I cannot say; she asked me half-a-guinea a yard for the cambric, I bid her eight shillings, but I did not understand it myself; I paid her for it on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell it for? - A. Nine shillings a yard; I afterwards bought thirteen yards more of her at eight shillings a yard, which Miller had from me; this is the same cambric that I had from Mrs. Hayes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a dealer in old clothes? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, at Bow-street, you told the story you have told now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You produced the same napkins? - A. They sent for the napkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you deliver those napkins to Miller? - A. At Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up at your own house? - A. Yes; on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in custody when you delivered up those napkins? - A. Two days.</p>
               <p>Q. You began to be a little alarmed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell them, over and over again, that you never did buy any napkins of Mrs. Hayes? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Weppler. This handkerchief has had my name marked in it, and it has been cut out; here is a hole that was in it when it was new, and is darned up; I know this garnet, there were twenty-seven of them in the trunk, loose in a paper, they formed a necklace, intermixed with rose diamonds, I putted it to pieces and took away the rose diamonds, I have not the smallest doubt of its being mine; this Spanish coin I believe to have been among mine, I had six or eight of them; there are more of the same sort but I believe it to be mine;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200035"></xptr>there is a hole through it, and I had one with a hole through it; I brought it with me from Jamaica, where I was an inhabitant nineteen years; the marks upon this piece of cambric have been torn off, but I can swear pretty certainly that it is my cambric, by the quality; it is not a piece such as are sold in the shops here, I bought it at Amsterdam; this is in the raw state as it came from the bleach; when it is done up, and calendered for the shops, it is put up in squarres; I have here the table-cloth that belongs to these napkins, I bought them together at Amsterdam.(Miss

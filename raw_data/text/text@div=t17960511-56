On the Thursday fortnight, I was sent with a parcel to the west end of the town, going up the Haymarket, I was buying some gingerbread, I looked over the way, and saw the prisoner, I knew him again; I crossed the street to him, and he jumped into a yard, I went after him into the yard; I heard him ask a man upon a cart in the corner of the yard, if a boy was coming down the yard, and told the man to send me out; the man said he had no business to send me out, I did not see him at that time; he then ran up to me and asked me how I was; I said, pretty well thank you; how do you do; he asked me, where are you going; I am going home; says I, where are you going; he said, to your master's house; I asked him what he had done with the parcel I gave him in Bridge-street; he asked me whether it was a parcel or a box; I said, it was a parcel in a brown paper; then he asked me whether I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110117"></xptr>run; I said, I could not run fast; and he began to walk fast, half running; I said, if you dare to run I will call out catch thief; he was looking up every turning; and when we came past Charing-cross, he said he wanted to go up a turning to see some of his friends; you shall see them another time, says I, come along with me now, and tell my master what you have done with the parcel; we came along together till we got to Burleigh-street, Exeter-change, I had hold of the slap of his coat, he broke from me, and ran up there; I cried, catch thief; and some man ran out with a knife, and stopped him; he had not got out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt it is the same man you delivered the parcel to? - A. No; he had the same cloaths on then that he had when I delivered the parcel to him, and has the same now; I knew his person as well as his cloaths; I am sure he is the person I delivered the parcel to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you tell the man upon the cart in the yard that he had taken your parcel, and desire him to stop him? - A. No.</p>

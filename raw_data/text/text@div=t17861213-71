            : on the 9th of December, I missed some gold and some silver, which we had given to the prisoner to melt; the prisoner worked with us about a month; I gave it him on the 9th of December, about thirty penny weights, and he took six; we did not find so much upon him; he was to melt it at the top of the house in the shop; when he came down to go to dinner, we searched him, and a small quantity, two or three grains, was found on the ground, which he acknowledged he dropped, and I picked it up myself close by his feet; there was about a penny-weight of gold; he said it was not our property, it was his own.</p>

               <p>Having reason to suspect the prisoner, I weighed him about thirty penny weights of gold and silver, and gave it him up stairs, and desired him to weigh it; he put it into the scales, and told me there was an ounce and a half, which is twenty-two penny weights, which was under what I gave him; I made no reply; I desired him to melt it; he did, and I weighed what he had melted, and found it was twenty-two penny weights, that was all gold, the silver was afterwards separate; I weighed it below stairs in the shop; he did not see me weigh it; that was about twelve, or half after; after he had melted that, he melted a quantity of silver, which I was not so particular in weighing; it was fine silver which I gave him to melt; and when I searched him, I found a piece of the same silver about him; he was the last man that went to dinner; I searched him with the constable, whose name is Holmes, and we found some silver, and two or three other little grains of gold, with some other gold of a coarser nature; some of the grains of gold were found on the ground some little time afterwards; we found the main quantity in the lining of his hat, where the button is joined to the outside, and being thin, it was not easy to be found; there were two pieces of gold; I took them out of his hat myself.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose you could not know it was your gold? - Yes, perfectly well, because it was gold that had been made thin.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear that these pieces of gold that were found in his hat, and in his pocket, were your property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In the melting, might so much have been lost? - Then it must have been in another state; it was in the state that I gave it him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the window safe before you heard the glass fall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen it before? - A. About before an hour, or perhaps more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any glass about it? - A. I saw the glass in the window when his hand was in the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was there any body else in the shop but yourself? - A. There was a little boy, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. You can see into the shop from the street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a light in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore he must have seen every body that was in the shop? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the prisoner had broke your window with intent to steal, he might have an opportunity of running away, upon seeing you come out to the door? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. The foot-way is always very dirty, slippery, and narrow? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not happened continually, that people slip down and break the windows? - A. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. These things were not in his hand, but upon the ground? - A. They were in his hand when I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not swear that before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had fell against the window, these things would have fell into the street? - A. No they would not, they were lying upon the window-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they an inch from the glass? - A. I cannot swear how far they were from the glass; they were upon the window-board, I am sure it is impossible they could have fell out.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this is charged as a burglary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the County are to pay you forty pounds, if the prisoner is convicted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard such a thing? - A. Yes; I have heard such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect it? - A. I expect a share of it, if he is convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have taken you some time to have come round to the shop-door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he had abundant time to have run away before you could have come to the door to catch him? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Warner any partner? - A. No.</p>

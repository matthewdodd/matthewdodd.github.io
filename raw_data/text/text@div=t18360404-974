                  </hi>. I am nephew and assistant to John Savage, a pawnbroker, in Whitechapel-road. On the night of the 24th of March I saw the prisoner near the door of the shop, pulling at some jackets which hung at the door-post—I called my uncle out—I had seen him before that, kick some boots which were placed at the door—I have since seen a jacket which hung at the door in the prisoner's possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Whitechapel-road. On the 24th of March, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and offered the jacket to pawn, which Mr. Savage afterwards claimed—I asked him where he got it—he sad a person outside had given it him to pledge—I asked him if he knew anything about the person—he said, "No."</p>

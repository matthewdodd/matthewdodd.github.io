                  </hi>. I am an officer of Marylebone. On Friday, the 16th of January, I went to the prisoner's house in Boston-place—I found the male prisoner—I told him I had a warrant to search the house—I asked if his name was Hickman—he said, "Yes"—I went into the shop, which is a marine store and rag shop—I searched for some other things, but I found this copper in the front room up stairs, a bed-room, it was covered with rags and old bolsters—I said, "Here is a new copper, how do you account for that?" He said, "It is one we have had for some time, we bought it at Pontifex's, in St. Martin's-lane." I took it away with the male prisoner, and Mr. Peaton identified it—the female prisoner did not come home while I was there—there was a man there very much afflicted, who I understood to be her husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I went with Keys to the house—we found the male prisoner there—I waited, I suppose, two hours, till the female prisoner came home—she came into the shop and took off her cloak—I was in the shop—I asked her if her name was Hickman—the said it was—I then told her I had been searching her house for some pro<lb></lb>perty supposed to be stolen, that we had found it, and she must go with me to the office—she said she was certain she had no property in her house but what she had come honestly by, and she was very willing to go to the office, as she could account for every thing—we then left her house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know it was her house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My brother officer asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020097"></xptr>
               <p>the young man if his name was Hickman—he said, "Yes." As I was going along with the female prisoner, I told her we had found a copper, and asked how she accounted for the possession of it—she said, "O, the copper is it? I came honestly by it, I bought it of Mr. Pugh, in Greyhound-yard, Holborn"—I said no more, having heard her son tell my brother officer that they had bought it at Pontifex's—I had searched the house and found no other copper there—when we arrived at the office the magistrate had left, and the prisoners were locked in separate cells which adjoined out another. I heard the female prisoner call out to the male prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, it is the copper they have brought us here for; you know we bought that at Pugh's, in Greyhound-yard, Holborn, for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about the 14th of last month"—the male prisoner replied, "I have told a lie about the copper, mother—I told them we bought it at Pontifex's in St. Martin's-lane, where we had sold the old pieces of brass"—she said, with an oath, "That will not do, you fool"—immediately after that a man came into the yard, whom we had seen at the house in Boston-place—he called out "Hickman." Mrs. Hickman answered, "Is that you?" calling him by a name which I for<lb></lb>get—he said, "Yes"—the then said, "They have got us here locked up about a copper; will you go down to Pugh's in Greyhound-yard, Holborn, and ask him for the bill of it? it cost 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and was bought about the 14th of last month"—she repeated these words several times, and asked him if he understood it; he said he did, and went away; he was gone perhaps two hours; when he came back, and called again, "Hickman," to let them know he had returned—I was waiting in the office, they could not see nor hear me; the man then said, "Mrs. Hickman, what was the use of send<lb></lb>ing me on such a fool's errand as that? Pugh knows nothing about a cop<lb></lb>per, he does not know at all what you mean; he does not understand you; he says he never sold you any copper"—she then said, "Aye, I was in liquor when I told you that—you must go up to the old man," meaning her husband, in Boston-place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he was her husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but the son had called him father two or three times, and told him what our business was—he was in the parlour behind the shop—he is afflicted with apoplexy, I believe, and has lost the use of his side, and his speech—he was scarcely able to walk—I should say decidedly he was not able to carry on the business of the house—he could not give directions, because he could not speak; but he seemed to understand every thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear him speak? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could make a noise, sig<lb></lb>nifying "No"—I asked him several questions, forgetting he was in that situation—if an article had been offered for tale, he was not capable of giv<lb></lb>ing his answer—he could signify by signs—I am quite positive he could not carry on the trade of the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did the prisoner, Elizabeth, say to the man in the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She told him he must go to the old man; and she said, "The copper you know, that we gave 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, on the 14th of last month, at Pugh's, go and ask the old man for the bill, he will find it on the file"—the man set off—I went with him—we went into the back parlour, and found the old man just where I had left him in the morning—he was sitting down—he has the use of one hand, and was smoking his pipe—I told him his wife wanted the bill off the file, of the copper that was bought at Pugh's—he shook himself, and made a sort of motion, and said, "Hum, hum," and began to cry very much—I asked him where the file was that he kept his bills on—he pointed me to two—I took them down, and looked over them very care-fully,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020098"></xptr>
               <p>but I could find no bill of the copper on either of them—I asked him if he had a bill for the copper at all—he again made a sort of noise, meaning "No"—I said, "Nor ever had, I suppose?"—he again made the same noise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the noise the same when he appeared to mean yes and no? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understood him "No"—he never had occasion to answer me, "Yes."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then is there any thing more than physical infirmity that prevents his attending to the whole business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not—he is capable of signifying what he wishes to be done—I did not take the files away—there were, perhaps, thirty or forty papers on each file—I read every one—it was on the 16th of January that this woman said, "We bought it on the 14th of last month"—she had been in custody two hours.</p>

                  <lb></lb>night, I was in Orchard-place—there was a crowd of people there, and I saw the prisoner among them—I saw a crowd round the door of No. 26, and saw Bewley telling the prisoner to go in—he was drunk, and swearing, and stamping, and grinning at Bewley, and said he would be b—d if he would go in—he went just on to the sill of the door, and was very violent indeed—I saw him make seven or eight blows at Bewley—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand—I was two or three yards off—he was standing with his left arm round the door-post, and with his right he was stabbing at Bewley, but could not get a reach at him—Bewley did not strike or offer any violence to him—after he was struck at several times he called out, "I am stabbed; he has got a knife; draw your staves"—I drew my staff—the prisoner still stood there stabbing—he would have stabbed me if I had not kept myself back—his room is the parlour on the right-hand side of the passage—while I was drawing my staff, Topp rushed into the room and took him into custody—he was partly in and partly out of the room at the time-there were several women in the room trying to pull him in, but he would not go—he was very drunk and violent—he was taken to the station, which was about a quarter of a mile off—a great mob followed us—there were four or five policemen—I was behind Topp, keeping the crowd back with my staff—the mob called out, "Go steady, go steady"—I did not strike the prisoner, and I did not see anybody else do so—I should have struck him, when I had got my staff out, if Topp had not rushed by me—it was unsafe to approach him without disarming him—it was dark in the passage—he got the blow over the head by falling down on the stones in the station—he was very violent, and would not be searched—the injury is not the result of any blow struck by the police—he threw himself down—I found this knife on him, with three blades (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Orchard-place is a low, noisy place.</p>

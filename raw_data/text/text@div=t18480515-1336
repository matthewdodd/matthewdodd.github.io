In consequence of an alarm I went towards North-street, and saw Jackson in the back yard, getting over the wall—he got into the house No. 15, and as he was coming through that yard I took him—he had no cap or hat on, but two coats—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the outside one—I took him to the Red Lion, and in the coat-pocket I found 90 cheroots, 1 half-crown, 4 fourpenny-pieces, and 17 sixpences, a chisel, a knife, and this silk handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 140.) On the morning of 19th April I heard an alarm, and saw Wilson running down Back Church-lane, which is near Battye-street, without either cap or hat—I stopped him—he said, "It is all right, it was not me, let me go"—he tried to get away, and I threw him on the ground—Wigley came up and we took him to the Red Lion—I found nothing on him.</p>

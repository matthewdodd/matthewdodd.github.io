On 16th Feb., about ten minutes past five o'clock in the morning, a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came to my house—Kitchen knocked at my door—I opened it—he asked if I was going to close again—I sad, "Yes; for about half an hour"—he asked me to allow him to leave a hamper—I said, "Yes," and I gave him the key of the tap-room—he left it, and said he would call for it in a short time—I went to bed again, and got up about twelve—the hamper was still there in the tap-room—I took it into the kitchen—I just opened the wickers of the basket, and saw there was poultry in it—at half-past eight the same evening, Neale and Smith came—Neale said to me, "You have a hamper here"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I shall call for it in the morning"—I said, "I shall not let you have it, without the party who left it is present"—he said, "It is all right"—Smith said, "The party that left it is very ill; he is in bed; if I go and get a note from him, I suppose you will let me have it"—I went into the parlour and came out again, and said, "I shall not let you have it; if Kitchen were here, I should not let him have it"—I asked them to leave me their names and addresses, and that of the party who left it, and I would call in a policeman and deliver it up to them—they said they were agreeable to that—I took down their names—I have it here, "John Smith, John Neale, and William Kitchen, 5, Milton-street"—Smith said he was ser<lb></lb>vant to Kitchen, and attended to a horse and cart—I went for a policeman, and when I came back they were gone.</p>

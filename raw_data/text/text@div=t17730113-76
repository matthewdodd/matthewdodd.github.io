               <p>Court. I do not see it will be of any use; if he has once been subject to extortion and fraud, that will not help your client.</p>
               <p>Walker. I sent the next day to see if there was any thing out against me, and to search the two Compters.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go to Wood-street Compter?</p>
               <p>Walker. Because he said he belonged to Wood-street Compter; the officer next day fetched the prisoner from over the water, and I had him secured; the other never knew my house nor my person; he must be brought there by the prisoner.</p>

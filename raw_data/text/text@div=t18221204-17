            . I am shopman to Mr. Carter of Lombard-street. As I came to George-yard, the prisoner rushed by me, and crossed to go up Three King-court, running in a direction from the cry. I pursued, and he was stopped a few yards up the court. I found the handkerchief in his hand, which I gave to the constable with him. He said he had picked nobody's pocket, before any questions were put to him.</p>

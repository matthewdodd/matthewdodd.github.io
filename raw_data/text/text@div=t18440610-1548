                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at No. 35, Holborn<lb></lb>hill. On the 25th of April, about seven o'clock, the two prisoners came to my shop together—Withers spoke first, and asked me the price of goods, which I told him—he then said that he wanted to make a purchase, and that he had a bill, which he produced—I said, if it was a good bill I had no objection to take it—he said it was accepted by a party in the Custom-house, if I in<lb></lb>quired I should find it worth my notice—he left it with me to see if I would take it—this is the bill—it is accepted by a Mr. Burnside—his residence is stated in the bill as Spring-terrace, Horsemonger-lane—I went next day to the Custom-house—I did not find any such person as Burnside—I did not see the prisoners myself afterwards till they were in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheese monger, and live in Bridge-row, Lambeth. I received this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which has been produced, on Saturday, the 13th of April, from a woman—on looking at it afterwards I imagined it to be forged, and sent after her—she brought the prisoner Withers to me the same day, and said, in his presence, he was the person who had paid it to her—he asked to look at it—I showed it to him—he said it certainly was the note he had given her, but from the parties he had it from, he did not think it was a bad one—I told him my impression, it was; that I had spoken to the woman, and I should have the money back on Monday—I had given her the change for it—on the Tuesday they paid four sovereigns—I kept the note till Saturday, the 27th, about eleven o'clock, or from that to one, when Atkins brought the remaining sovereign, and took the note away—he was not with Withers when he came before, but he had called in the meantime with a mes<lb></lb>sage, and he said he had come from Withers to pay the sovereign and take the note.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know who the woman was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had known her some years—I think Withers said he knew it was the note he paid the woman, because the name of Mason was on it—he looked at it, and said it was the note—I cannot say he recognised it by the name on it, but I had seen that name on it—it had been kept separate from other notes—I told the woman I believed it was a bad note—she proposed to take it back, and pay me.</p>

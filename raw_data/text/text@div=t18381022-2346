                  </hi>. I am writing-master at Christ's Hospital. At a quarter-past four o'clock on the 10th of October, I was in Picket-street, Strand—I felt a push on the right shoulder—I turned, and saw the two prisoners walking side by side—I started into the road, and felt, and my pocket handkerchief had been taken—I had seen it safe a quarter of an hour before—I went on in the road by the side of the prisoners about twenty yards, till we got to Wych-street—they parted—Hart went on, and Mitchell entered a public-house—Mitchell was nearest to me—I can swear</p>

               <p>he is the person who touched me on the shoulder—I followed Hart, and gave her into custody, and she immediately produced my handkerchief, this mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I went to the office with her, and while there Mitchell was brought in by another officer—he was placed before me—I said he was not the man, but when I went to the office again I saw him side by side as he was before, and swear he is the man.</p>

I saw Hart and the prosecutor, and just after they passed, Mitchell came by me and put his hand into his pocket, and, from information, I took him going through Russell-court—I had him by the collar—he turned and knocked me down, but I kept him and took him to the office.</p>

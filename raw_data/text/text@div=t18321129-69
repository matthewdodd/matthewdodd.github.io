I went out on the Wednesday morning, and returned in the evening - my room door was open; there was no lock on the door, and any one might open it; I was accused of taking the sheet - I said the young woman who lived with me might have taken it; I did not know she was then gone - the officer had time to apprehend her, but he would not.</p>

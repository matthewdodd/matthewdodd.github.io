                  </hi>. I am in the service of Jonas Bateman, a shoe-maker in Broad-street. On Friday, the 8th of July, the prisoner came to the shop about half-past eleven o'clock, and requested me to take some boots and shoes to Great Russell-street for a gentleman to try on—I took two pairs of boots and two pairs of shoes and went with him—he took me to a pastry-cook's shop in Great Russell-street,—he took the bag from me and went in—he then came out and requested me to go back and fetch two pairs more of pumps, which he had quire forgotten—I went, and when I re<lb></lb>turned he was gone off with the bag—I had delivered them to him thinking he was going to take them to the gentleman—he did not mention the gen<lb></lb>tleman's name—the pastry-cook knew nothing of the prisoner—the goods were worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I merely intended to leave them while I fetched the pumps—I have since seen them at the pawnbroker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday, the 12th of August I took the prisoner in Tottenham-court-road—he declared himself an innocent man, and said he was in great distress; but on getting further he admitted it was the first time, wishing to know what I thought the sen<lb></lb>tence of the Court might be, if he was convicted—I produce some dupli<lb></lb>cates which I found in his watch-fob; one is for shoes pawned on the 9th of July.</p>

On 28th March the prisoner came there about half-past ten o'clock at night—he asked for a bed—I let him have one in the back-room on the first-floor—he said he was to be called the next morning at eight—that room joins to mine—I had a trunk in my room under my bed—next morning I got up at half-past four, and at a quarter before twelve, the same day, I was going to my trunk, and missed it</p>

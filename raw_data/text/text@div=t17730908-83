On the 1st of September as I was coming from Vauxhall, between two and three in the morning, I met with the prisoners, about the Mews stables; Davis ran after me and asked me to go home with her; I offered her a shilling to see her bubbies: then we had a long conversation. I agreed to go home with her, and did. I and Davis went to bed, and the maid came and laid her head on the pillow; I put all my things under my pillow, thinking they could not take them away, during the time I lay there. I pretended to be asleep, though I was not; Davis, as she lay, reached her hand round to the things under the bolster, and took the things out of my pocket; I was angry at the maid's laying her head there, and bid her go about her business, but she said she was to stay there; then Davis got up, and went towards the door; I thought she would return; she came back and then the maid got up and took my things, I could not tell what they were; I thought they were things of their own; Davis put them in the maid's apron, and she carried them out: Davis came to bed again, but in three minutes, thinking I was asleep, she crept gently out of the bed, and went out of the room, and never came again; then I got up and missed my things; I went to the public house, and said I had been robbed, and sent for a constable; as the constable was coming, Davis's sister went into the room, and threw the case of the watch on the tester of the bed; they had pulled off the seals; it is a particular repeating watch, there are marks, enough on it to know it; I went with the constable and found Davis at breakfast at her sister's; I told the constable that was the woman; he seized her, upon which she dropped the tooth-pick case out of her hand, and the constable took it up.</p>

               <p>Going home, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I met this gentleman, he gave me a shilling, and said he would go home with me: going by the Mews he pulled out his watch; I never saw it afterwards till now. When we came home, we went to bed; he wanted the maid to lie down on the bed; I told him that was not proper. I lay with him till seven in the morning; then he got up and turned over the clothes, and said he was robbed; I was surprized at it: he went to the drawers and took away a pocket book of mine. I never saw the colour of his money, but the shilling he gave me.</p>

I told her to send the owner for them. She returned in a quarter of an hour, and said now I have brought the owner, I am the owner said she; she said, I stole them, and what do you think of that? she had no name she said, she was born in the reign of King Charles. She repeatedly told me she had stolen them, I asked her of whom? she refused to tell me. I delivered the property to Christian, the officer, that night. She came to me the 14th of October, between six and seven at night, the man's name is Gilson who took the shop mark to Twidle's; when she first came she appeared sober, but when she came the second time she appeared in liquor.</p>

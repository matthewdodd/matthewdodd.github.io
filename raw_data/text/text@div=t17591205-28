               <p>I had been from Clerkenwell to the Borough, and as I was coming back again, a gentleman said I have got an old packing case; if you will make it a little less I will pay you for your labour; I said, I had no too about me; he said if I had a saw, he could help me to a hammer. I went to this place, (what Mr. Scott says is true) but there was nobody there or I would have asked them to have lent me one. I tell the truth, I took the saw in my hand with intent to do the job and then return it, not with intent to keep it the least in the world; I should not have been gone half an hour with it.</p>

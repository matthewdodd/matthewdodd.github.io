I know the prisoner—in March or April last he kept a shop in Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury, as a working-silversmith—I employed him to make me the top of a <hi rend="italic">sporran</hi>, or Highland purse—I ordered it to be made of silver—I went and saw it at his shop before it was sent home—I remarked to him that it looked yellow, and said I wished to have the hall-mark on it, that I might be certain it was silver—it was brought home about a fortnight or three weeks after—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner when I paid him—I said to him, "I suppose it is good silver, as there are marks on it?"—he said yes—I have got the bill and receipt—I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the <hi rend="italic">sporran</hi> and tassels; but he had more, as there were various articles—this is the <hi rend="italic">sporran</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worn in front of a Highland dress—I paid for it as silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief assayer of the Goldsmiths' Company. I received this purse on 2nd Aug., for the purpose of being assayed—I assayed it—it is not silver—the ingredients of standard silver are 1loz. 2 dwts. of fine silver to 18 dwts. of copper in the 12oz. lb.—this is 2oz. 18 dwts. worse than standard—the Goldsmiths' Company would not permit the mark to have been put on such an article as this, as silver—it would be base metal—it is the practice if anything of this sort is brought there, which is not up to standard to break it to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It would be one-eighth or one-ninth part less valu<lb></lb>able than if it was standard silver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Considerably less than standard—standard silver would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the ounce, and this is about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is only those persons that have their punches entered at the company who can get the mark put on—I am not aware that the prisoner is one, nor Johnson—there are a good many working silversmiths not entered at the company, who get a friend who has his name entered, to get things marked for them—the company first had information about this on 1st Aug., and I went to Dr. Halley—I got my information from the solicitor of the company—I do not know where he got his information from—I have not seen Johnson at the hall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy-warden of the Goldsmiths' Company. I have examined the rim of the mounting of this purse—it is not such a mark as is used for this species of article, but for tea-spoons and other small spoons—the letter "I," in old English, is on it—that letter is used to denote the year in which the article is stamped—that is not the proper letter for the pre<lb></lb>sent year—it was used last on 29th May, 1845—a different letter is used every year—the proper mark for such an article as this would have been altogether different—part of the marks would have been put on the front of the clasp and part on the back, to prevent the possibility of a part of this being made use of and attached to a piece not hall marked, and there would also have teen a small mark on each of the mountings of the tassels and all the small movable pieces—the mark on the front would have been the lion passant and the leopard's head—I believe this mark has been let in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What mark is on it now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The lion passant, the letter for the year, the leopard's head, and the Queen's bead—if it was properly marked, the Queen's head and the letter would have been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210039"></xptr>
               <p>placed on the other side—the lion's head and the leopard's head would be there, but all the marks would be differently arranged—an ordinary working silversmith ought to know that this was not the correct mark—if he is in the habit of sending manufactured work to Goldsmiths' Hall, he must know it, or if he was in the habit of making articles of this description—we do not mark very many of these in a year—the prisoner's name is not entered at the hall, nor is Johnson's—I knew nothing of them before—it was Johnson who gave me the information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you put the Queen's head on all articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and the leopard and the letter for the year, but the difference is in the arrange<lb></lb>ment—this mark would not be used for large spoons—tea-spoons are marked by a press, at a single blow, but such articles as these are marked by punches put on by hand, with a hammer.</p>

I knew the prisoner at Edinburgh, and worked as a shopmate with him there—I met him in London, about two years ago, and since then have at times assisted him in his work—I remember the order of Dr. Halley, for the <hi rend="italic">sporran</hi>—I went into Gordon's shop just after he had got the order for it—he said he was rather busy, and would I assist him in making the purse—I said I would—this is it—I got the metal from Gordon—I was in the shop when Dr. Halley called about it—it was not then finished—the doctor said that he wanted it made of good silver, that he did not think it was silver, and he wanted it hall marked—the top part of it was mounted at that time, except two little bits at the side—the chasing was on it before it went to be mounted—after Dr. Halley had left, Gordon said that he would get a tea-spoon, and take the stamp from that, and solder it in—he asked me to do it—I said I would not do such a thing for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said he had much better break it up, and get a good one at once—I knew at that time that it was not proper metal—I laid it down and went away—that was about six o'clock at night—I went back in the morning, and the stamp was in it—(I had mounted it before that—I made all the silver part of it, except the chasing)—Gordon asked me if it was not done very neatly—I think I made the same remark that I did before, that I would not do the same thing for a good sum of money—when it was finished I accompanied the prisoner to Dr. Halley's door, and handed the purse to a servant, with the bill—I did not get paid for it—about a fortnight after I had a quarrel with the prisoner, and left him—it was somewhere in May that Dr. Halley called—I took the purse home, between two and three days and a week after that.</p>

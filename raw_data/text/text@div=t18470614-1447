                  </hi>. I keep the Waterman's Arms, in Shadwell. It is in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell—on the 11th of May, I fastened the house up safe about one o'clock in the morning—I was called up again at five o'clock in the morning—I found the tiles had been taken off the roof of the back ground, and a hole had been made sufficient for a man to drop down—I then found the panels had been broken out of the yard door—the door was open, and the bar was entirely stripped—some silver spoons were gone, and coats and cloaks, and the other things named—they were all safe the night before—here is a hat-band that was on a hat that was there—here is a peculiarity in the pattern of this band differing from all others, and it was covered with flour—this was on the hat the over-night—to the best of my belief, this is my hat-band.</p>

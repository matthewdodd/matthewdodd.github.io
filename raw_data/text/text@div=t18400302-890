                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, and live in Union-street, Middlesex Hospital. On Saturday night, the 22nd of February, I was walking with my wife, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock, in the Commercial-road—my wife had hold of my arm—I felt a pressure behind me—I looked round, and there were four men, the prisoner was one of them—I saw him <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> something into his pocket, and he stooped down to do something to the strap of his boot—I said to my wife, "Is your purse safe?"—she felt, and said, "It is gone"—I turned back, and on the other side of the road I saw the prisoner—t went and said, "I want that purse you took from my wife, give me that purse"—he said, "What purse?"—I took hold of his collar—he tripped me up in a moment, but I jumped up on my feet, and threw him, and tore his coat—at that moment he took the purse from his pocket, got it between his legs, and tried to get it down a grating—I put my hand between his legs, and took the purse from him—my wife said, "That is my purse, I will swear to if—this is the purse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the money stated was in it, but that was allowed to me at the office.</p>

I do not sleep on the premises, but many persons do—on Monday, the 25th of Sept., there were a quantity of Bandana silk handkerchiefs in the ware-house, and in another part of the premises some carpet-bags—there is a little court, which leads out of Carter-lane to the back of the premies—there are some iron rails and spikes at the corner, and adjoining these a water-spout which leads to the top of the house—if a person got by means of the spout to the top of the house, he could get to a window on the leads—I do not know whether that window was fastened inside or out<lb></lb>side—when I came to the house on Tuesday morning, the 26th of Sept., I missed twenty-five pieces of Bandana handkerchiefs from the warehouse—I know the patterns of them—I examined the premises at ten minutes to nine—I found some desks had been broken open in the counting-house, and vio<lb></lb>lence had been attempted at the door of the strong room, with instrumens—I have since seen ten pieces of Bandana handkerchiefs, which I believe to have been taken from the house—they do not bear any marks of our house—I can speak to the patterns of the whole of the handkerchiefs—I had handled them the night before the robbery—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—they were of this quality—I believe them to be the goods which were taken—I am a buyer of goods of this sort.</p>

                  </hi>. In Sept. last I was in the service of Reuben Barnett. About eight on Tuesday morning, the 26th of Sept., two young men came to my master's house, and stopped till my master came home at one—he had gone out at seven—he sleeps up stairs in the second pair back room—I sleep in the shop going over the front way—my master can leave the house, if he pleases, without my knowing it—he would not pass through the shop—my master knocked me up at seven o'clock that morning—the two men had some cakes and some gin at my master's—they staid till about four in the afternoon, when my master and they went away together—my master returned alone about six—one of the young men returned about eight that evening with a carpet bag like this, which appeared to be full and heavy—he staid about an hour, and left the bag and its contents behind him—my master and mistress went out with him—in about half an hour my master returned—he went in to count the handkerchiefs—I said, "The young man has left his bag behind"—my master said, "The bag belongs to me"—the handkerchiefs had been taken out in the parlour before the man went away, and piled on two chairs—Julia helped them to count them—there were twenty-nine pieces, and two single ones of different patterns—they made me carry them up stairs into the top room—on Thursday, the 28th of Sept., my master gave my mistress, the prisoner Julia, a piece of the handkerchiefs, and told her to pawn them at Mr. Barker's, in Houndsditch—that same day he sent me with a piece to White<lb></lb>chapel—he told me to give different names—I told him I would not—I gave my own name, and I think I gave his name—on that day he asked my mistress to pawn some more—she said she had her own business to attend to—she deals in second-hand clothes—on Friday I pawned one piece at Mr. Barker's, in Houndsditch, by direction of my master—I asked my master if the goods were got honestly—he called me a fool, and was very angry—on the Friday evening my master and I went out together—he sent me into one pawnbroker's; I do not know the name of the street—the gentleman would not take the article from me—I said my master sent me—my master wanted me to go and take another piece—I said I would never go any more—that was the pawn-shop at which my master was taken—I was outside, and spoke to my master—I went back to my mistress, by his direction—I told her my master was taken to the station—she instantly tied up eight pieces of hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs</p>

               <p>in a bundle, went with me, and told me where to leave them, in a coffee-shop in Harrow-alley, and deliver them to a man named Levy—my mis<lb></lb>tress waited outside till I came back—I did not go far in—I could not find Mr. Levy—I left the handkerchiefs on a form, in charge of the landlord, for Mr. Levy—before I took them, Levy had been in, talking to my mistress—I cannot say what passed—Levy deals in shoes and slippers from the country—on the Friday night my mistress gave me fifteen duplicates to burn—I asked why she could not burn them herself—she said, "You know I can't touch the fire on Friday night"—I burnt them—I said, "If I get into any trouble I shall speak the truth"—she told me, if I spoke anything against her or her hus<lb></lb>band, I should be killed by the Jews going through Houndsditch—I did not look at the duplicates before I burnt them—my master took the duplicates of the goods I pledged—on the Friday before my master was taken I saw him go out at seven in the morning, the back way, with five pieces—that is the way he could have gone out in the night, and I not know it—on the Saturday morning, when my master was examined, before I and my mistress were taken up, we were standing together in Guildhall-yard; my mistress told me not to say anything against her, and I should be sure to get away; and if I did get away, she would not mind making me a present of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I said no<lb></lb>thing against her—she said I should get killed if I was to say anything—she told me that several times—before I went to Guildhall-yard, when I was at the Compter, she told me that Mr. Levy had returned the eight pieces of handkerchiefs that I took for him, and said he would have nothing to do with them—I asked who had them now—she said a person named Ferguson—I asked where he lived—she said in Bell-lane, Whitechapel—I know him very well—he had been in the habit of visiting at our house—on the Monday morning my master told me to clean two pair of boots—I said, "Where do you go to in the night, that your boots are all over mud?"—he said, "Only to the coffee-shop"—I found his boots were muddy—I was taken before the Magistrate, and afterwards admitted as a witness.</p>

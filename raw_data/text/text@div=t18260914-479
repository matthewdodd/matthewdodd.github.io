I said I had been one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty miles across the water; he said "Ah, well;" he then left the house, and I looked for the Jew, as I wanted to get rid of the watch; but he was gone; the prisoner appeared to me like a broken down Captain, or something of that kind; I had been in London but four days; I looked round and saw the prisoner running away. I left the porter, half drank, and followed him down two or three streets into Petticoat-lane, crying Stop thief! but no one stopped him; I ran on and caught him; I said "You villain, you have imposed upon me; you have sold me a thing not worth one quarter the value I gave you for it;" he said "You be d-d;" I said "I shall hold you, unless you give me up my money, and take your watch;" I had scarcely looked round, before four or five people came up with the Jew and struck and kicked me violently; so that I was obliged to let the prisoner go; I saw him get off; I got into Whitechapel, and described him to Forrester, and he knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you thought to get a bargain of this man? A. No; I bought it for the Jew; I did not examine it.</p>

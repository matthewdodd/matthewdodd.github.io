                  </hi>. I am one of the presidents of the London district offices of the General Post-office. On Saturday, 28th Sept., for reasons I had, I made up this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and put into it a half-sovereign—I sealed it as it is sealed now, and saw it addressed to "Miss Mary Ann Ingram, Cliff-terrace, near Clifton-bars, Margate, Kent"—I then gave it to Peak, the officer, and directed him to post it at the Tottenham North-office on Monday morning—if it was posted at half-past seven on Monday morning, it would be forwarded by the mail-cart to the principal office at Tottenham, where it would arrive about ten o'clock—it would then be placed in the London bag, and forwarded to the chief office in London—on Monday morning, 30th, I proceeded to Stamford-hill—I got there about ten o'clock—I there met the mail-cart that was bringing the bag from Tottenham—I took possession of the bag, and opened it—it did not contain this letter—I then went with Peak and Mr. Cole, one of the inspectors of letter-carriers, to the principal office at Tottenham, at which the prisoner was employed as a letter-carrier—I arrived there about half-past ten—I saw the prisoner leave the office, and when he had got about fifty yards I stopped him, and asked whether he bad cut open the Tottenham North-office bag that morning—I meant merely opened it in the usual course—he said, "No, Bowers did"—(he is another letter-carrier employed in the same office)—I asked whether he had sorted any of the letters—he said he had—I told him there was a money-letter missing—he made no answer—I then directed Peak to search him, and I saw him take this letter out of the inner pocket of his coat—it was in the same state as it is now, unopened—I then said to the prisoner, "How do you account for having this letter in your pocket?"—he said, "I did not know it was there"—I then gave him into custody—the letter bears the stamp of the North Tottenham-office—there is no date to it—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here opened the letter, and it contained a half-sovereign</hi>)—this is my half-sovereign—I put some mark on it—the prisoner would in sorting the letters have the opportunity of seeing the letter, and taking it if so minded—it has not been opened till the present moment.</p>

WOOLLETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there such a person at Miss Ingram, of Cliff-terrace? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is not; it was a fictitious name—I cannot say whether Peak knew there had been any irregularities—I merely gave him the letter, with instructions to put it into the post—he could form a very good idea for what object it was—I did not tell him anything; I told him to post that letter at such a time—I had many times instructed him to post letters for me—after the letter was posted by Peak, it would be taken out of the letter-box, by the receiver at Tottenham North-office, and tied up in a bundle—it would then come into the hands of Bowers and the prisoner—there are four letter-carriers employed there—I cannot say which of the four it would come to—when I got to Tottenham I entered the office in company with Peak and Mr. Cole—Peak was in plain clothes—I cannot say whether the men would know that Peak was an officer; he has been an officer twenty years, and a great many years belonging to the Post-office—when I entered there was only one person in the room, Ellis, an old letter-carrier—the four letter-carriers would be the only persons who would enter that room from the time the letter reached the office to the time I went there—their names are Ellis, Bowers, the prisoner, and Cates—they would all have access to the letters—the letter was found in the inner tail-pocket of the prisoner's official coat—he has been thirteen years in the service, of the Post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, 28th Sept., I received this letter from Mr. Sculthorpe—in consequence of directions from him, I retained it till Monday morning, and then, about twenty minutes past seven, I dropped it into the letter-box-at the North-office, Tottenham—I was afterwards, on the same morning, at the principal office at Tottenham—in consequence of directions from Mr. Sculthorpe I searched the prisoner, and found this letter, with the seal unbroken, in his left inside coat-pocket—I then took him into custody.</p>

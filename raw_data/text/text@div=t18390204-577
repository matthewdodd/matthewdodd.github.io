                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 27th of December, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I was in Grove-street, Hackney, on my beat—I heard a noise in a house, like the moving of tiles</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040034"></xptr>
               <p>—I went round to the front door, and found it on the latch—I opened it, and heard somebody rattling about up stairs—the sergeant came by, and gave me a lantern—I went up stairs, and he remained below—as I got on the landing, I was attacked in a most furious manner by a dog—I heard voices calling the dog—I went into the room, at the top of the house, which was three story high, and found a quantity of lead on the floor, and the two prisoners lying down concealed under some old sacks, with their clothes on—the lower part of the house is occupied, but not the upper part—i went down stairs and told the sergeant—we went up stairs, and ordered them to come down—we took them to the station-house, then returned, and in the room found a hole sufficient to admit a man's body through on the roof—the tiles, and lath and plaster, were taken off—they had got on the roof, and into the house that way, as I heard them moving the tiles—I found the gutter had been recently taken up from different parts—the pri<lb></lb>soners' clothes were very dirty, just the same as there was on our own clothes, with getting through the hole—their knees and the toes of their shoes were very dirty with dry mortar—the lead belonged to the gutter—it was two whole gutters—there had been three gutters, and one was gone entirely—as the prisoners came from the station-house to Worship-street, Sole said, had he got it away, it would have made a good hiss in the pan, meaning a good fry of beef-steaks, and a pot of beer—the lead fitted the gutters—there was 118 lbs. weight of it.</p>

When Henderson was committed to the Gate-house, the Prisoner (Poulter) was Turnkey, there was a Box that was ordered to be searched for at the Wife's Lodgings of the Footman, who has suffered. Poulter (the Prisoner) was sent to bring this Box; when the Box was examined, there was these Things missing that had been lost, the Rings mentioned in the Indictment, and the Pearl Necklace. This Poulter (the Prisoner) if our Instructions are true, charged the Colonel with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050015"></xptr> secreting these Goods. It is surprizing, that a Reflection of this Kind should be cast upon the Colonel, when at the same Time this Man had the Goods in his Possession.

               <p>Justice Burdus. He gave different Accounts, sometimes he denied it, sometimes he said he had only the Rings. At first he denied that he had any Thing; then upon having this Receipt produced to me, I asked if this was his Receipt. The first Day he denied all; the second Day, when he saw the Particulars produced, he owned it was his Hand-writing, and he received the Money for them, but said, that he found them in a Bag in the Dust-hole in the Gate-house. The Writing is as follows:</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any Dealings with him at any Time? What did you buy of him?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. Forty-nine Pearls, and three Diamond Rings.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy them?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. I bought them the latter End of October. One of the Rings he insisted upon having again, he said it was a Family-Ring. I bought two Diamonds of him, and one Socket, out of which the Diamond was taken. The Ring that he insisted upon having again, I put a Crystal in, and sent it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for them?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. I gave him 25 l. for the two Rings, and one Diamond.</p>
               <p>Q. What can you sell the Diamonds to a Gentleman for?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. For about 30 Guineas, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy any Thing else of him?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. Yes, I bought forty-nine Pearls.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for these?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. 4 s. 6 d. a-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth to be sold to a Gentleman for his Lady?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. I take them to be worth 6 or 7 s. or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you an Account how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. I had an unhappy Brother-in-law in the Gate-house at that Time; he sent me a Letter, that there was a Gentleman had some Diamonds and Pearls to sell. When I came, I said to my unhappy Brother, Who is the Gentleman? And he said, it was the Turnkey; I said, I did not care to buy of such People; he said I might, for he gave great Security, and he had married a Wife with a Fortune, and they were to take a great Inn, and they had bought fourteen Beds already, and had a Mind to part with these Things. At first he shew'd me a single Diamond; so says he, if you come in a Day or two, I shall have one bigger. Accordingly I came in a Day or two, so then he shewed me all the three, and he said one of them was a Family-Ring, that he must not part with that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of the Woman?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. When I came, she had one of them on her Finger.</p>

             had been guilty of the Robbery and Murder. At last Henderson owned he had stolen the Things before Poulter, and Poulter (the Prisoner) was sent to Henderson's Wife's Lodgings for the Box, in which were these Things, and there was a small Box put into the large one, in the Presence of Poulter; at that Time the great Box was produced before the Justice, but the little one was not.</p>

               <p>Callow. He was the Turnkey of the Goal when Henderson was in Custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Discourse with him about the Goods stolen by Henderson?</p>
               <p>Callow. I never had any Discourse, no farther than at the Time that Henderson was in Custody, he came to lock up the Goal, and he brought up the Boy to my Husband who is a Debtor there, he brought him up to lie with him. My Husband said, What, bring up Murderers to lie with them! The Prisoner (Poulter) said, he could not help it; he also said, he had taken an Instrument out of the House of Office, that his Lady was killed with. Poulter told this to my Husband and I.</p>
               <p>Q. From whose House of Office?</p>
               <p>Callow. That he had taken a Hatchet, or Cleaver, I cannot say which, from the Captain's House, and that he had been at the Boy's Wife's Lodgings to fetch a Box, and said there was two or three Rings and a Necklace, and said, with an Oath, he believed Sir

               <p>Q. Did you ever see them in his Possession?</p>
               <p>Callow. Yes, I have had the Rings several Times in my Hand; I had the Curiosity to look at them. About five Months ago, there was a Man committed for Felony, that had formerly been great with Mr Poulter, and he loaded him with Irons. The Man wanted a Letter to be wrote to some Friend; whilst the Letter was writing, he asked me if I saw Mrs Poulter go out To-day dressed; I said what was she dressed in, and he spoke of the Rings; I said, that was no new Thing. I had seen that before: So the Man said, if he could get clear of that, he would blow him, for they belonged to Captain

               <p>Q. Do you believe these to be the Rings she wore?</p>
               <p>Callow. My Lord, I believe they are?</p>
               <p>Q. Is that Woman, the Prisoner, reputed to be Poulter's Wife.</p>
               <p>Callow. Yes, my Lord, she goes for his Wife; but several Women have come and claimed him for their Husband besides her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, please to ask her what that Prisoner's Name was.</p>
               <p>Callow. He is gone beyond Sea, I cannot tell his Name, but the Woman has frequently wore these things; he has often beat her for wearing them; she wore them, and has washed her Hands in them; she has threatned him, that she could swear a Smack of Robbery against him, as she used to term it.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. First in Point of Law I would submit to your Lordship, how far the Evidence can affect the Prisoner, as to make him accessory to this Felony, as receiving them, knowing them to be stolen. The Gentlemen, in the opening of the Matter, they have been pleased to say, that there were two Ingredients that went to this Matter, to induce the Court to believe the Prisoner knew these things to be stolen - The first is charging Sir

As to one Part, we shall only observe that the Prisoner went with the Constable to take care of Henderson, as he was his Prisoner, the Constable went with him, and brought the Box corded before the Justice. The Prisoner further urges in his Favour, to shew his Innocency, that he did not know these things to be stolen; that from the first Time he found the things, she wore them constantly.</p>

               <p>Brogdon. When the things were missing, the Rings and Necklace, Sir Thomas asked Poulter if he knew any thing of them. Henderson confessed that he had stolen them, and that the little Box was put into the great Box. Henderson was so strictly searched, that it was impossible it should be about him, for his Shoes and Stockings were taken off, that he could not secret any thing.</p>

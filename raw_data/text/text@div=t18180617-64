            . I am a marshalman. On the 27th of May, in the evening, I went with Mr. Hincksman to the Rose and French Horn, in Wood-street, kept by Mr. Perch, and searched the one-pair back room, where the prisoner lodged, and found the articles stated in the indictment there-some of them in the cupboard, and some in hat-boxes. I waited there sometime, the prisoner did not come in while I was there. I was informed that he was in Hart-street; I followed, took him in Monkwell-street, and brought him into the back parlour. I told him I took him for robbing his master-he was agitated, but said nothing. I found five cravats in his coat-pocket, two yards and a half of jaconet muslin, and five duplicates. I returned to the public-house, and found the key of the cupboard where the goods were, in his possession. Mrs. Perch gave me six yards of black and white gingham, sixteen yards of calico, 15-16ths of jaconet, and one handkerchief. Sarah Gable gave me two dresses, six yards of gingham, and a handkerchief.</p>

            , who keeps the Rose and French Horn, public-house. The prisoner came to lodge in our house about the 19th of May, in the one-pair back-room, which Harrison searched. He brought one deal box and two hat-boxes with him. I gave him the key of the closet-he said he lived with the prosecutors. I bought a piece of calico wrapper of him, which he said were his perquisites. He said he had just left his situation. He left a piece of gingham with me - He asked me to buy it; I did not want it.</p>

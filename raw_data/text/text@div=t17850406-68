               <p>How long had you lodged together? - She only lodged with me that one night; in the course of the night she was up three times; first of all she pretended to be after the pot, and as such I handed it to her, she went to bed again, and in about two or three hours after she pretended to have drank rather too much; I used some vile words, I wanted to know the reason of being out of bed, as such the person got into bed again, I went to sleep; in the morning when I awoke, I found my door open, and my bed-fellow gone; I did not think I was robbed, for I always told Mrs. Webb, where I lodged, that if she was straitened for beds, she might put a decent person into my bed: I got up in the morning as usual, between eight and nine, I went to the pump, as I usually do, and washed myself, I put my hand into my pocket to shift my money as was usual, and it was gone; I went to look for my money, I came to Mrs. Webb, says I, pray what gentleman was that you put into my bed last night; she said he seemed to be a very good kind of a gentleman; still it passed on or half an hour or more; I took my pocket-book out of my pocket, and I had some papers of value to me and none to nobody else, but they were gone; I cannot say which way she went out of the house; but I am informed she got out and left the door open; I am sure I had the money when I went to bed.</p>

               <p>How was she dressed? - Being in bed, I only passed by her, I took no notice at all of her clothes, I saw it was a person that seemed to be smartly dressed.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did she agree to lay till six? - She asked me whether she could get out at four, I said, I would call her at six; she asked me to shew her my door, and I did; she never knocked at my door.</p>

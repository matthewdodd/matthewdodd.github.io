                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Ratcliffe-highway, in the parish of St. George-in-the-East. The prisoner was in my service at the latter part of August as foreman, and remained up to the 4th of Dec.—about a quarter before four o'clock that afternoon I and my wife went out and left the servant Rosetta Kershaw at home with our little boy—the prisoner was not in my service then—I returned home at half-past eleven at night, and found some policemen there—I went up stairs to the front room first floor, which is my bed-room, and saw the drawers removed from their place—one was moved into the middle of the room, and the back of the chest of drawers was broken out, three bottom drawers were unlocked, but the back of them was not dis<lb></lb>turbed—my wife's wearing apparel was taken out of them and strewed about the floor—those drawers, I believe, had not been locked—I missed out of a small drawer at the top, which bad been locked, two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, fourteen sovereigns, and four half-sovereigns, in a purse in a sample bag—those were all in that drawer—one note was a Bank of England—the other was a London and Westmin<lb></lb>ster Joint Stock Bank note—I am sure they were there when I went out, as before I went out I went to the drawer—the money was in a purse in front of the drawer then, and I moved it to the back part of the drawer when I took a cravat out—I felt the money in the purse—when I missed the money I found the back part of the drawer torn to pieces—I came down stairs, went into the parlour, and found the door of a folding cupboard wrenched open, and a till which had been in it was on the table—I missed from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver from it—that was safe when 1 went out—I had locked it just before I went out—I have seen a chisel and chopper and knife since in the hands of a policeman—the chisel and chopper are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. On Sunday, the 4th of Dec., I was left in the house with the child, master and mistress being out—I was in the kitchen between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and about five minutes after six I let the prisoner in—he came to stir the sponge—he was alone—I asked if he wanted a light—he said, "Yes"—I gave him one in the bakehouse—while I was putting the light there the pri<lb></lb>soner was pulling out a rope from under the trough—I went up stairs to the kitchen—I went into the parlour to get some tea, when I got the tea I shut the parlour door, and left it on the latch—there are two doors to the parlour, one leading from the shop, and the other to the passage—they were both shut</p>

               <p>when I got the tea, but not locked—they were latched—just before I sat down to tea the prisoner came to me, and asked me to lend him a knife—I gave him one—he had a rope and the chopper in his hand—he went up stairs and called me, "Lucy, I want you"—I said, "What do you want John?"—he said, "Step up stairs"—I went up to the top of the stairs, and asked what he wanted—he said, "Come in here"—he was in the back attic, stand<lb></lb>ing with his back against the door—I went in, and said, "What do you want?"—he said, "No matter"—he came out of the room, and pulled the door after him, shutting me in—I tried to pull the door from him, and opened it some space—he told me if I made a noise he would soon be my butcher, he would soon despatch me—I called him a cruel young man, and told him he was going to take an ill advantage after master and mistress were out—he said that was what he wanted—I begged him to let me have the child with me—he said he would bring the child up—he did bring it up, opened the door a short space, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the child in, and fastened it again—I had tried to get out while he was down stairs, but could not—he went down stairs, and I heard a chopping, and after the chopping I heard the sound of gold jink—the door was fastened on me with a rope tied to the banisters and run through the key-hole—there is no lock to the door—I called out to him, and begged him to let me out—he said he would let me out in a few minutes, but if I did not keep quiet he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for me—I heard, after that, one single sound of silver jinking—I endeavoured to get the door open, and did get it open eight or ten inches, sufficient to push the child out—I got out myself at last on my knees—I pulled the door open sufficient to force myself through, and rushed into my own room—I pulled the bedstead against the door, went to the window, and called for assistance—somebody answered me from the street—a policeman afterwards came, and I went into master's bed-room with the policeman—I found the back of the drawers chopped off—the three lower large drawers were open, and mistress's wearing apparel was strewed about the room—the two top drawers were broken open, they having been locked—I had been in the bed-room about half-an-hour before I let the pri<lb></lb>soner in, and the things were in their proper order then—I went down with the policeman to the parlour-door leading to the passage—it was open then—I saw a candlestick which I had been using, on the corner of the parlour-table, and the knife I had lent the prisoner—the chopper was on the side-board in the parlour—I saw a till on the table with some copper in it, but no other money—there was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the table, near the till, which I put into the till after the policeman came into the room—the cupboard doors were broken open—I had dusted down the table half-an-hour before, and there was no 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it then.</p>

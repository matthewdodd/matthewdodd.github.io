                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, G</hi> 14.) I have known the prisoner seven or eight years—in consequence of information I received in the early part of Dec., I went in search of him—I searched after him till 8th Jan., when, at eleven o'clock at night, I went with Sergeant Steadman to the tap-room of a beer-shop in Pear Tree-street, St. Luke's, called the Blue Lion, where there was a number of men, and among them the prisoner—I knew several of the men—I said to the prisoner, "How do you do, Mr. Thomas?"—he said, "My name is not Thomas"—I then said, "You enjoy yourself better than you did when you kept a shop in Golden-lane"—he made no answer—I said, "I knew you, too, when you kept a beer-shop in New Inn-yard"—he said, "Yes, I did"—Knight said, "Oh, I knew Mr. Harvey when I was a little boy;" to which the prisoner replied, "Oh, I remember him when I kept this beer-shop"—I then called him to the front of the bar outside, and told him that I wanted him for passing forged notes, fives and tens, at Walworth—he said he did not know anything about it—I said I suspected him to be the man, and he must go to the station with me—on the way to the station, he wanted to go home, to take his wife the key—he did not tell me where his house was—I told him I should not let him go—on that he said, "Well, it is no use to deceive you; I have been made a dupe of, and I have lost 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it"—he said he had been engaged by a countryman to change these notes for him, and he told him that he would put him into business, or lend him some money to start in business—he said he was glad I had come, for he had been out of the way for about five weeks, and he was sick of it—he said if the case was not exposed in the papers, he would soon find the right party—I searched him at the station, and found the latch-key of his house—he gave his address, "16, Peartree-street," and asked me to take the key—I did so, and found it was the Blue Lion beer-shop, where 1 had taken him from—he had not said a word about lodging there when I first took him—I found from the landlord that he did not live there—the prisoner was remanded from 9th Jan. to the 14th—I attended the second examination—as I passed him, as he was in the dock, he said to me, "How came you to say that you took me from among thirty or forty swindlers, as stated in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper?"—I said, "I know nothing about the <hi rend="italic">Times"</hi>—he said he should complain to the Magistrate—he did not do so—I noticed to him that his whiskers were shaved off—he said he need not have done that, for he owned that he passed the notes—he said he should brine: parties forward to prove where he had the notes from, and bring his uncle forward.</p>

               <p>when you gave evidence before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I recollected them, but they did not take them all down; they put down the principal part—it was in the clerk's office that he said he should bring his uncle forward, at the last examination I believe—the Magistrate was not present—that was not said in answer to any question by the clerk—I believe it was said to one of the witnesses—he said it loud enough for the clerk to hear; and I believe the clerk told him if he had anything to say he had better mention it by and by.</p>

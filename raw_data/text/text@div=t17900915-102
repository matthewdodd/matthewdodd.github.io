I told him, I had been absent about three minutes; and the baskets of linen were in the hall; how many I cannot positively tell: when I came back again the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Now look at the prisoner Wilson; did you know him before? - I never saw him before that night.</p>

               <p>How soon did you see him again? - That day week; I saw him again at the justice's, in Poland-street, at Mr. Read's office.</p>
               <p>Did you then know the man? - Yes, directly.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that that is the man that came with the shoes? - Yes; I am very sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you observe his dress at all? - No; it was his face I observed; I had but a little time to observe that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say at Mr. Read's office, that if I was the person I had not the same clothes on, and that you could not swear positively to me? - I did not say so; but when I saw him at Mr. Read's office I swore positively to him.</p>
               <p>And likewise I told you, that if I was the man I never changed my clothes, and even by my tongue you could not be deceived; but they would not let me speak?</p>
               <p>Court. You have heard what the prisoner said to you; did you know his voice again? - No, Sir; I did not take any notice of his voice; but I said, I could swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say that in his presence? - No; it was other people that told me of the man when he was taken, before I saw him at Justice Read's office; because then I was not certain whether I should know him or not; but I never said so after I had seen him at the office.</p>
               <p>Was he in those clothes when you saw him at Justice Read's? - Yes; he was.</p>

               <p>I am an officer at Poland-street. On Saturday last I took the prisoner Wilson in Tottenham-court-road, on the Terrace; I dropped into the yard, and said, Wilson, I want you; he said to me; Brown, I find that my wife and child are in the watch-house; said he, do you know what is against me; I hear Lovett hath broke my box open, and taken my coat; is there any thing else against me that you know of? I told him, that as to the coat, I believed it was his own; but he desired me to think, and to tell him what was against him; I told him the cap on his wife's head, and the stockings on her legs, had been sworn to; that he must go along with me; he desired me to say that I had not seen him; I said it is of no use, for go with me you must; afterwards he said, if I must go with you, I must go with you; I brought him to the justice's: I have often seen him before.</p>

               <p>I am a landress; I work for Mrs. Wheeler. On the 4th of September I sent home four baskets of linen to Mrs. Wheeler's, by my servant, Spelman.</p>
               <p>Have you had any opportunity of examining the contents of the basket that was missed? - Yes, all of them; the basket was mine; and I know what was missed; there was two very fine book-muslin aprons, flounced top and bottom, and drawn at top.</p>
               <p>(The value not insisted on by the counsel for the prosecution; but the basket was deposed to by a black mark on one of the bandles, burnt with a candle; she likewise deposed to the other things produced.)</p>

                  , in the dwelling house of the said lady Mary dowager, countess of Macclesfield
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>MR. LARK. I am a painter, I was employed to paint lady Macclesfield's house, the prisoner was employed by me to work at the dowager's house. On Monday the 19th of October I discovered the drawers in the back parlour, and the butler's room were broken open; I being at work in the house, I found they had been broken open by a tool that painter's use; I have the tool here; this was the mark of this point of the knife in several places; and this iron was used to poise the knife to force the lock down. There is twenty locks broken in trunks and drawers, and so forth. I discovered this on Monday, and the prisoner not being at work on the Saturday, nor on the Monday, my suspicion fell on him. I immediately applied to Mr. Conant in Marlborough-street, he sent Jackson with me immediately, to see the condition of the house. In Oxford-street we met

             the officer, from his information, and by the description of the man, we went to the Savoy; we found Field there; he had been taken to the office in the morning as a deserter, and was sent to the Savoy. The officer took him in custody. The property was traced to be pawned by him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. You had several workmen in your employ in that house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLMOTT. I live in Bird-street, Oxford-street. On the 14th of October the prisoner came and pledged a gown for five shillings; I had seen him before.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, 72, High-street, Mary-le-bone. I believe the prisoner is the person that pledged the things on the 14t hand on the 15th of October; he pledged on the 14th a pelisse and a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pledged that pelisse with you. - A. I believe the prisoner; I have no doubt; he pledged the pelisse for eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth. - A. It is worth more money.</p>
               <p>Q. I must have the truth, whether your character is at stake or not, what is it worth. - A. I cannot tell what it may be worth, second hand things sell so bad; it is worth a guinea or more; I never looked at it much.</p>
               <p>Q. Then look at it, what is it made of. - A. Pretty fine cloth.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it not made of ladies' fine cloth. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I shall have the truth at last - upon your oath what is it worth. - A. It may be worth to the owner, perhaps, two guineas; it may be worth more to the owner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how much is it worth. - A. I should make no doubt it cost three guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How much more. - A. It might cost three or four pounds; it has been worn a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how much is it worth now. - A. It might be worth a guinea now, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath is it not worth two. - A. It may to the wearer; I do not think it would sell for more than a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath am I to understand you to say you think it would not sell for more than a guinea. - A. No, I do not think it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is an answer - is it not made of the finest ladies' cloth - A. Yes, but I do not know how wide the cloth runs.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell me, perhaps, how many yards there is in it. - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much a yard it is, perhaps you can tell me that - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. So you lend money upon things, the value of which you do not know. - A. The whole of it is this; he only wanted money on this for three or four days; he said it was his sister's; of course I said it would do for eight shillings; I lent him that on it, he had never pawned any thing with me before, to the best of my knowledge; he pawned it in the name of

               <p>Q. Very likely, but have you a doubt about it. - A. Very little doubt about it; there may be another man like him.</p>

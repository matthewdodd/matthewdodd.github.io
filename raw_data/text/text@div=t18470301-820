                  </hi>. I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner lived in our house—my husband went out on Sunday, after dinner, and left his watch on the table—the prisoner came up in the afternoon, with her little boy, and asked me some question about my husband, whether he was gone on board—the little boy took the watch up in his hand—he was about four years old—the watch was on the sideboard—the prisoner took it out of his hand, and put it to his ear, and told me to put it off the sideboard, on to the mantel-piece—next morning, about a quarter to nine o'clock, she came up and asked me the time—I said the watch was on the mantel-piece—she went to the mantel-piece, and took it up—I went to make the bed, and took no notice of the watch till my husband came home to dinner and asked for his watch, and it was gone.</p>

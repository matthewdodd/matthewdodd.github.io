                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. On the 20th of July, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was in Hampstead-road, and saw the prisoner coming out of the garden-gate of No. 34, Mornington-place, with a bag. I went up to him and said, "What have you here!"—he said, "Never mind, it is all right"—I said, "I must know what it is"—he said, "I had it given to me, it is all right"—I said, I must take him to the station-house—he dropped the bag and said, he would be d—d if he would carry it—I called another constable, took him to the station, and in his coat-pocket I found seven brass knobs, seven escutcheons, and the other articles named; and in the bag was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bs. of lead—I went back to the house with the articles, and found the door shut, but not fastened—I found the brass knobs taken from the cocks, and these fitted them—the sink was cut, and taken away—the service-pipe, and other parts of the lead, and the lead and other articles, completely fitted the places they had been taken from—I found the premises belonged to the Railroad Company—I found a screw-driver on the prisoner, and there were marks of the screw-driver on the places the things were taken from.</p>

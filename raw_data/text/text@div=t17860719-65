               <p>On the 5th of June I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; I live in Liverpool; the prisoner at the bar was a man shipped with me to go down to Liverpool; I was alongside the ship on Monday evening about nine o'clock; it is called the Delight; I was master of her; and about half past ten the same evening not finding my own boat there, I took a sculler and went on board; in the morning not finding the mate on board, I turned out about five and called the people up; then I went down, I went to look in my trunk to get my linen out; my trunk was kept in my cabin; all my linen was gone, what quantity I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Which side of the water was this vessel? - It lay abreast of the Tower, on the Middlesex side; I also lost my coat and waistcoat which were not in the trunk, the cloth coat was lost from the cabin, the waistcoat trimmed with gold was in the trunk; I examined the people and found the prisoner was not on board; I went about eight in the morning to Justice Smith's in East Smithfield, and there I saw the prisoner, and part of the property was found and brought there; I saw four shirts there, the marks had been newly picked out; I am sure they are mine; I saw the waistcoat and the coat; the linen stock is marked J. T. I had not seen the prisoner in the cabin that day; my trunk had been on board six or eight days.</p>

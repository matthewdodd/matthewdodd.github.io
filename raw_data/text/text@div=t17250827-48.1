             thus deposed: Elizabeth White offered me a Parcel of these Stockings to sell. She ask'd me 4 s. a Pair, and presently fell to 2 s. and said, if I would give that, she would fetch the whole Bundle, and the Man that own'd them. This made me believe that she did not come honestly by them; and therefore I desired her to go for the rest, but to bring them as privately as she could. In the mean time I sent for a Constable; but White, and the other Prisoner Grey, with a great Bundle of Stockings, were with me before him. In order to detain them till the Constable came, I made them tell over the Stockings, set down the Prices separately, and then cast them up. The Men's he allow'd at 2 s. Boys at 6 d. and Childrens at 3 d. At these Prices they came to 4 l. 16 s. in all. I told them they must abate the odd 16 s. but Grey said he could not afford it. You can if you will, says I. But who do they belong to? Perhaps I may come into Trouble about them. There is no Fear of that, says Grey, the Goods are mine, and I will bear you Harmless. By this time, my Husband and the Constable came in. Grey look'd very shy upon them, and whisper'd me to take the Goods at my own Price, and let him go But we secured them both.</p>

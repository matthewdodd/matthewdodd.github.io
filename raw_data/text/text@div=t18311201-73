            . I am an umbrella-maker. I was on the opposite side of the way - I saw the scuffle, saw the prisoner strike Mr. Burton in the face, and throw him down; as he fell he said, "Oh, dear, Stop thief!" I pursued the prisoner, who ran down George-court - he got to the bottom, and turned to the left; when I got to the bottom the Policeman had him by the collar - I said, "That is the man - he has knocked a gentleman down, and taken his watch;" I assisted in taking him back - I saw the Policeman take the watch from the prisoner's hand.</p>

            . On the 9th of November last, I was in company with Woodroffe, another officer. I observed the prisoner at the bar in the middle of <placeName id="t18151206-58-crimeloc322">Bridge-street, Black-Friars</placeName>

He put his hand into the gentleman's left hand coat pocket, and pulled out a silk handkerchief about four or five inches. He left it then for about a quarter of a minute, and then returned; when he pulled it totally out, I was shoved away from him by the mob; but told Woodroffe to keep close to him. I and Woodroffe took him into custody just as he had wiped his nose with the same handkerchief, and put it into his hat. I told Woodroffe to take him to the compter, while I went after the gentleman, but I could not come up to him.</p>

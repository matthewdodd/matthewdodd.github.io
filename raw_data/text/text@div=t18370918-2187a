In the early part of March, 1831, I went to Buckingham, and met with Susannah Green; and as they thought I was a man of property, they wished to inveigle me into a marriage, which was done in a few days, and took place on the 14th of March—I found the next day she was with child, and had been taking something to destroy it; and, on questioning her, I found she had two other children, which so disgusted me that I left her on the third day; she so annoyed me that I took to live with her again, but her conduct, and drink, and filth, made me determine on leaving her—I allowed her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on the 19th of July I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the next morning she gave information, and took me into custody—I am very willing to allow what is necessary for the support of my two children, and wish to spend my days with the last wife, who is a very worthy woman; and I hope the Court will have mercy on me—I lived six years with Dr. Ingham, of Trinity College.</p>

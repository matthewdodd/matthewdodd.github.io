            . I am a pawnbroker, on the 21st of Sept. the prisoner at the bar brought the things here in court, to me to pledge; I suspected they were not her own: I asked her, where she got them ? she told me her mistress sent them; and that her mistress's husband was arrested, and she wanted to make up a little money, because he should not go to goal; I told her, I would send somebody along with her, to see whether it was so or no; I sent one with her; she carried him to quite a contrary place to where she had told me her mistress lived: I advertised the things, and the prosecutrix came and owned the things.</p>

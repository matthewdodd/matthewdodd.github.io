               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can he swear I took two watches when he found one lying at the bottom of the window? Witness. At the time he took the watches one fell outside, and the other one he took away with him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WILLIAMS, Jun. I am the prosecutor's son. I saw the prisoner break the window - I am certain he is the man - I and my two brothers were at the door, just going to school, and I saw him knock his elbow or hand through the window, and take two gold watches and one gold chain - one watch dropped outside on the pavement, and that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150038"></xptr>immediately picked up and took in doors - he got away with the gold watch and gold chain - I saw him put the watch towards his right side pocket - I saw persons pursuing him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you when I put the watch into my right hand pocket? A. At the door - you were round the corner nearly - he put it in that direction - I did not swear at Guildhall that you took three watches.</p>

             (policeman 96). I heard a cry of"Stop him!" - the prisoner passed me in Giltspur-street - I pursued him into Smithfield, Hosier-lane, and in King-street, as he was gaining ground on me, I called Crawley, my brother policeman, to follow him - I still followed, and on Saffron-hill found him in custody - I searched him at the station-house, and he took a gold watch and chain himself from his right hand coat pocket, it seems, but I thought it was his right hand breeches pocket - the prosecutor claimed it - the prisoner, when he produced it, said, "I have just got what I wanted."</p>

             re-examined. I know these watches - I gave the officer the one found in the street - it was on the window-ledge - I am sure I gave him the same my son gave me - they both hung in my window - there was a gold watch beside, which fell inside the window - that was a third watch - three watches were disturbed.</p>

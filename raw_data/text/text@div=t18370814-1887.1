                  </hi>. I am single, and kept a house in Cow-lane, Shadwell, at the time in question. On Sunday, the 16th of July, I left my house about nine o'clock at night—I left no one in it—I bolted the parlour shutter and locked the door—I returned about eleven o'clock, and found the shutters standing wide open, a square of glass was broken, and the window up quite sufficient to let any body in—I went up stairs, and missed the property stated—I saw part of it again the same night, and part on Tuesday, at the station-house—I had met both the female prisoners in High-street, Shadwell, the same night, about ten o'clock, and they asked me to give them something to drink, which I did, at the White Hart—I went into the house and drank some gin with them—I was there about ten minutes—we came out together, and I left them afterwards about a hundred yards from my house—I went and supped at a friend's</p>

               <p>Christopher Green. I am Dr. Burton's Coachman, My Master's Stables are in Bartlet-street, and they join to his Dwelling-house in <placeName id="t17370907-58-crimeloc299">Dover street</placeName>

The Stables are at the End of his Gardens, and the Prisoner got over the Wall into the Garden, and so into the Stables, where I was abed, and my Cloaths lying by me, he drest himself in them and was taken with them upon his Back, about Three o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he get into the Stable?</p>
               <p>Green. Thro' a Sash Window. I waked just as he had drest himself in my Cloaths, and cry'd - who's there! upon that he jump'd out at the Window; I open'd the Door and took him directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173709070039"></xptr>- Nuttal. I am a Watchman, and was calling the Hour, - 'twas past Three o'Clock, when Christopher Green call'd me to assist him. I saw the Prisoner jump thro' the Window; Green seiz'd him and order'd me to take Care of him. He had the Man's Coat, Waistcoat and Breeches upon him. I asked him how he came to take the Things? And he told me, - the Devil put it into his Head.</p>

               <p>I know nothing how it came about. I was looking for Work about Three o'Clock in the Morning and these Men took me.</p>

            . I lived with Mr. Duston in Piccadilly, but never saw the prisoner before the Friday, the day before I was robbed I met him about twelve or one o'clock, and was with him drinking all the day long; he had me about from one alehouse to another drinking, and he desired me to come away from my place, and to be a chairman along with him; I was pretty much fuddled, so fetched my things from Mr. Duston's, a coat, waistcoat, a frock, two pair of breeches, four pair of stockings, seven shirts, a looking-glass, a razor, and two handkerchiefs, all in a-sack ; I carried all these goods from alehouse to alehouse where we went; on the Saturday in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, we got to the house of Mr. Jones in <placeName id="t17530111-19-crimeloc94">York-street, by St. James's church</placeName>

               <p>Phacker No. I have not.

            . I saw the prisoner and prosecutor come in with a sack with some things in it at Mr. Jones's at the Red-Lion almost three weeks ago, it was about three o'clock in an afternoon; the prosecutor seemed to be a little in liquor, but the prisoner did not seem so much in liquor ; they sat down, the prisoner brought the sack in, and the box in it behind him, and called for a pint of beer; the prosecutor laid his head down as if going to sleep soon after he came in; the prisoner called for the boy to take the reckoning, he gave him a shilling, and the boy brought him his change, which the prisoner received; then he took the bag and went away with it; I followed him to the corner of York-street, and then came back and told the prosecutor, we went out but could not meet with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity seemed to be in the sack?</p>
               <p>Cosier. There seemed to be about as much as two bushels.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Jones at the Red-Lion. About a fortnight ago I saw the prisoner and prosecutor come in about twelve o'clock, the prosecutor had a bag, they called for a pint of beer, which I drew, and when they had drank about half out, as the prosecutor was asleep, the prisoner said he would pay for this pint of beer, so gave me a shilling and I gave him his change accordingly; then he took the bag the prisoner had put down in the corner, and went out directly, I saw him carry it cross his shoulder over the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I met this man near Piccadilly, and he asked me to break him into a chair with him; I said I would if we could agree ; we went into a house and drew articles for 18 shillings. he gave me a shilling in hand and a shilling afterwards. I went from thence to Rosemary Lane, and going through the Minories met a baker's man riding on a horse with a pair of hampers: I saw some bags and said, baker, will you sell me one of them bags? so I bought one and went to Tower-Hill and bought three shirts, two pair of breeches, two pair of second-hand stockings, one pair of shoes, and put them in this bag; he was with me, he carried them one part of the way and I the other, till we came to Leicester Fields, where I met two brother chairmen ; there I gave him the bag, and he carried it into a publick house in the Hay Market; when we came out, I said, if you'll carry it farther I'll give you a pint of beer, so he carried it to King-street, St James's, and then to the Red-Lion in York street, where he set it down in the corner and fell asleep; it being my property I took it away with me; we were both drunk; I suppose he thought himself not able to be a chairman, so he took the advantage of me to get money out of me.</p>

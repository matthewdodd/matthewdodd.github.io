               <p>THOMAS TURNPENNY. I am an officer. On the 15th of May, I had directions to watch in <placeName id="t18170702-6-crimeloc30">Coleman-street</placeName>

I collared him, and took him into the house, I asked him where the two bags were that he brought into the house? Brothers was present. Moore said, what bags? I have brought no bags in here; I then asked Brothers, and he said he knew nothing about any bags being brought in. I found several rolls of paper, and one bag of fine wool, in the shop; I asked him again where the bags were that he had brought in? they both answered, that there were no such things brought in there - I found them on the landing of the first-floor, and knew them to be the same. Brothers said he slept at the top of the house - I went there, and found a roll of cloth, the bags had wool in them. I took them both into custody. Moore asked one of us to go with him to his masters' warehouse, for fear it should be robbed, as he had left it open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. They did not see me; I took notice of the bags as he carried them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Brothers's house is under repair-the workmen were all over the house; he was in the shop. If Brothers had been in the parlour he must have seen Moore go in with the wool.</p>
               <p>SMITH. I am an officer, and was with Turnpenny. I saw Moore come out with the bags of wool on his shoulder. They both said they knew nothing about it. I went back with him to his master's house, by his desire, and found the candle burning; he offered me 1l. to let him see his master.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WELCH. I lodged with Brothers. The wool was not brought to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The door is kept open.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>RICHARD BROWN (witness for Brothers). I am a milkman. I was at Brothers's house at the time the officers were at his door; I had been in the place ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before they came; Brothers was sitting down behind the counter, and had no intercourse with anybody. Any person could go in or out without his knowing it. I did not see the man come in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was serving him with milk; it is a small shop - They could not come into the shop without my seeing them.</p>

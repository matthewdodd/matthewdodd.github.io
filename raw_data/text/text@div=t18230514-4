On the 11th of April, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to see a print, which laid in the window - I shewed her several; she bought none, but asked for two patterns, which I gave her; she then bought some muslin, which came to 1 s. 2 d., but said she had only 1 s. without changing a sovereign. As she stood at the counter I saw the second print I had showed her under her shawl; I said nothing until I could be certain it was ours. I missed it from the counter - she was going out, and I went after her; she had got to the door. I saw a woman go from her. I brought the prisoner back, but she had not got the print - I am sure she had it when she went to the door - I have not found it. She said she lived round the corner, at the first butter shop. I said,</p>

               <p>"Yes," she said,</p>
               <p>"it was a young person from the country." When she was secured, she said she lived in Chandos-street.</p>

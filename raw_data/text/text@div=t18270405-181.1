On the 6th of March I met the prisoners at Ponder's-end Middlesex - as I passed them Lawrence said, "I think you know me;" I said I did; he said, "Well, we will have a pot of beer;" we went into the Goat public-house, and had a pot of beer - I drank once, but told them I had no money; I saw a piece of print in Lawrence's pocket - he said, "For God's sake, don't you say you saw me; if you should get to Hare-street" - I afterwards heard King had been robbed, and gave information - before we went to the public-house I saw Lawrence shew the print to a woman; I do not know what he said to her, or what she took away, as I was at some distance - Uncle was close by at the time - there appeared about fifteen yards of print.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Enfield. On the 6th of March I went into the Nag's Head public-house - Lawrence was there - he asked me to drink, and then asked if I would walk with him across Edmonton fields; we went near Edmonton church, and met Uncle with a bundle - they had some conversation, which I did not hear. We had some more beer, and crossed the fields towards Enfield - Uncle opened his bundle in the field, and took out a large piece of print, but we saw Camp the constable coming along, and they put it up again and went on. I had a basket on my shoulder - they asked me to put the bundle into it, which I did. When we came near Enfield town they took the bundle out - we went into the Rising Sun public-house, and had some beer. Camp came in and said, "What is in that bundle?" Uncle said"A piece of cloth;" Camp untied it, and said, "This is print;" Uncle said, "I meant print;" we were all taken into custody. I heard Lawrence say at the watch-house, that if he was asked where he got the bundle, he should say an Irishman gave it them to carry; and he said, "If Mr. King comes down I shall be done;" but they should say an Irishman met them at Eofield highway, and said, "How does trade go?" and he would say, "Very badly;" and he said, "If you will carry this I will pay you." I saw Uncle pull his stocking down, and take out two duplicates from there, and put them under a piece of paper at the bottom of his hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of William Warner; he keeps a stationer's shop in Chapel-street, Pentonville. On the 27th of January, I was in the shop—the two prisoners came in—Wilson came first, and asked for a halfpenny pen, which I gave him—he then asked me for a piece of paper to write a direction, which I also gave him—Wilton then came in for</p>

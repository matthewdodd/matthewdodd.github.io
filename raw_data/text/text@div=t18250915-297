On the morning of the 13th of July, I missed from my shop a linen shirt collar - I asked if he knew any thing about it - he said he did not - I said he must, as I had seen it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150109"></xptr>the drawers a very few days before, and had intended to take it away - there was no one there but him, my wife, and myself - he then acknowledged that he did take it away, but did not tell me where it was - I said I had missed several other things, and he must have taken them away - he denied it - I said I should like to see his box - he went up stairs very readily and opened it, and turned out two or three pairs of gloves, which I believe belonged to me - on opening a hymn-book there, I found a number of duplicates of my property - I asked whose they were - he said they were not his - I said, "How came they to be pawned in your name?" he said they belonged to a youth of his acquaintance, who lived at a cutler's shop in Martin's-court - I said that was not likely - he was then taken into custody by the officer, who found the collar in his coat pocket - we went round to different pawnbrokers, and found most of the articles - they are articles which I deal in, and I had missed similar articles from my shop - there are no marks on any but the shawl, which is worth about 16 s. - there is no single article worth 40 s.</p>

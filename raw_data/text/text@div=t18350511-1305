The ground-floor is at present unoccupied—the house belongs to William Page—there are several other lodgers—there is a staircase door at the bottom of the stairs, which come into the street; it is generally shut at night—every lodger has a key to the street-door—I went out about six o'clock in the evening on the 4th of May—I am the sole occupier of my room, and am single—I returned at nine o'clock, and found my door shut, but not locked—I had locked it when I went out—three of my drawers had been emptied—I missed seven gowns, two pairs of stockings, and all the articles mentioned—they were all safe when I left home, and were worth about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I went out at five o'clock, I saw the prisoner with three others; they passed and re-passed two or three times—I had had a quarrel with the sister of one of them—none of my property has been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isaac Addison—he is a soldier in the Grenadier Guards. I lodge in the next room to the prosecutrix—about seven o'clock that evening, I saw the prisoner near her door, on the first step of her stairs—he had two large parcels, one under each arm—one was in her brown apron—I am sure it was her apron—I had seen him there about three weeks before, when he came to my door and asked for a person who did not live in the house.</p>

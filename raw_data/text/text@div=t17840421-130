               <p>Have you brought the direction with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the hand-writing? - No.</p>
               <p>You say all the things were put into a box, and you believe that box was never opened in the way to London, I should be glad to see this key of this lock that nobody can pick; is that your reason for supposing that it has never been opened? - I have always had the key in my custody.</p>

               <p>Has the box been out of your sight? - It has.</p>
               <p>In whose hands? - When I brought the prisoner to London, I brought the box with me, and put a chain round it, and put a padlock round that, and locked it besides, it was taken to Mr. West and Thomas by a porter, it might be nine or ten days out of my sight, I thought it was as safe as if it was in sight, it was locked up by me, and I unlocked it at Guildhall, and locked it again, they were then taken to Mr. Thomas's house by one of his servants, and this morning I saw them at Mr. Thomas's, they were never out of my sight till they were locked up.</p>

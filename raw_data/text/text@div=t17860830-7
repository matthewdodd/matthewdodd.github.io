               <p>I left town about three on Sunday afternoon.</p>
               <p>What day of the month? - It was in July, the latter end of July; I think the gentleman at the bar was apprehended on the 4th of August, and it was the Sunday before that.</p>
               <p>When did you return again? - Between nine and ten the same evening; when I returned I opened my drawers to take out a night cap or something, and I found that my drawers had been opened, and every thing of value taken out; I left the drawers unlocked.</p>
               <p>Mention a few of the things that were lost? - There were several shirts, and three pair of black silk stockings; the marks are cut out of most of the things; there were two pair of sheets, and near two dozen of stocks, several pairs of breeches, handkerchiefs, neckcloths, stocks; I suspected the prisoner on account of my uncle having lost some things a few days before; and he suspected him, and said he would speak to his mother; I immediately called up the maid and told her, she said, she knew nothing of it; I said no more of it that night, the next morning I went to Bow-street; the prisoner acknowledged nothing.</p>

               <p>Was any thing found in consequence of that? - I believe it was the Saturday following some of the property was found.</p>

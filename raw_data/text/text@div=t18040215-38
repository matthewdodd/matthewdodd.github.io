               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I have seen him in my shop several times; he came to my shop under pretence of buying a lot of jewellery and plate; the last time he came was, I think, on the 1st of February, he represented himself as a person keeping a stall in the West Indies; I shewed him a lot, he staid a considerable time in looking at the articles, he staid an hour or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he purchase any? - A. We could not agree about the price; he called again, I think, on the 1st of February, he desired I would turn it over in my mind, and let him look at the articles again; I let him see them again, he examined them more minutely, it was a large lot, and came to upwards of two hundred pounds; I told him I would take two hundred pounds for the lot; he bid me one hundred and ninety-three pounds, or thereabouts; he told me to turn it in my mind, and then went away, and said he would come at the time appointed; in consequence of his not coming to the time appointed I looked over the things, and missed several of the articles, to the amount of thirty pounds, he never came to me; I found him by the means of Mr. Dobree, on Monday evening last, at Mr. Dobree's, No. 68, Oxford-street; he was taken to the office in Marlborough-street. On searching him there, an opera-glass was found on him with my private mark and number, it was in his coat-pocket, and a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that opera-glass? - A. Half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in the articles he had been looking over? - A. Yes, I am sure; the lot I had been shewing him were not in the shop, they were my own private concern, I have them under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other part of your property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop part of your house? - A. Yes; I and my partner live there, we occupy the house jointly.</p>

            . I am the wife of Joseph Davis. The prisoners came to lodge at my house on the 19th of December, and were to give me 5s. 6d. per week - they had been but about two hours in my room, and were in and out a good deal; I began to be suspicious that they did not bring the goods they had said they would, and set my daughter to watch them - Marshall went and pawned a counterpane belonging to Mrs. Kemsley, and then she went and pawned a blanket of mine.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Was the man in the room when the woman went out? A. I believe he shaved himself, and went out after her - I went up just before, and saw him shaving himself; she had the key of the room when she returned - there is a private door, and we were in the shop; she told me she did it by his desire.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you have any reference? A.She told me she came from a good way off - I think Hampstead-road, and said she was going to bring in a mahogany table and a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Marshall put in a written Defence, pleading extreme poverty, and stating that she has been respectably situated in life.</p>

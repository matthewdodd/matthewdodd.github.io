                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and occupy a shop and parlour at No. 39, Well-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone. It is let out in different tenements—I sleep on the premises—there is an outer door, which is left open for all to go in at—the landlord does not live in the house—I have a key to my apartments, and live in them separately—on the 16th of June, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I returned home, having been out, and observed my parlour window shutter open—I am quite certain it was shut quite close when I went out at eleven o'clock—I am not certain that it was secured—I looked in at the window, and saw the prisoner behind the counter—he had turned on the gas, and I had a full view of him—I shut down the window and the shutter, and called out "Police"—I ran out into the road, and met one—he ran round the court while I returned to the front—the door was shut, but not fastened—it was too—I saw the prisoner going across the road—I followed him, and caught hold of him—he knocked me down, and caused a wound over my eye—I got up again, and ran after him—a mob assembled round me,</p>

On the 10th of February, I left the shop, and bolted the front door inside, and fastened the back door outside by a secret way. I went to master's house, in Leadenhall-street, returned about eight o'clock in the morning, and found every thing gone. The front door was partly open, and the pannel broken. I missed the provisions stated in the indictment, which were all safe in the shop the night before they were worth 10 l. or 12 l. A shirt, which hung behind the door, was taken. I have since seen some hams, two tongues, and two skewers: one skewer had been in a round, and the other in a brisket of beef; I knew the skewers.</p>

On Monday, the 14th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, Johnson called on me - I went with him to Sawgood's father's house, in Hoxton-market-place; I asked if the son was at home: his mother denied him, but I found him in the back room, with the prisoner Burt - we took from the table several German sausages, two tongues, a round of beef, and a piece or two of brisket - two skewers were in the beef; and Sawgood gave me some polonies and hams from the cupboard. We had only said that we wanted them; we took them to the watch-house, and about half-past 12 o'clock I took Taylor, at the Bishop Blaze, public-house, about half a mile from Sawgood's.

            . I keep the Bishop Blaze, public-house. Burt was at my house about ten o'clock on the 11th of February, and I believe the other two were there, but am not sure. Next morning (Saturday) Burt came between nine and ten o'clock; whether either, or both the others were with him I cannot tell, for there were several of them together - they brought ham, cut into slices, with them, and remained there an hour or more; they had some porter - I took them some knives and a plate: they went away. Burt came again at night, and I think the others. On Monday, a little after twelve o'clock, in consequence of what my pot-boy said, I called Taylor out of the taproom, and showed him some ham which was left in the kitchen chair on Sunday night, and asked if he knew any thing of it (I had just then heard of this robbery) - he said it did not belong to him, but he knew to whom it did belong; I desired him to take it off my premises, as I suspected something wrong about it; he said he expected the young man there about dinner time. He went away with it, returned, and the officer took him.</p>

I went up, and saw the ham and beef - he said a man met him in the Curtain-road, and asked him to take care of it till morning. When I was getting up the officers came.</p>
               <p>SAWGOOD'S Defence. On Friday night I was at the Bishop Blaze - I returned home about eleven o'clock; my father let me in - I remained there till morning, when I went out; I met Burt, and went to the Bishop Blaze, and had a pint of beer. I went there again on Saturday - a few words arose between me and Burt; I went home at night, and met a man, who asked the way to Old-street; and when we came to Boot-street, leading to where I live, he said he had a few things, and if I would take care of them till Saturday morning, he would satisfy me - I said I did not like to take things up stairs without my father's knowledge; he said, "Never mind, there will be no trouble about them" - he went, and brought me these things in a bag, and gave me a small ham, just out, for myself - I took them up, and placed them on a table, which would not hold them all - I put the rest in the cupboard, and on Sunday morning I cut some slices off the ham he gave me, and took them to the Bishop Blaze. I got Taylor to take care of a small one. Burt came and slept with me that night - he asked what these things were, and I told him. When the officer came in the morning my mother said I was not at home, she thought; but she called out, John, and I answered. The officer came and took the things off the table; I said there was more in the cupboard.</p>

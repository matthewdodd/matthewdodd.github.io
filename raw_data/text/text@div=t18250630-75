I saw Mr. Harmer on Saffron hill; the prisoners were sitting on a step on the opposite side, and when Mr. Harmer passed about ten yards they got up, and followed him into West-street - I there saw Dutton take the handkerchief out of Mr. Harmer's pocket - Morgan was close to him - I know that the spot where they took it is in the City. Mr. Harmer got about twenty yards when I told him. I returned with him, and saw them go into the chandler's shop; I remained outside and saw Morgan run out - I lost him till next day - I have no doubt of his person.</p>

I was by when the constable took it out; the linen shirt was found in the bed where Lilleongreen and Newbery told me they lodged. (The different articles were produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

I felt under him and found Hawson's shoes and buckles: the rest of the things were concealed under a piece of canvas under the bed. I said these are Hawson's shoes, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160027"></xptr> is his name upon them; then Lilleongreen ran out of the house. I ran after him, and took him; the other staid in the house. I said I wanted nothing but my cloaths, and he might go about his business: then Lilleongreen said they were sold.</p>

            , he is a weaver, and I am a silk weaver. On the 27th of March, Easter Monday, I was in Globe Fields, I live in that neighbourhood. I was standing near to Mason, I saw the prisoner come and stand near to Mason, the prisoner, the identical same man, he placed himself at his right hand as close as he could get; there were full thirty people standing at the same stand, there was almost a mob. I saw the prisoner take Mason's watch; the prisoner looked sharply at Mason's breeches; there was a black ribbon hanging out, the prisoner passed by him; and took a second look at Mason's breeches, I withdrew from the prisoner about a yard; he laid hold of the ribbon with his right hand, and

             the watch from his pocket, he took the watch in his left hand, and put it into his jacket pocket. He withdrew from the mob, and turned into the next street; I kept my eye upon him from first to last; I think he took notice of my watching him; he returned back into the mob, and there I lost him. Mason missed his watch, and gave the alarm of being robbed; I said nothing to him. He made an attempt at my jacket pocket first, that induced me to watch him.</p>

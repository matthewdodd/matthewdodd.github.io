                  </hi>. I am shepherd to Thomas Hill, a farmer, living at Pinner. On the 1st of October last I missed a ewe sheep out of a field called Lower-hill, about nine o'clock in the morning—I had seen it safe the night before—I cannot say exactly at what time—I looked about the field, and found the skin of it—I know it by a mark on the near side, H, and a fleur-de-lis—it had not been killed in a butcher-like way—several bits of skin were left in the flesh—I went that evening to a blacksmith's shop at Pinner, kept by Samuel Deer—I found a sack there, and watched all night, thinking the person would come for it, but nobody came—on the following morning I was present when the sack was examined, and in it were two smock-frocks, two shoulders of mutton, and the neck and breast—I afterwards fitted the mutton to the skin, and it corresponded with it, and had formed part of the sheep—I looked at the smock-frocks, but knew nothing of them—they were bloody—they laid on the mutton—I know the prisoner, but do not know how he was employed.</p>

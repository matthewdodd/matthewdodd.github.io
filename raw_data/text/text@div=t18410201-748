                  </hi>. I am a constable employed by the Regent's Canal Company. On the 21st of January I was crossing the City-road bridge, at about a quarter to ten o'clock in the evening, I observed a wagon, in Mr. Crowley's employ, coming over the bridge—I saw no one with it till I went to the back—I then saw the prisoner and a countryman in the wagon—they seemed as if they were hunting about for some parcels—during that time a boiler-plate fell out—in two or three minutes I saw the prisoner throw his arm over the wagon, and heard something fall in the road, which sounded like a glass bottle—I went to the spot, and picked up this part of a glass bottle, and smelt it—it appeared to me to have held wine—I then looked at the two persons in the wagon—the countryman was very much intoxicated indeed, and so was the prisoner, but the countryman was the most drunk—I saw something dropping from the wagon, which appeared to be wine—I carried the glass bottle to Mr. Bulmer, and gave in<lb></lb>formation—he returned with me down Wharf-road, and met the wagon coming down—the prisoner was taken to the counting-house, and given</p>

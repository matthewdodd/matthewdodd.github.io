               <p>I am a chamberlain to the Ram inn, where the hat was taken from; this hat was on a nail by the tap-room, on a partition, the outside of the tap-room in the passage; I saw him take it off the nail, I immediately went after him, and took hold of him, after he had gone out and got a little from the door I saw the hat under his coat, he had one hat on his head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I was the man that took the hat what is the reason he did not detain me when I had the hat? - I could not detain him, he got away that night, but I am sure he is the man, he was in our house about half an hour, it was about six o'clock when he came in, on the 29th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when he went away - About half past six.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Nobody else see me take it besides you? - No, there was nobody present.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came up the next morning and had a pint of beer at the next house; he knows I am an innocent man as well as he is himself.</p>
               <p>Court. Whom did you give the hat to? - To

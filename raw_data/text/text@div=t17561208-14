            . On the 25th of Oct. the two prisoners came to my shop, and Parker desir'd I'd measure him for a pair of shoes. I measur'd his foot, and after they were gone I missed two odd shoes, made of callimanco; about an hour after that I was sent for to Justice Welch, where were the two prisoners and the two odd shoes (I have the fellows to cach to produce.)</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these shoes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property, there is my name on each of them.</p>
               <p>Gibons. Parker brought these shoes to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come alone ?</p>
               <p>Gibons. I did not know that any body was with him then, but afterwards I found there was. I asked him how long the shoes had been made, he said about a fortnight. I said they were not made so long; he would have laid me a guinea on it, and that one

             made them; he went out to fetch him, as he pretended. I followed him, and heard him say to Simpson, Damnation to the shoes, they are stopt; then we thought proper to take them. My father took Simpson, and I pursued Parker, who took a run round, and I seized him as he came very near my door.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was Simpson when Parker went out to him?</p>
               <p>Gibons. He was walking backwards and forwards, within about 3 or 4 yards of my door in the alley.</p>
               <p>Gibons the Elder. Parker brought these shoes to me. I asked him how he came by them, he said they were given to him by a countryman to pawn. I desir'd he'd be so good as to fetch him; he went out of the shop, my son looked after him, and said there is another man join'd him; I went out, and they parted. Parker went down Little Queen-street, and Simpson cross'd the way; I went over to Simpson and asked him if he knew that gentleman, he said what gentleman, I said that gentleman that was with you; he made a stop for some time, and said a man spoke to me and ask'd me to go and drink a glass of wine. I ask'd Simpson if he'd go to our house and look at the gentleman; to see if he knew him; he said yes. I said if you know him to be an honest man, you'll give him a character; he came with me, my son had taken Parker, and I ask'd Simpson if he knew him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080010"></xptr> he said he was a very honest young man, and no doubt but he can give an account how he came by the shoes. Then I took them before the justice, and they were both committed. We found the prosecutor out by his name being on the shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Parker asked me to go into this shoemaker's shop to bespeak a pair of shoes, after that he told me he had something to pledge, and said he had some money to pay to a person in Newgate-street. There was an execution against him. He bid me stay without till he came, which I did.</p>

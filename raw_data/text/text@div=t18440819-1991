                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live at Greenwich. About five o'clock in the evening of the 8th of Aug., I was in the grand stud at Edgware, where the horses were—I had a scarf on, with a gold union breast-pin—I saw it safe a minute before I missed it—I felt a pull at my scarf—I turned round, and accused a man close behind me—I do not know who he was—I sent for a policeman, who took him into a booth, and while searching him, some boys came and gave me information—the policeman ran after the prisoner about 200 yards, and took the pin out of his hand—this is my pin—it was about three minutes from the time of my losing it, and the prisoner's being taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at harvest-work at Edgware—I was at Edg<lb></lb>ware fair on the 8th of August—I saw the prosecutor there that day—I saw the gold pin in his bosom—I turned round again, and looked at the prosecu<lb></lb>tor, and the pin was gone—the prisoner was near him—I saw the gold pin in the prisoner's hand—I saw him drop it—he put his foot on it, and the prose<lb></lb>cutor turned his back, and took another man—the prisoner cut directly, and took up the pin, and ran away.</p>

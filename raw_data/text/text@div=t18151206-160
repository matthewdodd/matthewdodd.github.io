            . On the 2nd of this month, I was in company with the prisoner at Mr. Grainger's, the Peacock in the Minories, where I lodged. I had received forty-one new one-pound notes for my wages; I had them tied up in a song book, called the Berkshire Lady, I had them in my breeches pocket. I don't know whether the prisoner knew or not of my having them. He and I went down to the Crown in East Smithfield, and staid there until dusk, drinking. I had five old notes besides. Thence we went to the Hambro' Arms, on Tower-hill. I was not drunk; I was a little fresh, but knew what I was about; he drank gin and water with me there; then he said I must go home with him; he took me by the collar, and pulled me out of the house; we left some liquor behind us in the glasses. When we got on <placeName id="t18151206-160-crimeloc885">Tower-hill</placeName>

He ran away immediately; I ran after him; but could not catch him; he was out of my sight in a moment. Then I ran up and down the streets, thinking to fall in with him. I went to Mr. Grainger's to enquire after him; but could gain no information. I saw Mr. Forrester, the officer, in about three quarters of an hour afterwards, and I told him the sort of notes I had lost, and what they were tied up in.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 2nd of December, I saw the prosecutor, between six and seven in the evening, and he said he was going to make away with himself; he was in a very dejected state. I asked him what was the matter, and he said, he had been robbed. I asked him if it was a woman who took his money, and he said no; it was a shipmate. He gave me a description of the person who had robbed him, and told me the notes were wrapped up in a ballad book. I met the prisoner coming back from Grainger's, in the Commercial-road; I asked him if his name was not Kingsnorth, and he said it was. I told him there was a very serious charge against him; he said, he knew all about it; it was about the money; he said he had it to take care of. When we got to Grainger's, I said, the best way would be to count it on the table, to relieve the man's mind. He then said, he had not got it. I asked him where it was. He said he had taken it up to his own brother's, in Islington. We went to his brother's-in-law; he asked us what was the matter; we told him his brother was in charge of two officers for the money. He then said he had got it, and he took out a handful of notes; I got them, and only three more; we counted them out in the Minories, there were twenty new notes for one-pound each. I took from the prisoner this watch. (Producing it,) which he would not tell how he came by.</p>

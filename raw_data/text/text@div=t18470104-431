                  </hi> I am a plumber and glazier, and live in Albion-street, Albion-terrace, Wandsworth-road. On 9th Dec., between ten and eleven o'clock, I was going home on the wandsworth-road, between Wands-worth and Clapham—the prisoner came to me and said, "Well, my dear, how do you do, will you go home with me?" or something of that sort—I said, "No, lt don't answer my convenience, "or words to that effect—she asked me to treat her—I was walking before—I was standing still then, and my right hand was in my right pocket, with a small quantity of money in it, and my watch in my fob—I felt my watch drawn out, and immediately charged her with stealing it—I seized her by the right hand with my left hand, and my hat was knocked over my eyes in an instant—to the best of my knowledge there was one female and two men there, besides the prisoner—I imagine it was one of the men knocked my hat over my head—I heard footsteps running as fast as men could run—I kept hold of the prisoner, and never left her till I gave her in charge of a policeman—this watch produced is mine—I am quite certain I felt my watch in my fob when my hand was in my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>, I was captain's cook of the <hi rend="italic">Java</hi> East Indiaman. On the 19th or 20th of July, we dropped anchor at Gravesend, and a person of the name of Phillips came on board—I had not known him before—he was known to the captain's-steward and the ship-steward—it was agreed that I should lodge with Phillips, at No. 8, Coal Harbour, Blackwall—I had a trunk and portmanteau—Phillips said he was going on shore that night; he might as well take my boxes—he employed Wilkinson to take them—I saw them in the boat when they were taken—on the 21st of July I went to Phillips's to lodge—I did not find my boxes, and Phillips was not at home—Phillips afterwards went to get the boxes from Barking, as he said—he did not take me to see the prisoner—I think I saw the prisoner two days after, in his own house, which was pointed out to me by Mr. York, a butcher in Poplar—I went and saw him—he said the boxes were in the hands of some other persons, and I was to meet him on the following day, which would be Monday—he did not mention how we were to get the boxes back at that time—on Monday I met him close by the East India Dock gates—Mr. York was with me then—no one of the name of Crabb was with me—the prisoner demanded the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me before the boxes could be given—Phillips was not present—I said I should not pay any such sum, and Mr. York stepped up, and said he would not allow me to be imposed upon—he came down to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after that—I did not pay it. I said, as I wanted to go to Scotland, my own country, and wished to have no trouble, I would pay 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to have my boxes and every thing safe—he took me to the house of a man of the name of Nunn, in High-street, Poplar—I did not see Nunn—the prisoner went back with me to the East India Dock gates, and I spoke to Crabb, the carman, to get them—I had not heard where they were—the prisoner said the boxes were lying at a place called the Salmon and Ball, Bethnal-green-road—I went there with Crabb and the prisoner—we found Nunn there—some conversation took place between Nunn and Crabb—Nunn said he would have the money before he brought the boxes, or he would not fetch them—I had not been told where the boxes were—Crabb paid him with money that I gave him—the</p>

               <p>prisoner was there—I paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Nunn—the prisoner and Nunn then went away together, and came back with the boxes in the course of half an hour—I observed to Mr. Crabb that my boxes had been broken open, immediately as I said that the parties were out of sight—they went away directly—when I got home I looked at the boxes, and missed six pairs of cantoon trowsers, one pair of black kerseymere trowsers, two waistcoats, two flannel shirts, and several other articles—they were all in the boxes at the time the boxes left the ship—I did not see the prisoner again till I came back from Scotland, which was sixteen days after—I then told him that he had taken the property out of my boxes that was missing, and he offered to pay for it—he asked me to state a sum that I would take—I said I would not state any sum, as I thought it was wrong to take any money of him for them—Mr. York was present at this conversation—when I said it was wrong to take any money, he turned on his heel and went away—I do not recollect that I saw him again till he was taken up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher at Poplar. I felt it my duty to see what I could do to get this man's boxes back, without fee or reward—I saw the prisoner Wilkinson on the subject, I think it was on the Monday—the prosecutor has given a true account of what the prisoner said—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was demanded, and I think it sank to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and finally, the prosecutor said, rather than have any <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>, he would give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because he wished to get his property, and go to Scotland to see his children—(there were two meetings on one day, because I was obliged to get a policeman, and the prisoner ran away)—I did not go to the Salmon and Ball—all I saw was on the Monday—I re member the prisoner being apprehended—I was present—I saw him before that, and said it was a very bad thing to break the man's trunks open—I said, Cannot you produce the property you have taken out of the man's trunks?"—he said he did not think he could, but he could produce 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I would take it, and give him an undertaking, so that it should be settled—I said I would do no such thing, and he might let it be till Mr. Hay came from Scotland—I saw him again before Mr. Hay returned, and desired him again to endeavour to get the property, or it would be worse for him—he said he thought it was impossible, and wished me to go with him to Barking—I said I would do no such thing—he said he could not possibly Produce the things—I threatened him with an officer when Mr. Hay was</p>

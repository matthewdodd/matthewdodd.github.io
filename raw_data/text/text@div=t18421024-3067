On the 5th of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, Dudman and Clark came, and had half a quartern of gin—Otzin, who was our barman for a fortnight, served them—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then saw him take a six-pence—he sounded it on the counter, and put it into the till—he then took. out of the till three shillings and six pennyworth of halfpence, and put it down to Dudman—she put out her hand to take it up—I put my hand on it, and said, "Stop, let me see what you have given there"—I then turned to Joseph Smith, our other barman, and said, "Take notice of what I have taken up here, it is three shillings and a sixpence"—I sent for an officer, and gave Otzin and Dudman into custody—Clark went away, but she went to the station to inquire about Dudman, and the officer brought her to me, to know if she was the other party—I did not observe which of them put down the sixpence—each of them had some of the gin.</p>

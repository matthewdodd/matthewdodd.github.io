               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Delight. On September the 2d, about seven in the morning, I went into the cellar to look for a newspaper, instead of which I observed thirteen pieces of soap; I informed Mr. Delight; the prisoner came to work, and was in the cellar about an hour; about three he went out; we went down and found the knapsack covered with his coat and stowed (as we thought) quite full; in the evening he came to be paid; then he had the knapsack under his arm; I was determined to let him pass out of the door; he came back when I called him.</p>

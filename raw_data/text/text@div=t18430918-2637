                  </hi>. I keep the Coach and Horses, in Mitchell-street, St. Luke; it is my dwelling-house—on Sunday night, the 3rd of Sept., I went to bed at five minutes past twelve o'clock—I left the house quite safe, I bolted and locked the doors—they were all fastened up, with the exception of my club-room window, on the first floor front—in the course of the morning, the police rang the bell; I went to the club-room and found the window as I had left it—in consequence of what the policeman told me, I went down stairs, and found a side inner door open, which had been locked and bolted the night before—there is an outer door, with a spring lock, which goes into the passage; that was shut—I found that they had screwed off the lock of the bar door—they had got into my bar over the counter, and got to the street door, which was open; and just outside I saw the sergeant, the policeman, and the prisoner—I examined the bar, and found the tills all Irawn open—from my bar-parlour I missed a quantity of cheroots, from the box, which was left—I am sure they were safe the night before—they were not worth above 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also missed seven farthings from the till—I found</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 30.) I was on duty in Mitcbell-street, and I tried the door of the Coach and Horses, at a quarter to three o'clock; it was quite secure then—I went on my beat, and made a report to my ser<lb></lb>geant—I came back about three o'clock, tried it again, and it was not fastened; I pushed it half open, and found it was pushed to again by some one inside—I saw no light—I put my foot between the door and door-post, forced heavily against the door, then turned my light on, and saw the prisoner standing before me—I laid hold of him, and asked him what he was doing there—he said, "What do you want?" several times—I kept him by the collar, sprung my rattle, and took him out into the street—the sergeant came immediately—I gave him information—he rang the bell, and Mr. Wilson came down—I saw the bar door inside; it was open, and the fastening was lying down by the side of it—the till and two drawers were out.</p>

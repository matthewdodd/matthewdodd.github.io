On the 7th of March, I left home, and arrived in London on the 8th of March - I went to the Red Lion, in Whitechapel - I saw the prisoner there - he said he had had nothing to eat since the Thursday - this was on the Saturday - I got him some steaks, and gave him some - I then got my own breakfast, and then went and got the money for my hay, which had been sold by the salesman - I then went to the public-house, and saw the prisoner - he asked me if I would be so good as to let him go as far as Hoddesdon with me; I said he might, if he pleased - I had received a £5 note, twenty half-crowns, two crowns, and some half-pence - I put the whole of that money into a purse in my pocket - I had some loose silver in my pocket - I started between one and two o'clock, and went with the prisoner towards Kingsland - when I got there, I went in to have some beer and some victuals - I gave the prisoner part of it - I had been up the whole night before, and I got into the waggon and fell asleep, as the prisoner said he would drive - I felt the money safe when I went to sleep, and my pocket was buttoned up - while I was asleep the fore horse was unhooked from the waggon and the other horses - the waggon and I were turned down a nasty lane - a gentleman called out, "You are wrong, I think;" and I awoke and found myself in a lane, close by <placeName id="t18340410-193-crimeloc1101">Ponder's End</placeName>

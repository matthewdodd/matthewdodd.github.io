               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A.

I am positive I did not say that I did not know that it was the one I lost.</p>

            . I was going down the Haymarket, and saw a great many people going in: I heard some one say,"Take care of your pockets;" I looked round, saw the prosecutor and several others, and all in a moment I saw the prisoner thrust his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, draw something out, and put it into his left-hand breeches pocket - I followed him up the gallery stairs, and seized him; Groom took the purse from him - I went back, and saw the prosecutor; I thought I knew him again, but not being able to get to him, I called, and on the second time the gentleman said, "I have, it is a new purse, and two rings a little rusty;" I asked him what money was in it- he said he was not certain, he believed towards 4l.; he was certain two half-sovereigns were in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you say? A. If any body had lost any thing, if they would apply at the pitdoor they would hear of it; the prisoner was going up stairs when I saw him - the prosecutor said he had been laying out some money; he said at the office there was one sovereign and two half-sovereigns, which he had put in just before he came out - he did not mention three sovereigns; I am sure he said the rings were rusty - Groom took the purse from the prisoner's pocket, and has had it ever since; I scarcely suffered half a minute to elapse before I took him.</p>

            . I was standing against the theatre about six o'clock in the evening; there were a great many of what they call the swell mob - Shaw turned and said the prisoner had got a purse; I followed him, and Shaw held him while I took this purse out of his left-hand trousers pocket - I took him to the watch-house, and Shaw brought the prosecutor; this purse has the same money in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Shaw say any thing to you? A. Yes, and I saw something blue in the prisoner's hand- Shaw said it was in his breeches pocket; he ran up the gallery stairs - the prisoner said it was his own; I asked him how much was in it, and he said between 3l. and 4l.; he had taken some loose silver out - he was taken almost instantly; he could not have taken it out to see what was in it - there was 3l. and some silver in it; he had 9s. in his pocket besides; he told me almost exactly what was in it - I believe the prosecutor said there was a sovereign, two half-sovereigns in it, and some silver, but he afterwards recollected there was another sovereign he had taken out in the morning; that was after it had been opened and shown to him - he said he had brought a third sovereign out to pay a bill, but had not paid it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your oath, was it not after it was found that you said you brought out a sovereign to pay a debt and had not? A. I said I partly recollected bringing out a third sovereign, but I did not recollect it at first - I bought it in Catherine-street; I gave half a crown for the purse and rings; I put these old rings on the purse, as those I bought were too small - I said they were old; I did not write down every word I said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a blue purse, two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and some silver in it, to what amount I cannot tell; there was a great crowd - I stopped about ten minutes, and ten or twelve persons came behind me; when the doors were opened, I was forced against the side of the theatre - I took some silver from my purse, and intended to pay to go into the pit, but being such a crowd, I changed my mind, and thought I would go into the 2s. gallery; I was stopped - the purse was taken from my pocket; Shaw said he could not say he saw me rob any one - I said I would go, but it was my purse; I went to a public-house with Groom, and then to the watchhouse, till Shaw and Groom came to fetch me; I said,"Where am I to go?" they said to the Magistrate, as there was a gentleman had lost his purse; but Shaw said, "I am not going to swear that I saw you take it, or that it is his property;" the purse and money are mine.</p>

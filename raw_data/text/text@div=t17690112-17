They were plated stirrops, and girths to one, and a saddle-cloth. The other had stirrops, but no girth.</p>

             brought this saddle to me to sell. I refused to buy it. There was a gentleman's servant in the shop, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176901120014"></xptr> bought it, and gave half a crown for it. (Produced in Court, and deposed to by Mr. Parker.)</p>

               <p>Walker. That is the full value of it. Mantle said he bought it of a countryman that was with a hay cart.</p>

I said, I am a little busy now, call again in the afternoon, and I'll let you know, after I have looked it over, what I will give. I suspected, from the appearance of it, he had not come honestly by it. (The saddle produced, and deposed to by Mr. Parker.) I said, I think I know the saddle, and the owner of it. The other prisoner was with him; he said, The gentleman thinks we have stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two prisoners come together?</p>
               <p>Demain. They did. Mantle made answer, and said, I would have you to think we came honestly by it, for we can produce the owner; he sent us with it to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say, Sent me, or us?</p>

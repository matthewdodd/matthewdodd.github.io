                  </hi>. I live in Burn-street, Mary-le-bone. On Tuesday morning, the 15th of October, the prisoner came to me, about ten o'clock, and asked if I had got a low-priced horse that I could exchange with him for one he had got—I said, "I have several, where is yours?"—he said, "Up in Portland-market, at Stevens's potato warehouse"—I sent him to fetch it, and he brought down a brown mare—I asked what he wanted for her—he said, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that his father told him to ask that, but he had broken its knees since he left home, and therefore he considered it worth not so much—I asked what he considered a fair price—he said, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "You don't mean so much as that; I think you must mean about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he then came down to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I rose to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and agreed for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in consequence of suspicion I locked the mare up, and went to Hempson, a neighbour, and made a communication to him—I took the prisoner with me—shortly afterwards I was obliged to go to Guildhall, and left them—the mare was afterwards in the hands of the police.</p>

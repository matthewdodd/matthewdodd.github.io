                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 12th of December, about half-past two o'clock, I met the prisoner in Hanover-square—I lost sight of him for a few minutes, and then met him coming up Little Brook-street—he there met another man—they went down Brook-street to Bond-street, and up and down several streets for about two hours, till half-past four o'clock—when I first met the prisoner he had a basket, which appeared to me to be empty, and at half-past four o'clock I saw the man who had been in company with him put a pot into the basket—I went up and laid hold of them both—they went very quietly with me for some distance—I asked what they had got—they made me no answer—when they had got twenty or thirty yards the prisoner threw the basket over an area, and they both began to struggle very much—the other man made his escape, and left the collar of his coat in my hand—the prisoner made an attempt to throw me down, which he could not do—I secured him against the railing, during which time I received a wound in my arm and another in my leg he then made another attempt to throw me—I called a man, and we got the prisoner to the station-house—I desired the man to take up the pots and bring them to the station-house, which he did—these two pots were in the prisoner's basket.</p>

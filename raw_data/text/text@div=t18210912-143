On the 14th of August, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in the kitchen. A man came in at the back door, and in a few minutes I heard a noise over the kitchen, I went up into the bed-room, saw no one, and came down again, and in a few minutes heard somebody coming down stairs. I stopped down in the passage, a man came to the bottom of the stairs, went out at the back door, and went towards New Brentford - he held his face down so low. I could not see his features - my husband gave an alarm, I went up and found my brother-in-law's box broken open - the prisoner was in the house that afternoon, but I will not swear he is the one I saw come down stairs.</p>

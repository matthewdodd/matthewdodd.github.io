                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer, and live in Goswell-road, On the morning of the 15th of June I heard a noise in my shop, at about a quarter to eleven o'clock—I was in the parlour, at the back of my shop—I walked up towards the counter, and was proceeding round the counter, and saw the prisoner coming from it on his hands and knees—he was just coming round from behind the counter—I seized him by the hand—I observed sliver in his hand, and took him towards the shop-door—I then called a policeman, then released his hand, and the policeman took six shillings and one sixpence from his hand—I went to my till, and found it half-open, and empty—I cannot swear it had been locked before—there was about that quantity of sliver in it before, but I did not count it—it was all gone when I returned—there were half-pence there, but I imagine they were not touched.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Mr. Johnson called me in—he was at his shop-door—I was passing by, and asked him what was the matter—I took hold of the prisoner, opened his hand, and found in it six shillings and a sixpence.</p>

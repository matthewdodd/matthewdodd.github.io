The prisoner was my shopman—I took him from a neighbour, by whom he was discharged for stealing a penny—I thought it was trifling, and looked ever it—I missed a handkerchief on the 27th of February—I went to his lodging, and found an umbrella and two printed books, a rule, some buttons, and other things, which were mine—the girl, who was a fel<lb></lb>low-servant, of his, told me he lodged there—I found them in a house in the New-cut, Tothill-street, Westminister—I cannot tell the number—I charged him with stealing the handkerchief—he said he had pawned it—I never saw him at the lodgings I went to—I knew none of the boxes that were there to be his, nor any of the articles that were in them.</p>

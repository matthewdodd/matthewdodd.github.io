On the 4th of February, he was employed in the yard, in the front of the house; the time for his leaving work, was half-past six o'clock, that evening. A man of the name of Rose was employed in the yard with him. Lougham and Kiebird were employed in the loft, as stove-men, to hang the skein-silk to dry. There is a passage from the yard leading<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160047"></xptr>to the loft. On the left, there is a door which leads out of the loft on to the lead-flat of my premises, and then communicates to Mr. Prior's roof, on the same level. After you pass Prior's house, there is an open stone-yard, belonging to Mr. Goudge. The door which leads out of the loft on to the lead-flat, is always bolted with four bolts, and locked inside, when the men leave work. There is no means of opening it from outside. On the 4th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Allen told me we had been robbed. I immediately went to Crew, and found him at work in the yard - I asked him if he had seen any body come into or go out of the dyehouse, as they must have passed him, if they had; he said, no one had passed either one way or the other. This was about seven o'clock in the evening, when the men had returned from lunch. The men went to lunch about twenty minutes before six o'clock. I went through the dye-house, at four o'clock, and did not see any rat-trap there then. Bird was taken up for the robbery a few days after. I had particularly asked Crew if he had left the yard at all - He said he had not. The distance from his station to the door was about fifty yards; any body could go, and return in less than a minute. In going to it, he must pass the spot where the rat-trap and water butt stand. He was asked if he had been to the place where the tub was, which is close by the stairs-he said he had not. I went over the premises and the roof, and am of opinion, that the premises could not have been entered from without. The value of the silk was 150l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. There is a watchman at the gate always-it was not Crew's place to set the rattrap - He said he had not been near it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LOUGHAM. I am servant to Messrs. Desanges. On the 4th of February, I was drying silk. The prisoner, Crew, was taking up the boiling, in the yard, about twenty minutes before six o'clock, when I left the yard. Crew and Rose were both together in the yard. Kiebird went out with me. The man who attends the boiling ought to stay by the copper. We had just come from the loft as we went out. The door was bolted, with one bolt, inside, when we left, and the silk all safe. I came back ten minutes before seven, and was the first man that came back. I went up to the loft, and found all the skeins of silk that I had left there hanging to dry, gone. The door was unbolted-it opened on to the leads-it could not have been opened from the outside. I traced footsteps from the roof, coming as from over Prior's premises towards the door: they were gravel marks; two tiles were broken. The other part of the tiling goes to Mr. Goudge's yard. There is gravel in his yard. I could plainly see, that the person who came over the leads, must have come over from Goudge's yard.</p>

            . I was working in the loft, with Lougham. I went to lunch, at twenty minutes after six o'clock in the evening, with him, and returned five minutes before seven o'clock, after him. The prisoner was gone. I bolted the door the last thing before we left the loft. Nobody could get into the loft without being let in from within. I went on to Prior's roof; the tiling was broke. A man could get upon the roof of Prior's premises from Goudge's yard, and from there upon the lead-flat where the door was.</p>

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Desanges. On the evening of the 4th of February, the prisoner, Crew, said he particularly wished to stop at the boiler, as he wanted to go out the next day; it was not his turn. The men went to lunch at six o'clock, and I stopped till a quarter after. The prisoner, Crew, and Rose also stopped. I went to tea, and left them in the yard at work at the bat - They had no business to leave work till I returned. I returned in less than half an hour, and found him and Rose at the bat as I left them. In about ten minutes, Lougham told me of the robbery. I went up with him, and missed the property stolen-it was worth 150l. - it was unfinished silk, and the door was open. A person could get from Mr. Goudge's stoneyard on to Prior's roof, and get on to our lead-flat; if the door was bolted they could not get into the loft. Crew did take a holliday the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was Crew's duty to stop at the boiler. A man could not go through the yard to the loft, without his seeing him. There were no persons in the yard but Crew and Rose.</p>

I was crossing opposite the dye-house door, and saw the men go to lunch - I never go to lunch. - I saw the rattrap all day, standing at the bottom of the stairs. After the men went to lunch I saw Crew run across to the rattrap, which was at the bottom of the stairs, leading to the loft - He was out of my sight there, and could have gone up stairs to the door without my seeing him. After the robbery was discovered, he came to me, and said he wondered what was the matter, and that he just been setting the rat-trap.</p>

            . I am a silk-weaver, and live in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. I frequent the Jolly Weavers, public-house; I was there in February last, the prisoner, Crew, was there, I knew him, he was drinking with Toby and Brown; Crew asked me to drink, and I drank some egghot with him; he got from his seat, leaned over, and whispered to me that there was a robbery going to be committed, and asked me to be in it. He told me to come down on Tuesday night to the Castle, in Long-alley(this was the day before the robbery), to meet the parties, at seven o'clock. I did not go. I saw him on Wednesday morning, unloading the cart with the man; he said the robbery was done and safe away, and told me to go to the Jolly Weavers, and he would be with me in a few minutes; I went and waited sometime - He did not come - I left; he told me what a fool I was, for I might have have had 1l. or 2l. if I had come down to him; this was while he was unloading the cart. When he proposed the robbery, he said, we were to go into the stone-yard by Messrs. Desanges, and he would bring the silk out; he asked me if I knew any person that would take it? I said I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I was tried at Kent, two years ago, for a burglary, and have now come from the House of Correction. I have been tried here for stealing a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since was you at the Mansion-house, about cotton stealing - A. About four months ago. There were several people in the public-house.</p>

When Gurney came for it, he asked if a young man (a dyer) had left a bundle at my house. I told him he had. Crew only asked me to take it in; he did not tell me who to give it to.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Dorothy Babington, who is single, and lives in Woburn-square. On the 23rd of March, the prisoner came down into the area, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—the gate was shut, but not locked—he came into the kitchen and asked me if there had been any medicine left there on the Sunday by mistake—I said I would inquire—I went to my fellow-servant, but the prisoner being a stranger, I returned very quickly, and saw him standing before the breakfast-tray, with his back to me, taking the spoons—I told him he was a thief—he ran up the area-steps—I pursued and called "Thief"—he was taken and brought back in less than five minutes.</p>

            . I live about twelve doors from the prosecutor's. On the 13th of July, about a quarter after seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come by with some things under his arm; I had not known him before, but I am sure he is the man - he had two bundles under his arm, and a red merino frock - he went towards Waterloo-town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with two bundles? A. Yes, I am positive I did; you came past me on the same side of the way, and was not more than a quarter of a yard from me.</p>

             (police-constable K 278). In consequence of what I heard, I went to the prisoner's house in Wellington-street, Waterloo-town - I knocked, and the prisoner and his wife were at home; the prisoner opened the door - I asked him if Mr. Dyson was at home; he said no - I asked if he knew when he would be in; he said no - I asked what part of the house he occupied; he said the back parlour - I said I would call again that day, which I did, but he was not at home - I went the next day at two o'clock; his wife came to the door - I asked if Mr. Dyson was at home; she said no - I said"That was your husband who spoke to me yesterday" - she said, "Yes, I know it was; I am lawfully married to him" - I then went into a room with her; a knock came at the door - I opened it, and the prisoner came in - I said, "I want you;" he said, "Let me go to bed; I have just been fighting" - I said, I could not; but he washed himself, and put on a clean shirt, and I took him - I afterwards went with the prosecutor to his house - we searched a box but found nothing - his wife then turned down the bed clothes till she came to the bed, and said, "You see there is nothing there;" I then turned the bed over myself, and found this bit of chintz trimming, which the prosecutrix said she could swear to - we then looked further, and found this patch work, which he also claimed.</p>

            . In November, 1823 the prisoner was in our employ - Veal was then the acting clerk, but the prisoner was assisting him - our business was carried on in Wood-street, and at the City-road. When the prisoner received a cheque or money, he was to enter it in the payment book, and deliver the money to the cashier every evening, who gave him a receipt for it - he was to make the entry in the cash-book: he had no further duties to perform with respect to entries there. On the 1st of December the prisoner returned after a week's absence - I then told him there had been discoveries made, which impeached his integrity; we had heard from some parties that they had got his receipts for money, for which he had not accounted - he went up to the wharf, and there he escaped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Todd was the person to whom he was to render the account of money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150065"></xptr>collected in November - A. Todd was not the collector - Veal had been appointed: he was to account for the money to Veal, and Veal to give it to Todd. If he gave his account to Veal or Todd it would have been sufficient. My orders to him were to go round to the customers with Veal, and account to him. It would not have been a branch of his duty if he got a draft to have got it cashed. His father had given a bond when he entered our service, but I believe his name was not to it - his father was then dead.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He might pay a cheque in change - A. Yes; if he got a cheque for 10 l, and had to take a larger cheque, he might have paid that away, and I should not have expected an account of that, but should, no doubt, of the larger one. If there had been a trifling damage to pay of a few shillings, I should not have permitted him to settle that without its being submitted to our inspection.</p>
               <p>MR. DOBSON. This is my draft (looking at it,) and this is the receipt the prisoner gave me - the draft was upon Messrs. Masterman and Co., for 14 l. 7 s. 9 d.: the receipt was written by the prisoner in my presence, about twelve o'clock on the 19th of November - I wrote the cheque in his presence.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Masterman and Co. I paid this draft on the 19th of November, 1823; I paid a 10 l. note, No. 15781; this is the note (looking at it) - the rest was in cash: it might have been silver if requested. I have not entered the year; the note was dated. I believe there are 10 l. notes issued every year - we only enter the dates when we receive them, not when we pay them away.</p>

            . I live with my father, who keeps the Cumberland's Head, public-house, City-road. I received this note and gave change for it in the month of November, but I cannot say on what day - I changed it for the prisoner or his servant: I knew him perfectly well before - here is the name of Moore on it, but that is not my writing - this 11-23 is my writing; it signifies the 11th month, 23d year.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you know who brought the note, a man or a woman - A. No; but if I had not known the parties I should not have changed it. I knew where the prisoner lived - he was a housekeeper: I delivered the money to him or his servant; I cannot say which - his servant was a female; I had known her before; her name was Jane - I have seen her in his house.</p>

            . I was clerk to the prosecutors'. I examined the portable book, the cash-book, and ledger, for the express purpose of seeing if this account was entered - I did this about a week before they were destroyed, in February last: I examined them diligently and no trace of this account was to be found - the portable book was partly in the prisoner's hand-writing: the payment book includes the accounts of many years. The entries of the 19th of November are in the hand-writing of Veal - the prisoner had access to that book, and could have corrected any inaccuracies.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is there any one book which has been saved from the flames relative to accounts but this - A. No: the cash-book and ledger were destroyed - the ledger was made from the cash-book - and the bills, or invoices. There are entries here not made by Mr. Veal - it was not the prisoner's business to make entries here: it was Veal's duty to do it. If Veal had made a mistake he would have found it out by the cash in his pocket. If the prisoner had received in any one day 100 l., made up partly of cheques, and partly money, and brought the whole of the amount it would have been all that was required - he had no right to change a cheque for payment. The amount on the 19th of November was in eight payments, 83 l. 19 s. 3 d., all in bills or cheques except 6 l. 6 s. 8 d. Veal was there at the time of the investigation, and assisted in it. If the prisoner had received a cheque for 14 l. 7 s. 9 d., and gave it in change he should have accounted for both in the book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the practice previous to Mr. Veal's coming, to enter both the names in the book - A. It ought to have been: the credit given to the customers did not depend upon this book, but the cash-book; the ledger could not have been creditted from this book - it must have gone to the cash-book, which had the entries from the collectors portable book, which the prisoner carried about with him - it might be half a sheet of paper: it afterwards remained as a document of the house. I found several of these portable books in the prisoner's desk, which had dates to them; he should have made them out every day. I do not know that I had every one he wrote.</p>

            . I was ledger keeper to Messrs. Langton and Co. I remember the prisoner leaving on the 1st of December. I examined with the last witness the various books to see what entries were made - there was not in the cash-book any entry of this money, paid by Dobson - I cannot speak to the other books. Mr. Veal continued there till the 26th of February, and all that time there were enquiries going on - it was Veal's duty to have made the entry in November last if he had received the money - if he did not he could not have made it: if he had received the money and not made the entry, it would have been the prisoner's duty to have asked him for it.</p>
               <p>MR. TODD. The prisoner never accounted to me nor Mr. Veal for this 14 l. 7 s. 9 d. - he had an opportunity of seeing this book every day: every sum he paid me he had my signature for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. From what did Mr. Veal make his entry in the cash-book, from these memorandums - A. Yes. When he had a day's money to account for he was to give an account to Mr. Veal, but I cannot tell whether it was by word of mouth, or memorandums - but if he brought money Mr. Veal should have entered it, or if he brought it to me I should have entered it. I have been many years a book-keeper, and sometimes make mistakes. Mr. Veal was very correct, if he made a mistake of 1 d. he would have set it to rights. I think it quite impossible he should have made a mistake of 14 l. 6 s. 9 d. - he continued in his place till the fire.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of December, I searched for the prisoner under a warrant, but I did not apprehend him till the 10th of June last - when I took him I either read or suffered him to read the warrant - he said he had written a letter to his masters, to try to settle the business: I asked if the letter was gone; he said, No, it was in the hands of a friend, and he should stop it: I made no reply to that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have very little to add, but with regard to changing the note, I think I can explain that. Though I was not to collect, I used to settle the damages up to that time, and if there was any trifling damages I was authorized to pay them, and if I had paid them out of any money of my own, I might change a note to reinburse myself - there was never any memorandums passed between Mr. Veal and me when he received money. I have paid many hundreds of pounds without receiving any memorandums, and it depended upon their entering it in the cash-book to exonerate me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am wagoner to Mr. George Jones—he has a wagon from Andover to London. On Tuesday, the 15th of October, I was com<lb></lb>ing to London—I had come up on the 8th—Mr. Perman keeps the white Bear public-house, at Hounslow—I got there on the 15th, at seven o'clock—I had taken up this prisoner between Egham and Staines—he wanted to ride to Hounslow, no further—I had my little boy with me—I had received four trusses of silk from Mr. Taplin's at Overton—they were all safe in the wagon—when I got to Hounslow, at seven o'clock, they were together, laid as close as we could load them, and as near the tail</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183910210094"></xptr>
               <p>as we could put them, within about a yard—I saw them all safe—when we got to Bedfont, the prisoner got out, and we had three pints of beer toge-ther—he said he was going on to Hounslow—I stopped at the White Bear public-house at Hounslow, and took my horses out—I left my little boy in the wagon—after I had done my horses, I went into the White Bear public-house, and saw the prisoner sitting in the tap-room—he asked me to have a pint of beer with him—he jumped up, and went and fetched it, put it on the table, and asked me to drink—I told him I wanted victuals first, as I had not had any thing to eat since dinner—he sat down about a minute or two, and then he jumped up and said he wanted a pipe of to<lb></lb>bacco, and he would go to the bar and fetch it—my son George was by my side, going to have some victuals—I said something to him, and he went out of the room—he came back in a minute, and made a communi<lb></lb>cation to me—I ran out directly to the wagon, and the prisoner was in it, getting a truss of silk over from the back to the front of the wagon—I stopped him, and said to him, "You rascal, what are you doing, robbing my wagon?"—he sprung out of the wagon, and fell down across the shafts—I jumped down upon him, and held him till I got assistance—he wanted me to let him go, and said he had not robbed the wagon, and was not going to do it—at last I gave him into custody—when I got to London, I found one of the four bales of silk was actually gone—I was in such a flurry at the time I took him, that I did not think of examining whether another bale was gone—I saw them safe at Hounslow before I left the wagon.</p>

I was with my father on this Tuesday—I remember the prisoner joining us between Egham and Staines—I cannot say how far it was from Bedfont, as I only came up for a few weeks' holidays—I rode inside from the time of the prisoner getting up till I got to Hounslow, or on the footboard, but I never left the wagon—I got down at Bedfont, but did not walk one hundred yards—there were some poles by the side of the wagon at Hounslow—the prisoner got out and went to the corner behind the poles—on that another man came from the other aide of the road, and talked to the prisoner—they were together about two minutes, and I then laid down in the wagon again—up to that time I had not left the wagon—a little time after that he came up on the shafts of the wagon, it was then dark—he said, Is any one here?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Where is your father?"—I said, "In the yard, doing his horses"—he said, "I wanted to have a drop of beer with him before I leave"—I laid down again, and after a time my father came out to me—I told him what had passed between me and the prisoner—my father went away, and did not say any thing—I remained on the wagon about twenty minutes, when my father came to me with a light after the victuals, and looked round the wagon—I can swear the four bales were safe then—I saw them myself—I then went into the tap-room with my father, and the prisoner was there—I did not remain away more than five or six minutes—I had not eaten two mouthfuls—(up to the time I left the wagon the tail of it was safe)—the prisoner said he must go and call for a pipe of tobacco—he went out, then my father said something to me, and gave me some directions, which I obeyed—I went to the tail of the wagon, and heard something rustle—I went to the head, and could hear it plainer—I did not make any noise—I went back to my father in the tap-room, and told him what I had seen and heard—he went out and I after him, but did not get there so soon as he—I saw my father with the prisoner on the ground—the bale was lying up against the head of the wagon—I heard the prisoner say, "Pray let me go"—when be was first taken up he seemed to peep about the wagon, and then he laid down by the side of an old woman, who got down at Hounslow, and went to bed—she was gone before my father examined the wagon with the lantern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipwright On Saturday night, the 4th of June, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, I was passing along Corn<lb></lb>hill, near the Royal Exchange, with a friend—I noticed somebody at my pocket behind—I immediately turned round, and the prisoner had got my handkerchief in his right hand—he immediately dropped it—I picked it up—he made his escape, and ran across the road—my friend followed him, took hold of his coat-tail, and he fell down, I collared him, and held him till I gave him into the custody of the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I saw two young men behind the gentlemen; they threw the handkerchief down; I picked it up; the gentlemen collared me; I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it down, and tried to get away. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was not a soul near. <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD GATEHOUSE</hi>. I am third mate of the barque <hi rend="italic">King William.</hi> I was walking with the prosecutor—I heard him call out, "Stop him"—I followed the prisoner and caught him after a chase—when I stopped him he said, "I did not do it, it was not me"—I had not told him he had done anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> They knocked me down and stood on me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He fell down.</p>

I heard the cry of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> "stop thief," and found the prisoner in custody of the two witnesses—Mr. King gave me this handkerchief—the prisoner denied having taken it—he said he was merely on his return home, that he saw two young men behind the prosecutor, and saw them drop the handkerchief, and he was speedily hasting away on the other side of the way, and it was optional to himself whether he was running or walking.</p>

               <p>Roberts. There was one 200 l. one 100 l. and one 45 l. which were made in my own name. And there was one 20 l. and four 10 l.</p>

               <p>Roberts. It was on the latch on the outside. I went down stairs again for about half an hour. When I came up the second time I missed them. Then I thought of my notes. I went to stop them that night.</p>

               <p>Court. Consider now, when upon your oath, which is the most solemn engagement between God and your soul, if this young man should be hanged for what you shall say, and you should tell a lie what will become of you?</p>

               <p>Morris. Nobody; I thought that of myself.</p>
               <p>Court. A very proper answer, tho' I think I never saw so much ignorance in a boy of thirteen years old: but I shall take an opportunity to speak to him. Swear him (he is sworn.)</p>

               <p>Morris. I was going through Fenchurch-street between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, about a month ago, on a Wednesday night: I met two young men by this gentleman's house; they came to me and said they would give me some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner's name?</p>
               <p>Morris. They call him Cut Nuckle, it is a nick name that is given him. One said, he would give me some money if I would not say any thing about them or what they were doing; for they said they were going into this gentleman's house. I saw one of them go in, not both, then I followed them: it was not the prisoner, it was Waters that went in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he came out?</p>
               <p>Morris. He called him Waters. The hatch door was open when he went in, it had a brass knob. I staid at the door with the prisoner: they said they would give me money not to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the compting-house from the first door?</p>
               <p>Morris (describes it) When he came out he gave it to the prisoner, and they both ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the house?</p>
               <p>Morris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it might be some other house?</p>
               <p>Morris. It was a corn-chandler's shop, so I know it by that; it was dark and all the other houses were shut up. The next day I went to play at Salt

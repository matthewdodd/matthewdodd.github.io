On the 21st of May I was going into the country, and ordered the watchman to call me at half-past three o'clock; I told my man to have my chaise ready - I went down at four o'clock; the watchman told me something had been taken away - I went down to the wharf; I found one boat drawn back farther than the others - I went on board and found this horse-cloth, with part of my name burnt out; I found these oats in a sack in the barge - which I had put into the granary the night before; I have brought part from the bulk to compare with them - I found these picklock keys, some skeleton keys, and this wrenching-iron in the boat; my doors were not broken open; I found the two prisoners in the cabin of the boat - they said, they bought the oats from Mr. Meredith; I said, they had come from my granary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you try any of the keys to your lock? A. No; the prisoners are father and son - the father was sitting on the sack of oats, and the son laying with his head on the horsecloth - the father is rather paralytic on one side.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say to the prisoners? A. I told them to come out of the barge; they made some resistance, but came.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to call Kelly about ten minutes past three o'clock, and saw a sack fall from Kelly's loft; one person threw it out, and another caught it - I thought they were Kelly's servants, and did not notice them much; when I returned they were gone - I went with Kelly to the boat; his evidence is correct; I found the sack and the oats in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Morgan sitting on the same sack as was thrown down? A. It was one of the same size and colour, and had about the same quantity in it; the stable is about sixty yards from the wharf.</p>

            . About four o'clock in the morning, Kelly gave two persons in charge; I found they had permission from the ostler to sleep in the stable, and dismissed them - Kelly came again soon after with John Morgan, and the corn; Henry was then brought in with these keys - John Morgan said, he had bought the corn of Meredith, the morning before, and given 4s. 6d. a bushel for it; none of the keys opened the door - there was one nearly opened it; that was broken - I did not try them.</p>
               <p>EDWARD KELLY. The sack is not mine, but the horse-cloth is; I have lost thirteen, and a great deal of harness - I do not know when I had seen the cloth safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear you had seen it within a month? A. No; I saw some in the stable the night before - I found a padlock in the cabin, and this broken key nearly opens it; the broken part was found in Henry's pocket - I lost a padlock and key like this, about six months ago; I cannot swear it was mine.</p>

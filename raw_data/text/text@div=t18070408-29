               <p>Q. Did you know her. - A. I had never seen her before nor do I know how she came into the room. When I awoke I found my clothes gone, there was nothing left me but my shift.</p>
               <p>Q. What had she to do in that house. - A. She lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a house is this. - A. A lodging house in Chick-lane, and they sell clothes; I know the mistress of the house, I went there to dine. I was informed where the prisoner was, I went to her, I said to her this is my property that you have on your back, how could you rob me; the landlady told me to take her out of the house, then I might do what I pleased with her. The prisoner went out, I followed her and called stop thief; when I came up to her she bit me on the arm, she was secured. I said my gown was on her and my shawl.</p>
               <p>- . I am a constable; the prisoner was brought to me on the 31st of March, charged with theft.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the prosecutrix's gown on. - A. She had a gown, shawl, and cap of the prosecutrix's. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The cap I will not swear to; it is my gown and shawl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This good woman lodged at Mrs. Ford's, she is a woman that keeps a great many young women and lends them clothes and sends them out to bring in money. On Sunday evening she lent me the clothes; I could not get any money, I was afraid to return home. Mrs. Newman has lodged at Mrs. Ford's a long time. On Tuesday evening I went into Long-lane with some friends; she came into the house and accused me of robbing her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never lent her the cloaths nor do I lodge at Mrs. Ford's, I had not seen Mrs. Ford for six weeks.</p>

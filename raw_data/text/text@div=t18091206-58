            . I am brother to the last witness. By reason of suspicion, on the 1st of December I watched the prisoner when he took the loaves off the shelves, and counted them as he put them in his basket: he put eighteen loaves into his basket that day, I had suspicion that he had done it every day, and when he returned he told me that he had only delivered sixteen. From information my brother sent for an officer.</p>

            . I am an officer of the public office, Whitechapel: on Friday the first of December, between eight and nine in the morning, I went to the Hallifax-head, public house; I saw in the bar two half quartern loves and a quartern; I went into the back parlour; I waited there a little time, the prisoner came and took the three loaves, and as soon as he was gone, I followed him, and as he was turning into Brick-lane, I told him I knew him; I said, who do you live with, he said, with a baker down the road; I told him that was false, he lived with Mr. Clarke, the bread that he had got there, was stolen bread. I told him that was not the first time that he had been watched; that he had been watched taking two loaves every morning that week to the public house, and I had no doubt but that he had been doing so ever since he had been with Mr. Clark; he then said that he had never taken any before that week, and begged that I would fetch his master to him, and not lock him up: I asked him if he was a married man; he said no, he kept a girl in some court by West-Smithfield, he was going to carry the bread there.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

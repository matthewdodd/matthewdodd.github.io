            . I am a watch spring maker, and live at Beckwiths. On the 4th of December, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I was returning home and saw the prisoner go up the steps, open the door softly, looking to see that nobody was in the shop, he went to the glass case and took a pelisse. I stopped the prisoner at the door, with it on his arm. When I first saw him coming out, I said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Mr. Beckwith?" thinking it might be him. He said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do Sir?" he then went towards the parlour, Mrs. Beckwith came from the parlour, he asked if Mr. Beckwith was at home - she said</p>
               <p>"No I do not expect him till nine o'clock," and asked his business - after some hesitation he said he had a few things to sell. I secured him and said, he had taken a pelisse out of the glass case, he said he had knocked with his foot, and whistled three times, which is false.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say he was sent to buy a pelisse - A. No.</p>

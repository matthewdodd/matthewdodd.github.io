            . I am a servant to Mr. Read. I had the care of his cart on the 2nd of January; it was about three o'clock I got to Nicholas-lane. I wanted to go to Mr. Scholey's, for some tongues. I could not go there with the cart. I desired Mr. Edney to take care of it, and when I came back Mr. Edney had got the pork on the foot-board. He asked me, whether I had sent any body for it. I said, no. He said, a man had just been there, that said, he had been sent for it. He gave me a description of the man. I pursued and took the prisoner. By his description I had seen the prisoner lurking about the lane, when first I came with the cart. I took the prisoner in Lombard-street. I brought him back to the cart. A gentleman sent for an officer; he took him in custody.</p>

             drawed up with Mr. Read's cart; he asked me to give an eye to it while he run down the lane. The person came to the door to pay me. I looked round, and saw the prisoner in the cart. I saw him take a bundle out. He jumped from the cart with the bundle in his arms. I went to him, and took hold of the bundle, and asked him, what he was going to do with it. He said, he was going to Sam's coffee-house. I told him he must not take it until the man came that belonged to the cart. He then laid the bundle on the foot-board, and turned down a court that leads into Nicholas-lane. He called out to his mate. Armsworth came to the cart directly afterwards. I told him. He persued him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. to Armsworth. What did that bundle contain - A. Pork, seventy-two pounds weight, and six pounds weight and three quarters of salt, a pair of pantaloons, a waistcoat, and a pair of gaiters. These are the things.</p>

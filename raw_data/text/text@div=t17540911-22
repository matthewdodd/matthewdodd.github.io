I was coming home from Highgate from work on the 17th of last month. This woman and another were standing by the corner of the life-guard stables in <placeName id="t17540911-22-crimeloc118">Oxford-road</placeName>

I said, Do you know me? She said, Yes; are not you a chairman? I said, I am in the winter time. She begged me to give her a pint of beer. I went to the Wheatsheaf and gave them a quartern of gin, they chose that. The other said, Give us another quartern, that will serve us all night. I did, and then came out, and at the door the prisoner said, Will you not give me a buss before you go? and held me: I gave her a buss to get shut of her. In the mean time came a man with a knife and held to my belly, and said, If I stirred or resisted, he'd rip me open. This woman had hold of me at the same time. She took out my watch, and 5 s. in money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her take it out?</p>
               <p>Dobbins. I did. I had it in my pocket when I was in the house. They all three went away towards the fields. I advertised the watch. At last a man brought the watch on the Monday morning. The constable advised me to take the man that I was to give the reward to before the justice; there I paid the reward. The justice said he'd give me the watch when I found the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man that brought you the watch?</p>
               <p>Dobbins. Yes, his name is Stevens; he took his oath he found it in Oxford-road. On Monday the 19th in the evening, I went to the house where I had been robbed, and near there I found her. She would not confess taking the watch or money, only said she was in company.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the watch?</p>
               <p>Dobbins. It cost me 5 l. new; to be sure it is worth 4 l.</p>

               <p>That man gave me a dram; I thanked him and made him a court'sy, and bid him good night. I never went nigh him, or saw his watch.</p>

On the 23d of June I lost a watch out of the back-room adjoining to the shop. A gentleman was there at dinner and the prisoner; I had some victuals in the same room where the watch was. About two minutes after the prisoner went out, I missed the watch; I pursued the lad and got sight of him; he ran when he saw me, and he took down a passage; I saw his hand move, and I took him; he denied having the watch, and then said there is something there, and the watch lay behind a shutter.</p>

               <p>I was in this room at dinner. I saw the watch behind me when I went into the shop, and it was 18 minutes after twelve.

               <p>One day I was in great distress, and a gentleman came up and gave me 3 d. and I went into the shop: the gentleman was ringing the bell for coals. I was in great distress, out of place, and it was necessity made me take it; it is the first error I ever was guilty of, and I hope you will have a little mercy. I have no friend in the world but my mother; she lives at No. 52, in Skinner's-street; she knows I am in goal.</p>

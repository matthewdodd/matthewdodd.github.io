               <p>I was coming home last Saturday, about half past one, and saw the prisoner at the bar, and two others, within the iron railing of a house in Welbeck-street; it being so late, I was a little alarmed; I went toward them, and thought I saw something set down, I cannot positively say what; they got out into the road, and I followed them for ten or twenty yards; I called to the watchman; but, previous to that, I perceived one of them with a bundle on his head; and when I came back from the watchman, to pursue them, I found they had dropped the bundle: I challenged the three with having had property on their heads, and asked them what made them drop it, and gave charge to the constable, and he followed the prisoner, and took him out of a house where he had escaped into a cock-loft; the others made their escape, and are not yet taken.</p>

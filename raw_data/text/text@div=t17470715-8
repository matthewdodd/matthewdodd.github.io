The Box was put behind the Coach . Indeed I did not like it should have been put there, but the Coachman said it was very safe .</p>
               <p>Prisoner . As I was passing along there, a Gentleman said to me, there is behind such a Coach a Box; I would have you take it, and carry it to such a Place .</p>
               <p>Richard Lane . I saw the Prisoner with a Knot upon his Shoulder take the Box from behind the Coach , which the Gentlewoman saw herself, and she called out, and said, The Man has got my Box. And the Prisoner ran down New-inn-Yard, Shoreditch ; so I seiz'd him by the Sleeve of his Coat, I ask'd him what Business he had with that Box; he said, he was not going far with it. I said, I did not design he should.</p>

            . Please ye , my Lord, I took hold of the Box upon his Back . I am the Coachman. Mrs Lewis took a Place in my Coach , and I put the Box in myself, and a-going along Shoreditch this Man took it down. When I seiz'd him with it the Excuse he made was , that a Gentleman told him to take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . I was desired by a Gentleman to carry this Box to Old-Street .</p>
               <p>Q. to Hawkins . Was the Box tied behind the Coach ?</p>
               <p>Hawkins . No, my Lord; because we have a Place to put them without any Manner of trouble.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing more to say, but when these People came to me the Gentleman was gone .</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner . Is it usual for Persons to take Boxes off a Coach, without calling to the Coachman ? Will you call any Witnesses ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner . No, my Lord. <rs id="t17470715-8-verdict34" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>JOHN TILLEY. On the 11th of July, between four and five o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18250915-262-crimeloc1408">Arlington-street</placeName>

I took hold of him, and found my handkerchief in his hand - he was in the act of giving it to another boy.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw two young men following this gentleman - his handkerchief was half out of his pocket; I saw them in the act of picking his pocket; I called out to the gentleman, and they threw the handkerchief down - the gentleman turned round and took me.</p>
               <p>JOHN TILLEY re-examined. Q. Did he say any thing of this at the time? A. No, but when I took him to the watch-house, he begged forgiveness, it being his first offence.</p>

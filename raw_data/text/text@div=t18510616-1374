                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, at 154, Shoreditch. I have nearly lost my sight, and can only see light—I am led about—on Monday, 28th April, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon I was in New Inn, Shoreditch, coming home, being led by a little girl—I felt a kick on my heel—I fell down, my hat fell off my head, and my spectacles and my stick out of my hand—I partly raised myself, when I was assisted by two men, one on the right, and one on the left—the one on roy right asked me if I was hurt—I said, "No"—the left one said, "Shall we see you home sir? do you live near here?"—I had got on my legs by that time—'I had a silver watch in my right hand waistcoat pocket, secured by an Albert guard through the button-hole—I told him I was not hurt, and said, "You have got my watch" and the one on my right ran away, followed by the other two—I missed my watch, but the guard remained in the button-hole with the handle of the watch to it—a fortnight after that I was at Worship-street Police-court, when there was another charge made against Hurley—I heard some one speak, and I heard a cough and a voice, and I recognised them as that of the first person who assisted me—when he coughed, I said, "That is the man who coughed that assisted me"—he had coughed at the time he lifted me up—I also knew the voice—I heard it more than once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Wheatman, a bedstead-maker, of 22, Christopher-street. I have known Hurley sixteen months—he has visited in the house where I live—on 28th April, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon I was with him and another man and woman at a public-house at the corner of Crown-street—Hurley left the public-house—I followed in about ten minutes, and saw him alone on the other side of the road, and I went after him down New Inn-passage, or yard—I saw Mr. Collins in the act of being picked up, and Hurley was at his right side, and Catton who had joined Hurley, at his left—I saw Hurley put his hand into Mr. Collins's pocket, but I cannot say whether it was his watch pocket, or hit waistcoat pocket, and I saw Catton hold Mr. Collins's left arm while Hurley twisted the watch off—Mr. Collins put his hand to his pocket, said, "I am not hurt," and then said, "You have got my watch!"—Hurley ran away instantly, Cat<lb></lb>ton after him, and another man who was there—about an hour afterwards I saw Hurley in Curtain-road, which is five minutes' walk from New Inn-pas<lb></lb>sage—he said to me, "Was not that a daring robbery"—I said, "Yes it</p>

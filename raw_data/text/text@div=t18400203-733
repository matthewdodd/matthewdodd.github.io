                  </hi> I am a ship-carpenter, and lodge in High-street, shadwell. On the 1st of February, between eight and ten o'clock, I was in Poplar, and met Carter, I went home and went to bed with her in her house—I awoke between twelve and one o'clock, and missed the things stated from my trowsers' pocket, I seized her, and said I would take her to the station-house if she did not give me my things—I had put my trowsers on a chair—I saw no one but Carter when I awoke—I got a policeman, and then Wilson was in the house—she detained me at the door four or five minutes—I demanded the door to be opened according to the constable's orders—this is my watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I had come from sea that day about four o'clock, and landed at the West India Docks—then went up to Poplar, and went to a public-house, and from there I went to the house where I met the prisoner—that was between eight and ten o'clock—I was not sober—there were several women in the public-house, but I do not know who.</p>

I asked him what he was going to give me; he asked if T would trust him, I said, "No;" he said he had no money, but he would give me his watch, and he pulled it out—I took it to Mr. France's, and got 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it.</p>

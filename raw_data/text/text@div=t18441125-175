                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Gault, who is in the employ of the Brighton Railway Company—we live at No. 35, in the Maze, Borough. On the 2nd of Oct. I hung out some clothes in my yard, and saw them safe at nine o'clock at night—I fastened the back door, and at that time the copper was safe in the back-kitchen—the door was only latched—the policeman brought the clothes to me at near two o'clock in the morning—they they were the articles stated, and are all my husband's property—the pri<lb></lb>soner was then in custody—I missed the copper—it had been fixed with mortar and bricks—it has since been refixed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman in the Borough-market, and live at No. 36, in the Maze, next door to the prosecutor. On the 24th of Oct., I was disturbed about half-past one o'clock in the morning, and beard a something rumbling in the passage between my house and the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's—it sounded to me like copper—I got but of bed, threw up the window, and saw a man who had just passed my window a little to the left—I then saw a second person, the prisoner, come out of the passage—I hallooed out, "Halloo, mate, what is <hi rend="italic">up</hi> there?"—he made no answer—I sprang my rattle, and the policeman flew to the corner—the prisoner was met by the police in less than five minutes, and brought back.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 166.) On the night of the 23rd of Oct. I heard a rattle spring—I went towards the sound, and met the prisoner in Tooley-street, just at the end of the Maze, not a great distance from the passage—he was carrying a bundle, containing sheets, and other linen, wet—I stopped him, and took him back to Mrs. Gault's house—she identified the articles—most of them have been returned to her—as I was taking him back, Crockett was at his window, and identified him in a moment.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 156.) I was on duty in Tooley-street on this night—I heard the rattle spring, and went to the spot—in consequence of something I heard, I looked for the copper, and found it in a mews, right opposite the prosecutor's, concealed under a block or washing stool—Mrs. Gault identified it—I did not fit it.</p>

I said, "I don't know; I have just had it given me to carry."</p>

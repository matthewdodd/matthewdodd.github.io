                  </hi>. I am a mill-wright, and live in Craven-street, City-road—I am foreman to Mr. John Morant Hervey—he is an iron-founder and smith, and lives in Brick-lane, St. Luke's. The prisoner Watson has been in his employ about three years—we have a great number of files, which pass through my hands to examine them and see if they are correct—I have lately missed a great number of them—the room in which Watson worked joined to the office in which the files are kept, and he had access to them if he thought proper—on the 20th of February the policeman came with Kellett, and Watson, whom I had seen there not three minutes before, made his escape out of the premises over a wall, and through some adjoin<lb></lb>ing premises—I then went to a shop kept by Cowan, in Goswell-street, within five minutes' walk of the prosecutor's—Cowan calls himself a gen<lb></lb>eral dealer—he deals in files and all sorts of things—I found eighty-two files there—I looked at them, and these two I can identify—I know they</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Goswell-street, St. Luke's. I remember the prisoner Watson coming to my house—I had some files exposed for sale at my door, and he came and said, "Are you in the habit of buying files?"—I said, "Yes, sometimes"—he said he was a file-cutter, and he was in the habit of having a great many at times—I said I would buy them if they suited me—about two days after, on the 3rd of December, he came, and brought two dozen of files with him—he asked 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for them—I said I could not give that, as they were re-cut; I could not give more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two dozen—he gave me the name of "Cook, No. 12, Memel-street, St. Luke's"—I have no doubt the files now produced are part of what he brought—some time afterwards the female prisoner came, and brought two dozen of files of the same sort—she stated she came from her husband, and asked me to buy them, and I bought the two dozen of her for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think that was about a fortnight after I had bought these of the male prisoner—she afterwards came again, and I bought two dozen more of her—she came again, and said she had some more, but I said I was full, and did not buy any more of her—I put them on the shelf, and on the 20th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary I was applied to—I gave up the files I received of the prisoners to the prosecutor and the officer.</p>

               <p>Baikie. I had not laid in it since last summer; I was there the evening of the 30th of June; on the first of July this card was brought to me (producing one) by which I was directed to come to Sir John Fielding at eleven o'clock; I did not know then that I had left my pocket-book there, the card I had left in it; I went there; I found a small looking-glass with a wooden frame, a pillow-case taken off of a pillow that I had laid on the bed, two napkins, two pair of scissars, and a pocket book, all my property, which were in that house over night; there was a china half pint bason, but as there are others of the same pattern, I do not swear to that; I lost such a one; then I went to the house, and missed the things mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the house broke?</p>
               <p>Balkie. There was no place broke; the house had been new paper'd, and I left the window open, and the door not locked. I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

            . On Tuesday fortnight I was out at night, and I light of Jones in Bow-street, Covent-garden, the other was with him; they asked me where I was going.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before?</p>
               <p>Crofts. I did; they said they were going up into the fields to sleep among the hay, and asked me to go with them. When we got into the fields, Jones slept over the pales into this gentleman's garden, and said he knew of some cucumbers there; then Donnelly went over after him, and I followed Jones; finding no cucumbers, he went and lifted up the latch, and went into the summer-house; he slept up upon two chairs, and took a silver spoon out of the corner-cupboard, and a pocket-book; then we took two napkins, and a pillow-case, from off a pillow, two pair of scissars, five china cups and saucers, a half-pint china bason, and a looking-glass in a brown frame. Jones gave me the five china cups and saucers, and I was stopt on the top of Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take these things from?</p>
               <p>Crofts. From the summer-house.</p>

               <p>Q. to Wright. Did you see Crofts when you stopt the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, he ran away, and threw down the cups and saucers, and broke them; and afterwards he came to us, and the prisoners said they knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Jones. It is a designed thing, with intent to take away our lives.</p>
               <p>Q. to Crofts. Do you know me?</p>
               <p>Crofts. I have known Jones half a year, he is a breechees maker; I have drank with him several times on evenings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Crofts. Somewhere by Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. from Donnelly. How long have you known me?</p>
               <p>Crofts. I have known Donnelly about three quarters of a year; I have drank with him many a time; I never knew him to be guilty of any such thing in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you persuade them to do this?</p>
               <p>Crofts. No.</p>
               <p>Donnelly's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been a hay-making, I met a man with some things in his hand; he said, he and his wife had quarrelled, and he would not live with her any longer; he asked me if I would buy the things; I gave him ten shillings for them; we met the evidence; he asked us which way we were going; I said we were going towards London; he asked to what part, I said towards Tooley-street; he brought us down to the Devil's-gap, and while we were talking they stopt us; they never meddled with him, but let him go; and then two days after he came and made himself an evidence against us, for a thing we know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Wright. We had an evidence with us handcuffed, watching for other persons; and seeing the looking-glass at Donnelly's back, and their pockets stuffed out, we stopt them.</p>

               <p>Q. What can an industrious man get at your business?</p>
               <p>Watson. He may get fifteen or sixteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How came you to indict them for breaking your house, when you left it open?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The person that made out the bill, said, are you sure the latch was shut; I said yes; then he said that will do.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is a man gives his evidence, no account how or when taken, or how he came to be admitted evidence. It is observable, he is very careful to make out the burglary; Jones he says, went and lifted up the latch of the door.</p>
               <p>To Donnelly's character.</p>

                  </hi> I am porter to Mr. William Barker and another, twine-manufacturers, 59, Watling-street. On Thursday night, 8th Feb., at half-past six o'clock, I had occasion to take a letter two doors off—when I went out I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the door of my master's warehouse—there were three men with it; Smith was one of them—they were lifting a bale on the box of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw Callingham, but I did not take so much notice of him as I did of the other—they were all lifting the bale—I did not tee any one enter the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw Smith open the <hi rend="italic">cab-door</hi>, and I saw him shot it—he then ran round behind the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, ran past it, and up towards St. Paul's, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> followed him—(I had seen the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man run round on the off-side and get on the box)—I know the bale—I observed the mark on it as they lifted it up—when I got into the warehouse, John Clarbour spoke to me about the bale, and, in consequence of what he said, 1 went after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw it run along Watling-street—I was some distance behind it—I chased it till I got to St. Paul's Church-yard, and there saw it draw up to the side of the pave<lb></lb>ment, and Smith got on it: he sat on the seat, with his legs across the bale, which was outside—I chased them down Ludgate-hill—I called out, "Stop that <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>," and "Stop thief!"—I should think the driver could not have heard it, I was too far behind—I lost sight of it in Blackfriars-road—I saw a policeman running very hastily after it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> Did it not rain very hard that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did, but not at that time—I brought the letter out in my right-hand, open—I had to take it for an answer.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 360.) On Thursday evening, 8th Feb, about five minutes before seven o'clock, I heard an alarm, and went in chase of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Callingham was driving, and Smith was sitting on the box with his legs hanging on the bile—I called out," Stop that <hi rend="italic">cab!</hi> "and" Stop thief!"—I was at that time six or seven yards from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw both the prisoners look round, and when they saw me gaining on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, Callingham whipped the horse to make it go faster—they got out of my reach, went down Ludgate-hill and down Bridge-street to the foot of the bridge—I there became exhausted, and told Burchall to follow them.</p>

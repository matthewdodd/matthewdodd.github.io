               <p>Q. What is the Coat made of?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Silk Camblet. I put them into the Drawers the 28th, and I found them the 30th.</p>
               <p>Court. You don't know who took them away.</p>
               <p>Hudson. Sir she (the Prisoner) pawn'd them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear that she own'd them?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes. Before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. You say she confess'd before the Justice. As she was confessing, was he writing?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I thought so.</p>
               <p>Court. You thought so, than let that be return'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sign any Confession?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No, Sir. But she said it was true.</p>
               <p>Q. Now will you tell us what she did confess before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Hudson. The Justice said to her, that I laid these Things to her Charge that she took them, and he ask'd her whether that was true; and she said that it was true.</p>

               <p>Hudson. Yes. At the three blue Balls in St. Martin's-Lane. She own'd she took the Waistcoat and pawn'd it for Half a Crown; then she took the Coat the second Time, and put them in her own Name for 7 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you redeem them?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No. I took them away and brought the Pawnbroker before the Justice, by his Order.</p>
               <p>Court. (to the Prisoner) You hear what this Witness says; that you told him that you pawn'd them at the three Blue Balls, and for three Half Crowns, and you confess'd before the Justice that it was true? Did you know this Woman before?</p>

               <p>Cook. That she had casry'd them to the Pawnbroker's and pawn'd them for three Half Crowns, in St. Martin's-Lane; as to the Pawnbroker's Name she could not tell. Whereupon he order'd me to take her away to the Round-House. The next Morning he granted Mr. Hudson a Search Warrant: Accordingly we went to Mr. Caddy's, in St. Martin's-Lane; we takes the Woman at the same Time from the Round-House, and brings her before the Justice, and the Pawnbroker at the same Time, and she was committed to the Gatehouse.</p>

I am housekeeper to John Burrows, No. 5, Grafton-street, Soho—he keeps a coffee-shop—I know all the prisoners—I had known Cooper for two years, at Carshalton, where he lived—he went by the name of Timberlake there—on the 2nd of Sept. he came into the house to see Mr. Bur<lb></lb>rows—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210040"></xptr>
               <p>asked how I was, and said, "How is John, where is he?"—I said he was gone out—he said, "What time will he return?"—I said I did not know, for he was gone to Gravesend for a day's pleasure—he said he wanted something to eat, would I get him a chop—I said, "Very well, I will get you one"—he said, "Get more than one, I have a couple of friends I will bring in here, who are close by, to have one with me"—I did so—he returned with the two other prisoners in a minute or so—they occupied a private parlour, used by Mr. Burrows and myself—after they had had their chops, Cooper asked for a sheet of paper, he wished to write a letter—Jackson was pretend<lb></lb>ing to write the letter—I was not in the room all the time—I was in and out, attending to my business—I was in sometimes with them—after they had written the letter, and had their chops, they all three went out—they left the letter, directed, on the table, unsealed—I put a wafer in it, and sent it to the post by a woman—the direction was, "Simmonds, 30, George-street, Ha<lb></lb>nover-square"—Cooper came in directly after, and said they would post the letter themselves—he followed the woman, came back again, and stayed all the afternoon with me—the other two prisoners went away—he said they would return to tea, which they did about six—the three prisoners and I all had tea together in the private room—after we had had tea, a person came into the shop—I got up to serve him with some coffee, and Cooper followed me out into the shop, and kept me talking there for about two or three minutes—the other two prisoners followed him out while he was talking to me in the shop—they wished me good night as they passed me, and I wished them good night—Cooper remained about two minutes till the other two had got just to the corner of Moor-street, and were turning the corner—I stood at the door talk<lb></lb>ing to him, when all of a moment he suddenly left me, and ran to Moor-street—I thought it very odd he should leave me in that manner—I walked straight back into the room, and the first thing that struck my eye was a little basket which had my money in it—I saw the lid of it had been lifted up, and moved—I went and looked, and missed a little black bag and a purse containing 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had seen it safe in the bag about an hour before they were there—no one had been in besides them—on turning round I missed two watches from the mantelpiece, a small hunting-watch of my own, with a silver chain at<lb></lb>tached, and an old-fashioned silver watch of Mr. Burrow's, with a brown guard attached—the value of mine was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

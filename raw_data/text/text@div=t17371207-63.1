Then he went in and took 2 Bundles of Check: I took it from him and gave it to Southall. He went in a second Time and took out a Bundle of Stockings; we carried all to Correl's House. Chap was with us, and went out with us upon this Business. Smith and Alexander lodged in Correl's House; he gave us but 5 s. for the two Peices of Linnen and we were obliged to carry off the Stockings from his House, because Southall having offer'd a pair of them to a Soldier, at a Cook's-Shop, next Door to Correl's, he stopp'd them, and we were afraid of being pursu'd. Alexander receiv'd the Money from Correl for the Check, and we were to have our Shares the next Morning, but the Constable came and took me out of Bed.

            . Southall lifted up Mr. Horner's Sash, and pull'd the Shoes within Reach with his Crutch, (for he was a lame Boy;) Chap was not in our Company then; but 2 or 3 Days afterwards we all went with him, and Southall then took the Roll of Ticken out of the Window and gave it to Chap. We cut off a Peice and went with it to a Pawnbroker's in the Broad-Way, Westminster, but they would not take it in, so we sold it to a Soldier, and Correl bought the rest, for half a Crown or 3 s.</p>
               <p>Horner. The Roll that I lost was worth about 20 Shillings.</p>
               <p>Adams, Constable. Correl's Wife brought me this Ticken with the Check. I did not ask for this.</p>

            , Chap own'd that he and the rest of the Boys, had taken the Things out of the Window, and that the Ticken was sold to Correl. I went upon this to Correl, and ask'd him for it. He said, he knew nothing of it, at first, but afterwards he told the Constable, if he would not hurt him, he would see the Goods forth coming, and he sent his Wife out for them.</p>

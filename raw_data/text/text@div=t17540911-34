On the Monday after I missed the spoon, Mr. Porsham brought it. Produced in court and deposed to.</p>

               <p>Fowke. Here is the fellow to it, producing one. They are both marked with a crest and initial letters of my daughter's name, M. F.</p>
               <p>Mr. Porsham, I live in St. Martin's-Lane; am a pawn-broker; the prisoner at the bar brought this spoon to me on the 2d of September to pawn. She said it was her own. I seeing the crest was in part erased out stopped it, watched the prisoner, and saw where she went to, it being the prosecutrix's house. I went there and informed her of it.</p>

               <p>When I liv'd at Knights-bridge, along with that gentlewoman, there were two large silver spoons out, and she said she would charge one of them betwixt a gentleman and I. I said, I'd swear fresh and fasting I knew nothing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a book-binder, and live in Jewin-street. On the 12th of April, between nine and ten o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, I was in Aldersgate-street, at the corner of Hare-court—I felt some-thing, I turned round immediately, and saw the prisoner—he passed from behind me, and went up Hare-court into a house—I got an officer, we went in, and searched two rooms—he was not there—we were going up to the third floor, and met the prisoner coming down—I missed from my pocket this silk handkerchief, which the officer produced the next day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 138.) On that Sunday evening, the prosecutor's wife came to me, and said her husband had lost this handkerchief, and the person had ran up the court—I went up the court, went into No. 11, and searched two rooms on the first floor, then went up a second pair of stairs, and saw the prisoner coming down the third pair—I went up stairs and saw a hole, and saw some white on the prisoner's trowsers—he must have got up and thrown the handkerchief out on the leads, as it was found there the next morning.</p>

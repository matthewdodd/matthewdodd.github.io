About seven o'clock, on the morning of the 27th of May, I was called up by my servants—I went down stairs, and found the front door of the premises, which opens into the street, open—I then went into the parlour behind the shop, on the ground-floor—I found a box that was there had been broken open, and copper money, to the amount of about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., taken away—it was done up in five-shilling papers—I also lost a silver pencil-case from an inkstand on the sideboard in the same room—there were marks of a chisel, or instrument of that sort, being applied to the box to force it open—I was the last person up on the premises the night before—the front door was then secured by a lock, a bar, and two bolts—the pri<lb></lb>soner Morley was in our service at the time as an errand-boy—the witness Thomas Fisher was my apprentice—neither of them slept on the premises—they left their work at eight o'clock in the evening—they ought to come in the morning at seven—on the morning I discovered this robbery Morley came a little after seven, and Fisher a little after nine—I immediately sent to the police—Inspector Penny came to my house—he asked Morley if he knew any thing of the robbery, as he was suspected—he said no, he was at home and in bed all night—that was before Fisher came to work, I think—I had Fisher and Morley taken into custody that evening, in consequence of a communication made to me by Porter, my foreman—they were taken before the Magistrate—Fisher then said he was at home and in bed, and slept with his father that night—the Magistrate gave him time to produce his father to prove that—he was produced, and examined that afternoon; and on his being examined the Magistrate discharged Fisher—after that, Porter made a statement to me, which led me to Fisher, and he made a state<lb></lb>ment to me—there is an area-gate in the front of the premises, the key of which hung on a hook over the desk in the front shop—in consequence of Fisher's communication, I and the policeman looked into a hole in the area on the 3rd of June, and there found twelve five-shilling papers of halfpence, similar to those I lost, wrapped up in a towel of which I know nothing—it did not belong to the premises—I looked for the key of the area-gate on the day of the robbery, and found it hanging up in its usual place.</p>

               <p>to my master's shop one day, and asked for Morley—I told him I believed he was out—I then left him to go to dinner—that was all that passed that day—I saw him again at the shop about nine days before the robbery—he asked me again for Morley—I cannot positively say whether he was at home then; I believe not—I had no other conversation with Davis then besides his asking if Morley was at home—I had no other conversation with Davig, except when he spoke to me about the money at the Alfred's Head—he did not at any time give me any explanation of what he meant—the day after that conversation with Davis, I asked Morley what money it was that lie had been speaking to Davis about—he said, Davis and some others were going to <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> the master's <hi rend="italic">crib</hi>—I did not say any more to him that day—next day he told me, if I did not say any thing about it, that I should have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made no answer to that—I went away and left him—it was after that that Davis called once or twice, and asked for Morley—about nine days be<lb></lb>fore the robbery Morley asked me, if he gave me down the key, would I open the gate, and I told him "Yes"—it was the small key belonging to the padlock, which was on the area-gate—I received the key from Morley that night, opened the padlock, and left it hanging on the chain, so that any person could get in—I gave the key back to Morley—I saw Morley on the following morning—I do not recollect any conversation passing—I told Morley afterwards that they had not done it that night, and I would have no more to do with it—I said that the day after the gate had been found open, which I believe was on a Thursday—the gate was discovered open by Francis Porter—on the morning before the robbery, (Wednesday the 26th,) Morley told me that he had been een in the street by a police<lb></lb>man, and that he had on him three small keys, a file, and a key which he had been filing, to try to make it fit the padlock—he showed me the filed key in the burning-place, and I pressed the ward off with my thumb, be<lb></lb>cause he should not do it with that—in the evening I saw Morley take the key of the area gate off the hook, after Mr. James Newton had hung a bunch of keys on it—when I left work that evening I went away, in company with Morley and James Beverstock, to a bath in Oakley-street, Westminster-road, to bathe—I did not take any towel with me—I cannot say whether the others did—I parted with Morley at the corner of London-street, about half-past ten o'clock that night—Beverstock had left us before—I told Morley at parting that I hoped he would not do what he was going to do, I should have nothing to do with it myself—I went to my father's house and slept there that night with my brother—I went to my work next morning about a quarter to nine—I saw Morley at my master's—he came down into the workshop where I Was at work—he did not address himself to me, because there were others in the shop—he merely said his master had been robbed—about twelve I saw him in the burning-place—he then told me Davis and he had committed the robbery, that he entered the place by the assistance of the key he had taken away, and undid the padlock, and after he got in he locked the gate after him again—by undoing the padlock he could get to the workshop, as there is a door on the top of the stairs that is not kept locked—a person getting through the area gate could get to the room where the money is kept without breaking any other room—he said he took the bar from the street-door, and placed it against the parlour-door, and then he let Davis in at the front-door—that Davis cut away the box, and carried away 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he carried away 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that they went as far as Farringdon-street, and then</p>

I stood with my back towards these lads. Mr. Pain told me, he saw Bowell take my handkerchief out of my left-hand pocket: he had then secured them both. He accused Bowell with it; and I saw the boy himself pull it out of his breeches. ( Produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . On the 29th of December, at the time of drawing the lottery, I saw these two boys very busy at several gentlemens pockets. The Prisoner went up and leaned over the rail; Jones was by him; he had his hand in his right-hand pocket; there happened to be nothing in it. Bowell wheeled round to his left side, and took this handkerchief out of the left-hand pocket, and thrust it into his breeches. Then I said to the prosecutor, You are robbed; and we accused the boy, and he took it out of his breeches himself.</p>

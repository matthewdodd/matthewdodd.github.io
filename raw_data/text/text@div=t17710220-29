               <p>Q. How do you know she picked your pocket of your key?</p>
               <p>Rutt. Because, just after, I was obliged to break the door open to get into my house. This was yesterday three weeks. I was at a public house; she came, and said, her mistress, Esther Green, wanted me. I asked her to drink; she sat down; this was between ten and eleven o'clock. I heard she had picked a sailor's pocket of twenty or thirty guineas; they said it was in a red purse. I then went home, and missed my money; I did not miss it till Friday; I was in company with no body else but her, and she knew the way of my house. I took her up, and found one pair of buckles in her shoes, and another pair in her pocket; two rings were on her fingers; one of the rings is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200053"></xptr> mourning ring, the stone is knocked out; it is an old family ring; here is my purse, here is a darn of my mother's in it, I can swear to it; she dropped this purse.</p>

            . I went in search of this woman: I found her at the Anchor and Crown, in New Rag Fair: she had two rings on her fingers: she was going to take them off, but the officer took them in his possession. We went from there to one Stewards, a public-house; there the officer searched her: I saw him take a pair of buckles out of her pocket, nine guineas, two half guineas, one thirty-six shilling piece, six shillings in silver, and eight-pence farthing. The officer took charge of her: she was standing pritty near the fire: I said, Mr. Rutt, do not you know these buckels? he said they were his: he took them out of her shoes: one of the rings is a mourning ring. Mrs. Green was committed with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mrs. Green live?</p>
               <p>Ragland. In Denmark-street, at that part of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was her servant?</p>
               <p>Ragland. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Rutt accuse Green of having robbed him as well as the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Ragland. No; I heard him say before the justice, that he believed she was innocent of the robbery; for if he had but two shillings she was welcome to one of them: the prosecutor told me to go to her, and tell her, that if he could get the money again, within eight or ten guineas, he would not hurt her: she said she had given him all she had left of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They came to me at New Prison, and said, if I did not mention her name they would be very favourable to me; if I did, they would hang me.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Court. Did you, or Rutt, or any of you, say any such thing?</p>
               <p>Ragland. I went to New Prison to her: I asked her if she would give the man the money, or let him know what she had bought.</p>
               <p>- Macknarth. I am a constable. I was at the searching of the woman; I found ten guineas, and one thirty-six shilling piece; two gold rings I took off her finger; I found these square buckles in her shoes, the other round ones I found in her pocket.</p>

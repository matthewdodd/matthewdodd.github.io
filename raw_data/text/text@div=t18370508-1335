                  </hi>. I am nine years old, and live with my mother, who keeps a shop in Chelsea-market—my father does not live in the house. On the 8th of May, about three o'clock, I went into the shop from the parlour—I saw the two prisoners outside the window, which was open—I had seen it shut about half-past two o'clock—I did not see them open it—when I first saw them, they had got one boot out, and were trying to get another, but could not—they had it half way out—I went to the door and they ran away—I told my mother, and she came out—Skinner was brought in in about half an hour—I have known the prisoners for about a year.</p>

I heard my son call out, and went to the shop—I found the window half open—I had seen it shut a very few minutes before—it is a double-sash window, and can be opened from the outside—it was lifted about a foot and a half—I missed one woman's boot from the window—the fellow one was on the ledge, halfway out—I had seen the boots in front of the window about a quarter of an hour before—the second boot was entirely removed from where it was before.</p>

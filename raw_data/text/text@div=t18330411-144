            . I live with my sister Ellen, who sells fruit. I was out of employ, and went to Smithfield to look for a job, on the 8th of March, and saw the prisoner coming down Long-lane with this pony - I asked him what he wanted for it; he said a guinea, that he had brought it from Hackney, out of a dust-yard - that the man was very ill, and could not afford to keep it, and the least farthing it was to be sold for was 18s.; he said, "If you have got nothing to do, all you can get over 18s. you may have for yourself;" I took it round Smithfield - he kept behind me about twenty yards, and I sold it for 28s. to a man I do not know; I went into the Bull's Head, to take the money - the prisoner stopped outside, and when I came out he asked for the 18s.; I said, "I shall see where you brought it from first" - he went a little way with me, and then ran off up the street as hard as he could; I ran after him, calling Stop thief! and he at last stopped of his own accord; he stopped at a shop, and called out "Father! father!" a man came and asked what I took him for - I told him what had happened; I returned the money to the man I sold it to, as I took him back to the public-house; I did not think it was all right, and returned him the money, and he returned the prisoner the horse; the prisoner took it down the Ram inn, and on the Saturday I found the owner of the horse.</p>

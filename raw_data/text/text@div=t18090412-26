            . I am a confectioner. On the 3rd of April, about ten o'clock, as I was observing the company going to the Mansion house, I felt a great crowd behind; on turning round I observed the prisoner snatch a watch from a gentleman; upon which I attempted to seize him, I could not; I observed there was only one way of his making his way off; on that way I observed him, keeping my eye upon him frequently; I was again going to take him in the crowd, at that moment he came off the pavement; I then attempted to seize him, but could not; he then run, I followed at the distance of half a yard. I suppose he ran between the carriages he had the start of me on the pavement: as I came on the pavement he passed me with the cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you called stop thief before - A. I never called out at all; I instantly seized him, I never left my hold till he was put in the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watch - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Your curiosity was excited, like a great many more honest men, to see the company go into the Mansion house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the person of the gentleman at the time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you know when you saw him at the Mansion house that he was the person against whom the attempt was made - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know you saw an attempt made by somebody on a gentleman - A. By the prisoner, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed that the prisoner was the person that made the snatch - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was standing near the prosecutor - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The same impression might be in his mind; he might fancy he saw somebody snatch the watch from the prosecutor, and he might be calling out stop thief to have them taken - when he was searched you found upon him his own watch, and eight or ten pounds in money - A. When he was searched in the Poultry compter the watch was not found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect observing at the Poultry compter, that you was quite sure that he must have the watch about him, and you directed a strict search to be made - A. No, I was sure that he was not in possession of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day you attended at the Mansion house and saw the prosecutor - A. No, on the second examination I saw the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. And then, and not till then, you were not able to ascertain that the watch was lost by the prosecutor - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say before the watch was produced that it was a handsome watch - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not able afterwards to know whether the watch that was produced was the watch that was taken at the time, supposing the prisoner stole it - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. The moment you saw the watch snatched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120020"></xptr>from the gentleman's pocket, you never lost sight of him - A. No. When we secured him there was a mob about him; he was taken down Walbrook; some said duck him, and some pump upon him; two gentlemen came up, and said take him to the Poultry compter.</p>

            . Q. You are a marshalman - A. I am. On Easter Monday I was on duty at the Mansion house. About ten o'clock a gentleman came up to me, saying he had found a watch, he believed it to be a gold watch, he would wish to leave it in such hands as the right owner might have it. I asked the gentleman his name, and I gave the gentleman my name; the gentleman's name is Sharp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Are you certain it is the same watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was out of your custody - how long - A. Almost four days; then it was locked up in Mr. Hoblers's box at the Mansion house; it was delivered to me at the Mansion house; I have had it ever since.</p>

            . I am at the Commercial docks. I was crossing Charlotte row, from that side next to the Mansion house, near ten o'clock on the day mentioned; just before I got to the pavement, I heard something fall down, and break like glass; there were several people passing at the time, they did not look at it; I put my hand down, I found it was a watch case. I looked a little further, I saw the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Charlotte row was this - A. Between the side door of the Mansion house and the one in front.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the crowd appear to be about - A. They appeared to me to be passing and repassing. I delivered the watch to Mr. Porter at the Mansion house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Then the impression on your mind was, that there was no robbery then - A. I did not see any thing at all; it certainly fell on the pavement; how it came there I could not tell, I heard it drop, and was rather surprised that they that passed took no notice of it; it appeared to drop from some of the people that were passing at the time; no person stopped to pick it up, which rather surprised me.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been down to Greenwich to get my prize wages; I found the office locked up; I came back by the stage. Coming by the Mansion house I came across the street, he came and laid hold of me by the shoulders, he said stay; I said I shall not stop. I was lugged by my legs and arms, and when they got me to the Poultry compter, then the constable came and searched me, and found nothing; then they would not let me go, this young fellow would not let me go, he said he was sure I had the watch, it was a pretty watch.</p>
               <p>JURY to Phene. When you saw the prisoner make an attempt at the watch, did you see the watch whether it was a white one, or what - A. I saw it all in his hand together, and part hanging out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take any notice of the gentleman that lost the watch - A. No.</p>

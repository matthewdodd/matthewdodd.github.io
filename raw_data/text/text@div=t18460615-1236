On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 6th of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, in company with other officers, I went to a house in New-court, Duck-lane, Westminster—I went up stairs to the front room second floor, and found the door fastened inside and out—I was provided with hammers and implements to break open doors—these two large logs of wood were placed against the door inside, and it was fastened outside by two bolts, one at top, and one at the bottom, and two planks, about two and a half inches thick, which reached from top to bottom, were nailed outside the door, to give it the appearance of an uninhabited place—we broke it down in an instant with our implements, and saw the prisoner there alone—I had four officers with me—as soon as I entered the room I saw the prisoner standing by a large clear fire—in her right hand she had a large plaster of Paris mould, in her left this large iron spoon, containing white metal in a fluid state—she put the spoon on the hearth, and at the same time lai'd hold of a counterfeit half-crown, with a get attached to it, off the mantel-piece, and put it into the iron spoon, which was quite hot, and the metal was in a fluid state—she at the same time dashed the mould on the floor, and commenced stamping upon it with her feet—Brannan then secured her—I produce three Britannia metal spoons which I found upon the mantel-piece, one partly melted, a file, the teeth of which were foil of metal, that was on the mantel-piece, also a piece of white metal—I also produce a piece of a mould which I found on the hearth quite hot—it was part of the one which she threw down and destroyed—she abused us very much, and said, "You b—s you thought you had me to rights, but you b—i you have not; if you had been here half an hour sooner you would; you ought to have been searched before you came here."</p>

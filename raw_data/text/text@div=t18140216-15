               <p>MATTHEW HOLMES. I am in the employ of Messrs. North and Simpson. In consequence of what had passed on the 12th of February, I watched the prisoner; he left the warehouse at ten o'clock; that was sooner than usual of a Saturday night; I followed him; he turned up Little Bridge-street; it is a bye way, very private. I observed him to stoop near a dunghill; he took something out of his pockets, and put there: he returned to the warehouse; in less than half an hour he left the premises again, at eleven o'clock. I then followed him again; I saw him stoop at the same place where he had stooped before. He then appeared to take up something, and put it into his pockets: he went on towards his home, as I presume; I followed him, and stopped him on Ludgate-hill; I felt in his pocket, and found some soap there. I told him he must return again to his masters. He went with me. I found his pockets to contain three pounds weight of soap. Upon the soap being produced, the prisoner said, in the presence of Mr. Graham, it was the first time he had taken any thing, went down on his knees, and hoped he would forgive him. The other soap is here. This soap I found in the prisoners pockets is both yellow and mottled; it is worth three shillings; it is three pounds in the whole. I cannot swear to soap.</p>

            , myself; these are the names of all the partners. When Holmes brought back the prisoner to our warehouse, I told the prisoner we had suspected him of robbing us a considerable time. He said, it was the first time, fell on his knees, and begged we would forgive him of that offence. We sent for Harper, the constable.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I went with Harper to search the prisoner's lodgings; we found about forty or fifty pounds weight of soap, cut up in pieces.</p>

               <p>Mr. Graham. We dealt in this kind of soap; we had such kind of soap in our warehouse. One of the pieces of soap has the appearance of having laid on a dunghill.</p>

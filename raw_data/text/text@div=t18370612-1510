Q.</hi> Have you always said you saw the trowsers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was what I saw—they were not quite finished, and they were unmade dresses—I told Rose that I should not have had tea there, but she took my bonnet and shawl, and locked them in—Walker's wife was trim<lb></lb>ming a bonnet—I did not mention that before the Magistrate, as I was not asked about it—I looked at Rose's clock when the prisoners went away—I cannot exactly say the time—it was near four o'clock—about half-past three o'clock—I cannot say whether I ever said it was a little after three o'clock.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated it to be a little after three o'clock when Blackson left, and contained nothing of having observed the trowsers.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Walker, a linen-draper, in Oxford-street. On Whit Monday, between five and six o'clock in the evening, Blackson and Walker came to our shop, and bought two cotton dresses—one was a pink plaid—they each changed a sovereign, and received change.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the afternoon of Whit Monday I was called into Mrs. Harris's house, when the alarm was given—I saw the drawer, and examined the door—there were no marks of violence on the door—I went on the Wednesday with Mrs. Harris and Mrs. Roberts to No. 5, Charles-street, Lisson-grove, which is about a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Harris's—in the first-floor front room I found the prisoners, Blackson and Walker, and two young women—I asked Mrs. Roberts, which was the young man she had seen in the house that day—she pointed Blakson out, and I took him into custody, and told him he was my prisoner—he asked what for—I said, about stealing a £5 note, seven sovereigns, and other articles—he said he never heard tell of such a thing in his life—I saw a pair of quite new boots there, and asked whose they were—Blackson said they were his—I found none of the stolen pro<lb></lb>perty—Walker was also taken—I afterwards took Chambers, and found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, in a small box in her room, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>in a table drawer in the room where she was, (the first-floor back room)—I also found a key which had been newly filed—I applied it to Mrs. Harris's door, and found it opened and locked it—on the Friday night following I went into the same room, and found this gown piece in a box belonging to Chambers—I had searched the same box before, and she then said it was her box—Davey was with me.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you not Chambers in custody at the time you found it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had—I searched the box the day I took her, but I was not looking for a gown then, but a silver tea-spoon and watch—the gown-piece might have been there and I not notice it, as there were sheets and different things in a lump together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went on the 17th to No. 5, Charles-street, with Cumming, and took Walker into custody—I searched the room, and found two chisels, two files, part of a centre-bit, a hand-vice, a screw-driver, ten duplicates, and a pick-lock key, in a small box, in Walker's room—I applied the chisels to the marks in the drawers which I found at Mrs. Harris's, and they corresponded exactly—one chisel was smaller than the other, and there were marks of both.</p>

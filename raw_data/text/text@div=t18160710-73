We usually buy lead of any one who brings it; but we don't buy any for money, unless from persons we very well know. I had known the prisoner a short time. He had brought old lead, and taken new for it. He said, he wanted thirty feet of three quarters pipe. The prisoner came again after we had seen Mr. Aburrow. I did not stop the prisoner when he came again, and it was after Mr. Aburrow claimed the lead as his.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 38, York-street, St. Luke's, and am a linen-draper. On the afternoon of 13th Feb., the prisoner Maine came and bought a ball of cotton, paid for it, and went out—directly she was gone Mrs. Mills came and spoke to me; in consequence of which I went to the shop porch, and missed this piece of print (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I had seen safe a quarter of an hour before—I went through several streets; through King's-square, which is a quarter of a mile from my shop, and at the corner of Wellington-street, Goswell-street, I saw Jones, Sullivan, and Loader—I laid hold of Loader; I found she had nothing, and let her go—I then took Jones, and found she had the print in her apron; I said, "You have my print in your apron"—she said some one had given it her—I told her I should take her to the station, she begged me not to, and made great resistance—as we were going, some one gave her a knife, and told her to stab me, and she cut my band, but did not hurt me—I took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) away from her—in the evening Maine came to my shop with two women, who said they were Jones's mother and sister, and offered to pay for the print—Maine said they were outside together, and Sullivan gave her a penny, and sent her in for the ball of cotton—she said nothing about the print.</p>

                  </hi>. I live nearly opposite Mr. Rowsell's shop. On this afternoon I saw all the prisoners standing next door to Mr. Rowsell's—I saw Jones and Loader leave the other two, and go to Mr. Bowsers door, and Jones took the pins out of the print, and put them into her frock—they then went back to the other two, and Maine went into the shop, and while she was in, Jones and Loader went, and Loader took the print—they both came out, joined Sullivan, who had been waiting for them, and went away together—Sullivan could see Loader take the print—Maine almost immediately came out, and turned the contrary way to which the others had gone—I told Mr. Rowsell.</p>

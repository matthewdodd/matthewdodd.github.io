                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live in Upper Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square. I was in Mark's employ upwards of twelve months, three years ago—I knew Silk as a hatter—I always considered him as a master, as keeping a shop—I have seen him at Marks's, with goods to sell—not very often—he had beaver hats unfinished, just as they came from the die—</p>

               <p>sometimes he brought them in a string, sometimes in a handkerchief, but not doubled up—I have seen others bring hats doubled up and folded in a handkerchief—Marks lived where he does now when I lived with him—he had two shops in High-street—I defy any man to judge the value of stuff hats within 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this hat is damaged (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—in our neighbourhood we are obliged to buy cheap—I would not give more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it at the utmost—this other hat is perfect—I would not give more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—this other is better, and I might go as far as 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it in St. Giles's, but not more—I have known Marks six or seven years—I never heard any thing against him—Davies was his shopman, and worked with me; he bore an honest character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hatter in King's-bench-walk, Southwark. I have sold Marks hats for the last four years—I sometimes sent them folded, and sometimes blocked in the hood—I have never sold any exactly in this state—I have seen Silk, but never deak with him; he was a master hatter when I knew him two years ago—I lately heard of his being a journeyman.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>The things I lost were kept in a vault in a building in Southampton-buildings; I saw them on the Saturday night; on the Monday morning, I found the door broke open, and the tools gone; I and Haggard went to the prisoner's house; we met him; he went back with us to his own house; I insisted upon his opening the cellar door; to see if I could find any thing belonging to me; the first thing I saw, was an iron axe of mine. I have had it I suppose ten years; there are two pieces broke in the head of it; I have not the least doubt of it being mine; between the floor and joists in the cieling I found my hand-saw, there is a piece of the handle broke; it is an ash handle; I have had it in use twelve years; I found another saw, that was my man's, a key-hole saw, with a piece broke off the handle; we found the two brad-awls behind the door.</p>

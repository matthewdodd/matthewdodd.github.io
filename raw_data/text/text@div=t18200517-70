The door was fastened by a spring-latch. The window was down, but not fastened. About eight o'clock in the evening (I had left the parlour about ten minutes), I heard a loud knocking at the door - it might be daylight in the street. I came down, and the people said there was a thief in the house. I perceived the prisoner in the parlour, and he was secured. I found a handkerchief hanging over the cupboard-door, and missed about 18 s. off the mantle-piece. I had left the handkerchief on a chair.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoemaker. On Sunday, the 14th of May, about a quarter past eight o'clock, I was informed a man had been seen lurking about. I live opposite the prosecutrix, and saw her window open; the man then moved a step or two from the window. I asked who was there; I received no answer. A man passed by, and whistled twice. I then suspected he had accomplices inside. I shut the window, closed the shutters, and then knocked at the door. I found the prisoner in the parlour, and he was secured. The man outside walked off. There might be light enough to distinguish a man's features.</p>

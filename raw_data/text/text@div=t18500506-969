                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On 30th April, about half-past fire o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in St. James'-street; and met the prisoner within a few yards of Jermyn-street—I crossed over to him, and said, "Halloo, here you are out <hi rend="italic">screwing</hi> already this morning"—he said he did not know what I meant—I saw a person on the opposite side run—I said, "Have you got any screws about you?"—he said, "No"—I took off his hat, and found two milk-jugs and a mustard-pot in it—I took him to the station, and asked him if he had anything more about him; and he took from his pocket six table-spoons, a gravy-spoon, six tea and four salt-spoons, a fish-knife, a butter-knife, a pair of sugar-tongs, and seven forks (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found on him a screw-driver, a knife, part of a wax-candle, and a quantity of lucifer-matches—I received information, went to Mrs. Gibbs', and found marks of violence on the door in the passage—this screw-driver found on the prisoner fitted the marks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and carry on business in Down-street, Picadilly, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On 29th April I was the last person up—I bolted the street-door at half-past ten o'clock—I heard nothing in the night—I got up at eight in the morning, and missed this plate—it is mine, and was safe the night before—the outer door had not been opened by violence, but it was found unbolted in the morning—there were marks on the shop door.</p>

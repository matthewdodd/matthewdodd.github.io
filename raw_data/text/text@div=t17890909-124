               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor; on the 27th of August, I was in his house at work, in the shop which communicates with the house by two doors; one into the parlour, and one into the passage; my master is a gun-smith; and as I was at work, I saw two young men come in at the street door; I thought they had been going into the house about business, to some of the lodgers; but the gentlewoman over the way giving an alarm, I came out of the shop directly, and saw the two prisoners coming down stairs with bundles in their hands; when they came a little nearer to me, I seized the prisoner Williams by the collar; he dropped one of the bundles he had in his left hand, and made his escape; I am quite sure I saw him drop it; I pursued him about twenty rood, hallooing to stop him; and a gentleman put his foot, and threw him down; then I came up, seized him by the collar, and desired the gentleman to assist me; I did not see the other prisoner taken; I never saw either of them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you be positively certain these are the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure the prisoner Davis was the other man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Williams ever out of your sight? - Not half a minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. As there are lodgers, they let themselves in and out, I suppose, by the same door that these people went in at? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That door is occasionally left open? - It was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>You was minding your work? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know it was fastened in any way? - I heard the latch shove up.</p>
               <p>But whether it was fastened, you cannot positively swear, to your knowledge? - No.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of August last, I was at work in Neale's yard; I heard the cry of stop thief; and I saw one of the prisoners coming very fast, and I chucked up his heels, and collared him; then this young man came and said he had robbed his master's house; that was immediately after I took him; going to Litchfield-street, I took these keys out of his pocket (produces a large bunch of keys); I had seen him before; I know him now.</p>

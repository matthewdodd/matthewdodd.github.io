               <p>Q. What day was he robbed? - On Thursday, the 6th of November last, about three o'clock in the afternoon; they came in the shop and desired to look at some silk handkerchiefs, both the prisoners, in company with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it applied to you to look at the handkerchiefs? - I rather think it was the woman at the bar, but they all seemed to speak at once, but it was particularly the woman.</p>

On their desiring to look at some silk handkerchiefs, a bundle was shewn to them by themselves; they looked at them and tumbled them about, in such a manner that gave me an idea they had an intent to steal, particularly the prisoner's wife; Kelly, while his wife was looking over the handkerchiefs, attempted to pull something from over the counter, which strongly strengthened my suspicion; this attempt was made several times; at last I thought I see something taken from the counter on which I immediately swept the whole of the handkerchiefs off from the counter,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080051"></xptr>determined to shew them no more; they desired to see more, but I would not shew them any more; whereupon they quitted the shop; Mr. Kelly was the last person that left the shop, whom I seized and brought back, and afterwards the woman, his <rs id="t17941208-9-deflabel51" type="occupation">wife</rs>

               <p>Q. Was she out of sight? - No. On seizing her as she walked a few paces back she dropped the handkerchiefs; the goods I have with me, a quantity of handkerchiefs containing six dozen; the stockings she did not drop, she gave me those.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she drop these cotton handkerchiefs, from her petticoats or from where? - From under her cloak. As she was coming along, before she returned to the house again, delivered to me a paper of stockings of her own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these handkerchiefs? - Sixteen shillings and six-pence; it is stated in the indictment sixteen shillings, they cost that money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had they cost that? - I cannot exactly say; the stockings are likewise valued at eleven shillings in the indictment, but cost eleven shillings and six-pence.</p>

When the prosecutor said that I had something that was not my property, I really did not know what he meant; he gave me in charge to the man, and stopped the woman, on whom he found what was mentioned in the indictment; but nothing was found on me; Johnson walked away, although close to the woman when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080052"></xptr>prosecutor took her, and my consternation was such that I really did not know what I said or did; but, as I said before, nothing was found in my possession; but however, I was, with the woman taken before a magistrate and committed for trial. I have wrote to my brother now in the College in Dublin, that I was in trouble; he has wrote me an answer to know what my motives were for going to England, and desires me to send him the abode of my prosecutor, in order that he may write to some of his fellow students to settle it for me.

               <p>Q. When did you first see Hillier? - A. Just after Mr. Carruthers's business, I went to Mr. Hillier, and told him, I was going to dispose of it to another person, I did not tell him who that person was, nor he did not ask; he asked how much we had got, I told him, I did not rightly know; I told him, I thought there were tow gallons; he asked me the price, I told him four shillings; he said, that was too much money; he told me, that a very little while ago, he bought a carboy that he gave half-a-crown for; I told him he could not have it at that, it was too little, upon which he agreed to give me three shillings and sixpence, and Ronaldson desired me to take it; I took it in a stone bottle that held three gallons; he asked me if I was sure it held three gallons, and I told him I was sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he content with your assurance, without measuring it? - A. Yes; and he neither asked, not I did not tell him how I came by it.</p>

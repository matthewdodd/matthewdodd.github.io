I am going home. With that she followed me, and I asked her to go along with me, and asked her what she would have? She told me she would have a shilling; so I told her I would give her six-pence; and she took me up an alley, and I gave her six-pence, and as I was with her I felt her take the watch out of my left hand pocket; with that I charged her with it, and took her to the watch-house, and she denied the watch at the watch-house, and then the watchman insisted on searching of her; accordingly the pulled the watch out of her bosom, and the watchman would not let her go then, nor me neither, without I left my watch for security, to come on Monday morning eleven o'clock, which I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the watch on condition of going to a house with him, to take half a crown for myself, and a shilling for the room.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say when you first took her up? - She denied having the watch; in the watch-house, when I prest on her, for her to be searched, she put her hand into her bosom and took the watch out, and gave it this Michael Cullen; She said, she would never do so any more; she said, that this Cullen gave it her as a pledge for half a crown, at some house.</p>
               <p>Court to Cullin. You talked of an agreement for six-pence; did you give her the watch in pledge for two shillings and six-pence? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am an unfortunate person, and very poor, and I told the gentleman I knew a place for company, and he gave me the watch to take half a crown for myself, and a shilling for the room; and when he came into the watch-house, I honourably gave it him, before the company.</p>

Anthony Gibbs and Co., on 14th May—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the order had been given before—my vessel was lying at Cotton's-wharf, London-bridge—I know Long very well, he is a lighterman, I employed him about the guano—I first saw him about it on Thursday morning, 15th May—I gave him this order, and told him I wanted him to fetch 14 tons of guano from the West India Docks—the order was for delivery on Friday, 16th May, the day after I gave it him—this is my name, but I did not write it—I do not know whose writing it is—he was to bring the guano as soon as he got it—he ought to have got it on the Friday, according to the order—he said he had a barge in the docks, and he might perhaps get it on the Thursday, which would save us a day—I did not see him again till the Monday morning, when the barge tame alongside, and he came afterwards—(I had inquired for him at his resi<lb></lb>dence on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two or three times a day, but could hear nothing of him)—I asked him about the delay, he said he did not get the guano till late on Saturday night, and thought it was no use to bring it out till the Monday morning, because the barge would be much safer in the docks, and he thought we should not have taken it in on Sunday if he had brought it—the barge was then unloaded into my ship; as the bags came up the ship's side, they looked less than bags of guano which I have taken before, and I said I thought they looked less than I was used to—Long said he did not think there was any difference in them—I was to receive 220 bags, but there were 221—I said we never had any over before, and it was rather strange—my mate found it out, and said there was one over, and Long said he knew it, they had given one over this time—the barge which brought the guano was called the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi>—I paid Long, and he went away—I had no other guano on board—I immediately set sail for Yorkshire, and delivered the guano at Mr. Scholfield's place—I was afterwards fetched ashore to look as some guano, I cannot say whether it was the same—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the bags I brought up—it was given roe by Gelder, Mr. Scholfield's foreman, and I delivered it to Messrs. Gibbs and Co., at their office, where I saw a sample taken out of it, which I took to Professor Way—I did not see the bag weighed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman at the East and West India Docks. I am not check clerk in point of fact, but I do that duty—I have to attend to the delivery of goods on delivery-orders—on 16th May there was a vessel in the docks called the <hi rend="italic">Invermore</hi>, laden with guano—it is my duty to see to the delivery of guano on such orders as this—I received this order on 17th May, it is dated the 14th, for delivery on the 16th—I do not know who brought it to me—I know Long by sight—I was on shore when it was brought—I deli<lb></lb>vered from the <hi rend="italic">Invermore</hi>, 14 tons, 6 cwt, 1 qr., 1 lb. of guano—I saw Long on board the <hi rend="italic">Invermore</hi> on Saturday, 17th—I saw him on 16th, and Pickering—there was a person with him who I have seen before—I have seen him since frequently, and have heard him called Joseph Fulmer, or something like that—I should know him again if I were to see him—I have seen him with Pickering—I have not heard it stated who he is in Pickering's presence, nor in Long's, so as for him to hear it—the guano was delivered into the <hi rend="italic">Old Soul</hi> between 12 and half-past 2 o'clock—Long was standing by looking after his craft, and urging the men to get it done as quickly as they could—he said he would give them some beer if they would make haste and save the tide—I keep a book in which I enter the numbers and weight of the bags before they are put over the ship's side—the bags were Nos. 6102 to 6321—when that, was done, I made an indorsement on the order, and took a receipt—every bag was numbered consecutively—as soon as the delivery is complete, I make an indorsement on the delivery-order, and then it is signed by the working lighterman who takes the stuff in—his name is Carney, his name is here—I send the note to the Dock Company's-office—I am present all the time taking the account—it was delivered in linen bags similar to this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry to the Royal Agricultural Society, and live in Holies-street. My attention has been very much directed to the subject of manures—I understand guano—I have analyzed many hun<lb></lb>dred specimens—I received one sample from Cruikshank, and another from Captain Drury—I have analyzed them—there were two analyseses made of the sample from Captain Drury, which agree very well with each other—what I received from Cruikshank was pure guano—the component parts of the pure were, moisture, 8.71 per cent.; animal matter and salts of ammonia, 57.54; sand, 1.23; earthy phosphates, 21.06; earthy salts, 11.66—the animal matter furnishes 14.77 per cent, of nitrogen, which is equal to 17.93 of ammonia—the specific gravity is 1/65—the two principal fertilizing ingredients are ammonia and phosphate of lime—they are the most material ingredients—there is only 79 per cent, of fertilizing matter in it—the sand is about 11/4 per cent.—the samples I received from Captain Drury gave animal matter and ammonia 26.68; the phosphate, 12.58; clay and sand, 45.67; the nitrogen was 6.52, equal to 7.91 of ammonia; the specific gravity of that, in relation to water, is 2.97—the alkaline salts are 6.16; the moisture, 8.91—that makes up the hundred, leaving out, of coarse, the nitrogen; that is a separate calculation—one sample weighs rather more than half as much again as water, and the other twice as much—the impure is the heaviest—guano is a very light substance—the greater part of it is clay—there is a great deal of iron in the clay—the benefit of that is given to the earthy phosphates—all clay contains iron, except the white pure clay; that is free from iron—I did not detect any iron beyond what I should expect to find in clay—the guano was not improved; it was about half its former value, both in point of money and utility as a manure.</p>

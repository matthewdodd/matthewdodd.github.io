                  </hi>. I am 13 years old, and live with my father, James Suckling, at Kensington. On Tuesday night, the 3rd of Nov., about five minutes after six o'clock, I was in the back-parlour, and heard somebody walking up and down in front of the house—I heard a noise as if a nail dropped—I and my mother went to the front, door and to the garden-gate in front of the door—we found a pair of shoes at the gate, and a barometer leaning against the hinges—that was not its proper place—there was also a square box, like a writing-desk, by the lamp—we carried the things in.</p>

                  </hi>. I was usher at the Police-court, Bow-street. On the 3rd of Nov., about a quarter-past six o'clock, I returned home towards my house, met the prisoner, thought he looked a suspicious character, and stood aside to watch him—I went home, and from information I received I pursued the prisoner, and found him in Silver-street—he got into a place where there is no thoroughfare—a constable came up, and I gave him into custody—I saw he had no hat or cap on, and when he came to the light I saw he had no shoes on—next morning I was in the garden—my attention was called to a man's cap in the next garden—the policeman has it.</p>

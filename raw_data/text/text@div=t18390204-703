                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Piggott, a tailor. On the 10th of January, at a quarter past nine o'clock, I was coming up Chiswell-street, on to Finsbury-pavement, to come home—there were two young lads first before me and then behind me—the prisoner then <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> against me, and I fell against the railings—I felt his hand at my pocket—I turned round and said "You have picked my pocket of my purse, containing two half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence"—I held him—he said, "It was not me that had your purse, it was them that ran away"—he got from me—I fell down, and a witness caught him—the other two lads had run away—when I took the prisoner, he said, rather than be exposed, he would make up what I had in the purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silver-plate worker. At a quarter past nine o'clock, I was crossing the square, and saw a few persons assembled—I went up, and the prosecutrix was accusing the prisoner of taking a parse—he made a bit of a scuffle, and ran away about fifty yards—I overtook and stopped him—he said, "I have not done it, by G—d!"and I heard him say to the policeman and the prosecutrix, that he would rather make up the money than be exposed—he said he was too respectable to rob a person.</p>

I heard the call of "Police"—I went, and found the prisoner in the custody of John Kendall—the prosecutrix came up, and told me she had lost a purse with two half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence—I said he must go to the station-house—in going along he said, "If you will not take me there, I will go to the first pawnbroker's, and pawn my coat and waistcoat, and make it up, and give it her.</p>

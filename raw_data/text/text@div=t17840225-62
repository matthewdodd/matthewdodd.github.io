               <p>What quantity? - I have the quantity with me, I have not weighed it, it may be seven or eight ounces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for the Prisoner. It was a part of the business of the man at the bar to put on the bridges of the buckles? - Certainly, among the rest.</p>
               <p>There were several other men who worked in the same place with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now is it by any means unusual to put them in their pockets? - They have no business to put them in their pockets.</p>
               <p>This man was going to get his breakfast? - Yes, he said he was, it was not nine o'clock, he had his coat on, and his hat on, his great coat was in the shop.</p>
               <p>You cannot swear to the small pieces of silver? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you find any plate at his apartments? - No.</p>
               <p>Describe the situation in which this peep-hole was, that you watched the prisoner through? - At the top of the stairs, there had been a door, there was only a wainscot that parted the shop from the stairs, I took down a board.</p>
               <p>I should suppose that the window of the work-shop faced the peep-hole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The man was between you and the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose the men worked with their faces to the light? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Consequently the men were between you and the window, now I want to know whether you can see through a man, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250138"></xptr> is my short question, because this man was standing with his back to you? - He did, but not when he put the bridges in his pocket.</p>
               <p>When he was forging them down he stood with his back to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He told you after, that for the purpose of multiplying bridges he had forged them down? - He did.</p>
               <p>Then he would be to account for so many as he had multiplyed them into? - Certainly, but no man does account.</p>
               <p>You had no reason before to doubt of his being an honest man? - No, only my general suspicion of all my shop.</p>
               <p>You said your defect consisted chiefly of filings? - Of filings and bridges.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I searched the left-hand breeches pocket of the prisoner, and found nothing but money, I felt his waistcoat pockets, and found they were worn out, and could hold nothing, I came to his right-hand breeches pocket, and was going to put my hand in, he pushed my hand away, stop says he, and he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out the silver, and gave it into my hands.</p>
               <p>How many bridges are there? - There is two bridges no way deficient, there is another bridge that is hammered and doubled to.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing? - I searched him in every other pocket, and Mr. Lycett then said, give them into my charge, and the man said, he did not intend to take them away.</p>
               <p>Did you search his lodgings? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Of what use are the other pieces of silver? - Of no use but to work.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner asked to speak with me in the parlour and he told me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say any thing to him before he spoke to you? - No. I had given charge of him, and was going up stairs.</p>
               <p>When you went into the parlour, did you speak to him first? - No, he spoke to me, he said it was the first time, and he hoped I would have mercy on him, I turned away from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe you attended afterwards at the Rotation Office in Clerkenwell Green? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the justice there what had passed in the parlour? - I believe I did; this bridge is one of them that Mr. Terry marked; this is one that I marked. (The bridge deposed to).</p>
               <p>Recollect a little, because it is of some consequence to the defendant, whether you told the justice what had passed in the parlour? - I cannot be sure whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Aye, but you must endeavour to recollect yourself, because you know it is a subsequent fact to that? - I cannot charge my memory whether I did or did not; I mentioned it before Sir Sampson Wright at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it at Clerkenwell-green? - If I did not, my partner did.</p>

               <p>What he was spokesman? - Any body was spokesman, we were insulted in the face of the Court.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell me, yea or no, that you did say so? - I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not? - No, by no means, nor I cannot swear that I did.</p>
               <p>In consequence of the examination that took place at the Rotation Office, this man was discharged? - He was.</p>
               <p>And afterwards he was taken up by a new warrant and carried to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There you told the story of the parlour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Be so good to recollect exactly, and state it in words, what passed between him and you in the parlour? - He said, I wish to speak to my master; I came down stairs, and went with him to the parlour, and he said it is the first time, I hope you will have compassion or mercy; I turned round from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250139"></xptr>Had not you at that time said, compassion! why you have stole my plate? - I need not tell him that.</p>
               <p>Had you told him that he had stole it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then this expression might mean this, have compassion on my character, perhaps he meant that? - I told the men that we had been robbed to a very considerable amount, and that it must be some men in the shop; he did not tell me then that he had any silver in his pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

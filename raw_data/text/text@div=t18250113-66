On the 10th of December I lost an umbrella from a rail inside the shop - I had seen it safe about a quarter of an hour before: I was in a back parlour when it was taken. I saw it again in about ten minutes, when the prisoner was brought back with it. I had seen him repeatedly, with other boys, in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I am master of the Atalanta. Bowden slept on board that night - I heard an alarm, and saw him find his watch and case - I also missed a watch, three sovereigns, and some silver, from the state-room; I went and found the prisoner in a boat alone in about five minutes, and charged him with it - he denied having been on board, but said, he was smuggling two bottles of gin, and was pursued by the police; that he belonged to a vessel in the tier above; he was without a hat - a person brought it to him, and he owned it - as I was going down into the boat where he was, somebody said, "Captain, he has hove your watch overboard;" he said the man was a liar.</p>

            . I am a Custom-house officer, and was on board the next vessel to the Atalanta - I heard an alarm, went on deck, and saw Bowden pick up his watch; I saw a person getting into the next vessel and followed him four or five vessels off into a boat - some men in the sixth vessel called out, "He is in a boat" - I got down and callared him; it was the prisoner - he put his hand into his pocket and took out something - then put his hand into the water and dropped it - I cannot tell what it was - he said he was pursued by two officers, as he had had two bottles of gin, and lost his hat in the scuffle - I said that was a lame story, and it was likely he had taken the watch - he said I was a d - d liar - I then went and found his hat near the companion door of the Atalanta - I brought it to him, put it on, and it fitted him very well; I said, "I have brought your hat;" he said, "Oh! have you;" I believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260098"></xptr>him to be the man whom I saw crossing the ships - it was between two and three o'clock in the morning.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A countryman promised me two bottles of gin - I went on board to get it - I was pursued by an officer, and escaped across the tier, and in a quarter of an hour, they came and said I had robbed them - my hat had fallen into the water.</p>

            . I live in Leadenhall-street, and am a baker: on Monday the 6th of May I sent my man out with a basket of bread; he soon returned, and said his basket was gone again; this was the third I lost. I put on a disguise in order to see for it; I was directed by a brother baker to go to Chick-lane; I asked a baker there if he had seen any such; he said, here is a baker that has almost ruined me, by selling bread cheaper than the standard: I went on, and saw the prisoner pitch a basket and take six quartern loaves, two under each arm, and two upon his head, and go into this baker's shop, named Becket; I followed him into the house; the man and wife took the bread and set it on the counter: the baker's man went to secure the basket; I followed the prisoner towards the basket; and said, do you know who owns this basket; he said, no; he did not know any thing of it. I took him back to the shop; the man and woman began to swear they knew nothing of the prisoner: I took the prisoner before my Lord Mayor: we never got back the six quartern loaves; they swore so, and made such a to do, that I could not get at them. I doubt not but there has been 400 baskets lost within sixteen or eighteen months, with bread in them.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the college yard on the 1st of August, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon; she invited me to drink part of a pot of beer. I went away with her. I had received my money that evening. I had it in a green purse. I sat along with her a drinking. I paid for two pots of beer. I pulled out my purse and took out a six pence, and put it in my waistcoat pocket; my comrade came after me, and found me there; we were sitting close together; she was sitting on the right side of me. I thought her a very honest and modest like woman by the appearance of her. My thigh happened to be on her left thigh, and she let her thigh slip, and my thigh went between her legs; her hand was in my pocket, not that I thought she would steal any thing out of my pocket; seeing her so free I took my foot back and sat beside her, and I took the beer and drank. Was not this person very lovely. I bid her drink, and she drink at last. The third time I put my hand in my pocket, and I miss'd it directly; her hand was round my waist; but I did not think she took it then. Before I got off the seat I challenged her; and said you took the money out of my pocket. She said no, take care your comrade don't take it away. I said no, you took it out of my pocket, when my hand was under your pettycoats. Then said she, unstrip; O said, I, I did not think you was such a one. My dear, says she, your money is safe enough; it is better I should have your money than yourself; come along with me; and so she invited me to dine with her. Woman, says I, you had better give me the money; and I rose and paid the reckoning with the loose money I had in my pocket. Woman, says I, I want to go home, and not stay with you. I got out; I did not know what to do with her. She got to another place and would have a bottle of Hock. I said, woman, I want to go home. I do not want to sit down. I gave her a bottle of Hock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she carry you to?</p>
               <p>Maclane. It was not any place I knew. She would not go where I was known. I thought I was going to have my money. She would not be satisfied till she had a glass of gin at another place; and I humoured her for the sake of my money. Night was coming on, and she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110016"></xptr> for flinging me in the street; she could not do it. She came where there was five or six men drinking, and would not go by without drinking. I would not call, but she drank first out of the pot, and then gave it me, and said pay for this; I had but one penny then. She said this man is blaming me for a robbery. I said, Woman, I shall not follow you any longer. I thought she would bring me in another company; the men never spoke a word. I ask your pardon said I; I throwed it in her face, and said, if it costs me a dollar to morrow morning I will find you. I came out of the door, and she came out. I took her by the arm and gave her a kick with my right foot, and said go home; I'll find you to-morrow morning. She called me by name; I turned about, and she said, come along with me, the money is safe enough; so I went to her own apartment, and lied all night; 'tis below Jews row; I could not sleep; I left some cloaths on the floor, and when day light came I put no cloaths on but my shoes, and I rose, and she waked, and said, Maclane, what, are you getting up? your money is safe enough. I laid down again; I could not rest, but did rise between four and five, and I would not stay in the place; she rose and put on her clothes, and bid the other woman, that was her partner, take her clothes with her. I would not stay. I desired her to let me have the money; she said, as true as I'm the devil I have none. I never heard such an oath before from any one. I said, I will find you before night; so I went home to my comrade; there were none of them up. If it had been an English woman I should not have minded it; but it was very hard to be served so by my own countrywoman.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sober or drunk?</p>
               <p>Maclane. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sign where you picked her up?</p>
               <p>Maclane. The Mermaid.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you loose?</p>
               <p>Maclane. Two guineas, and a half guinea in gold, and 4 s. and 6 d. in silver. I received it from the office the same day. I had not had it three hours in my custody.</p>

            . He received his money at our college. They were in the yard; I saw them in the Mermaid yard; when I went to receive my next paper to know when I was to receive my next money, they were moved into the box, and were sitting very lovingly together. I said it was time to go home; he said he would come presently; so I left him. I saw no more of him till between five and six o'clock next morning; he had been with that woman all night, and had no money left. I said you have made a bad hand of it; he said she had picked his pocket of it. He said there was no body in company but her and him; he knew he had it in the Mermaid; there he missed it. I came down with him to Jews Row, and finding the woman, we went into a public house with her about the money; she said his money was safe enough: and if he would live with her, he should have his money again; and he should never want money in his pocket, and she would be better to him than his money. I believe I staid about three hours, desiring her to give the man his money, she said it was safe enough, he would get it again. I left her and came down again the next day; she said the same again, it was safe enough, and she would not give him a farthing till she thought proper herself; so we took her before the justice; she denied it before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. So the man never got any of his money?</p>
               <p>Addey. No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 2, Angel-alley, White-chapel. On Tuesday night, the 24th of November, before twelve o'clock, I was at the Pavilion theatre—I was returning home to my lodging—I turned into Angel-alley, and in the alley I met the prisoner—I knew her before, but was never in her company—she asked me to give her some money—I told her I had got none to give her—she then hit me in the lip with her fist, then put her hand in my bosom, and took my purse out—there was no money in it—it was a blue purse, with white stripes on it—I turned back to go a different way home, to get out of her way—I did not strike her at all—she followed me, and hit me, at the corner of Osborne-street, across the nose and in the eye—she then undid the string of my bonnet, and threw me down in the mud—I did not fall from the blow—she threw me down when she hit me, to undo my bonnet, to take it off my head—she broke the string, and took it right off—she ran away, leaving me there—there were a good many people present when she ran away—she took my bonnet with her—I went home—I made no charge against her next day—I could not come out till Friday, because my face was so bruised—I came out on Friday, and saw her in Angel-alley—she spoke to me first, and began to abuse me again, calling me names—she did not strike me again—I then gave her in charge—I did not see any body present when she struck me and broke my bonnet-string—the bonnet had a feather in it—I have not seen the feather again—I had never spoken to her before, but I had seen her walking the street—my occupation and hers are the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Angel-alley. On Tuesday, the 24th of November, I had been to the Pavilion, and had a quartern of gin with the prosecutrix—we were both quite sober, I am certain—she left me to go home, just by the Pavilion, in Wnitechapel-road—I live in the same house with her, but in a different room—I came home about a quarter to one o'clock—Phillips was then at home, and crying—her face was bruised—she was saying when I came home, "Don't tell Mary Ann"—(she was afraid to tell me)—I said, "I don't want to know any of your secrets," but two or three minutes afterwards I asked her how it happened, and she sat down in a chair, burst out crying, and told me all about it—on the Tuesday night she had on a straw bonnet, lined with Persian silk, and the outside trimmed with velvet—I did not see that bonnet after she parted with me that night—I went out with her on the Friday follow<lb></lb>ing, and saw the prisoner standing in the alley—Phillips said, "That is the girl that stole my bonnet," loud enough for the prisoner to hear—the prisoner began to abuse her, and call her names—we walked down the court together, and saw a policeman at the bottom, and Phillips gave her in charge.</p>

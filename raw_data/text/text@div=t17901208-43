            ; I was sitting in my kitchen, about nine o'clock in the morning, the 17th of last month, the door was open; I had sent my daughter on an errand; the prisoner came in through a long garden into my parlour, immediately he went into a closet in the parlour, and took out these sheets, (the sheets produced) and put them into a leather bag, which was likewise in the closet; the publick house boy happening to come to the door for the pots; I went up stairs to give it him, and hearing a noise in the parlour, I immediately went in, and did not see any body; the stair case of the bed-chamber comes into the parlour, and looking up the stair case, there I saw the prisoner almost into my bed chamber; I screamed out immediately, and ran into the garden; my daughter coming back, and hearing me scream ran up stairs; as soon as we got into the garden, the prisoner came down the steps and told us, he was looking for a dyer; the neighbours came in and advised me to go back into the parlour, and see if I missed any thing; upon this I went into the parlour, and found these sheets packed up in this bag, which had before been in the closet, and they were found upon a trunk; my daughter secured the prisoner.</p>

In the month of August I had sent my steward and other servants to the Cape of Good Hope; in consequence of that I placed the same confidence in him as I should have done in my steward. On the 27th or 28th of September, I received an order, a note, from the Admiralty, saying when the sloop of war would be ready to receive me on board. In consequence of that I gave the prisoner an order to get all the goods packed up and sent to Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Among these articles were there any table cloths. A. There were table cloths, and I believe there were table cloths packed up, but whether they were packed up I do not know, I certainly meant them to be packed up.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mention table cloths, but your order included them and napkins, and every thing that you intended to be sent to the Cape. - A. I included every thing but three beds and linen; it was in consequence of a very hurried state I desired every thing should be packed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an order given respecting wine. - A. There was, the prisoner was to pack up some wine also for the Cape.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time these articles were packed up. - A. I saw them in the cart which was to convey them to the waggon office in Warwick lane; there were thirty-two packages to be sent to Warwick lane, and ten to be sent to the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you left this country did you leave any wine in your house. - A. I left this country the first week in December for Ireland. I cannot recollect the exact time I was last in the cellar, but when I was last in the cellar I did leave wine in it; there ought to be wine in the cellar when I left this country.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner the key of your lordship's cellar. A. When I was packing up I sent for my wine merchant, Mr. Harrison, directing him to send me some man to pack up some wine; during that time I entrusted the prisoner with the key of the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave it in his possession during the time you were absent in Ireland. - A. I cannot be positive, there were two keys of the cellar, one was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether you had left the other key you are not certain. - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing particular occur at the time they were counted. - A. I found the prisoner was not very correct in numbering the packages; he asked me particularly why I counted them twice over, and then he asked the carman about the packages.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when he counted them whether he made them greater or less than you made them. - A. He made them less.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me how many. - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any directions on them packages. - A. On all; some to my lord Caledon, and some to Mr. Dupree Alexander.</p>
               <p>Q. When lord Caledon was in Ireland, after he left London, did you see whether any of these packages were brought back to my lord's house. - A. The very next day after my lord's departure I saw some of them brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. How many was brought back. - A. One, the prisoner himself brought it back in a hackney coach.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing done to these packages when they were brought home. - A. The locks were entirely wrenched off after they were brought home.</p>

               <p>Q. I mean after the boxes were broke, and when the locks were broken off, did you see the contents. - A. I saw some wine and some wearing apparel, and some perfumery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any cambric. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect his coming to the Oxford Arms with the last witness any time, and when. - A. He came on the 30th of October to our inn and brought thirty-two packages.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those packages delivered to your care. - A. They were.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect in what manner they were directed. - A. Some were directed, Lord Caledon, Cape of Good Hope, and some of them, Mr. Alexander, by the same conveyance as lord Caledon.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see the prisoner at the bar. - A. Either one or two days afterwards he gave a general order to stop the goods, until a further order from his lordship; the goods were not sent. In about ten or twelve days he then came in lord Caledon's name and demanded a part of the packages back. He at that time opened one box, and took out some boots and shoes and tied them up in a handkerchief, and took another trunk and put it in the coach, and ordered the coachman to drive to lord Caledon's house in Stretton street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other packages delivered to him at different times. - A. Eight more; they were all taken away in a coach, and ordered to be taken to lord Caledon's house.</p>

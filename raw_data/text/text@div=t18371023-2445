                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know the person behind Mr. Phillips? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was served with a subpoena to come here—he told me not to attend when the officer came; and afterwards when the solicitor's clerk came, he said I must go—I bought the property found at my house of the prisoner—I keep a livery-stable in Montague-mews, and am partner with a man</p>

               <p>of the name of Gullett—before that I was a sadler at Crediton, Devon<lb></lb>shire—I have kept livery-stables about three months—I had 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left me by my uncle—I bought 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property—when I got this glass and chairs, I paid him 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him a bill for the remainder on the 1st of September—it was all for furniture—when the officer came and found the property, and asked how I came by it, I said my uncle had left it with me for safety, merely to prevent his taking me into custody—he told me I was not bound to say any thing that would criminate myself—I did not then say he had brought them to my house—I said I bought them—he asked me how I became possessed of a box of plate?—I did not tell him my uncle had directed me to go to a hotel where I should get it—I went to a hotel to get it—I do not know that I told the officer that my uncle told me to keep it till he had determined what to do with it, but he did so—he searched me—he did not find in my pocket any £20 of Bank of England notes—he searched me at the station-house, and found 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sealed up in a letter, and the officer broke it open—I got it from the pri<lb></lb>soner—he told me I was to keep it till I had directions to deliver it to the party it was directed to—I did not tell the officer the date on which he gave it me—I did not say I had been acting very wrong—I did not say I wished I had never seen the money—on my way to Bow-street I said I had sold a great deal of property by the desire of my uncle—articles of furniture—I did not tell the officer I was sorry I had done it—I asked him whether he thought I should be remanded.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you afraid they would have remanded you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>I was rather—my uncle lived with his sister at Poplar at the time I sold the furniture—it was for that house that I sold it—it was the officer took the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me—this is the letter in which the three £20 notes were—I have kept it safe ever since—the letter is addressed to R. God<lb></lb>son, Esq.</p>

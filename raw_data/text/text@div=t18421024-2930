On the evening of the 12th of September, I went with the horse and cart and the goods—I had to go to several wharfs—on my way to the wharfs the prisoner came up to me in Cannon-street, and said I was to go back to the warehouse, Mr. Wignell wanted me, something about the bills was not right—he was to take care of the cart while I went back, and I was not to be gone many minutes—I drew up on one side of the road, and left the prisoner with the cart—I went back to my roasters', and saw Mr. Wignell—I told him what the prisoner had told me—I found it was all untrue—I went back with Mr. Wignell to Cannon-street—the horse, cart, and goods were gone—I did not hear any more of them till between eleven and twelve o'clock that night—some time after a communication was made to me by Goodwin—I went to the New Prison, Clerk en well, and I saw the prisoner among about fifty others—I immediately pointed him out—I am sure he is the man—it was twenty-five minutes to seven when I turned into Cannon-street.</p>

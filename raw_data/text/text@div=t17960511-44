               <p>Q. How lately before he came in had you seen the two watches? - A. I had left the parlour upon his knocking at the door to go to open it; they were hung over the mantle-piece in the fore parlour; the parlour-door is a little way in the passage, on the right-hand side, upon the same floor; I went to the back parlour and told her George Deadman wanted her, I did not stop with my mistress half a moment; when I came from my mistress, I met him near the fore parlour door, with his right-hand to his waistcoat-pocket, and his hat in his left-hand, I had left him in the passage close by the parlour door; I told him my mistress was coming, and he said he must speak to a man first; he went off, and opened the street-door, and pulled it to, but did not shut it; I went into the parlour a little behind my mistress, who was going into the fore parlour, I asked my mistress where the captain's gold watch was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he was gone, was it before you perceived the watches were missing? - A. Not a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. When you let him in did you shut the street door after him? - A. I shut the street-door after him; upon missing the watches I opened the door and he was got out of sight; I gave the alarm, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110108"></xptr>pursued him till I came into Francis-street, and I could not get any intelligence of which way he went; I got sight of him in Oxford street, opposite St. George's Market, and he turned into his lodgings in some court opposite St. George's Market; he did not see my his sister was with me, and she went to Mary-le bonne Watch-house and got a constable for me, his name is Macklin; Macklin, and his sister, went to his lodging, and I staid at the corner of the court, in Oxford-street, till he came out of the court; and I took him by the left arm, and a man of the name of Oliver collared him, but he got away, and Oliver took him again; he hit Oliver two or three times, and got away from him; I pursued him till he was in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he secured that day? - A. Yes; that was about a quarter after four in the afternoon; it was about half past one that he came to our house; he was taken the corner of James-street, in Oxford-street; there was nothing found upon him.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he taken there? - A. I look upon it the women to shelter him; it was a yellow watch as big again as my watch; upon that they took him out into the front room again, and I saw my life was in danger from the whole, and I gave it up; then I went down stairs, and stood in the passage of the house, and he had this knife in his hand, and said, will you stop me; I said, go like a thief as you are; and I was very glad when he was gone past me, for I had nobody to assist me, and then I lost sight of him.</p>

I left my shop about eight o'clock in the evening—the things were all in proper order, and the shop safely locked up—next morning I found the shop-door nailed up—I went in, and missed all the things mentioned—these articles produced were in the shop when I left the evening before, and were gone in the morning—the value of all I lost was about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

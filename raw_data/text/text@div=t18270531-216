            . I am a constable. On Thursday last I and Goddard went with a search-warrant to No. 15, Grafton-street - I found the female prisoner there; I said I had come to search for some notes, which had been stolen from an hotel; she appeared to be going to faint. I proceeded to search, and soon found these stays; I said,"Where did you get these?" she said, "I bought them at Mills';" I said, "Do you mean in St. Clement's church-yard?" she said Yes - that she gave 12s. for them; I said,"How did you pay for them?" she said in silver. I went into the bed-room, and between the bed and mattress found this silver snuff-box; I called her into the room, and said,"You seem to be a respectable woman - I expect you will be candid, and answer me - how did you become possessed of this box?" she said, "I know nothing about it;" I said,"Now - when you went to Mrs. Mills', to buy the stays, did you not give her a 10l. note to change, and tell her to write 'Mrs. Lee, No. 5, Dean-street,' on it?" she said, "Yes, I did;" I then said, "Now, was not your husband standing at the window at the time?" she said he was - and just after this the male prisoner came up, opened the door, and went into the front room; I said, "Your name is Taprell, is it not?" he said, "It is." I took him into the back room, where his wife and Mrs. France were, and said, "I have found this snuff-box between your bed and mattress, and expect you will tell me how you came by it, and there is a 10l. note your wife passed at Mrs. Mills', and you stood outside;" he then said, "Three weeks or a month ago I went to Exeter, to my mother, and she gave me this snuff-box and 20l.; the 10l. note was part of the money;" I found some promissory notes - he said he knew nothing about them. We then went in a coach; he said on the road, "If there was a boy standing at my side at Mills' window, he was not in my company;" I said, "Then you were alone"- he said Yes.</p>

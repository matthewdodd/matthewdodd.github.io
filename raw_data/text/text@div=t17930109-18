I had made him no promises nor threats; that was my master's bridle; he had a woman along with him; he said to her, do you go and get Mr. Kaye's bridle; she did not bring it to me, so I told her when I see her again at the justice's, that she had not done according to the prisoner's bargain; he told her again to fetch it, and I went with her and we found it under a barrel, she heaved the barrel up on one side and I picked it up from under the barrel, this barrel was just the outside of the back door, just at his sitting room; then I said to her, woman if you know of any thing else that is hid, I will be glad if you will tell me; she told me where a coulter was hid on my master's premises with an intent to take off, but it was not taken. The prisoner at the bar said at the justice's, that neither me nor my master should not be alive at New year's day to prosecute him; he had worked for me about five weeks as a hay maker; I had discharged him on Wednesday, but not on this affair, as I found this out on Saturday.</p>

When we came home to his own house he stowed this plow share into the place called the pantry, and puts some wood on it. On Monday morning I went to work again as usual, on Tuesday I went again as usual, and was taken with the fit of the ague, and have been bad ever since. When I went up to Bow-street Chine paid me the part of the weeks wages that was due to me. I have no witness here.</p>

The prisoner had been our porter a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lodge in the house? - A. No. The suspicion then fell upon the prisoner at the bar; I went, with Mr. Clarence and the watchman, to see if the prisoner was in bed; I knew where the prisoner lodged, we did not know the number of the house, it was in Cable-street, near Wellclose-square; we rapped at the door some little time; the prisoner, in the course of a little time, looked out of the window apparently in his shirt; Mr. Clarence told him, he wished to speak to him, or wished him to come down, I don't know rightly which; he then said he was not up; we waited there a considerable time, but the door was not opened; I waited about half an hour, and then I went away.</p>

               <p>Q. During the half hour that you waited, did you hear any thing in the house? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you go away for? - A. I went to inform Mrs. Clarence where Mr. Clarence was. When I came back, there were several watchman upon the ground floor, Mr. Clarence was up stairs. None of the goods were found in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I think you said this was between two and three o'clock in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he appeared in his shirt like a man; just out of bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Just as you would have done, if you had been called up in the night? - A. Yes; I saw nothing but just his arms and shoulders.</p>

             sworn. - I am a shopman belonging to the prosecutor: About a quarter past one on Wednesday morning, the 7th of March, I was called up by three rings at the door; I asked what was the matter; the watchman told me the warehouse door was open; and, in the warehouse, I found a slat basket filled with five pieces of Irish<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180036"></xptr>linen and six pieces of muslin handkerchiefs; I took up the basket, and looked at the Irishes; I immediately found they were of the best make and the highest prices; I suspected it must be somebody that knew the premises; I then went backwards to see if any thing was disturbed, and the handkerchiefs were taken out of the box in the back warehouse, and the lid shut down.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did the person get into the the warehouse? - A. By picking the locks of the street door, there were two locks and a latch; I was then asked to go to Billing's house; I did not go immediately; Mr. Clarence went to the house, I stopped in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was it before you went to the prisoner's house? - A. About three quarters of an hour. On entering the room on the first floor, I saw a constable and Mr. Clarence searching, I saw them take up a muslin shawl from a box which stood by the bedside; Billing's wife was in bed at the same time; the shawl appeared to be our's; there was a girl in bed on the other-side, and the wife said, you need not take that shawl, for it is that young woman's. Mr. Clarence asked me if I thought it was our shawl, I said, I believed it was; we took the shawl, and told the young woman if it was her's, she should have it again; she disowned the shawl being her's afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon examining the shawl, it turned out to he your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner dressed then? - A. Partly dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his appearance? - A. His shirt was all over foot and dirt, and both his hands and face were footy. We then made further search, and found a piece of Corsa muslin, it is an India muslin which goes by the name of Corsa, and some remnants of Irish; afterwards we searched under the bed, and found some remnants of bed-furniture tied up under the bed, in a little bundle, between the sacking and the bed, and some other things, which I do not now recollect; the bed-furniture was printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else besides what you have stated? - A. Some other things, which will be produced. The next morning I got up early, about six o'clock, and found Mr. Clarence there, and Mr. Fox the constable; I then went up stairs, and found some few things, which we had no doubt were our's; we then went down stairs into the cellar, and under the chamber stairs, going down, we found a green vellum-coloured book, a writing-book, lodged on the bearers of the stairs, in which we used to keep an account of the goods we bought; we then went down the cellar, and searched the cellar thoroughly, and found nothing; but, on going up stairs, I found in some dust a shawl, which proved to be our shawl, with my own mark upon it. I then gave it into the custody of Tipper, a constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner respecting the articles then found? - A. I told him the things appeared much against him, he said he knew no more about it than a new born child; but he said he never took any of the goods, except the few remnants of cotton that were found under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. Is there not some other persons concerned in the firm, besides those gentlemen? - A. No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it, of your own knowledge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this man came down stairs, there would have been ample opportunity to remove the things, if he had been so desirous to do? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: My box was close to the door of Mr. Atkinson's warehouse. Just before one o'clock of the 7th of March, I saw two men walking backwards and forwards, and while they were walking, the clock struck one; I went my best as fast as I possibly could, and I ran all the way back as quick as possible; when I came to my box, which is at the corner of the house, I met a man, I said, pray what do you do here.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that one of the men that had been walking backwards and forwards? - A. Yes. He made me no answer; I got immediately to the warehouse door, and I found it open; while I was going to the door, he ran off, as fast as possibly he could, across the field; I called stop thief; it being rather dark, he was soon out of my sight; I called to Box, another watchman, that was close by, to stand at the door, while I alarmed Mr. Clarence; and when they got up, we went into the warehouse; there we found a large basket, with those things in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you saw a man, and you asked him what he did there? - A. I did; he made me no answer at all. I went afterwards to the prisoner's house; I saw the prisoner look out of the window, and answer Mr. Clarence.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at the prisoner, was he the person that made you no answer, when you said,"what do you do here?" - A. I think he was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if I understand you right, you believe the prisoner was the person, but you will not swear it positively? - A. I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your observation to Mr. Clarence, that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you wait at the door? - A. Near three quarters of an hour. I heard people stirring about the house; after we had been there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180037"></xptr>about three quarters of an hour, we saw a cellar window; the door was not opened at all; this cellar window Mr. Clarence found, there was no fastening to it; we opened the window, and got in; we went up stairs, and we searched the house above and below; the constable and Mr. Clarence stood at the door to see that nobody got out; we went backwards, and searched the necessary; we were looking to find the prisoner; at last we were coming into the kitchen, and Harry came in where the pork was, we asked him where he had been, and he made no answer; we suspected he had got over the pales, and on my getting over the pales, they were five or six feet high, I saw something lay upon the Jews necessary-seat; then we searched the necessary on Harry's side with a stick, but could not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the first visit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing besides what you found yourself? - A. I saw many of the things found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person find any thing? - A. Yes; Box took hold of many things.</p>
               <p>Q. State what they were like, were they in bundles, or open? - A. Open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said to the prisoner about them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his examination taken in writing before the Magistrate? - A. Yes; certainly it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. One man you could positively swear to? - A. There was no man I could positively swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe them both to the prosecutors? - A. Yes; one had a blue coat on.</p>
               <p>- Box sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 7th of March, about one o'clock in the morning, the watchman came to me, and said, for God's take come over the way; I ran as hard as I could, and found the warehouse door open; and when we went in, there was a large basket by the warehouse door. We then went to the prisoner's house, and we knocked a long time; Mr. Clarence called Harry, I want to speak to you; we were there three quarters of an hour, before we got into the house; we got in at the cellar window; we found a muslin shawl on a box in the prisoner's bed room, and a piece of Irish; Mr. Clarence found them; as fast as he found them, he gave them to me. There was some bed furniture found between the the bed and the sacking; I have kept them ever since. There were a great many things; I cannot speak to them particularly; a piece of muslin, a shawl, and bed-furniture. (The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hayward.) How do you know that shawl? - A. If you examine that shawl it is cut crooked from what we generally cut them, and this shawl exactly matches with what we have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, you can swear that to be the property of your masters? - A. I will undertake to do it. This is the bed-furniture that was found between the bed and sacking.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the furniture he said he had taken from his master? - A. These are the pieces that he said he had taken out of the rag-tub.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that book, is that the book he said he had taken? - A. This is the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any of your writing in it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any of Mr. Clarence of Mr. Atkinson's writing in it? - A. No. I have seen the book before, and I will undertake to swear to it.(A coloured shawl shewn to the witness). This has my private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say a single muslin shawl was found in the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it cut apart from that piece? - A Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the remainder? - A. It was packed up in a box to go to Barbadoes, but it did not go.</p>
               <p>Q. That has been cut? - A. Yes; from the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any private mark upon that which was found in the prisoner's house? - A. No. I packed those four into the box.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that has not been fold? - A. I will undertake to say that we never sold but one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you packed it, there were only four? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know it was never sold? - A. I know it because it was never brought into the retail shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it? - A. By the manner it was cut, for no man in our shop would have cut it off in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that that shawl, which you found in the dust, was never sold? - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. These people came to the door and knocked, I jumped out of the bed, and went down immediately; before I got down they were in; I ran down stairs without breeches on; they broke into the cellar window, it was hooked upon a chain; and when I came down, Mr. Box went towards a place that was closed, and he took a piece of print, he said he took it from the necessary; they opened the drawer where I kept my money, and they took out fifteen shillings. I bought some of the things in the fair, and some at the door. If I had meant to be a thief to my master, I could have robbed him of thousands and thousands of pounds; I lived with him about a year and a half before, and then I lived with him again.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180038"></xptr>The watchman said before the Lord-Mayor, the other person was the man, but when he found he could not lay hold of that man, he got hold of me. There was a woman that laid in the same room that night, and that shawl she brought in, but before the Lord-Mayor the said it was not her's.</p>
               <p>Eight witnesses were called, who said they had known the prisoner from three to eight years, and gave him a very good character.</p>

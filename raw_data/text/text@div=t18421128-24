                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Grafton-street, Soho, in the parish of St. Ann, Westminster; Sutherland had been occasionally in my em<lb></lb>ploy for about two years, I have seen Freegrove in the neighbourhood. On the 19th of Nov. I was watching my house, from the front room of the Brown Bear, which is exactly opposite, and about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning, I perceived Sutherland enter my private door—I presume he got in with a latch-key—the door was on the latch when I left it, about ten, as I have lodgers—I should say, decidedly, it was not open before I saw him go in—he shut the door after him, apparently—I then went down to the street-door of the Brown Bear, and, in consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion from the landlady, I went into the street, and saw Sutherland, within about three paces of my private door—I seized him, and saw Freegrove within about five paces—I rather think he was standing still—I was disguised, and they did not seem to suspect it was me—they were taken to the station, and on Sutherland was found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper, and 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, including a bad crown-piece and bad sixpence, a franc, and other money—I had a bad crown and sixpence among my silver—I had marked some of the money myself the previous evening—the franc was marked—it was my money—the copper was tied in four separate papers, with my mark on them—I had left the silver in a drawer behind the counter, and the copper on the counter—I went into my house, and found the partition shutter between the shop and passage forced from its place—on Freegrove was found Sutherland's shoes, and Su<lb></lb>therland bad no shoes on nor stockings.</p>

               <p>the shutter further—I have missed money many times before, and the shutter has always been put back—the lodgers have keys to the private door—I cannot say that no lodger had come out after I left, as I took a circuitous route before I went to the Brown Bear,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I was on duty in Grafton-street on the morning of the 19th, and about one o'clock saw Freegrove come down to<lb></lb>wards Mr. Cowderoy's house, and turn into Litchfleld-street and King-street—he came back the reverse-way, towards the prosecutor's house—I followed him to King-street, and at the end of the street I heard him whistle, near Cowderoy's house—I returned to Grafton-street to meet him, but he went</p>
               <p>towards Seven-dials, and got nearly out of sight—in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I heard a call of "Police," and found Sutherland in Mr. Cowde<lb></lb>roy's charge—I took him and searched him at the station, and found two packages of copper in one pocket, and a ludfer-box of matches, a knife, and a key which I found opened the prosecutor's door—I found nothing on Freegrove, but knew him to be the same person who whistled, and went round the prosecutor's house—I saw a pair of shoes found on him, and Sutherland had no shoes.</p>

                  </hi>. I searched Freegrove, and found one shoe In each coat pocket—I asked him, in Sutherland's presence, whose shoes they were—he said, "They are his," pointing to Sutherland, who had none on—next morning Sutherland asked ma for the shoes, to walk to the police-court, saying they were his.</p>
               <p>(James Reid, saddler, of Morrmonth-street; Thomas Welsh, of Earl-street; James Payne, Earl-street, Seven-dials; and John Dawson, Broad-street, gave Sutherland a good character.)</p>

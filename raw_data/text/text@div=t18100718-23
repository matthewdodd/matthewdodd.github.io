I lost things every day belonging to the country gentlemen; I denied my servants going out without asking my leave, that I might ascertain the thief. On the 20th of June I saw the prisoner in Newgate-street; I followed her home and questioned her where she had been; she said she had been for thread; I asked her where the thread was; she had none; she then said she had been to Mrs. Faulkener's. My daughter and the constable went to Mrs. Faulkener's; the prisoner said, I will go up first; my daughter said, no; the prisoner ran away; my daughter returned with some of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner return to your house - A. No; the constable took her. This bonnet was left in my house in the waiter's care, till the person called for it, I saw it in my house; there is two silk handkerchiefs of mine; this silk handkerchiefs I swear to, it is my own, it is worth five shillings.</p>
               <p>- CRESWELL. I found this new silk handkerchief and another under the prisoner's arm when I took her in the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found that handkerchief in a room next line coach-office. I know they found the two towels upon me, I put them in my pocket, I meaned to return them; the bonnet is not my mistress's, nor any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180014"></xptr>body in the house. I do not know that I wronged my mistress of two pence. The handkerchiefs were wrapped up in a bit of paper, and finding it in a public place I thought I had a right to it as well as any other person.</p>

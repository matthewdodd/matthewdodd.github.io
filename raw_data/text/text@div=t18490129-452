                  </hi>. I live at 76, Cornhill, in the house of Mrs. Louisa Heppel—she does not reside in it—my wife carries on the business for her, and I reside in the house—the servants are under my control—I sleep in the third-floor front room—on the 4th Jan., I had occasion to go up to that room; it was kept locked—I took the key up in my hand—when I got to the door I found it standing ajar, and the prisoner standing in the room in front of the chest of drawers—the bottom drawer was kept locked—I found it had been forced open, the bolts of the lock still projected—I found a gown and a shawl on the floor—they had before been in the drawer—I laid bold of the prisoner, and called for the police—he got from me, but he was stopped on the first-floor—he got away again, and he fell at the bottom of the stairs, and was taken by the policeman—I went up-stairs again, and found these two instruments where the prisoner had been standing—I examined the drawer, it had been opened by such an instrument as this—the gown and shawl were my wife's.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see your wife put these things away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know they were put away—it is just possible I might put them into the drawer myself—I was the last that left the room that morning—I had had the key in my possession—I left the room about ten minutes to nine o'clock—I put the key on the mantel-piece in the ice-room—I was in that room, and in the shop which communicates with it, till half-past twelve, when I went up-stairs and found you there—my wife had not been up-stairs, and had not had the key—no one had it till I went up, and took the key in my hand—when I left the room in the morning there was nothing on the floor.</p>

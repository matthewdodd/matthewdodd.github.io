On the 7th of February the prisoner Johnson came to the shop and asked for employment - I merely answered No; in about ten minutes Wildes came in, and asked the same question - I was in the act of answering him, when he placed his hand upon a coat which was on a chair before the counter, and made off with it - I flew to the door and called Stop thief! or something to that effect; I returned to the shop; the coat and Wildes were brought back - Johnson had left before Wildes took it.</p>

            . I live in Arbour-square, Commercial-road. On the night of the 7th of February, I heard the alarm - I saw Wildes running; I pursued, and he was stopped in my night - I laid hold of him and he threw down this coat, which I produce; I took him and the coat back to the shop - on his way to the station he said if he had got clear off with it, he should have pawned it, and he intended to go on the tramp - Johnson followed us all the way; I asked what he wanted, and he said he had as much to do with the coat as the other, for they were both acting together.</p>

               <p>BARTHOLOMEW SCANDLAN. I am a patrol of Castle Baynard ward. On the morning of the 10th of May I saw Mr. Dobbs' counting-house; the window was broken in, and I saw some glass laying on the ground; I saw a light, and heard a whispering - I looked through the shutters, and saw two men turning the papers over, and throwing them on the ground; I went for assistance, and the watchman came - I opened the shutters, and jumped in at the window - I took one of the prisoners by the collar, and put him out at the window to the watchman; I looked for the other - he hid himself for some time, and then got out of the window - I found on Jones a towel, some steel pens, some halfpence, a stick of Sealing-wax, and two or three keys; all the lower part of the sash was broken, and this instrument was standing against the window; I believe the shutters had been forced by this - the door was fast.</p>

               <p>Jones. Q. Did not I come up the wharf when one of your people struck us? A. No, he jumped out of the window while we were looking for him, and began to beat the watchman who had charge of White, whom I had put out of the window.</p>
               <p>DANIEL MONAHAN. I am a watchman. I went to the counting-house, and White was taken under the desk - Jones was looked for, but he got out of the window;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170069"></xptr>there was no other way of getting in but by the window; the place was secure in all other respects.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MOORE. I am a watchman. I took charge of White when he was put out of the window by Scandlan and in a very few minutes Jones was coming out of the window, and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL WILSON. I was constable of the night. I saw the things which were found on Jones - these are them.</p>

               <p>Jones' Defence. I and this young man were drinking on the over night till past two o'clock in the morning - we were locked out, and went down a wharf to go on board a barge; we heard a rattle spring, and went up: the watchman met us, and struck this man on the head -I struck the watchman again, and Scandlan put these things into my hat, which he picked up from the wharf; he has often said he would do for me.</p>

On the 19th of April I lost this money - I had taken the money out of my till all but two sixpences - I and my wife went to dinner, and the prisoner came into the shop; my wife went and served him with a halfpenny-worth of apples - I heard her ask him why he came into the shop without rapping, this induced me to go into the shop; I looked into the till and missed the two sixpences - no other person had been in the shop - I followed the prisoner, who had got about a hundred yards - I took him and brought him back, and accused him of taking the two sixpences - he denied having anything but a shilling, which he had been in my shop before to get changed - I saw a policeman going by - I called him in, and the two sixpences fell from the bottom of the prisoner's trousers.</p>

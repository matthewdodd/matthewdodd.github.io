               <p>Q. Did he mention Mr. Crew's Name?</p>
               <p>Crowther. I mention'd that Mr. Crew had lost 15 Brace of Pheasants from Farnham-Royal , and he then owned that himself and Brown took them out of the Pens, and that he held the Bag while Brown put them into it. He likewise said, that he went that Way some Time ago, and heard the Cock Pheasants crow, which brought him to the Pens now. That he brought 9 only out of the 30 alive to Town, and had fed them with Bread and Meat at the Cart and Horse in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Thomas Green. On the 16th of Dec. the two Prisoners came to my Master, Mr. Lipscomb's Shop in St. James's Market, and offer'd 6 Pheasants for Sale. I had before this seen an Advertisement of some Pheasants that had been lost, upon which I charg'd a Constable with them, and carried them before Mr. Deveil, who committed them to the Gatehouse for farther Examination.</p>

               <p>Green. To the best of my Knowledge it was the tall Man in the Wig, that is Brown, and he told me he bred them himself. I imagined at first that these were the Earl of Essex's Pheasants, therefore I went to his Lordship's House, but he not being at Home, we took the Pheasant-Keeper with us, and went directly before Mr. Deveil, and before we got there, Brown contradicted what he had told me, and said he bought the Pheasants on the Road.</p>
               <p>Q When Brown was before Mr. Deveil did he confess any Thing?</p>
               <p>Green. Not that I heard. Davis confessed that he stole them, and said they were not my Lord Essex's, but Mr. Crew's.</p>

A Day or two afterwards there came full Evidence of both Robberies, and I then had the Prisoners again before me. Davis then confessed Mr. Crew's Robbery, and describ'd the Place in such a manner, that it was known to be Farnham Royal, and discover'd the Poulterers where the Pheasants were sold.</p>

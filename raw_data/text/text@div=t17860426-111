               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Thwaites, No. 106, High-Holborn. On Monday the 7th of November, in the evening, between five and six, Mr. Thwaites sent me with his cart to deliver some goods at Mr. Gibson's, <placeName id="t17860426-111-crimeloc507">Barbican</placeName>

               <p>On Monday the 7th of November, between five and six in the evening, and Mr. Thwaites cart was at the door, I heard Bradley cry out, there are six pieces of prints gone; Mr. Nicholson ran after him; I ran into Golden-lane, expected him to come that way, and there I saw the two boys scuffling with the prisoner, when I got within fifteen or twenty yards of him, I saw the boy fall down; he was making his escape; I ran after him, and laid hold of him as fast as I could; he said, I will shoot you; he put a pistol to my face, and the fire came into my face; I called for assistance; the two boys said to me, that is him; I saw him drop the goods; the prisoner was on the spot; it was just as I had laid hold of him that the pistol snapped in my face; I tried to secure his arms, and cried out, for God's sake assist me, he has more; he gave a plunge, and threw the pistol away; there were two or three came up, and he was taken to the constable and secured; I desired the constable to take care of him, I expected he would be rescued, he looked about for his cutlass, but could not find it; I was near half an hour in the house with him; I went out through the croud and called the patrol, and desired the patrol to come and bring his cutlass with him; the patrol came; my wife was very much frightened, and I stepped in to let her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260179"></xptr> know I was not hurt; and I heard a shout that he had acted the part of harlequin.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know his person to a certainty? - Yes, my Lord, I should know him from five thousand; I looked at his face, and pulled off his hat once or twice, and I looked at his hands, and said, how do you get your living my friend, he said, he was a watchmaker; I said, you work very hard, you have a nice soft hand; the prints were brought to my house, either Tuesday or Wednesday; I sent Mr. Nicholson, to deliver them to Mr. Lieffe.</p>
               <p>Did any of Mr. Thwaite's people see the prints? - Nobody but but Bradley; I had seen the prints at Mr. Thwaite's and I knew them to be Mr. Thwaite's; they were not untied at all; I have seen them loose at Mr. Thwaite's, but they are easily distinguished; I could see them very plain; they were only tied round with a cord; I am sure they were Mr. Thwaite's property.</p>

               <p>Was he down? - No, he was standing up; he d - d me, and told me he would shoot me; upon which I was frightened, and I let him go; he had not got above fifteen yards, before Mr. Gibson and a brewer's servant got hold of him.</p>

               <p>I heard the cry of stop thief; I run, and saw a man running with some things in his arms; he tried to get into a house, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260180"></xptr> could not get in, and he dropped the things; I tried to lay hold of him, and he threw me down.</p>
               <p>Did you see him afterwards stopped? - Yes, Mr. Gibson stopped him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the man that Mr. Gibson stopped, was the man that dropped the goods? - Yes, Sir, I am.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have been convicted by the Jury, on the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, of the offence charged in the indictment, that offence is not so described in point of law, as to make it capital to affect your life; but as you endeavoured to take away the life of a person, I think no sentence, that the law authorises the Court to pass upon you, is too severe; which is <rs id="t17860426-111-punish509" type="punishmentDescription">

               that you be transported to Africa, for the term of seven years
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court. In the first place, Mr. Gibson's situation put him out of the necessity of receiving any other recompence for his very meritorious conduct, than the thanks and approbation of the Court and the publick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibson. I do not desire any other, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Let these two boys have forty shillings apiece, and the other witnesses the common allowances.</p>

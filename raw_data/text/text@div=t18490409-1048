                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 267). On the night of 14th Jan. I was on duty in Bermondsey-street, and about half-past two o'clock in the morning, on passing by the prisoner's shop, I heard a crackling noise—I put my head to the door, and smelt-fire—I looked through the key-hole, and saw a light at the far end of the shop—the house is at the corner of a passage called Sugar-loaf court, up which is a side-door—I went to that door, and found it open—I then went part of the way up-stairs, and alarmed the inmates, a great many of whom came down in great confusion—I came out, sprang my rattle, got assistance, and sent for the engines—I then returned, and broke open a door leading from the foot of the stairs into the back-parlour, where the pri<lb></lb>soners slept; that door was fastened by a chain inside—I could not get in, there was so much smoke—about two minutes afterwards I saw John Scollard come out from a back-gate leading into the yard—a back-door opens from that yard into the parlour—there are three doors into that parlour, one leading into the shop, one into the passage, and one into the yard—John Scollard bad on his trowsers, waistcoat, and stockings, and his coat over his arm; he came into the street, rubbing his eyes, and took no notice of me; he might hare seen me; I was near him, and it is a very narrow court—I beard a cry of "Fire!" in the back-parlour—I went through the yard, and fetched one of the lodgers out, and then I kept at the front-door till the engine came—about four in the morning I went into the cellar, and saw the remains of some burnt wood there; it was not then burning, but had been lately—there was no smoke—I saw William Scollard in the back-parlour about four, before I went into the cellar.</p>

               <p>this fire—I went there, and entered the house directly—the shop-door was open; I went into the shop—I seat a man before me, to break open the back-door, to let the smoke out—I have a note, which I made at the time, of the state of the shop: (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—" Some empty tubs, shop-fittings, and things burnt, and some loose fire hanging about: under part of the stairs, and partition burnt; front-shop and back-parlour scorched; egg-chests, and some straw in cellar burnt; two. distinct fires"—that is the note that was furnished to the Fire-office next morning—I examined the tubs; they were butter-firkins; there might be twenty or thirty of them; they were all empty—I saw four half firkins on the other side of the counter; they were partly fell of butter—the empty firkins were standing on their heads on each other, and there was a little butter, about half an inch thick, on the heads; there was a little layer of butter on the beads of the uppermost ones, which I could observe; the prisoner, John Scollard, drew my attention to that—I had asked him what trade he was, and where his butter was, and he said, "What do you call that?" pointing to the head of those casks—the principal part of the shop had been burnt, under the stairs, and some empty firkins; it was not burnt through, not consumed; the flooring was not burnt; the fire had not spread over the whole of the shop, only the partition, and under the stairs—these stairs started from the street-door and came into the shop—there is a recess under the stairs in the shop; the wood was burnt there—the door leading from the shop to the back-room was open, and there is a door that leads from the back-room into the yard—I ordered that door to be opened, to let the smoke out; I suppose it was shut at the time, I did not see it—the fur<lb></lb>niture and the partition in the back-parlour were severely scorched—there was a bed on the right-hand side, and a sofa under the window—the flooring was not burnt at all—I went into the yard, where there is a trap-door opening into the cellar; it was partly open, and there was a great body of smoke coming from it—I stooped, and saw a glimmer of light; I did not go down—a man named Wilkinson went down by my orders, and I went down a very few minutes after—there was a great deal of water in the cellar, which we had thrown in, and some burnt boards between two uprights, which I took: to be egg-chests broken up—the cellar is right under the shop—from what I observed I am positive the fire in the cellar, and that in the shop, were two distinct and separate fires—I should say, from the appearance, there was only fire in one place in the cellar—the flooring of the shop was not burnt—the fire in the cellar could not have fallen through from the shop; there was not the least cavity—I saw John Scollard in Bermondsey-street, between three and four, and asked him if he was the occupier—he said, "No," his brother William was—I afterwards went into the shop, and William and John were both pointed out to me as the occupiers—I asked William Scollard what office he was insured in—he told me some office over London-bridge, he could not tell me the name, and produced a receipt of his insurance—I said, "Why you are insured for 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "Yes"—I asked what he celled himself—he said he was an egg and butter-merchant, and pointed to the butter, as I stated before—they were both present—I said, "Where are your eggs?"—one of my men pointed out to me, and said, "Master, here are some," and took three out of the shop-window—I said, "Are these all you have got?"—he said, "I am rather short at this time of year"—the fire had not extended to the shop-window—I then said, "Where is your butter?"—John Scollard said, "There were forty firkins before the fire happened"—I said, "Where are they then?"—he pointed to the little butter on the heads of</p>

               <p>the casks—I said, "Is that all? I could eat all that"—I then sounded the tubs, and found them all empty—I asked William Scollard for his policy—he said he could not find it, and it was then he produced the receipt—all the stock I saw was the part of four firkins, except four, five, or six pounds in the cellar at the foot of the stairs, and that had no business there—there was a little straw in the cellar, but there was so much water that I could not see it then—there was a very thun skim of butter in the cellar, not thicker than a wafer; there was no butter in the shop, or any sign of any having been there—I made a hole in the shop, to let the water through into the cellar, and there was butter on the surface of that water as thin as a wafer; I should think a very few pounds indeed would have made that appearance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Fire-brigade.

               <p>burnt—the cellar did not appear to have been used as a coal-cellar—there were no signs of coal except those pieces—the flooring under the stain was charred and burnt, and some old tubs on the shelves in the shop, that was, I should say, nearly three feet from the fire underneath—the fire in the back-parlour was occasioned from the fire in the shop, because the door was open—I saw four half firkins of butter on the right side of the shop, and about 10lbs. or 12lbs. of butter in a half-firkin at the bottom of the stairs in toe cellar—I saw some empty firkins standing upside down.</p>

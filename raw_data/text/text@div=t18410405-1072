                  </hi>. I am in the employ of a town carman. On the 5th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was em<lb></lb>ployed to carry some cheeses to Harrison's wharf—they were the property of John Green and another—they were in a close cart, which had a tilt over <hi rend="italic">it</hi>—I believe there were forty-one cheeses in one lot and twenty in another—I saw the prisoner behind my cart, and the tilt was removed—I went on to the Dublin steam-wharf, and saw the prisoner again behind the cart—he made a rush and ran—I pursued and collared him—I never lost sight of him—he had this cheese with him—I looked into the cart, and missed one cheese, and this one tallies with the one I lost.</p>

I was standing at the horse's head when the cheese was taken out of the cart—I saw the carman ran behind the cart very quickly, I followed him, he cried out, "Police "—I said, "Here I am"—he said, "I charge this man with stealing this cheese"—it laid at his feet, and the witness had hold of his collar.</p>

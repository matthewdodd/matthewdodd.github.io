               <p>Q. Where was you with these women?</p>

               <p>Mynet. Yes, they were; I was a little in liquor, and I suppose we were all middlingly in drink.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were in drink, how can you remember this?</p>
               <p>Mynet. I was not so much in liquor but that I could very well remember what they did - I found Dixon in the house of office in the lost above.</p>

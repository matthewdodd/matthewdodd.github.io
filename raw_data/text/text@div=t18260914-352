            . I heard of the prosecutrix being robbed - and on the 25th of the watchman brought Bryan to me, with the prosecutrix - she said in his presence, "This is one of the boys who robbed me last night of the tablecloths" - I said, "Are you sure of that?" - she said, Yes, and she knew the others, and mentioned their names - I then asked, if he was the boy who took it out of her hand - she said, "No, but he ran away with it." - I did not lock him up, but sent her to get the others; and in the morning, from information Bryan gave me, I went and took Norman and Oliver out of bed - Bryan was with me, and said, in their presence, "It was Norman took the bundle from Mrs. Connor, and threw it down the tinker's cellar" - Oliver and Norman said Bryan took it - Connor said, in their presence, that they were the boys who took it, and they did not deny it, but said the tinker had the property; I did not see the prosecutrix on the night of the robbery - her husband told me, the boys' parents had been and made it up.</p>

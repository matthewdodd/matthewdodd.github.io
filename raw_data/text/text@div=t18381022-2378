                  </hi>. On the 15th of October, about ten minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner by the door of Mr. Weston, who keeps a cook-shop next door to me, with a piece of boiled beef under hit arm—suspecting he did not come honestly by it, I went and asked Mrs. Weston if she had sold him a piece of beef—she said she had not—the pri<lb></lb>soner walked away with it—Mrs. Weston came to the door and I pointed the prisoner out to her—he threw the beef down and ran away—I hallooed "Stop thief"—my son ran after him and stopped him—he was brought back directly by the policeman—he is the man I saw throw down the beef.</p>

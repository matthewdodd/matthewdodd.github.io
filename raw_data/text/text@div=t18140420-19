I have let the room where I used to sleep; I have put up a bureau-bedstead in the shop, and mean to sleep in the shop when the weather is warm. I intended to sleep there again on the day of the robbery, but there was no bed there. On the 9th of February, I quitted my house about seven o'clock; I locked my door when I went out. I returned about ten o'clock; I found my door broken open. When I came to look and examine my room, I found two pictures framed and glazed gone, one was a painting the Prince of Wales, the other the Circumcision of Christ; I also missed an iron cast boiler with a brass cock, a few loose bolts and hinges, that were hanging upon the boiler.</p>

I asked him what his name was; he told me his name was Gray. I then told him I apprehended him on a charge of breaking open Mrs. Pegram's house, and stealing pictures, a boiler, and other things. He said he knew nothing about it. I then asked him whether he had not pledged a picture in that neighbourhood. We were then in Brick-lane, close to the pawnbroker's house. He said he never pledged any picture at all. We took him to the office.</p>

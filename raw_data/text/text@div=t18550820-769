                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of No. 2, Nassau-place, Commercial-road. On Saturday, 30th June, about 8 o'clock in the evening, Williams came to my shop, dressed as a respectable common sailor—he asked to look at some common white shirts; my wife served him with two shirt and a silk handkerchief, they came to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he paid me by a supposed to be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he placed it on the counter, and asked for change—I examined it, and requested my wife to get it changed—she took it away for that purpose, and returned in about five minutes, with the note and five sovereigns—I requested Williams to put his name upon the note, be said he could not write—my wife had the pen close to her, and wrote his name on it, John Williams, and said, "What ship my man?"—he said, "The <hi rend="italic">Autumnus</hi>. not a ship, a barque"—my wife wrote that down in my presence—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in change, and he left—the note was returned to me as forged on 2nd July—I saw Williams again on 5th July, at Worship-street, and knew him, but he was very much disguised—when he came to me he had a pair of large whiskers, a blue Guernsey shirt, a pair of blue trowsers, and a cap; at Worship-street, he had on a hat, a coat, and a pair of black trowsers; he was there in a large room with a quantity of other persons, and the other prisoner—the police<lb></lb>man asked me if I saw any one there that I had seen before, and I said, "Yes, that man there"—he said, "Which of them?"—I said, "The little one," and pointed him out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Dennis, grocers, in Church-street, Hackney. About 8 o'clock on Wednesday evening, 4th July last, Williams came to the shop—he first asked for a pound of tea, I served him with it—he then asked for a pound of coffee, and afterwards for four pounds of loaf sugar, the goods amounted to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me a supposed to be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he took it out of a pocket book, I did not notice where he took the pocket book from—during the time I was serving him, there being nobody else in the shop, I had a little con<lb></lb>versation with him—he described himself as an Australian gold digger, and was telling me about his being rather fortunate in one place, and unfortunate in another—I dare say he kept me serving him pretty well a quarter of an hour—he did not talk much about Australia—he said he did not like the country much, there was a very rough lot about—he said, "I made a good deal of money, but not so much as I might have done"—this was while I was serving him, and then he produced the note—I examined it by the feel of the paper, and did not like it—I then examined it. and found the signature of H. Back to it—there had been a letter in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> a few days before about notes with that signature, and I tried to recollect myself, and went up stairs to Mr. William Dennis—I asked him what the name was that had been advertised—I did not show him the note,</p>

               <p>I had it in my hand, but he did not look at it—I merely said, "Here is one of the forged notes"—I then returned into the shop, and found Wells stand<lb></lb>ing by the side of Williams—he had come into the shop just at the time I was going in doors to speak to Mr. Dennis, and just as he entered the door he called out for a pound of <hi rend="italic">pic nics</hi>. and said, "I am in a hurry"—we have some biscuits called <hi rend="italic">pic nics</hi>—when I returned into the shop I found him standing by the side of Williams—I walked in front of the counter, and asked Williams if he knew what he had given me—Wells was close enough to near what I said—Williams replied, "Yes, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I said it is not a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; in fact, it is not a note at all"—I then walked behind the counter, and laid the note flat on the counter, thinking him to be an innocent look<lb></lb>ing man by his face, to show him the signature of H. Back, and I said, "This is not the signature of the note, because it is J. Ferraby"—Williams looked at the signature, and just at the time Wells looked over his shoulder at the note—I was not holding the note very firmly, and he put his hand over, took hold of it, and held it up to the light—he said, "Oh, this is right enough; this is one of the last issue; I have got plenty of them, I will change it!" and he put his hand into his pocket, and drew out a handful of gold and silver—he took five sovereigns out, and laid them on the counter—he had the note in his hand—he scrambled it up very carelessly, and put it into his trowsers pocket—I pushed four of the sovereigns towards Williams, and took one my<lb></lb>self, examined it, and put it in the detector, and then into the till—I gave Wil<lb></lb>liams the change, keeping the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the goods he had had—Williams tied up the goods in a silk pocket handkerchief, and walked out—as soon as he went out I took a bag and weighed Wells his pound of <hi rend="italic">pic nice</hi>—he gave me a half crown, and I took 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—as I was weighing them, I called out to the lad Steed to get ready to go out immediately, as I suspected they were regular <hi rend="italic">smashers</hi>—just as Wells went outside the door, I went to the lad, pulled off his apron, pointed out Wells to him, and sent him oat to watch him until I could go myself—just as I was going outside the door, the lad returned—in consequence of what he told me, I went to the corner of Well-street and Mare-street, Hackney, and in a nasty little turning there I dropped upon Wells, Williams, and two others, standing talking to each other—Wells had a parcel of goods in his hand, tied up in a pocket hand<lb></lb>kerchief—it was about the bulk and appearance of the parcel I had sold to Williams—I believe Williams saw me; he had his face towards me; they immediately parted—Williams came towards me, and Wells went the other way, and the other two parted—I lost sight of them in a moment, there being a lot of labouring men about there, and they appeared as working men themselves—I followed Williams on account of his tendering me the note—I think he observed me to be following him; he walked down Well-street, and passed me—I walked into a grocer's shop to conceal myself, and asked them to allow me to wait there a minute or two—I saw Wells drop the parcel of goods he was carrying, and they were all scattered in the street—that was after I had followed Williams, after Williams had gone down Well-street—I had to run to keep sight of him afterwards, and I saw him turning back, and he saw me turn into the same shop where I first went in—I afterwards saw Wells and Williams together again; that was after I had seen the parcel dropped by Wells; after I came out of the shop again, and was walking after Williams again—Williams was on one side of the road, and Wells was just across the road, where he had dropped his parcel of goods—he picked them up, and went into an unfinished house, I suppose to put his goods to rights again; and by that time Steed, our lad, overtook</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

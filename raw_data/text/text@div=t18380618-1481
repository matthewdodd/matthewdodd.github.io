                  </hi>. I am single, and live in the service of William Patten Donkin Chubb, landlord of the King's Head, Dolphin-court. On the 19th of May, I opened my master's shop—the first thing I did when I came down stairs was to go to the coffee-room door, and see what o'clock it was—it was ten minutes to seven o'clock—I saw the clock safely fixed in the wall in the coffee-room then—about half past seven o'clock the three prisoners came in together—they called for a pint of half-and-half—they drank of it together at the bar—I am sure these are the three men—Honeyman then went into the coffee-room—he came out again, and whispered to Hill—I</p>

               <p>saw him—I was at the bar after that—Hill went into the coffee-room—while he was gone, Honeyman asked me to oblige him with a glass of cold water, that was kept at the back of the bar—he drank it—it was a large glass—Hill then came out and whispered to Honeyman, and Honeynman then asked me if I would oblige him with another glass of water—I said "No, here is the glass, and there is the water, go and help yourself"—Honeyman went for the glass of water, and drank it, and then Hill whis<lb></lb>pered again, and Honeyman said to Hill, "She is looking"—I came out of the bar, and went to the coffee-room door, and saw the clock was down—it had been taken out of its place where it had been fixed, and was behind the door, partly covered with two handkerchiefs—I asked them which of them took the clock down—they said they knew nothing about it—I went to the street door, and hallooed up to the bar-maid, and she came down as quickly as possible—there happened to be a person in the tap-room who heard me, and he came out to ask what was the matter—from the time I saw the clock fixed, till I saw it unfixed, no person entered the coffee-room but the two prisoners, Hill and Honeyman—Page came in with them, he talked, and drank with them.</p>

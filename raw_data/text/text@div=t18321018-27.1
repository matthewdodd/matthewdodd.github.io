On the evening of the 28th of September I returned home just after he had closed the shop and was gone; my clerk gave me information - I found four pairs of nut-crackers concealed; I marked, and left them there - the next morning I went to breakfast at eight o'clock - they were then in the same place; I had not an opportunity of looking when I went from breakfast, but I soon afterwards sent the prisoner out with a lamp; I then looked and missed the nut-crackers; I sent my shopman to bring him back, and charged him with taking them; he denied it - I said I must search him; he seemed reluctant - I sent to the Police-station, but before the officer came the prisoner began to be a little alarmed, and said if I would not be hard with him he would give them to me; he then took two pairs of crackers out of his side jacket pocket and laid them on the desk - I said they were not all; there were four pairs - he said that they were all he had taken; the Policeman then came, and found on him ten sovereigns, and 10s. 31/4d., which I cannot account for, as his salary was but 1l. a week, and he had a wife to support; he said if we would let him go below he would get the other two pairs of crackers - we went down with him, and he took these other two pairs of crackers from a place and gave them to me; I went with the officer to his lodgings, where I found the rest of this property, most of which has my private mark on it.</p>

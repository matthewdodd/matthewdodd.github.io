               <p>Q. Did you on the 2nd of August purchase of Mr. Goodwin two pieces of kerseymere - A. I never purchased any; I never was a customer to him, I never gave the prisoner any orders since he was with Mr. Goodwin; I did not give the prisoner orders on the 2nd of August, I never saw the goods till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentleman of the jury, the whole that I can say upon this subject is, that I was employed by Mr. Goodwin, as agent, to act according to the best of my skill and judgement; it was not done with any intention to defraud in the least; Mr. Goodwin in the first place might have prevented that; I was involved in difficulties when I first went there, and a person of the name of Philpot first involved me in it. The goods were in the first place bought, they were then pledged; he led me on from one thing to another, but not of the least advantage to me whatever. I have only further to observe I was never engaged to Mr. Becket, my agreement was with Mr. Goodwin to be agent and traveller to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

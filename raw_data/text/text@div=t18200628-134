            . My husband is a broker. On the 26th of January, at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house in Nottingham-court, Holborn - I immediately sent for Mr. Shew, as I knew him to be the man who stole the first two chairs; I also sent for an officer, and detained him with assistance. He struck me, and threatened to send my head through the wall if I did not loose him. He had at this time brought two chairs up the court to my house, and wanted 5 s. each for them. I gave one of them into my lodger's hands - the prisoner immediately took the other, and was going to run off with it, but I secured him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man named Harding, whom I knew three years ago, met me, and asked where he could sell these chairs, and told me to dispose of them for him - the woman said they were stolen, and I was going to look for Harding, but she detained me.</p>

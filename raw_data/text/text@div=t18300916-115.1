On the 8th of August I was in White's-row, between twelve and one o'clock; I had a basket of tools in my hand - I was a little in liquor, but knew perfectly well what I was about - the prisoner came and snatched the basket out of my hand, without saying a word; I had a long plum-rule in my right hand, and the basket in my left - she was a perfect stranger to me; there were two or three in company with her; she snatched the basket, ran off, and gave it to another person - I do not know what became of them; I ran, took the prisoner, and called for assistance - the other made her escape with the tools; I have never seen them since - I told her if she would produce my tools I would forgive her; she said she would take me to where they were - I went with her a little way, when two or three more persons came up, chiefly women; they shoved me about, and got me down - the prisoner tried to make her escape, but I held her fast till the Police came up.</p>

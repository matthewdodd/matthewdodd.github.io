                  </hi>. I keep a music-seller's shop, in Gray's Inn-passage. On the 11th of April I noticed the prisoner standing opposite Mr. Corfield's shop, which fronts mine—I saw him take two books from the shelf, put them under his coat, and walk away—I called to him, and he came back, with the books still under his coat—I then left him in charge of the prosecutor, as I had to go to my own shop—he had the books concealed under his coat.</p>

The prisoner was brought to my shop by Mr. Mason in charge—I saw these books, but whether they were given me by Mr. Mason or the prisoner, I do not know, owing to the confusion by knock<lb></lb>ing down a pile of books—Mr. Mason said, "Here is a man who has taken two books of yours, and these are the books," but whether he gave them me or the prisoner I do not know—the prisoner asked me to let him go, as I had never seen him there before—I said, "No, I have suffered too much from thieves"—I sent for the policeman, and gave him into custody—they are my books, and cost me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

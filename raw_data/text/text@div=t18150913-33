I had twenty-two pounds in English notes in a pocketbook. I was drinking with the prisoners in the tap-room; I was perfectly sober, and having fallen off the Portsmouth coach coming to London, I was not able to look out for a bed for myself, so I said, I would thank any one to help me to a bed;

I fell asleep, and they remained in the room. My money was safe then in a pocket-book, which was in a sort of belt round my body. I was awakened by the prisoners rummaging my clothes about, and then I perceived they had got the pocket-book. I saw Elizabeth take the notes out of it: then she threw the pocket-book at me, and then they both ran down stairs. I picked the pocket-book up, but it was empty. I then went down stairs, and to the place where I first fell in with them, but could learn no tidings of them. At last, I fell in with them at the Kettle Drum, in Ratcliffe Highway, and I immediately procured an officer, and had them taken into custody. I am sure I had four notes for the payment of five pounds each, and two for the payment of one pound each.</p>

On the 8th of March, at a quarter to five o'clock in the morning, I was near Saffron-hill—a man came and gave me some information—I went to Great Saffron-hill, and found the pri<lb></lb>soner with his coat, waistcoat, and cap off—they were hanging on a post—he was throwing his arms about, and saying the first that came near him he would</p>

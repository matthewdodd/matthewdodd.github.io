                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Thomas Webb, a wire-drawer, at No. 64, Kent-street, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark—he keeps the house—I keep a shop in the general line. On the 10th of January, about ten minutes or a quarter after eight o'clock, I went out with my husband—I locked up every thing safe—we fastened the shop-door, and then the street-door, after us—the windows were all</p>

               <p>closed—we returned in an hour and a quarter, and found several people about the house, and a policeman in the shop—I found the door of the shop wrenched from the hinges, and missed from a room adjoining the shop, from a drawer which I had locked, and which was broken open, two silver watches, six silver tea-spoons, three coral necklaces, a silver scent-box, a silver thimble, a brooch, a pair of gold-wire earrings, and several trifling articles—I cannot say how much money I missed, but I suppose from 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the same drawer, consisting of two half-crowns, six<lb></lb>pences, shillings, a few pence, and a sixpence with a hole in it—I had locked the drawer, and had the key in my pocket when I went out—the prisoner was then in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 35, Castle-street, near the prosecutor's. On the night of the 10th of January, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I had occasion to go up the passage in which their shop-door it, to speak to a shopman of mine—I was talking to him for about a quarter of an hour, and as I came down a ladder from him, I saw a light in Webb's back-par<lb></lb>lour, which communicates with the shop—I looked in, and saw two men in the back-parlour—I had no suspicion, but when I came up the passage I saw the door of the house open—I caught hold of the shop-door, and called out three times for Mr. Webb—nobody answered—one man came to me out of the shop, from towards the parlour, and asked me for some name—I said, "I do not know such a name"—he ran away as hard as he could—I then had suspicion, and closed the door, pursued him a short dis<lb></lb>tance, and, just as I returned back, I saw another man come out of the same door—I turned my head and saw Marshall, a policeman, and pointed out to him the man who I had seen come out of the door—I am sure I pointed out the same man as I had seen come out of the door.</p>

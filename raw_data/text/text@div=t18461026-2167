                  </hi>. I live at Canterbury-street, York-road, Lambeth. On the 8th of Oct., about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was in Collingwood-row, Black friars-road, and saw two men and a woman going on before me, all abreast, close together—I do not know whether they were arm-in-arm, but they were talking together—the prisoner was one of them—I overtook them, and, after I had passed three or four yards, the female came to my left side, and said, Where are you going, my dear?" or words to that effect—I said I was going home as fast as I could, and did not wish to speak to her—the prisoner was a few yards behind, with the other man—the woman left roe—I thought I felt something at my breast pocket, put my hand down, and found my watch was gone—I had seen it there at half-past nine o'clock—it must hate been in my possession at ten minutes to ten—I did not see her hand there, only felt it—she put her hands on me—she came alongside me, and touched me—I did not feel her directly put her hand into my pocket—I felt her hand touch me just about the breast, in such a way that she could take my watch—she left me suddenly, and was about two yards from me, when looked down, and made a grasp at her to catch her, and instantly received violent blow on my mouth from the prisoner, which stunned me—I laid hold of him, and called out, "Police, run after the girl, she has got my watch"—the prisoner struggled with me, and was just getting from my grasp, when Davis secured him—the woman ran off as hard as she could—I could not see the other man afterwards.</p>

On the 8th of Oct., between half-past ten and eleven o'clock at night, I heard a cry of "Police!" ran into the street, and saw the prisoner and Fortie struggling—I thought they were fighting—I went towards them—the prisoner bad then got from Fortie, who <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "I have lost my watch"—I immediately ran after the prisoner—he turned the corner of the street, and finding me close at his heels fell back against the wall and said, "I have done nothing; what have I done?"—I held him till the policeman came up—he bad got the length of six small houses from where the struggle was—he was never out of my sight.</p>

             (Police-constable G 33). I lodge at No. 23, Helen-place, Clerkenwell. About one o'clock that morning I met Mailey, Carvey, and Barnes, on Saffron-hill - they spoke to me; I then went up West-street, and through Sharpe's-alley - I then met them again, running down Sharpe's-alley, and Mailey had a great coat; Barnes had a hat and an umbrella - one of them dropped a book- they cried out, "There is Smith, spill it," and they all ran off; I told them I knew them - I had not seen Colliss then, but I came up Sharpe's-alley, and found him at the prosecutor's shop; he told me what he had seen, and I said I knew them all - I saw Nash at the house, as it appeared, in a fit; in about half an hour I took Mailey at his house, in West-street - his coat had some flour on it; I said,"You have been with the baker's;" he said he had been in all night; "Yes, (said his landlady) about twenty minutes;" it appeared that if Nash had let them in they would have taken more than they did - there was a watch and other things there.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER WOOLCOCK (Police-constable G 149.) I lodge in Greenhill's-rents, Cowcross. I came up to the house, and found Nash against the door; I raised him up several times, and he fell again - he seemed quite stupid.</p>

               <p>ROBERT SKINNER. I lodge in the house. I returned home at twelve o'clock that night; Nash let me in - I bolted the door, and went to bed; at half-past one I was called up by Lee - I came down, and saw Nash apparently intoxicated, but I thought it could not be, as he appeared sober when I came in; I have always found him strictly honest.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FELTHAM. I was in the City Police, but have left it. I was present at the trial of Mailey in September last- I have a certificate of his conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's; (read) I know he is the man.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 27th or 28th of April I saw a man come out of the yard with a pair of wheels; there was a stick run in between the wheels, and with his running them along the stick broke. He tried to tie the stick up again; he went a very few yards before the stick gave way; he went into the yard and got another stick, and wheeled them off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Look me in my face, can you say I was the person. - A. I know you very well, I was in your company twenty minutes; you went up towards Drury-lane with the wheels. I did not suspect him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear before the magistrate that it was Tuesday morning, a quarter after four. - A. It was either Monday or Tuesday, I am sure as to the hour, it was twenty minutes after four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going on an errand for my father - there was a crowd in Thames-street; the handkerchief was thrown quite across my arms by somebody - I took it up, and before I could speak the gentleman seized my hand, and said, "What have you got?"</p>
               <p>MR. MILNER. It is impossible that could have occurred - he said at first that it was thrown at him; but when he found I was determined to give charge of him, he fell on his knees, begged pardon, and said he would not do it again.</p>

I said no; she said, God bless! they have not been in bed to night; I went up, and there were no sheets on the bed; I looked about when I opened the door, and found the key of the drawers, which was locked, and all my property, that I delivered, was gone; I stopt the servant maid, and sent for a constable; and before the Justice she told me where the interpreter was, and he was taken also; the interpreter and the woman servant, confessed without promise of favour.</p>

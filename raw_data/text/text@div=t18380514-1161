                  </hi>. I am residing with my aunt, at No. 6, White Horse-place, Commercial-road. I went to the Tower, on the 15th of April, about one or two o'clock, to see a soldier, a cousin of mine—I saw the prisoner, and he offered to go with me to a public-house—we did so, and I war to stop there till he fetched my cousin—he came back, and took me to an<lb></lb>other place, and took me into a room and ill-used me—I had a handkerchief, a ribbon, and a brooch—he took them away from me, and did what he could to me, and then locked me in with another man—he took the handkerchief, ribbon, and brooch away with him—this was not a bad house, it was in the barracks, in the Tower—there were no other soldiers in the room where, he took me—it was between seven and eight o'clock when he let me out of the room—I hallooed "Murder" when I came down.</p>

I did not give him either of these things—he took them from me—my handkerchief was twisted round my hand, and he took it from me—he locked me up in this room with himself and then after he had done with me, he locked me up with another one—I told the other one that the prisoner had ill-used me—the prisoner let me out—I came down, and told a man that I had lost my things, and he had been ill-using me—he asked me if I should know his name—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Was it M'Gann!" and I said, "Yea"—I had beard another man call him by that name.</p>

I am sergeant-major in the 20th regiment—I was passing round the barracks in the Tower, between seven and eight o'clock that night, and saw this young woman crying—I asked what was the matter—she said that a man of the name of M'Gann had kicked her down stairs, and taken a collar, some ribbon, and a handkerchief from her—I had</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Samuel Matthews, a butcher, in Newgate-market. On Saturday night, the 4th of Feb., I saw the prisoners together—they went into the shop, and came out—I saw Vickers take from the board a pair of necks of mutton—I let them go about three yards from the shop—I went after Vickers, touched him on the shoulder, and asked what. he had got there—he said, "Nothing"—he let the necks of mutton fall down by his feet—Simmonds said he was going to take them to the next shop to get them weighed—neither of them had asked a word about the price.</p>

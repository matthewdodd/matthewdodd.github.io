            . I live at Hackney. The prisoner was on one side of the way, and I on the other; I heard somebody halloo Stop thief! I looked round, and saw the prisoner with the coat - when the gentleman hallooed Stop thief! I saw him drop it; he ran away, and was pursued: I did not follow him, but I knew him before, and am sure he is the man - the gas-lights were lighted; I swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far from the shop did I drop it? A. Just by Slatterie and Green's - it was not quite dark.</p>

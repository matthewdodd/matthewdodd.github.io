                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live in King David-street, Shadwell. I was in Fleet-street, the prisoner Wilkins came over to me, and said it was a fine morning—he said he was a stranger in London, and had come from the country, to receive some money for some apples and pears—he asked where I was going—I said to the Admiralty—he said, "I never saw the Admiralty; I should like to take a walk with you"—he pointed to Temple-bar, and asked what church it was—I said it was no church, it was what we called Temple<lb></lb>bar—he walked with me to the Admiralty—I said I was going in to ask a</p>

               <p>few questions—he said, "I will wait here for you, and we will go and have a pint of beer, or half-and-half"—(I was going to try to get into Greenwich hos-pital)—when I came out, he was waiting outside—he said, "We will go and have a pint of beer together"—I said, "I am agreeable"—he took me down to the Strand, to a public-house down an alley, which I did not know—we sat down, and in came Davis, who said to me, "I presume you are a seafaring man"—I said, "Yes; I have been long enough at it; fifty-two years"—he said, "I have just come from America myself; when I was seventeen, my father died, and left me 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my uncle did me out of it; I was seven<lb></lb>teen or eighteen years with a man, and my old colleague died, and left me 14, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said he had come from Liverpool to London, he was a stran<lb></lb>ger, and should like to see the Tower—he drank a pint of beer, and then took wilkins and me in the steam-boat to London-bridge—he went along Tower-street to a public-house, up some steps—we all three went in—it was then about one o'clock—Davis then said he would lend me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would not have it; I could not return it—he then said he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he took out a bag with sovereigns in it, and a pocket-book full of notes—he said there was 14, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then asked what money I could show, and told Wilkins to go home with me, to see what money I could muster—I was to bring my money—I went home and fetched a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and three sove<lb></lb>reigns, in a tobacco-box—I took that to the public-house—Davis then asked Wilkins what money I had brought with me—Wilkins said 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Davis then would not give me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—he took me to a house at the corner of Pres-cot-street, and there he said he would give me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had got six bags, with strings to them, which he said he got for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said to Wilkins, "Here is a bag for you to remember me, put your own money in this bag, and I will pot another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in it"—he put a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the bag first—then he said to me, "Here is a bag for you; take your own money out of your pouch and put it in here"—I took the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the three sovereigns, and put in, and then he said, "Now here is a remembrance for yon; here is an<lb></lb>other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—he put it in the bag, and said, "Now I will <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it in your pocket for you," which he did—he then said, "We shall stop here, you run home with your money first, and then we will go to the Tower"—I went out, but I did not get far before I looked to see if the note was good, and I found only three farthings in the bag—I went back to the public-bouse, and the prisoners were gone—I was then foolish enough to go down to the Tower—they were not there—I did not examine the bag to see if the notes were in it till I got to Tower-street—I then found there were only two papers in it—my own 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was gone and my three sovereigns—I can take my oath the prisoners are the two men.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Standard in Whitechapel. Some weeks ago the prisoner Wilkins came into my house—he pasted the bar, opened the parlour-door, and looked in—he then passed the bar back again, and said to some person outside, "We may as well come in here; we can gel at good a drop of ale here as any where"—Sharp and a shorter man then came in, and they all three went into the parlour—I went in directly after and said, "Gentlemen, what can I help you to?"—Wilkins ordered three glasses of the best ale—it was taken in and the door shut—when they had been there about ten minutes, Sharp went out and the other two went in two or three minutes after—I knew no more for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, when Sharp came back in a confused state—he opened the parlour-door and said, "Are these men gone?"—I said, "Yes, they went directly after you; is any thing the matter?"—"Matter enough," says he—he took out a bag and shook it on the counter—there were two pieces of paper and three farthings in it.</p>

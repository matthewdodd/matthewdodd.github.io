               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Have you always given the same account of it? A. I believe so - the purse was made of linen; I never said it was made of leather - it was about eleven o'clock at night; I never swore it was nine - I said I did not know the time, as there was no clock; the prisoner was taken facing the door of the General Elliott - the landlady was in the bar, but the passage is but narrow, and I turned my side to the bar to drink the beer; she was perhaps two yards from the prisoner - she did not say, in my hearing, that he was not the man; I was perfetly sober.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him of a purse and some money; I took him to the station - I was surrounded by three women, and thrown down with the prisoner in my hand; we were all down together - in going along the prisoner said he would be d - d if it was him that robbed him, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you on the spot? A. I was passing by; I took the prisoner ten or twelve yards from the house - I cannot say that the prosecutor said before the Magistrate, that he had seen the prisoner give his purse to a woman, but he said so after he came out of the office; the office was so crowded, I did not hear what he said there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prosecutor sober? A.He had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200068"></xptr>been drinking, but knew what he was about; I did not hear any of the women call the prisoner by name, but he lives with one of them named Dockerty.</p>

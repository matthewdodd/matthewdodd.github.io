            . I am servant to Mr. Ewington. On the 18th of February the prisoner brought some coals to the house, and on the 25th he brought two sacks more - he took some up stairs, and some down; he passed the passage or hall, where the coats hang in general.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRAVES. I live in the same house with Medcraft in Hart-street. I received a coat from a little girl, who lives with my landlady, about the 18th of February; it was a black coat, but I never opened it - it was a close body coat; the prisoner came to my room a little before one o'clock, and asked for a black coat - I said, "There is one hangs over the chair;" he said, "I left it when you were out;" Mrs. Loveday had come in, called me Johnny, asked if it would fit me, and then I saw it was a close body coat, and too small for me - I saw that it had a bit of red tape at the top, and said "Where did it come from? it must have been hung up at some shop;" the prisoner laughed, and took it away - he gave me a bit of snuff from a box, the colour of this, and it had some drawing on it. On the 25th of February he came again in a great flurry, and asked if his boots were done; he had a great coat on then.</p>

On the 8th of August I was on duty in Bath-street, City-road, about one o'clock in the afternoon—that is upwards of a mile from the West India Dock warehouse, which is in Fen church-street—I saw a man of the name of Miller carrying a bag—I stopped him and asked what he had got there—he said, "It don't belong to me, it belongs to that man ahead," pointing to the prisoner Wagstaff—upon his saying that, I called to Wagstaff and asked him what was in the bag—he said it was bags—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "From Hackney"—that was the first answer he gave me—I asked who it belonged to—he said to himself—I asked," Why you are going towards Hackney; where are you going to take it to?"—he said, "That is my business"—I told him he must come to the station-house and explain it there—I took him there, and he then said he got it from Glover's Hall-court, in Beech-lane, where he lived—he gave no other account till he got before the Magistrate—I do not know whether what he said was taken down in writing—I do not think it</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouse-keeper, in the employ of the West India Dock Company—they have premises in Fenchurch-street—Stokes was in their employ, and had been so a little exceeding two years—it was his duty to take charge of certain stores in the warehouse—30,029 1/2 yards of canvas had been placed under his care—it is an article prepare expressly for the Company's use, of a particular weight and quality—I find on this piece of canvas a numerical number, and the contractor's mark on it, the letter M for Murray, and a number, as received on a particular day—these facts satisfy me that it is the property of the Company—I have no doubt of it—I cannot say what quantity has been lost—about two or three hundred yards must have been taken—a person in Stokes's situation must have missed so great a quantity if it had been taken by anybody else—he never made any representation of having missed any before he was taken from his employment—he would have ample opportunity of stealing that quantity if he chose—he had the care of those things—it was part of his duty to send out samples of indigo from the warehouse—they were sent out in bags—if any thing else went out in the bag, nobody else would look over it—it would go out on his own responsibility—on the 8th of August, I saw Stokes send out some indigo—these tools are the property of the Company—they were in Stokes's care—it was his duty to keep them in a store-room—they were to be locked up—he had no authority to take them off the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the employ of the West India Dock Company. I was there on the 11th of May—my attention was directed to a man of the name of Ridler, by John Williams—I watched Ridler, and followed him, when he left the dock, into the Minories—I then saw him with the prisoner Hallen—they went to a public-house, and then to an oil shop—I did not see them after—I don't know Stokes—I am watchman at the West India Docks.</p>

               <p>(John Davis Cox, a publican, of Thomas-street, Kennington-common, and Richard Jones, of the Feathers, in Wild-street, gave the prisoner Stokes a good character.)</p>

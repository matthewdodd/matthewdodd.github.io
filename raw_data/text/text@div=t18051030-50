            , I immediately went out of the shop, and pursued the prisoner; I overtook her in Gray's-inn-lane; I took hold of her, and she dropped the print out of her apron on the ground, I took it up, it is Mr. Powdich's property; I had seen them in the morning in the shop. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A. Three pounds ten shillings; Mr. Powdich pays the rent and taxes for the house; he has two houses; Mr. Sands lives in the house, he is the foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not Mr. Powdich's dwelling house? - A. No, he does not live there, it is Mr. Powdich's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pollock. Q. Do you know where these goods were at the time they were stolen? - A. Yes, they were at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they inside or outside of the door? - A. Rather of the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner in the shop at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the goods are Mr. Powdich's - what mark is there upon them? - A. The ticket I wrote upon them and the print was in the same fold as they were when we put them to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to a fold, you must swear to some mark? - A. They had a ticket upon them of my own writing.</p>
               <p>Q. They hung out of the covering of the door, if the door had been shut they would have been outside of that covering? - A. No, the door could not be shut; they were partly inside and partly out; they were on a pile on a chair, they were exactly on the threshold.</p>

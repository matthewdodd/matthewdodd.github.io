On the 18th of October, I gave him a check for 487l. 10s., to take to Sir John Lubbock, and Co., bankers, and told him to bring large notes for it; I sent him at ten o'clock; a quarter of an hour was plenty of time for him to return in; he did not return-in about three quarters of an hour after, I went to Lubbock's, and found the check was paid. I went to the Bank, and there received information that the notes had been changed. Soon after twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner at his mother's in Belvidere-place, near the King's-bench; I asked him where the notes were - He said he had lost them, he did not know where. I said, I ordered you to bring large notes, why did you go to the Bank and obtain small ones? he said, "I know you did, sir, but it was my foolishness." I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. His mother came to me in the Bank; I went to him with her; she said he had come to her, saying, he had lost the pocket-book<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290008"></xptr>and did not like to return; she gave me the 10l. which he said he had not lost.

            . I am clerk in the Bank of England. I have two 200l. notes, Nos. 4149 and 2584, and two 40l. notes, Nos. 360 and 4992; they were brought into the Bank on the 18th of October, by a young lad like the prisoner; he asked for 1l. notes, which he had-400 of them in numbers, from 49,601 to 50,000.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I will not swear he is the person.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BARNARD. I live in Nicholl-square, Cripplegate, with my father. I am acquainted with the prisoner. On the 18th of October, he came to my father's, he said he had brought 500 1l. notes - I do not think he said where he got them; I told him to put them in the stable where the fowls lay - He did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he brought them-did he give you any intimation of his intention - A. About three weeks before, he said he would get a sum of money to keep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he meant to do with it - A. He once said he would go to America, and afterwards that he would surrender himself up. On the afternoon of the robbery, the officer searched my box, which alarmed me; I threw the notes into the Thames, at Dowgate, they were loose in a pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had known him about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew he was in no situation to bring 400l. which he came honestly by - A. Yes, I told this story when the officer had searched me; I was liberated on my uncle being bound to answer for my appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him the impropriety of what he was doing - A. Not then - I did before. I am sixteen years old.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why did you not give the notes to the officer instead of throwing them into the Thames - A. I thought this would condemn me at once.</p>

            . I am horse-keeper to Messrs. Harden and Jaques, wholesale grocers. On Sunday morning, the 19th of October, I was at Dowgate-wharf about seven o'clock, and saw some papers floating about - I picked them up, they were bank notes, some of them were tied together; there was a bill-case along with them. I found 439l., and afterwards found two 1l. notes, which I delivered to Mr. Roofe-there were 5l. or 6l. in the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>MR. ROOFE. I have the notes which the last witness gave me - They are marked between 49,601 and 50,000.</p>

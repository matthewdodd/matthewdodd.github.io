            . I am a constable, I live in Shoemaker row. On Monday last between eleven and twelve o'clock, there were some goods offer'd to sale at a place call'd Broad-court in our parish. I went with the person, the prisoner was coming with the pail on his head in a bag with some dock leaves, his sister had two sauce-pans in her apron; I stop'd the prisoner, and catch'd him in several stories about the things, so I carried him before the sitting alderman, he order'd me to carry him to the Compter, and advertise the things, which I did; the man came and described the pail and swore to it, and the woman to one of the sauce-pans.</p>

               <p>My brother is foreman to a nightman, we were together in Hounsditch ; a soldier was coming along, he said, do you want a jobb ; said I, cockey, I shall be glad of a jobb. Said he, will you carry this bundle (what was in the bag I did not know ) I was to carry it into the Minories; when I came into the middle of Hounsditch I saw him talk to a Jew woman, I cross'd the turning he was to turn up; when I came into Shoemaker-row he bid me set them down, I laid them on a stall; he staid a pretty while, so I went to him, and said, come cockey, don't hinder me in another jobb, I cannot spend the whole day with you; he and the woman was as near together as I am to your worship. The mob gather'd round me, and which way he and the woman went I don't know.</p>

The last time the prisoner worked for me was on St. Thomas's day. I, being summoned to attend the wardmote, weighed my stock of silver, which was 25 ounces odd penyweights. I did not come home till eleven at night. The next morning I weighed it again, and there were four ounces deficient. What I missed was cuttings and filings of buckles. My children observed to me he had been melting, and I had given him no orders to melt. I went to the chandler's shop, and found he had had some pearl ashes, we can't melt the silver in a body without them. Then I had recourse to an assay-maker, and there I found there had been an assay made in his name. Then I went to the refiner, and found he had bought an assay of silver from the prisoner, which was 23 ounces odd penyweights, for which he received 6 l 5 s. 4 d. Then I went to Mr. Curry, where the prisoner had worked, to give him a caution that he did not serve him the same. He told me he also missed a quantity. I got a warrant, and took up the prisoner. He gave no satisfactory account before my lord mayor how he came by the silver, and he was committed. He was searched, and in every one of his pockets were the remains of filings. He hardly worked one day in six or seven, yet never wanted money.</p>

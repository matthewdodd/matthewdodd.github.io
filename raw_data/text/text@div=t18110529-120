            . I am an officer. On the 17th of April Norgan told me he had been robbed; I gave the alarm to the patrol, he found her in Essex-street, coming from the receiving-house, I knew her before; she was taken up, brought to the watchhouse, and searched, but no property found upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 17th of April I was coming along Whitechapel, I was met by a young woman and the prosecutor; the young woman asked me to let her have the key of my room for an hour, which I agreed to; I returned in an hour, I saw the prosecutor sitting on the bed, he told me he had lost his watch; I said I was very sorry that they came to my room; he said he was sure that I knew nothing of it, and after he had got his clothes on he wished me good night. In about half an hour afterwards I was taken into custody. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am positive the prisoner is the person that took the watch out of my hand.</p>

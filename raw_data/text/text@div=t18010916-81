               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. (Counsel for Hunt.) Q. The person you suppose to be Hunt, was dressed in black at that time? - A. Yes; but I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see him again for a fortnight afterwards? - A.No; he was taken up by the description I gave of him at the Office; they knew him from my description.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JACKSON sworn. - Mrs. Wyatt gave me a description of Hunt on the 17th of August; she said she was sure she should know him again: we were after him till the 27th, and then we took him in Feathers-court, Holborn, from her description.</p>
               <p>HENRY LOVETT sworn. - I was with Jackson; I know no more than he has related.</p>
               <p>Munday's defence. I know no nothing of the man that stands by my side; a gentleman told me to go and order some linen to be sent to Mr. Godwin's, and I should be rewarded; I did so, and just before I got to Mr. Godwin's, the gentleman met us, and sent the woman back for some cambric; I went to Mr. Godwin's with the linen, and when we had got within the door, the gentleman said we had got to the wrong house; I immediately, upon coming out, heard a cry of stop thief; he ran away, and I was taken.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Hunt, left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

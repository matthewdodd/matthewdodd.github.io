               <p>AMELIA ROSENHAGEN. I live with my parents. About eight o'clock in the evening on the 16th of July I was opposite <placeName id="t18320906-52-crimeloc309">Old Gravel-lane</placeName>

            . I live in the neighbourhood, and was going for some vinegar; I saw this lady's dress in a dreadful state - the prisoner said if she would go over the way she would find her a place to clean it; I went up to her, and said if she would go to my mother's, I would give her some water and a towel; she said she hoped it was not far - I said No: she then went, and thanked me - the prisoner went with her, and cleaned her dress, and while doing that she took a steel purse out of the lady's pocket, and put it into her own; the lady then put her hand into her pocket, and missed her purse; I told what I had seen, and told my mother to get an officer, but the prisoner was gone before he came - she was taken soon after.</p>

             (Police-constable K 178). About ten minutes after eight o'clock I saw the prisoner come down the court - she made a full look in my face-she had no shawl or apron on then; in about five minutes the prosecutrix came, and said she had been robbed - I said "Is it by that girl who passed me?" she said Yes - I went after the prisoner, and found her at the end of Cannon-street - I said, "I want you;" she said "I know what it is about - it is about that young lady;" I took her into the parlour of a publichouse, and found 3s. 6d. in silver on her, 5d. in copper, and a purse, but not the prosecutrix's; she said her father was in the artillery at Woolwich - I went there, but could find no one to own her.</p>

               <p>MISS ROSENHAGEN. I am sure I felt my purse when I went into the house to be cleaned; I had been to a shop before, and I went there to satisfy myself - my purse was a steel one; the one found on the prisoner is silk, with a steel snap.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix came out of the house with me, and wished me a good afternoon; the purse the officer found on me is my own - Costelow was locked up herself.</p>
               <p>JOHN MURRAY. I took them all, but no one was locked up but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, protesting her innocence.</p>

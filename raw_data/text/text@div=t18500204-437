                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Chapman, of Brentford-end Isleworth, market-gardeners. I had charge of their fruit-room, which is a building a little way from the house, and is part of the premises. I was there on the morning of 25th Dec., about eight or nine o'clock—there were some pears there—I went again next morning, about eight or nine, and missed four or five bushels of pears—the door appeared to have been opened by an iron instrument; it was forced open—it was safe the day before—the pears were of three different kinds, the <hi rend="italic">Bura Rance, the Neplus Meuris,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Nelis Diver</hi>—I afterwards saw some at the station at Brentford, and they exactly corresponded with those I missed—they were of two kinds—I produce a sample, which I brought from home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother as market<lb></lb>gardeners, in the parish of Isleworth. On 26th Dec., I received information about my pears being lost—on 15th Jan., I accompanied inspector Brown to Mr. Pullen's, in Farringdon-market, where some pears where shown me—to the best of my belief they were part of the pears I had lost—the value of those I lost was at least 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were of three different kinds, and those I saw at Mr. Pullen's were of the same three kinds—my fruit-room a shed erected in the yard against the garden wall; it is enclosed within the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer in Covent-garden and Far<lb></lb>ringdon-markets. On 26th Dec., between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, a person, who I believe to be the prisoner, came to my place, and after looking at some apples outside, asked me to purchase some pears—not thinking, from his appearance, that be had any worth purchasing, I said, "No"—he said, "You had better come out and look at them"—I did so, and they appeared in very bad condition, on account of their being badly packed, and the frost had taken them; they were in fish baskets—I should say there was between three and four bushels—I said I would have nothing at all to do with them, they were in so bad a state—be followed me into the shop, and said, "Will you not bid me anything for them?"—he asked 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said it was a sin to see such good things so badly packed, for they were quite destroyed from the way in which they had been brought to Lon<lb></lb>don—after a time, I said I would give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if only a small portion of them came good—he said he would not take that—I said, "Well, I will not give you more, and if you leave the place for one moment, I will not even give you that"—he asked if I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—I said I cared so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185002040038"></xptr>
               <p>little about them, that I did not care whether I had them or no—he said, "Well, you shall have them"—I paid him the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he brought the baskets in—when I was about to unpack them, he said he would call another day for the baskets; he did not call—Morgan, my servant, was present at the purchase—I sent him to take the man's name—these produced are some of the pears.</p>

The things all together were above the value of 5l. certainly; there were two £5 notes in the purse, besides other things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q.Are you a military man or a naval officer? A. A military man, belonging to the East India Company's service - I am married - Mrs. Grindlay was at this time indisposed, and I slept in a spare bed-room - nobody slept in it besides myself - there are two bed-rooms adjoining my room - I have three female servants - the female servant came from the room immediately adjoining.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a door besides the outer door between your room and your servant's room? A. No; as far as I can describe to you, there is only one door to each room, and they are close together, so that persons cannot come out of both doors together without coming in contact with each other - there is only one door to each room - they open close together - the female servant came out of the door immediately next to mine - her name is

            , or something like it - I have a female-servant named Kellet- she sleeps in the same room with Sherold and the housekeeper, three of them together - Kellet was in my service at the time the prisoner was - I am not aware that the prisoner was courting Kellet - I know nothing of it one way or the other - my room was not fastened - I don't think even the latch had caught - any servant in the house had access to my room at any time, by day or night.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you mean by asking the prisoner if any persons were concerned? A.Because I wished to know if there were others, that we might look sharp after them - I rather addressed the question generally to the prisoner, and to the police I said, "Are there any more? let us look round" - I did not expect to get any answer from the prisoner - I certainly did not allude to any persons in my own house - I did not suspect any of my establishment - When the prisoner left me, he requested I would give him a good character - I discharged him with great reluctance, because I found he had acquired a habit of drinking, which all my endeavours to prevent were fruitless - I found him so excellent a servant in other respects, I wished not to part with him - I gave him three or four warnings, and he promised to give up that habit; but he did not, and I discharged him- I don't think he has been in service since - I have given him a character two or three times, but I believe he has not been in service.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you given him a good character? A. Whatever questions a person puts to me, I answer sincerely, in the presence of the servant, that he may not fancy I have said anything against him without foundation - about three months ago he requested me to give him a character - I said yes, but I insisted on the prisoner remaining in the room at the time - which might be thought extraordinary, but I was determined to abide by it.</p>
               <p>RICHMOND MOORE. I am a policeman - about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning of the 1st of January, I was walking down North-bank, Regent's-park, on duty - my attention was attracted by a noise which I heard on Captain 
               <persName id="t18340102-53-person473">Grindlay</persName>
            's premises; and, while I hesitated whether I should go and see what was the matter, the prisoner made his appearance out of the front gate without his shoes, attempting to make his escape; on which I ran in front of him, and asked him who he was - he told me he was Captain 
               <persName id="t18340102-53-person474">Grindlay</persName>
            's servant; on which he said, "I dare say you know me well enough" - I told him, I had no right to know any man coming out of a gentleman's house at that hour in the morning - upon putting his hand into his pocket, he said "Here, take this - it is Christmas time; the Captain won't let me go out in the day, and I am going out for a lark" - I told him unless he would go back with me to Captain Grindlay, and be recognised as being his servant, and he sanctioned his going out at that hour in the morning, I should take him as a prisoner - he then said, putting his hand out again, "Here is plenty to make it all right; and you are a d-d fool if you don't take it" - with that attempting to speak to me, he, at the same time, gave me a blow on my head, he put his foot out and threw me over on the ground, on my right shoulder - by the time I got up he was ten or fifteen yards in front of me, making his escape - I saw him throwing something from his pocket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020026"></xptr>as I supposed, a pocket-handkerchief - he dropped five successively, and told me to stop and pick them up - upon which I got very near to him, and told him I should not be bought with silk handkerchiefs, and that I would not be bribed by any man, for I was determined to do my duty; and told him if he did not surrender I would strike him on the head - he did not seem willing to surrender, and I struck him three blows on the arm with my staff; but, being injured a little by the fall, the blows made no impression on him; on which he closed in on me and we both fell to the ground - I held him as long as I could; but in a short time he made his escape a second time; and by the time I got up he might be twenty yards distant, but still in sight - on which I hallooed, "Stop thief;" and my brother constable,

            's, and as I went back I picked up the five handkerchiefs in the same place where I saw him throw them - he was searched at the station-house, and a gold watch, a guard-chain, a seal, a purse with two £5 bank notes and the two sovereigns and a half, a snuff-box, a ring (which Captain 
               <persName id="t18340102-53-person477">Grindlay</persName>

               <p>CAPTAIN GRINDLAY re-examined. I have the ring on my finger - it is mine - this is my watch - these are two £5 notes, which I believe to be the same I received at Coutts' the same morning, but I have not the numbers; but they were in my own purse - this pencil-case belongs to a memorandum-book which was returned to me before the magistrate - these are my handkerchiefs - the two sovereigns and a half were in the purse with the notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not break into the house, nor steal the articles named in the indictment - the articles were given to me by a person in the house - I had been out with a person living in the house for two or three hours in the evening, and I went outside at eleven o'clock, and when part of the servants were gone to bed, I returned, and one person came down and let me in, a person who I believe my counsel has named to Captain 
               <persName id="t18340102-53-person480">Grindlay</persName>

I believe it is fruitless to say any thing more, but that I leave it to your Lordship and Gentlemen of the Jury. Several gentlemen I have lived with, had I time to have let them know, could have given me a character, but the time has been so short nobody but the servants know I am here - I was only committed on the 1st of January.</p>

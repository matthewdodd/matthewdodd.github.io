On Monday Laremore went to this room ; I went after him; Laremore had the waistcoat, two table spoons and six tea spoons, and he sent them to Garth's; two punch bowls were likewise at Garth's, and the hanger; there we found some rings and a gold watch and chain put into a check case ; we took them to Long Acre, and Garth told us that he knew a Jew that lived in some square, I do not exactly recollect the name, that would buy them; Garth and I went there; he was not at home the first time ; we went a second time, and then we were bid to come again in the dusk; Laremore and I went to Garth's, and Garth and I went to the room in Long Acre; we met Laremore and Walker there;

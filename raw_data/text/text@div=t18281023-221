            . I am an officer. On the 1st of October, I went to No. 5, Perkin's-rents, Westminster, with another officer, and found Thomas Williams, Creeman, Henry, Taylor, and Elizabeth Williams, all in the room, and a quantity of carpenters' tools about the room; Creeman sat in a chair near the window, examining this saw, I asked how these tools came there; they all said they knew nothing about them - Elizabeth Williams was sitting up in bed sewing something; Taylor was in bed with her - I asked her who the room belonged to - she said to her, that she had taken it the day before; I asked if she could not give some account of the tools, or how they came there; she said she could not, as they came in the night before, while she was out - I asked how they came there; she said they were brought there - I asked if she locked the door; she said she had - I said "Was your place broken open, then?" she said she supposed it might be so - I examined the door, it had not been broken; she then said she had left the key with an Irish girl, but did not remember her name - I looked round the room, and saw Henry on a chair, and a jacket was at the back of his chair; I found a great coat hung up at the window as a curtain - I told Elizabeth Williams to get up; she said the Irish girl was out, and had got her shawl and shoes - I went to the door, and saw Chapman at a distance, she had the shawl and shoes on - I brought her in; she said she had the care of the place last night, while Elizabeth Williams was out, and that at eleven o'clock she went to Williams again with the key of the door - I searched further, and in Thomas Williams's hat I found a flannel jacket, and on the table a crooked nail, which I tried to the door of the workshop - it opens it very well; I heard Thomas Williams say at the office, that he was not seen at eight o'clock at night at the place, for he had all the property in a coach at Westminster by eight, and that none of the other prisoners had any thing to do with it - after the examination he told me where the things were pawned, and I found them; I had applied to some of the pawnbrokers before, and am sorry to say they denied having the things.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . This coat is mine - I had left it safe in the shop.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WILLIAMS' Defence. I was passing the shop, and saw no one - I took out a nail, and opened the door; took as many tools as I could, and gave a boy 6d. to carry them to a coach - next morning I pawned several of them; the other prisoners knew nothing about it - I asked Creeman to breakfast with me; I know nothing of the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>HENRY'S Defence. Taylor was taken ill, and sent for me.</p>
               <p>TAYLOR'S Defence. I was taken ill, and went to lay down in this woman's room - I sent for Henry, to tell my parents; he had not been in the room ten minutes, when the officer came.</p>

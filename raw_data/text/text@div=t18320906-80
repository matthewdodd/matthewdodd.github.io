On the 2nd of August I had some necklaces and trinkets, and money in a small box; I saw the box safe on the drawers in the parlour at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning; the drawers were within a few yards of the window, but not near enough for any one to put his arm in and reach the box - the window was open and the blinds down; on going into the room at a quarter before two o'clock I missed the box; it was shown to me by the officer about half-past two or three, broken to pieces - I found in it a pair of pearl ear-rings, which were under the part of the box which drew up; among other articles which I lost from the box, was one pearl necklace and one cornelian - I have seen the pearl necklace since and part of the cornelian.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the parlour on the ground floor? A. 
Yes, there is a railing before the window.</p>

             (Police-constable S 92). On the 2nd of August I saw the prisoner by the tap-room window of the Southampton Arms public house at Camden-town; three or four miles from Hendon, between nine and ten o'clock, in company with a boy named Gray and another girl - in consequence of suspicion I took the prisoner's address out of the bail-book at the station, and went to her lodgings in Jeffry's-buildings Westminster, on the 11th of August - I found her there; I searched and found this cornelian necklace, a gold watch, a silver thimble, and a china thimble: Warren, who was with me, found eight sovereigns - I told her I apprehended her on suspicion of being concerned in a robbery; she said she had nothing to do with it - I asked if she had seen Gray; she said No, she had not; I then asked whose the necklace was: she said it was hers, and had been given her by a cousin - we then took her to the station-house, and on the same day, the 11th of August, we took her before the Magistrate at Hendon - I told her in going along, it would be better for her to tell the truth to the Magistrate, but not to tell me any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you find these articles? A. In her box in the lodging; it was not locked, there was a quantity of women's clothes in it - there was only one bed in the room, she was in bed with a yound man named Chapple; he was taken, but discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found her in company with this man? A. Yes; he lived with her; I had known her some time - I saw her on the night of the 2nd of August, at Camden-town, which is in the road from Hendon to London, with Gray, which she denied.</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker in the Westminster-bridge-road. I know the prisoner; on the 4th of August she came to my employer's, and pawned this necklace for 9s.; there was another female with her; I asked the prisoner how much it cost; she said a gentleman purchased it, and I believe she said in the Strand, and made her a present of it - this is the counterpart of the duplicate I gave, it is in the name of Charlotte Clark, lodger, No. 4, Charlton-street, Somers'-town - this is a pearl necklace; I did not apprize her of the value of it; if she had asked 2l. I should have lent it; it might have cost 6l.; she was dressed quite in a fashionable manner, in a silk hat and silk dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not take her for an unfortunate woman? A. Yes, and they frequently take gold watches and other things to pawnbrokers.</p>

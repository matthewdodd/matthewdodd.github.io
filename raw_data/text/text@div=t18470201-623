Last Friday even<lb></lb>ing, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another female in the shop—J did not serve her—they came for a piece of ribbon—I saw her served—I observed that she was gone, and afterwards saw her brought back by the con<lb></lb>stable, who had this piece of print, which I had seen tied to a chair inside the door five minutes before—I know it by private mark—it is John Cunmer's property.</p>

On Friday even<lb></lb>ing, the 29th of Jan., I was walking in High-street, Borough, opposite Mr. Cunmer's shop—I saw the prisoner and another female coming out of the shop—when the prisoner was near the door she took a piece of print with her left hand, took it across her bosom, and tried to hide it underneath her shawl—I stopped her two or three yards from the door—she dropped the print—I said, "You have stolen that print, I shall take you back to the shop"—I could not take the other one—I am sure the prisoner is the person who came out of the shop—this is the same print.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How do you know he is the man? A. I tapped him on the shoulder, and looked him full in the face - he gave me a push on the breast, and threw the lead down at my feet - that staggered me, and I could not take him then - I was with him about a minute - I never saw him before - I pursued him eight or nine hundred yards - I saw his face before he came to me - I met him - it was as near half-past six o'clock as could be, and in Angel-alley.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Christopher-square, Long-alley. I am a turner - the prisoner is in my employ - he lived in my house, and slept in an adjoining room - on the morning of the 13th of March, I am confident he was not out of bed till past seven o'clock - my wife went to light the fire, and she said to him, "George, get up" - I saw him in bed, and heard his voice - he said, "I am coming" - I do not remember Mr. McDonald calling on me that morning - the prisoner has been an honest, sober man - I never knew him to associate with bad characters.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is your house from Angel-alley? A. About one hundred yards - I cannot tell how long it would take a man to run that distance, and jump into bed - my house is full of lodgers - they are all honest people, and keep good hours - the prisoner turns the wheel for me - he seldom gets up before seven o'clock.</p>

            . I am wife of this witness. The prisoner lived in our house - we take our meals in the room he sleeps in - on the morning of the 13th of March, I made the fire in the room where he was in bed - I remember Mr. McDonald calling that morning for a pair of pillars.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time do you go to bed? A. Sometimes about ten o'clock, sometimes later - the prisoner gets up about half-past seven o'clock; and when I awake him, he gets up at seven o'clock - I know Angel-alley and Long-alley - they are not far off - it is a large house, and many lodgers in it - the door is not often open - it makes a great noise when it is opened - I do not sleep very sound - I had gone to bed about eleven o'clock the night before - we had supped all together, and the prisoner went to bed - I did not hear the door open after that time - I did not hear any of the lodgers come in after I was in bed - they could not come in after the door was fastened, as it makes a great noise - when lodgers come home, I am obliged to get up to let them in - there is no key to the lock - there are ten rooms, and all are full of lodgers and children.</p>

Above two years - he told me he came from the north; he has not tendered me any sum of money - his friends attempted a negociation, but I always rejected it; they were troublesome to me, and I referred them to Mr. Harmer - his mother and sister wanted me to take something, but proposed no specific sum; I do not know what they said to Mr. Harmer.</p>

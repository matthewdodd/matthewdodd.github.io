               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you really mean to say you were sober? A. I do; I had 236l. about me - it was my own, and the produce of my labour -I lodge in Oxford-market, and am now at work at Lambeth, for Mr. Armstrong, as a journeyman plasterer - I am forty-three years old; I was unfortunately led away - I had my trousers and boots on in the room - I had met her between eleven and twelve o'clock - I had come from the seat of his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury that evening - I arrived in town about five; I had come from Croydon in a go-cart, which took me up outside the Swan - I did not go into a public-house - several persons were in the go-cart - I have had very excellent jobs, by which I got the money; I have not charged any body else with this - three persons were brought to the office on suspicion of having the property, but not by my desire; they were no doubt connected with the prisoner; I have not charged any body with it but her - this was all the property I had - I have been earning it since 1817 -I thought it safer about my person than to leave it in my box - I have jobs at great country seats - I took about 190l. with me down to the Archbishop's; I had not looked at my money that evening, but I knew by the weight of the gold that it was there - it was in my inside coat pocket, wrapped in a silk handkerchief, and in three separate brown papers.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had the notes? A. I had been no where but in respectable company - I am accustomed to come from Croydon in a go-cart - the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080112"></xptr>soner was taken on the 22nd of August; she had abaconded - I looked for her for three weeks - I do not often go to houses of ill-fame - I am single - I am not in the habit of carrying money about me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were the sovereigns in? A.In three separate pieces of brown paper, tied tight round with my handkerchief; I did not see the handkerchief in the morning, nor any of the paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker. The prisoner lodged with me for nearly twelve months, at No. 8, Queen-street, Mint, in the Borough. On the 28th of December, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I went up stairs to a room on the third floor, for a bed, which I had lent to two young women five or six weeks before, as they had none to lie on—they were no relations of the prisoner, nor did they live with him—he lodged in the same room With me on the first floor—when I went up I found the door shut—I knocked at it, and was answered by the prisoner, and he said, "I will get the bed immediately"—in five or six minutes be opened the door, and said, "Here is your b——bed"—the bed was then rolled down stairs, and he held a light in his hand, and said, "Come, you can come in and see if she is here"—I went in and told him it made no matter to me where she was, but he should be ashamed to commit such nastiness in a house where so many people lived—(I had been told that he and the young woman Mary Hurley had been in bed together that night, which made me go up for the bed)—there was no woman in the room then—there was a candle in the room, and a fire too—the prisoner had the candle in his hand—he said, "There are so and so bad in the house," alluding to other lodgers—I came down to my own room—I went up again in a minute or two afterwards, and when I got very near the door the prisoner threw the candlestick from his hand into the room—he was inside the room—I observed the light</p>

               <p>thrown on the floor as I stood on the stairs—as soon as I crossed the door, and got into the room 1 received a stab on my left thigh in front, from the prisoner—I fell on the boards, as my flesh trembled—I fell right on the spot—I called out to Fitzgerald, the landlord, and told him my leg was broken—he was in my apartment at the time—I said nothing lo the pri<lb></lb>soner—Fitzgerald came to my assistance, and as soon as I got up I fell again on the floor, and remained there some time—I had not felt any thing else done to me before Fitzgerald came—I could not remember what passed after the second fall—I became quite stupid after receiving the stab—I fell in attempting to get up of my own accord—that was after Fitzgerald came in—I did not know of any other harm being done to me except the stab on the thigh, but I found afterwards that I had received eight cuts, two on my forehead, and the remainder about my head, before and behind—two were on the back of my neck—I perceived that when I got to the hospital, about eleven o'clock the same night—I cannot tell when or how they were done—I came to myself at the hospital—I had a stab in the breast of my shirt, but it did not go quite to the flesh—it was a stab, or cut—it was done at the same time—I had not done or said any thing to the prisoner—I never offended him at all—I was ill from the 28th of December till last Monday morning—I was an in-patient of Guy's hospital till then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman. I know Mahoney and I have known the prisoner a short time. On the night of the 28th of December, be<lb></lb>tween nine and ten o'clock, I was there—I went up stairs to the first room for some money which Mary Hurley owed me—I went to her room, but received no answer at the door—I came down again, and met the prosecutor's wife in the passage—I then went up to Mahoney's room, and in about twenty minutes he went up stairs for the bed in Hurley's room—I was down stairs in his room, and saw him bring the bed down—he only remained a few mo<lb></lb>ments, and then went up stairs to the same room after some chairs—I was on the stairs behind him at the time, the door was open, and I saw the prisoner there before the light was put out—there was a candle when Mahoney first entered the room, but it was knocked out of the prisoner's hand—I cannot say whether he dropped it, or whether it was knocked out of his hand; but if it was, it was by Mahoney falling at the time—I saw the prisoner hit Mahoney about the head, as I thought, with his fist—Mahoney was</p>

               <p>down on the floor at the time—I did not observe how he came there—he fell right in the moment he entered the room, and the prisoner fell on the top of him—I did not hear a word spoken—Fitzgerald lifted Mahoney up, and was carrying him down stairs, and then I saw the prisoner take and kick him either about the shoulders or head, I cannot say which—it was a kick with his foot, not a blow—after the prosecutor was brought down I went up again with a light, and saw blood on the floor in two or three places, but it had been wiped up—I could see the places where it had been—there were two big places—Mahoney was in a dreadful state when he was brought down—I thought his bowels were in his small clothes—he was very in<lb></lb>sensible—we could make nothing of him—he was taken to the hospital in about half-an-hour—he got his senses a little before he went, but not much, I think—I cannot say whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand at the time he hit him—I did not see any instrument till I saw a piece of a knife produced next morning, which was found by the police in the next garret.</p>

On the night of the 28th of De<lb></lb>cember, I went to this house, No. 8, Queen-street, Mint, at very near ten o'clock, and went to an up-stairs room—I did not get admission on knocking, and broke the door open—I found nobody in the room—I saw the stairs were clotted with blood, and the floor of the room had blood fresh wiped off it—I only noticed that in one particular place on the floor, but on the stairs there were several places where the blood was not wiped up—it was between the two stories—I took the prisoner, about a quar<lb></lb>ter-past ten o'clock, in the adjoining garret—I asked him if he had got a knife about him—he said he had not—I asked him no more questions, but took him into custody—he was asked what he had stabbed the man with—he said he had no knife—I saw part of a knife picked up under a table in the garret where we found him—it appeared fresh broken—I found nothing more that night—I returned next morning, and a person who rented the garret, gave me the other part of the knife—she is not here—it is the point—I think it corresponds with the other part, but there is some doubt about it—where the woman found it I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a student at Guy's Hospital, and have been so six years and a half—I am twenty-four years old. On the 28th of December, the prosecutor was brought in about eleven o'clock at night, in a state of considerable exhaustion—I examined him, and found a very severe wound on the left thigh—it passed inwards and downwards, and was between four and five inches in depth—there must have been a great loss of blood—that was apparent from the state of his clothing—it was not bleeding the moment he arrived, but very shortly after it did bleed—I observed, I think, eight cuts on his head—they were merely su-perficial cuts—they must have been done by a cutting instrument of some sort—the wound in the thigh must have been made by a pointed and cutting instrument—he remained there until last Monday morning—the wound is not quite healed yet—there was very great danger attending the</p>

               <p>wound at first from the loss of blood, and from an operation that might have been required—he might have bled to death—I think this knife formed one blade, but there seems a portion of it gone now—if that was an entire knife, I think it possible it might have made the wound in the thigh—I think it must have been a sharper instrument, but it is pos<lb></lb>sible.</p>

               <p>I am a pupil in the hospital; I came home about twelve, the dial was gone, but I did not suspect it was stolen; I saw the window open in the middle of the room, the place where the dial was; the window opens into the garden, the garden is surrounded with will and paling.</p>
               <p>Then any person might get over it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How high were the pales? - I fancy about six feet, the other side of the pales goes into the Row just by the Infirmary, it is a room we always sup in at night.</p>
               <p>Court to Bennett. When you went to bed, at ten was that window open? - No, it was shut when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Did you leave any body in the room? - There was no person in the room, there were nurses in the ward; the night nurses they could get into the room if they pleased.</p>
               <p>Court to Kempson. Did you see any body in the room when you came home? - No, the nurse came with me with a candle.</p>
               <p>Ward is the house-keeper, were not these his particular apartments? - No; this room is for the use of the gentlemen and Mr. Ward if he chooses; it is the court room, we generally sit in it.</p>

               <p>How do you know that? - By the standing orders of the house, and the declaration of Mr. Ward.</p>
               <p>Is that for the property in his apartments? - For the property of all the goods.</p>
               <p>Suppose there were to be any beds stolen from the sick wards would he be liable for them? - He would be accountable by the standing orders.</p>

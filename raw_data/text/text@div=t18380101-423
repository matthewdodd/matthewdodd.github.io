I am inspector of Bank-notes to the Bank of England—(<hi rend="italic">examining the notes</hi>)—this £10 note uttered to Mrs. Shand is forged in paper, plate, and signature—this £5 note uttered to Barrett, is also forged in paper, plate, and signature—this £5 note uttered to Pallett, is also forged in every respect; also this uttered to Eales, in paper plate, and signature.</p>

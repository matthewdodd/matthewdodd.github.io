            . I was in Oxford-street - the prisoner came up, caught hold of me, and said, "Young man, where are you going?" I said home; she said, "Go with me;" I said No, I would go home - I walked further, and heard a halfpenny drop on the pavement; I caught hold of her hand, and said, "You have robbed me - I will give you in charge; I have lost my money and a key, which I can swear to;" she said, "There is a Policeman - give me in charge;" she crossed over to him, and said, "This young man gives me in charge;" I know I had half-crowns, shillings, and a sixpence, but not exactly how many - this is my key; I broke the ward, and had it soldered - I did not touch her.</p>

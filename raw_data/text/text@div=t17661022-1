I made a full stop. and with some difficulty got myself back again from them. I went on the other side the gate till the mob was dispersed; I was standing reading a play bill that was stuck up, the prisoner came and laid his hand on my shoulder as before, and said, They will all be acted tonight, meaning the plays; I seeing the place was pretty clear, went to go the way I was going before, they both let me go; when I was about three yards on this side the hospital-gate, again I found myself much about the same situation as before; they took hold of my shoulders as they had before; some of them cry'd again, Drivethro', drive thro'. I had a little money about me and my watch; I clapped my hand down and found my money was safe; they drove me almost down by showing me at my back; after I took my hand away the prisoner let go his hand, and went from me: then I missed my watch: I looked about me and said, I had lost my watch; he that was on my left hand said, You should have taken more care of it; said I, I will take care of you, you insulted me while my pocket was picked; a boy who was standing by me said, He has not the watch, I saw another man take it out of your pocket, and he is gone that way, pointing towards Pye-corner. I was afraid to trust to him; then another boy said he saw him take it, and desired I would go that way with him, and he would shew me him; I went with them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220003"></xptr> and looking down towards Newgate-street, the the first boy said, there he goes, pointing to the prisoner; he was in Windmill-court; the prisoner got by the side of a house; he seeing he was pursued, stooped down, I saw him put his hand behind a spur-stone; I had a suspicion he had laid my watch down there; I ran after him and took him by the arm, and said, give me my watch; he said he had not got my watch, I might search him; said I, I saw you stoop at that place, you shall go back to it; I pull'd him; he said, what are you going to break my arm; I got him to the place, there lay my watch; I took it up and called for a constable; a gentleman near us said, you are a constable yourself, do you take care of him; I brought him here to the Old Bailey, the court was sitting; I took him into an inward room before an Alderman; the prisoner began first to tell his story; he said he was a Whitechapel officer, a housekeeper, and a citizen of London; I believe he is a Whitechapel officer; I have seen his name on a sign as such, in George-yard, Whitechapel.</p>

            . I am a hot-presser, and live in Chiswell street; I do not know the prisoner at all; I saw him pick up a watch the first day of Bartholomew-fair, in Smithfield, about five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Howard. It was betwixt the Cloyster-gate and the Red-cow, that is, on this side the gate, that is in the path way between the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people there at the time?</p>
               <p>Howard. No, there were but very few; I saw him stooping, and saw it lie before him on the ground; he put it directly into his right hand pocket as he rose up: I do not know whether he put it in his coat or waistcoat pocket, then he went on towards the Red-cow</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him upon his finding it?</p>
               <p>Howard. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in Smithfield at that time?</p>
               <p>Howard. I was out of work</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know of the prisoner's being taken up?</p>
               <p>Howard. I heard he was in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear that?</p>
               <p>Howard. That was two or three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Howard. That was of a stranger at a public-house, the Ship in Drury-lane; he told me a man was taken up for picking a pocket in Bartholomew-fair, and committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon that?</p>
               <p>Howard. I said I saw a man pick up a watch there; this was one Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>Howard. I went to Newgate out of curiosity on the Sunday to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you?</p>
               <p>Howard. No, I went alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you enquire for?</p>
               <p>Howard. I did not enquire for any body; the gate was open, and I went up to the door; there I saw the man by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Howard. I said, So you are got here for picking the watch up; he said yes, I am got here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you said?</p>
               <p>Howard. It was all I said, all that passed between us; I just looked round on the rest of the prisoners, and then came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got a subpoena?</p>
               <p>Howard. I have (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by it?</p>
               <p>Howard. A woman brought it to me yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the prisoner you knew any thing about the watch?</p>
               <p>Howard. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you lived?</p>
               <p>Howard. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came he to know how to send you the subpoena?</p>
               <p>Howard. I told it to the landlord at the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you guess how the woman that brought the paper came to know your name, or the place where you live?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220004"></xptr>Howard. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she find you?</p>
               <p>Howard. She brought it me where I work, at the Bell in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you used the Ship alehouse?</p>
               <p>Howard. I have for this month past.</p>
               <p>Q. What work are you employed in at the Bell in Drury-lane?</p>
               <p>Howard. I am a hot-presser.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that woman was that brought the subpoena?</p>
               <p>Howard. I know nothing of her; I cannot say who she is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner ask you where you lived?</p>
               <p>Howard. No; I told the landlord at the Ship I saw the man pick up a watch; he asked me my name and place of abode, in order that I might be sent for if wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your master's name?</p>
               <p>Howard. His name is Cornish.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect any particular circumstance relative to a man whose pocket was pick'd in Smithfield?</p>
               <p>Cousins. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Howard upon that subject?</p>
               <p>Cousins. No; I never changed any words with him, any further than serving him with liquor; I never heard a word about such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he saw a watch picked up in Smithfield by a man who was accused with stealing it?</p>
               <p>Cousins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask him his name or place of abode, in order that he might give evidence about it?</p>
               <p>Cousins. No, I know nothing about it?</p>
               <p>Court. He has been telling us that a stranger was telling him one Sunday evening, at your house, that there was a man taken up for picking a pocket of a watch in Smithfield, and that he told you he saw that man pick up a watch from off the ground; and that you desired him to tell him his name and where he lived, in order that you might send for him when wanted.</p>
               <p>Cousins. There were never no such words pass between us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cornish. Howard work'd with me a month last Saturday; I hired him for a month certain, then he left me. I know no more of him.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 24, Swallow-street, I am a pewterer and brazier, I bought this copper of the two prisoners, and gave them ten-pence a pound for it; I believe I bought of the two prisoners in the whole 40 lb. or better.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day? - A. Part on the 12th of January, part on the 14th, part on the 15th, and on the 16th I bought seven or eight pounds of copper of the prisoners</p>
               <p>Q. Can you shew us what you bought on the 16th? - A. I really could not tell was it ever so, it was all put together inside of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Does all the copper belong to you? - A. I judge so, because I have missed as much more as is here.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ewster.) Which is the one taken in the basket? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any part you sold there? - A. Yes, this one piece.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there for the purpose of detecting this? - A. Yes; he told us what he bought of the two prisoners afterwards, when we found him out, but not at first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How long was it before you found him out? - A. I informed him on the Thursday, as we found him out on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you sold this last parcel, you informed your master of it? - A. No, after we had sold this last parcel; we sold this on the Queen's birth-night, on Friday the 18th, and on Saturday they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Buckingham.) When did you buy it? - A. I cannot directly say.</p>
               <p>Q. It is another piece, sold on a different day? - A. I cannot tell whether they came on a different day or together.</p>
               <p>Q. Take another piece, when did you buy that? - A. In the course of the four purchases.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy your purchases? - A. First on the 12th of January, second on Monday the 14th, third on Tuesday the 15th, and the fourth on Wednesday the 16th; they are all here, I believe; the greatest part was brought on Monday, I believe, that was twenty pounds; eight pounds on the 15th, eight pounds and a half on the 16th, six pounds and a quarter, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know which parcel it is you bought on the 16th? - A. This is a piece I bought on the last day, I am sure of it, by reason it was put in the fire; it was very thick with lead, I was taken in with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other day on which you purchased any with solder? - A. There were; I did not see it till after I purchased the last time, and then I took a small allowance for it, but not enough. (The witness handed a card to Mr. Gurney.)</p>
               <p>Q. You give me this card that I might know your address; is this your writing? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose writing is it? - A. A little boy's of mine, that I asked to put it down, it is merely for a memorandum.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it, and tell me whether it is your's, or your little boy's? - A. It is my writing I see.</p>
               <p>Q. Both by this piece of paper, and this card, they do not agree with your evidence: they make the solder sold on the 15th? - A. No, the solder on the 16th.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200018"></xptr>Q. Now which is correct, your paper or your evidence? - A. Both, I hope.</p>
               <p>Q. Take your choice, which is correct, both is impossible; was it Tuesday or Wednesday? - A. Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you point out any one piece, except that one piece you gave me now, that you bought on the Wednesday? - A. This is another piece I bought on Wednesday, I think there were six pounds and a quarter; they were reckoned five shillings, and for which there did not weigh three pounds of copper when the lead was taken off, it came to four shillings; there were several pieces of this kind.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were first questioned by the officer, you said you had bought none? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When Ewster came to your shop, you told him you had not bought copper of these persons? - A. The young man came into the shop to ask me if I bought copper; I told him I must know whether they got it honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you, in point of fact, did you or did you not, deny having purchased copper? - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) How much copper have you lost in this house? - A. I suppose double the quantity, and more.</p>
               <p>Q. What pieces have you matched to your house? - A. Only two or three pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to shew us the two or three pieces? - A. These two pieces match exactly; we did not try any more.</p>
               <p>The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence, but called three witnesses each, who gave them a good character.</p>

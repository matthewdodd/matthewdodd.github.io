               <p>Q. In the month of May last, in consequence of finding a deficiency, did you mark the crank winders for register stoves - A. I did; I began to mark them on the 2nd of May. On the 17th of June I missed six. After Stredder was gone to dinner, I examined them; on the Friday and on the Saturday I missed them. I counted them every night after I marked them.</p>
               <p>COURT. You had marked all you had in the manufactory, had you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose keeping were they - A. In Stredder's, they were kept in a drawer in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that drawer near the spot where Stredder worked - A. Yes; he was mostly in sight of the drawer, except when he was sent out of an errand, which was not often.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that drawer kept locked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Were there any other persons working in this room where the drawer was - A. No; Stredder was the time keeper, he was not a labourer; he had to keep the men's time, and to take care of many articles; and among other these crank winders; the workmen had no business there unless they come to Stredder. I examined on that day and missed six. In the course of that evening Brewer came, he brought three dozen and a half of crank winders; I examined them, they were brought as new goods; I paid him seven seven shillings and six-pence a dozen for them. On my examining of them, I found half a dozen of them with marks, which I myself had put. These are them, it is a little nick with a file.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did this man used to be paid upon delivery - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your discovering that these were half a dozen that you had marked, what did you say to him - A. I said nothing to him, I went for an officer; I left him with Mr. Bound, and when the officer came, Mr. Bound gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever give Stredder leave to lend winders to Brewer - A. No, I forbid him to lend them to Brewer or to any other person; the reason was that Brewer two or three years back was in the habit of borrowing; when I had a partner he might have the liberty of my partner; he used to say they were returned; probably they were not returned; consequently I forbid to lend to Brewer for two years back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any application recently before this happened to lend to Brewer - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rendall. At the time that Stredder said he had lent these half dozen to Brewer for a particular customer - did Brewer say any thing - A. The magistrate asked him why he brought them in again; he said he wanted to make up a bill, and that was the reason he brought them.</p>

Mr. Bound says he refused me two years ago, he has only dissolved partnership since the 1st of January last, since then I have borrowed of him, I always returned them. I asked Stredder to lend me half a dozen; he lent them me; I told him I would return them the next week Mr. Bound cannot say that ever he heard the least slur upon my character.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you know of this transaction, or was any application made to you by Stredder or Brewer - A. None at all. The partnership has been dissolved since January last; in Mr. Greensmith's time I gave positive orders not to lend.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bound, you have lent me within this six or seven months yourself - A. That is not so; I have forbid Brewer myself of having any lent.</p>

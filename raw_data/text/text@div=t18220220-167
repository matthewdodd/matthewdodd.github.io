            . I am an officer. On Sunday morning, the 3rd of February, I was at the Palace at the time of the relief. I saw Sooley with a child in his arm, and two by his side. Barnett was close to his left side, and the two prisoners were a little in the rear. Sooley was holding the child up. I watched Barnett, and I suppose he saw me; for he drew back. I then went behind the crowd, so as not to be perceived. I came in sight again, and saw Barnett draw back again, and come on a level with the other two. I then went quite out of sight, and heard an alarm given of a robbery, and immediately missed the prisoners. I went outside the Palace, and met Leary running after them. We ran in different directions, and in three or four minutes came into the Park, and at the gate of Cambridge-house, saw the three prisoners. Leary said, he was sure they were the persons - we ran towards them, and on getting near them, one shot a few yards a-head, and Barnett immediately ran away. I called out,</p>
               <p>"It is no use to go, Barnett, for I shall have you." He still continued running - I pursued, calling Stop thief! and told the witness to stop the others. A gentleman caught at Barnett - they reeled over in the road together. I came up and secured them. He put his hand to his coat pocket - a person caught hold of his pocket, and held it till we got to the watch-house. I found two shillings in his coat, and four in his waistcoat. Johnson made considerable resistance when I was going to handcuff him. I lost the prosecutor, but he came to the office next morning.</p>

            . I was at the Palace. Johnson and Jones stood before the prosecutor, and were looking in his face; they observed me looking at them. I turned my head, and on looking round again, I saw Barnett's hands in Sooley's pockets. He went out of the yard, and the other two followed him. I went to Sooley, told him to examine his pockets, and told him to follow Jones and Johnson out, and perhaps he would get his money. He went out, returned in a few minutes, and asked me to go and shew them to him. I went to the stable-gate, and saw the three prisoners opposite the bridge in the Park. I am sure of their persons. When I got within twenty yards of them, Barnett saw me, and ran off. I followed and he was stopped.</p>

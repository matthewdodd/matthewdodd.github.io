                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Leadenhall-street. On the 26th of June, about a quarter to three o'clock in the afternoon, Meyer came into my shop and asked me to show him some rings—I did so—he selected one at five guineas, and desired me to substitute some rubies for the emeralds—he left me a ring with a crystal in it, requesting I would put a garnet in it—the ring cost about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., independent of any stone—there were some rings in a tray lying near where the prisoner was standing—I should think 300 or 400—before he left the shop, from an intimation my brother gave me, I entertained some suspicion—my younger brother followed him, but did not succeed in tracing him—I did not think myself justified in seizing him at the time—I afterwards found that a diamond ring was miss<lb></lb>ing, worth twenty guineas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the last witness. On the 26th of June, some time before three o'clock, Meyer came into the shop—my brother showed him some rings—I observed one of them was missing, and followed him out of the shop, and immediately caught sight of him just after he passed Lime-street—he had got some short distance—he joined Berg under the portico of the India-house—Berg could not see the shop from where he was placed—when Meyer joined Berg, he entered into conversation with him for about a minute—they were then standing at the door of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not see anything pass between them—they separated—Meyer walked on a little further and hailed a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, with his stick pointing westwards—he got in and we drove off towards St. Paul's—when I returned, Berg was in the other <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the horse's head was towards Whitechapel, but still stationary where I had left it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Berg.

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, and live at No. 2, Spring-gardens, Charing-cross. On the 22nd of June the prisoner Berg engaged apartments at my house, along with Meyer his friend, as he represented him—he called him Leopold Burlington—Berg said that Meyer was a young gentleman come from Germany; that his friends were very rich; and he had come over here to stop for six weeks or two months—Berg did not lodge with me, he came as Meyer's friend—they were not lodging together—I used to see Berg at Meyer's frequently—on the 26th of June, about nine or ten o'clock in the morning, Berg came—I cannot say whether they went out together—I did not see anything more of them till Berg came in from half-past three to five o'clock, I cannot swear exactly—Meyer came in about a quarter of twenty minutes past five—he did not sleep there that night—he said nothing about where he was going—Berg had come in great agitation and trouble about his friend—he had a newspaper, and was up and down stairs in great agitation, saying, "Is my friend come yet?"—Meyer came a little after five—Berg came down stairs to make up the bill, and said they were going away directly—I was surprised, as they had only been there four days—they paid me, and went off in great hurry and excitement—Berg said they were going to some German Baron in South or North Audley-street.</p>

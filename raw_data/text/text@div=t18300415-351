            . I am warehouseman to the prosesecutor; no persons sleeps there. On the Saturday evening I had been at the warehouse at six o'clock -I locked it up; I am sure it was secure - the outer door had a lock and a padlock; I went there at eight o'clock on Monday morning, and found the lock of the outer door had been broken, and the hasp of the padlock had been wrenched, so that any one could get in - I did not observe any other mark of violence on the door: I went up three or four steps, and there was another door which had been broken open, and then a third door, which gave access to the tea - I missed some, but I cannot say how much; there were twelve, and ten of them had been emptied - they held 90lbs. or 100lbs. in each; a great quantity was spilled about - I crossed the yard to Mr. Brandon's cellar; it goes by the name of Brandon's warehouse - we occupy one wing and Mr.

            . I am a fishmonger, and live in Creechurch-lane, almost opposite the warehouses. I came down about half-past six o'clock that morning, and saw a cart loading at the warehouse-wall; the prisoner and another man were putting bags into the cart, but I only saw two come out of the middle warehouse window, even with the street - I never saw any thing brought out that way before - I did not notice how many bags were in the cart, but there must have been five besides the two I saw put in, as when it was stopped, there were seven in it; two more young men came out of the cellar window, and went away with the other person who was with the prisoner - the prisoner went on in the cart, but was taken before he got to the London Tavern; he went along Leadenhall-street, and I gave information - he appeared to be the driver; the other three men got away, and the prisoner got into the cart and rode off - he had assisted in putting the two bags into the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the men? A. Not above twenty yards, at my own door; the door was open, and the prisoner was carman - I did not hear the others give the prisoner any directions; they spoke together about two minutes.</p>

            . I am an officer of Aldgateward. I received the information when the cart had just got beyond St. Mary-axe - I pursued and came up with it; the prisoner only was with it - I stopped the horse; the prisoner was taken by my brother officer - he had no opportunity of leaving the cart; he said he was hired by two or three men to go and load in Creechurch-lane - he did not say who the men were, but he was to meet them by Bishopsgate-church; he did not know where the things were to go to - there were seven bags of tea in it, which weighed 499.lbs; I know the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150149"></xptr>warehouse perfectly well - he was not going the nearest way to Bishopsgate-church; he said he was hired, and was told to come the back way to the warehouse - it was a small chaise cart.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say a word before the Magistrate about the back way? A. No; I was not asked what he said - he did not immediately say he was hired; it might be five minutes - it was at the watch-house he said so; he was not asked on the spot in my presence - we passed Creechurch-lane; he did not point out the spot to me - he said he was hired to take a load from a warehouse in Creechurch lane.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it at the watch-house, or before you got there that you asked him this? A. As soon as I took him - I did not ask him again at the watch-house; the other officer went out several times, but I staid there all the time he was at the horse's head. and I took the prisoner some yards from the cart - we did not go back to the watch-house together; he never said at the watch-house that three men had hired him, and told him to go to Bishopsgate-church - he told me so when I stopped him; I think he pointed down Creechurch-lane - as we were going down Leadenhall-street. he did not mention the name of the lane; the other officer was leading the horse - I did not go to Bishopsgate-church.</p>

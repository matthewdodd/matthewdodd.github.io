                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Curtis, and occupy a parlour in the house of Alexander Ross, No. 13, Little Albany-street, Regent's Park, in the parish of St. Pancras—Ross lives in the house. Last Friday night I went to bed about a quarter to ten o'clock—I did not fasten the door—my ton came home after I was gone to bed—in the course of the night I heard a noise in the house—I did not get up then, but went to sleep again—I got up about a quarter before four in the morning, went into the passage, found the back door wide open, and the things stated gone—some had been on the line in the passage, and some in the yard behind the house—they were wet—the back door had been opened from within—it had been bolted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Last Saturday morning, a little after two o'clock—I was on duty in Munster-street, Regent's Park, about 130 yards from the prosecutor's house—I saw the two prisoners turn out of Little Albany-street, in a direction leading from the prosecutor's house—they took the middle of the road, leading into Munster-street, side by side, apparently in company—as they came towards me they parted—Sweet went towards the New Road, and Saunders towards Bruton-street—on her pawing me I observed she had a bundle—I called to know what she had—she made no answer, but appeared to hurry on—I stepped after her, and said I must see what she had got—she said she would see me b----d first—I then took hold of her arm, and said I must see what she had—she immediately threw the bundle into the road—a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>, who was passing at the time, picked it up, and put it under my arm—I was about conveying her to the station, when one of my comrades came up, and said there was a man with her—I said, "Yes, there he goes along the street, go and fetch him back again"—he was still in sight in Osnaburgh-street, which is in a line with Munster-street—another constable went in pur<lb></lb>suit of him, while I took the female to the station—in going along I asked where she got the things—she said the man had given them to her—I asked what man—she said the man that the policeman had gone after—on getting to the station the prisoners denied all knowledge of each other—the bundle con<lb></lb>tained the articles stated, which were wet—in the morning, as I was coming along Munster-street, I saw a brother constable pick up this latch-key, in the very spot where the bundle had been thrown—he handed it to me—I after<lb></lb>wards tried it to the prosecutor's door, and it opened it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Knill Kinsman, at No. 57, Lincoln's Inn-fields, in the parish of St. Giles. On Thursday evening the 4th of June, I was sent out by my master, and when I came home, I met the prisoner about three hundred yards from master's house—he had a bundle with him—I did not know him before—after I had got home, the servant told me something, and I proceeded up to master's bed-room—I found the clothes taken from the wardrobe—I missed trowsers and coats—I did not examine to see the exact number—I proceeded down, and informed my master, and then went with all possible haste to overtake the prisoner, but could not—the bed-room is on the third floor—my master was sitting on the first floor—I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken into custody.</p>

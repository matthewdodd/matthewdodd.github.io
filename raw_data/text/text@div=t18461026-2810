                  </hi>. I live in Little Windmill-street, Haymarket; I am a ser<lb></lb>vant out of place. On Saturday, the 19th of Sept., I was walking in Saint George's market, Southwark—I had in my pocket a tobacco-box, containing a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note—the money had been left me by a master I formerly lived with—I had put it in the Moorfields savings-bank, and had drawn out these notes on the 10th of Sept.—I was going to make use of it, as I had not any money—the prisoner accosted me in St. George's market, and asked me to stand some drink—we had a quartern of gin, and after that we had a pint of porter—I was induced to pull out my tobacco-box in the public-house to see that I had my money safe—the prisoner was there, but I was not aware that she saw it—I returned the tobacco-box to my pocket she asked me to accompany her home, and I went with her to No. 19, Re<lb></lb>vell's-row—after</p>

               <p>some conversation with the woman in the house we went to a room up stairs—I put my coat on the bed-rail—my tobacco-box was safe in my coat-pocket then—the prisoner then came and sat on the side of the bed<lb></lb>rail, and soon after she went down, saying she would bring up some gin and water—finding she did not return I put on my coat, and I missed the tobacco<lb></lb>box and the money—the witness Williams came up and said the prisoner was gone, and I had better go—I am sure the prisoner is the woman who was in the room with me—this is my tobacco-box, and this handkerchief is also mine—it is marked—I told the policeman he would find my initials on it, "H.H."</p>

The prisoner and pro<lb></lb>secutor came there—the prisoner came down in two minutes—she told me to go up stairs, and she went out—she did not come back—the prosecutor went to the station, and when he returned he complained of his loss—they took me, because a shirt front was found in the drawer—I went to make the bed, and found it—the prosecutor could not swear to that front—he gave me money for something to drink—I sent another female for it.</p>

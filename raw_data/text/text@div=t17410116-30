               <p>Mr. Ward. On Sunday the 28th, of Sept. last, I found one of my Chamber Windows in <placeName id="t17410116-30-crimeloc155">Staples-Inn</placeName>

I am positive I made my Chambers and my Desk secure about 8 o'Clock; the Window was fasten'd with a Shutter, and a Pin put through it; but the next Morning between 7 and 8, I found the Shutter cut open. The Prisoner was my Barber's Servant, and I never suspected him 'till his Master came to me, and gave me sufficient Reason to believe that he was the Person who had Robb'd me; then I took him up, and had him examin'd by Mr. Justice De Veil, and he there confessed that he was the Person that robb'd me. The next Day we carry'd his Box to the Justices, and searched it; we found in it nine Moidores, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160016"></xptr> double Moidore and half; we likewise found a Guinea and half in the Prisoner's Pocket, which he confessed was part of my Money.</p>

The breeches were produc'd, and he charged the prisoner with stealing them, and desir'd he'd give him his money again; the prisoner gave him two half crowns and a shilling, then two shillings, then he went before Justice Withers, and he committed the prisoner, then the prisoner declared he had stole them in Lumbert-Court, and gave me directions to the owner; he said he took them that morning; he also acknowledged in Bridewell he had the half guinea that fell out of the breeches, and bought himself a pair of leather breeches with it.</p>

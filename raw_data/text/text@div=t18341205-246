                  </hi>. I occupy a house in the parish of Harrow-on-the-Hill, in Middlesex—I am a farmer's man. I left my house on Saturday, the 29th of November, at half-past five o'clock in the morning—the prisoner was taken that day, and brought to me where I work, about a quarter of a mile from my house, a little before twelve o'clock—I knew him before—he was a fanner's man, and belongs to the same parish as me, but he had no work, I believe—William Ball brought him to me—Ball's house and mine join together—it is all under the same roof, only there is a partition be<lb></lb>tween—you go into the two houses by different doors—when he was brought to me he had all my property about him—my wearing apparel, and other articles—I had left my wife in the house—I had not gone home be<lb></lb>fore the prisoner was brought to me—he had a velveteen jacket, two waist<lb></lb>coats, one with sleeves, and the other without, a pair of small clothes, a hat, three clasp knives, a razor, a little box, and two handkerchiefs—I had seen them all safe that morning before I went out—I knew them again perfectly well when I saw them—the prisoner had my hat on his head, and the other wearing apparel tied up in a shawl, belonging to the witness's mother, and the knives, razors, and other little things were in his pocket—the first word he said was, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, forgive me, and I will never do so any more"—I had said nothing to him at all—I had not said he had better confess, nor had Ball, in my hearing—I shut the door when I went away, but my wife locked it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to King. On Saturday morning, the 29th of November, a little after ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner come through the field where I was at work, towards our houses—he had nothing with him that I could see—I said nothing to him—I saw him come back a little after eleven o'clock, with a bundle, the same way as he had gone—he had a new hat on—he was not more than two or three hundred yards from our house—he had a bundle tied up in a silk shawl belonging to my mother—I knew the shawl, and went and collared him—I asked what he had got there—he said, his own clothes—I told him they did not belong to him—he said, "They are yours; let me go"—I said I would not, and that I would take him away to King, for he had got his hat on his head—I knew it was King's hat—I took him to King—I neither said it would be better or worse for him if he did, or did not confess—I took him to King between eleven and twelve o'clock—we left the things in possession of James Rowe, the officer, who has them now.</p>

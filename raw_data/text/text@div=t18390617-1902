                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Farey, the surveyor to the trustees of the Essex and Middlesex turnpike roads—they have stones in their yard, near Stratford Dock—on the 17th of May I observed some<lb></lb>thing about the lock of the gate which induced me to sit up that night—about half-past three o'clock I saw Valentine watering his horses, and about five minutes past five o'clock I saw him drive his horses and cart and a load of stones out of the yard—he came over Bow-bridge, and turned down the by-way towards Old Ford and Bethnal-green—I got the assistance of the policeman, and we watched the cart till it came to Bethnal-green-road, near the Salmon and Ball, when Valentine left his horses, and was away about ten minutes—he then came back again, and put the bag on his horses, and stood by his horses for an hour and a half—he then shot the stones down by the side of the road, where there</p>

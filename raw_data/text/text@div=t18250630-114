            . I am in Bonnick's employ. I took the trunk on the 16th of June, to go to No. 27, Commercial-road - I had to stop in <placeName id="t18250630-114-crimeloc576">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. Between five and six o'clock. I had never seen the prisoner before, but I took notice of him when I took this trunk from him.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner on the 16th of June, in company with others, run down Billiter-street, and then into Seething-lane; I cried Stop thief! and pursued - I took him in Seething-lane, between two and three hundred yards from Lime-street; I took him into custody, and brought him back to Falkener; he said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want with me? I have done nothing?" Faulkener said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man - he has stolen a trunk from my cart." I took him to the Compter. He owned his hat (which had fallen off in the street) when he was before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he cry Stop thief? A. Yes, but there was no person before him.</p>

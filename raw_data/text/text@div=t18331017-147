On the 20th of September, my premises were broken open in the morning, and I missed the articles stated; I printed a handbill, offering a reward; I heard that the prisoner had offered an air cane and some caps to Mr. Seager - we went to the prisoner's house, and found on him two knives, and a duplicate for half-a-dozen knives; I lost an air cane, out of repair, and it had a split close by the trigger, which was done by the key.</p>

            . I am a gun maker; the prisoner came to me on the 24th of September, he brought an air cane, and two boxes of copper caps, which had about five-hundred in each - I would not purchase them, but I took two caps, one out of each box - this is one of them; he wanted the cane repaired, and said it was for sale; I took the lock off in his presence, it wanted a main spring and a tumbler; part of the cane was broken, about an inch and a-half from the top of it.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WILLETT. The cane I lost exactly cor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170088"></xptr>responded with this description - I cannot swear to these caps, but they correspond with what I had.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Seager said at Hatton Garden, that he saw the bill in Mr. Willett's window, the day after these things were offered.</p>

            . No; I saw it at Mr. Willett's warehouse several days afterwards; the cane was like a walking stick - it wanted an air pump and a top; it was in one piece, it could not be parted; there was a split in the breach of it - it was yellow, resembling bamboo, and had a straight top; the caps were English caps - we call them town-made; they were not French; I had the boxes in my hand, and took the heads off - I did not state at the office, that I went into the country in search of him - I went on my own business.</p>

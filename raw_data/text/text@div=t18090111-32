            . I am a watchman. On Friday evening, the 9th of December, about ten o'clock, coming up Red cross street, I met the prisoner; he was standing with a bundle of leather between his belly and the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you were passing by - A. Yes; I made a full stop to look at him; he asked me to help him up with it; I did, and went on, and the prisoner went on; I suspected he did not come honestly by it. I went to the watchhouse and called Mr. Hedger; Mr. Hedger and I went after him up Paul's alley; in a court in Paul's alley, heard something fall, then I laid hold of the prisoner and called Mr. Hedger; Mr. Hedger knocked at a door and got a light; he found the leather about three or four feet off him; then we conveyed him to the watchhouse; I asked him where the leather was; he said he knew nothing of the leather.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the same man that you helped up with the leather - A. Yes; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You had passed Paul's alley for the purpose of getting Hedger - A. Yes, and when Hedger and I came from the watchhouse, he went up Paul's alley; it is a thoroughfare; there I met him; I stopped him when I heard the bundle fall.</p>

            . I was ward beadle at the time; setting the watch near ten o'clock, Porter came and gave me information; in consequence of that I went down Paul's alley with Porter; the night was very dark, I overshot Porter; Porter turned into Jackson's court, and said I have got the man; I then laid hold of the man by the collar, took him three feet back and knocked at a door for a light; we accused him of having the leather; he said he knew nothing about it; and in looking about four feet from the man, in one corner, there was the leather; we then took the leather and the man to the watchhouse and searched him; we found nothing but a knife, a pocket handkerchief, a seven shilling piece and half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any body else in either of these alleys - A. No, nobody but me, Porter and the prisoner.</p>

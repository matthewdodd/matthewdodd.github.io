            . On the 13th of April I gave the prisoner some money, but he saw me take that from the till; I gave him a sovereign and a half-sovereign about four month ago, in Old Gravel-lane, which is about a quarter of a mile from my father's house - I gave it to him as I was going to school; he had come that morning, and said if I did not let him have 30s. he would tell my father - I took it from my father's cash-box; he has frequently shown me a paper directed to my father, as I was standing at the bar - he said it was to let my father know of the transaction if I did not give him money; I saw the name of Pink on it.</p>

            . I took the prisoner. I said it was for inducing young Pink to rob his father - he said he knew nothing about him; I found this paper on him, and the duplicate of a musical snuff-box - I asked how he got this paper; he said he picked it up in Wapping, and he bought the snuff-box of Mr. Howard.</p>
               <p>The paper being read was scarcely legible, but related to something about the prosecutor's son giving money away, and was directed to the prosecutor.</p>

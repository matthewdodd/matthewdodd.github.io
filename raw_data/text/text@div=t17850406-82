               <p>On Tuesday the 8th of March, I lost a silver watch; I was going from Colledge-hill to the London tavern, where I live, between nine and ten going past the <placeName id="t17850406-82-crimeloc393">Mansion-house-gate</placeName>

               <p>Where was his hand? - His hand was very near to me, very near my fob, he had got my watch out; I immediately seized him by the collar, I gave the alarm of pick, pocket and thief; then the prisoner said, he is going to rob me, he is going to rob me, or something of that sort; and two or three people got between me and the prisoner, to wrench my hand away from his collar; I was struck upon the face and bit upon the left shoulder by somebody, I cannot say who; the mark was there for a fortnight afterwards; at that interval I lost my hat, and likewise my pocket handkerchief; I secured the prisoner, I never loosed him till he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see enough of the chain and seals to be sure it was your watch? - I am sure of it.</p>

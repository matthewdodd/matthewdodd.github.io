On the 1st of January I was in company with Davis, the constable of Ilford—I know Mrs. Hones—her house at Ilford is an empty house, belonging to Mr. Squih, in White Hart-yard, Ilford—I know the house where Susan White lives—that is in White Hart-yard also—White's house is about a yard from the window in which an entrance was made to an uninhabited house—I went with Davis to the uninhabited house on the let of January, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I had not then taken any body into custody—when I got there, Davis got in at the window, and opened the door, which was locked—I searched there, and found in the front room a lamb slaughtered, and hung up by a ham<lb></lb>mer in the way of <hi rend="italic">a gamble</hi>—the hammer was run through the hind legs—the lamb appeared quite fresh—the blood was dripping from the nose at the time—it was nearly cold—I found a knife lying under the nose of the lamb—Davis has it—I took Deller and Burton into custody, a very few minutes after making this discovery—I found them both in the White Horse public-house, not more than a hundred and fifty yards from the uninhabited house—Burton had marks of blood on his smallclothes, stockings, and shoes—it was quite fresh blood—Deller had a smock-frock) on, and on his smock-frock I observed two to three drops of blood—they appeared to be fresh—I found a great quantity of feathers in the house, of different descriptions, and part of the knuckles of deer, as the butchers call them—it appeared to have been made a camplete slaughter-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The brother was acquitted, because you said you might be mistake in the hand that touched your watch? A. Yes; as there were two or three round me, I might mistake which hand of the two rose up - the other man was nearest to me; I had been to Islington, but had nothing to make me intoxicated - I had part of two pints of beer before we started; we had a glass of gin, and two glasses of gin and water among five of us before we parted - I swore to the other man's person, but not that he struck me; when he was taken he said,</p>
               <p>"What the devil is the matter?" he was the only man who spoke to me; I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man who knocked me down - the other man surrendered to be tried, and so has the prisoner; I applied for a warrant when my wife got better, and he surrendered, but he was not to he found when I went fora officer to the gravel-pits - I saw he was not at work in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030080"></xptr>came across, and met him at the corner - he fell back to shun me, and went round somewhere; on the night of the robbery he had a fustian jacket on - I will not swear it was fustian; it was a brown jacket of that kind - he did not wear a coat; I gave his description at Worship-street.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife, and was with him - we were perfectly sober; three men met us as we were walking down the hill in the main road - the middle man had a bird-cage pack on his back; the right-hand man knocked my husband down - that was the prisoner; he did not say a word - I called out Watch! and Murder! - I looked at the prisoner, and said, "How dare you insult my husband, he never spoke to you?" he then up with his hand, and gave me a blow on the left eye -I swear he is the man: my husband, I believe, was getting up at that time; I cried Murder! - my eye swelled immediately very much; they all ran away in the same direction - the prisoner also called Watch! as we went up the hill we met the one with the pack coming back, and he said, "What the hell is all this about?" he has been tried, and acquitted; I had him secured by the watchman - I am certain the prisoner is the man who knocked my husband down, and struck me in the eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were just as certain about the other man? A. Yes - he had a bunch of onions; I also knew him by his clothes, and his face - I did not speak to his voice; I was in Newgate-street with my husband on the Tuesday afternoon - I had walked from Walthamstow that day; I suffered a good deal through it - I am sure he is the man.</p>

            , a gravel-digger, who was tried for this offence. On Sunday night, the 1st of November, I saw the prisoner at my house in St. John-street, Stoke Newington - he arrived there about twenty minutes past eight o'clock; he had on the coat which he now wears - he asked me to make him some tea, which I did; he laid his head down, and went to sleep, and about a quarter or half-past eleven o'clock went home to his lodgings, Bowling-green, Stoke Newington - he had been with me till then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How far is Stoke Newington from Clapton? A. I dare say it is better than two miles, or more, from Tile-kiln-lane - I know the time, for the eight o'clock beer had come; the lad had hardly gone from the door when he came, and we have a clock; my husband had been to Woodford that day to meet his father and two of his brothers - the prisoner was not one of them; he went out between three and four o'clock that morning, with a pack on his back; he did not return, but was taken to the watch-house - the prisoner lodges about a quarter of a mile from me; he did not tell me my husband was taken up - he has assisted my husband to catch birds on a Sunday, but seldom on a working day; he did not appear to have been running, but was very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>JAMES RICE. I work at the gravel-pits for Mr. Hindle- the prisoner has worked there for eight or nine years; I remember his brother being taken for this robbery on the Sunday; on the Tuesday after that the prisoner was at work with us from eight o'clock in the morning till sever at night all through the day; it was the 3rd of November - I went to dinner at twelve, and left him in the gravel-pits; I returned about a quarter to one - he has four brothers; they are not so much alike as to be mistaken for each other.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BARKER. I work at Mr. Roll's, and know the prisoner: I saw him on Sunday, the 1st of November, as near eight o'clock in the evening as can be, either before or after, in the footpath between Hobson's brick-fields, near Dalston - he had the same coat on as he has now, it was a long coat of the same colour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you ever see him in a jacket? A. Yes - Newington is about half an hour's walk from Dalston fields, but he was as tipsy as he could be; I have known him catch birds, but never on a Sunday - it was in frosty weather, when he could not work. I stood talking to him, and noticed his coat - I knew nothing of the last trial - I happened to say I had met him, and his brother came and asked me to come here; I heard the prosecutrix had said he had a jacket on - he was with me all day on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>JOHN HINDLE. The prisoner was upwards of ten years in my service, and is an industrious, sober, and honest man; I know he was at work in my field on the Wednesday, and I paid him for a day's work on Tuesday- Roberts was with me all day on Friday, and surrendered here about five o'clock; he could not have been in Newgate-street.</p>

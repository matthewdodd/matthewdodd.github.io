This acquaintance ori<lb></lb>ginated in consequence of my mother and myself residing very near to them in the same street; and having lent this young woman an apron during the week, I stood much in need of it. I had been on an er<lb></lb>rand for my mother into Bishopsgate-street, and on my returning home, having to pass by their door, I ran up stairs and inquired for her daughter, Mary Shannon, and was answered she was not within, but expected her home in a few minutes. I had my bonnet and shawl on me at the time; and as she was expected to return in a few minutes, I waited there. I most solemnly declare to you my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, I had not been in the room more than ten minutes when the officers came in and took me into custody, together with the other two female prisoners now at the bar with me. I humbly beg leave to state, that the officers who took me into custody, if required by your Lordship, can declare upon oath I had those articles upon me at the time they took me into custody. I therefore humbly hope this circumstance will convince you that I had not the smallest connexion, or was in any way interested in the business my fellow prisoners was then carrying on; and the circumstance that led me to their room was no other than what I have before described, to get an apron from her daughter that belonged to me."</p>

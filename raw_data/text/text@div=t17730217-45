               <p>White. We did a little business; she snatched it out of my pocket and ran down stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see this woman to ask her to get you a lodging?</p>
               <p>White. At the top of Bedford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see this woman before?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch at that time?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, because I put my hand upon it at the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not you drop your watch?</p>
               <p>White. No; I made search for it but did not find it; she ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she snatch the watch out?</p>
               <p>White. To the best of my knowledge between one and two on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. This was after you had had your gallantry together?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>White. I was not drunk: I had been in company with shop-mates.</p>

               <p>As I was going home I met this gentleman and two girls; they asked me to go and drink with them; I went; they began to quarrel and so I went home. Ask him if he did not say the other girl with him had robbed him the week before of some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that?</p>
               <p>White. No; one of the girls with her had bilked me of some money before.</p>

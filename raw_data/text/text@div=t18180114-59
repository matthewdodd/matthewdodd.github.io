            . I am a cheesemenger, and live in Broadway, Westminster. On the 16th of October, I met the prisoner, Turner, about a quarter after eight o'clock in the morning, by St. Clement's church, going towards Temple-bar, with a large bundle on her arm, with a towel over it. I said, "Cook, are you lost?" she said she was in a hurry, and passed me. The bundle appeared to contain linen; the towel did not quite cover it. I watched her till a waggon interrupted my view - I then went home. In about an hour and a half she came to my shop with a large bundle of greens, twice as large as the one she had before. I said, "Cook, are you returned?" she said, "I am. I said, "How you are splashed! where have you been?" she said, "to the King's Bench. I said that was not the road - She said, "No, to the King's Bench Chambers, which are her master's. She said, "The house has been robbed, and I have been to tell Mr. Pullen, the clerk, and he is coming down." I asked her where she was during the robbery? she said she slept at the top of the house. I asked her how she discovered it? she said, when she came down in the morning, she found a candle and a tobacco-pipe on the hall table. I asked her what they had taken? she said they had broken her master's drawers open, and had taken out the jewels and trinkets-that it was the painter's fault, as he desired her to leave the drawing-room windows open. She went away, saying she was going to the painter's. About eight o'clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Carter's house with Mr. Smith - She was then in the kitchen. I said, "Cook, do you deny having seen me this morning?" - I had been told she did. She said, "I do not deny meeting you, I deny having a bundle." I said, "You had a large bundle, and (pointing to the greens which laid there), tied up in the same towel." She said, "Yes, I had those greens." I said she had them when she came to my shop, but I could swear that when I met her at St. Clement's she had not those greens. She said I might swear any thing, and she would swing for it. I went away.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PULLEN. I am clerk to Mr. Carter. About half-past nine o'clock in the morning of the 6th of October the prisoner came to me at the Chambers, and said the house had been robbed - I said I would come down immediately - She had no bundle.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 16th of October, about one o'clock, I examined the house, there were no marks of violence whatever. I learned that Turner was acquainted with Davis - I went to him, and found him at Hungerford-market, and asked him where he slept last night? he said at his lodgings in Hungerford-market. I told him that something unpleasant had happened at Mr. Carter's - He said he had heard of it, and was sorry for it. I asked him how he heard of it? he said he had seen the cook that morning, and she told him. I asked him if he had any objection to my searching his lodgings? he said, none whatever, and told me where they were. He said he wished he had slept at Mr. Carter's that night, as he had slept there so long - He thought if he had been there the robbery would not have happened. I went to his lodgings, leaving him with Bly; they were in Hungerford-market. In a cupboard on the stair-case I found some saucepans, a candlestick, and a shovel, in a bag - I also found three chairs there. I asked him how he got them? he said he bought the kitchen things at a sale at Deptford, and the chairs at different brokers, one at a time, as he was going to be married to Turner in May. I found he had not slept at his lodgings that night. I found a bag at Mr. Carter's, corresponding with that in which the things were. Between his second and third examination, I was in conversation with him - He said the cook gave him the things towards going to housekeeping, that he wished he knew where the rest of the things were, and he would tell. I went with Bly to Mrs. Baxter's, in Shire-lane, and found a bundle of linen under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. When you went for him you met Parry, told him you wanted the prisoner, and he fetched him - A. I did. He told me where the things were, and said he bought the things because he did not want to have the cook brought into trouble.</p>

He brought the chairs to the room about a fortnight before he was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information, I was watching the house from the 1st of July until the 5th—seeing the prisoner come every morning in company with his son to the next street to the prosecutors's house—then the boy left the prisoner and went and opened the shop, and the prisoner went away; but on the 5th of July the prisoner passed the house once, he then came again and went in empty-handed, and came out in two or three minutes with a bag on his back—I went after him and asked what he had on his back—he said, "Hair"—I asked him where he was going with it—he said, "To take it to Lambeth"—I said he must go back with me—he wanted to know what I had to do with it—I showed him my authority—I took him back to the shop, and the prosecutor came down.</p>

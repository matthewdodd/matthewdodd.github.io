The Prisoner was at first scrupulous of dealing with this Evidence, because he was a new Face, and (as he told Trantum) did not yet look like a thorow faced Rogue, and therefore would not be concern'd with him till he was satisfied of his being a Villian, fit to be trusted. They then agreed to meet at the Ducking-Pond, by the Spaw at Islington, in order to give the Prisoner a satisfactory Account of the Qualifications of this Evidence: which Trantum did; by telling him that he was lately return'd from Transportation. Nay (says the Prisoner) if that's the Case, I am Safe, and all is well. Then they brought the Goods to the Prisoner's House, and he gave them 4 s. 6 d. an Ounce for the Plate, by his own Weights, which were none of the heaviest, and 12 l. 10 s. for the Silk, which was worth 70 l. and threw them a Guinea over in the whole. The Plate was mark'd, and this Evidence ask'd him if he could dispose of it: O! says he, I could safely dispose of the King's Crown if I had it. The Prisoner in his Defence said, That he never saw Leonard before, and called several of his Neighbours to his Reputation.

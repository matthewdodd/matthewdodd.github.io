So I went with him, but his Master not being there he carried me to several other Taverns betwixt there and Charing-Cross to see for him; but not finding him I told my Chap he must go back and take his old Clothes again and leave the new ones; so we returned together till we came to <placeName id="t17350911-9-crimeloc37">St. Michael's Alley</placeName>

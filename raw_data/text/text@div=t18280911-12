            . I am a Blackwell-hall factor, and live in Church-passage, Basinghall-street. On the 31st of July I went with my errand-boy into Wood-street to fetch two pieces of cloth, which were put on his shoulder; he turned down Lad-lane and I down Love-lane, and when I got down by the church, at the end of Love-lane, I saw the prisoner carrying the two ends of cloth on his shoulder; I thought they looked like mine; I had been absent from the boy about five minutes; I went across, took up the end of the cloth, and saw the number by which I identified it, and asked him where he was going with the goods; he said he was going to Bishopsgate-street with them, that a gentleman in Lad-lane sent him with them; I asked his name - he said he did not know; he kept walking on; I said they were my goods, and as we got near Browns, the clothworkers, I got the door open, put him in, and gave him in charge; the cloth is worth about 27l.; I was about three hundred yards from Lad-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not ask you to go back to the place where the gentleman gave him the cloth? A. No;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110016"></xptr>I do not remember anything of the sort; I was at the Compter with the boy; I do not recollect saying anything to him about identifying the man; I most likely was angry with him, but not for not identifying him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Darkhouse-lane, Billingsgate, in the pa<lb></lb>rish of St. Mary-at-hill—mine is a night house. On the 1st of November, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner standing outside the bar of my house in the passage—he applied to my servant for a bed, and paid for it before he went to it—he went to bed about two o'clock, and about a quarter to three I heard my wife cry out that there was a man in her room—I was down stairs—I went up directly into our bed-room, at soon as I could get a light, but found nobody there but my wife—I can<lb></lb>not prove that the room door was fast—I had got up and left my wife in bed—I cannot swear I closed the door—it might possibly have been left open—in consequence of the alarm I went to the prisoner's room with an officer, and found him in bed—my man came into the room, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of what he said I felt the candle in the room, and it was warm as if lately blown out—I searched the room and found nothing then, but two or three hours after we found a handkerchief which I missed from my bed-room, under the prisoner's bed, between the sacking and the bed—he was still in bed—this is the handkerchief—I had seen it safe in my own room when I went to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. My husband got up early in the morning on the 2nd of November—I had seen the handker<lb></lb>chief about eleven o'clock, when I went to bed, on a chair close by the bed-room door—I was awoke when my husband got op—I know this to he the handkerchief—I have my own marking on it—I can positively swear the door was shut when my husband went down—I was awake, and saw him shut it after he went out—I am quite sure it was on the latch—I was awoke afterwards by the glare of A. candle coming in at the door, as</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for to Mr. Par<lb></lb>tridge's house on Tuesday morning, the 2nd of November, between five and six o'clock—an officer had been there before me—I went with the prosecutor into the room, and found the prisoner in bed—he was very reluctant to get up, and while he was getting up they searched his clothes, and found three sovereigns, four half-crowns, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and fourteen dupli<lb></lb>cates, seven of them for handkerchiefs—I found this handkerchief between his bed and sacking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>) I was rather intoxicated when I went to the house—I called for some coffee and went to bed—I dropped a sixpence, but did not miss it till I got up stairs, when I searched for it but could not find it, after being in bed about five minutes the alarm was given, and the sixpence I had lost was found in my umbrella—nearly at the same time I went to bed two females went up stairs—all was quiet till half-past six o'clock, when the handkerchief was found under the bed—if I had known it was there I could not have slept, besides there was time to have eaten it if I was guilty—the landlady said at first that the man had a great-coat on in the room, but afterwards said she saw somebody crawling on his hands and knees.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether he has any notification in writing?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. No; I have heard him say not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Todd. I am first clerk to the secretary of the General Post Office.</p>

               <p>Todd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come by it?</p>
               <p>Todd. On the 22d of June, the day that the first came to the post office, the inspectors of franks supposed them to be counterfeit; they brought them to the secretary's office. Mr. Williams, the person it is directed to, was sent for to the post office; he came, and was told that they were supposed to be counterfeit franks.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to avoid an objection to your relating of any conversation that passed between you and Mr. Williams, which would not be evidence to affect the prisoner, I would desire to know-if in-conversation from any thing passing between you and Mr. Williams, the prisoner was sent for?</p>
               <p>Todd. Mr. Williams himself brought him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the prisoner about these franks?</p>
               <p>Todd. Mr. Todd, the secretary, did, in my presence; he said he had had a frank or two of Sir

            , and that he had told him he need not give him the trouble of writing the names, but he might frank in his name himself; he admitted this to be his hand writing; that he had wrote the superscription of the whole. (the superscription of the two letters read.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Fortesque. You said just now, you knew Sir

             well, and have seen him write?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you well acquainted with his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Now is either of these his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. Indeed neither the one nor the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they at all like his name?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. They are a very bad counterfeit of his name.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have seen him write several times?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You think this is not at all like it?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Todd. Did this letter come by the post from any place.</p>
               <p>Todd. Yes; from Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he franked these?</p>
               <p>Todd. At Mr. Williams's lodging, in Walbrook.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Gibson. I live in Birchin lane; I am a glazier. I have known the prisoner upwards of four months, as long as he has been in England; he came from Edinburgh; he has been remarkably sober and regular since he has been with me; he is appointed a surgeon to an East Indiaman.</p>
               <p>- Dickins. I know his friends in Ireland they live in very good credit; I did not know him till I saw him here; I heard, before I came here, that he is a very good lad; I know by his neighbours, that he has the best of characters.</p>
               <p>- Thornton. I am a glazier in Fleet street. I have known him since he came from Ireland, he is a surgeon and apothecary; I have heard a good character of him.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM COLLING. On the 11th of December I met Taylor in the street. and went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18300114-180-crimeloc967">Ship-yard, Pickett-street</placeName>

He went home with me and Taylor, and said he had no money and nothing but his watch, which he gave into my hands for 5s. each - I went to see if I could get a light, and could not get one; he wanted some liquor; I left him and Taylor in bed, and went to try to get some. Witness. It is totally false; I did not send for liquor.</p>
               <p>Taylor. He said he would leave his watch for 10s. with us; he was quite agreeable to have some liquor sent for, and Smith went for it - he was so tipsy he fell down on the stairs. Witness. I was not aware of it.</p>

            . I saw Smith in the Strand; she was running along at some distance from Ship-yard - I laid hold of her and said I must search her; I took her into a shop and she said, "I know what you want, you want the watch;" the prosecutor had come to me undressed, and stated what he had lost; I put my hand into Smith's bosom, but could not find the watch - she then gave it me; she said it had been left in pawn, but did not say she was going for drink; the prosecutor gave a distinct account.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THORPE. At a quarter-past five o'clock, the prosecutor said Taylor was active in the robbery; I went up stairs, found the door locked, and the things on the stairs - I demanded admission; there was no answer - I waited three minutes, and then broke open the door; I found Taylor there with her clothes on - she denied all knowledge of the watch, and said nothing about its being left in pawn; the prosecutor was not so very tipsy - he gave a pretty fair account of the thing; he said if the watch was given up he would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>Smith put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had given her the watch to raise money upon to procure liquor.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. He took part of his clothes off in the room, and he ran down stairs undressed as he was - he said he was married, and wanted to get home; he said he would settle with me next day - he has said he has sent three females out of the country, and he will try how many more he can send.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLLING. I do not remember saying so; I have not done so, and do not remember asserting any thing of the kind - I have not sent any woman out of the country.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Are you aware of having no money in your pocket? A. I believe I had not; it was arranged between Taylor and myself - I had not known her before.</p>

               <p>Mr. Whitaker. The Prisoner work'd for me in my Warehouse, and having lost very large Quantities of Tobacco, I told my Clerk, I could not go on in this Manner, for either the Thieves must be detected, or I must quit my House. On this Day sev'night some of my Men were at the Water Side, and I went to a Neighbour's House, where I had not been long before the Prisoner came to the Gate, and was followed presently by 2 others: Upon this I stepp'd up to them, and asked them where they were going? They said, to get some Beer. I desired them to go back again, and they seemed a little surprized. I took them into the Compting-house, and told them I had lost above 500 lb. worth of Tobacco since they had worked for me, and should be very glad to find that they were honest, but I must search them. They denied that they had any Thing about them, but on my searching them, I found on each of them, at least 6 lb. of Tobacco squeezed down in their Breeches. <rs id="t17410514-51-verdict226" type="verdictDescription">

On Friday evening, the 20th of January, I was in the West India-road, and saw the two prisoners coming in the direction of High-street, Poplar—I followed them down the street into High-street—there they loitered about the shop-windows—I followed them till they came near Blackwall—they went down a street—they loitered there, and I lost them—I came back, and found them loiter<lb></lb>ing in High-street again—I followed them—they stopped about Morris's window, where they had stood before—they had changed jackets when they came back to the High-street—I saw East put his hand through the wicket, and hold the bell of Morris's door—I ran over to see what he was doing—he ran out of the shop—Worster was outside, and they ran up the street together—I pursued, and before I got to them I heard Worster say, "<hi rend="italic">Douse</hi> it, he is after you"—I heard something rattle—I took East, and on him 1 found four penny-pieces, a sixpence, a wire, and a nail—the wire is such as is generally used for hooking things</p>

I am the wife of John Morris—we keep a chandler's shop, on the evening of the 20th of January, two boys came into my shop, pulled my in till out, emptied it, and went out again—I believe there were two, but I cannot say—one came in, he put it on the counter, and then ran away—to the best of my knowledge, there was about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—it was all copper money, I believe—if there was silver in it, it was more than I knew.</p>

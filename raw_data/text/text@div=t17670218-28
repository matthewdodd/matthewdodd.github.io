On Monday the second of this instant I was desired to go to a chandler's shop over the way, where they sell corn, to enquire after a sack of malt that was offered to the woman to sell; there was the prisoner and the malt; the woman is a woman in years; I asked her if she would let me have the bargain, not being willing to take the prisoner there to surprize the woman; the prisoner said, I might have the malt; I said, if he would take it over to my house I would; when we came there, there were two or three neighbours of mine; I desired of them privately to see if they knew the man, he being a stranger to me; some knew him, some did not; I desired them to stay with him while I got an officer; I got one; then I asked him how he came by the malt; (there was J. Higley at length on the sack) the prisoner said it was Mr. Higley's sack, of Walham-green: I sent for Mr. Higley; he came; then the prisoner acknowledged the malt to be Mr. Higley's property; we brought him to Sir

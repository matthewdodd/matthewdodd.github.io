                  </hi>. I am the wife of Gabriel Child, but left him the day after last boxing-day. I have lived with the prisoner as his wife for about eight months—we lodged at a beer-shop, No. 81, Kent-street, Borough—he was told he should not stop any longer—the parties were willing to admit me without him—on the 3rd of Nov. I went out with him, and walked about a little—about eleven o'clock at night we went back towards the house in Kent-street—I told him I was going into the house, and should not live with him any longer—he said I should not go if he was not admitted into the house—I parted from him a few doors from the house, and left him there to go in—when I got to the door I was not aware he was behind me—when I put my foot</p>

               <p>on the step, he caught hold of me, and said I should not go in—he laid hold of me towards the shoulders, more towards the neck, and said I should not go in—I then felt something across my neck—I could not tell what it was—I saw blood—I struggled with him, and fell down—I struggled to get away—I think he had hold of me when I fell, but I cannot say—the blood was running from my throat on my clothes—there was a good deal of it—I felt a little faint, but nothing to speak of—I think I got up by myself—he went away, I did not notice when, but I found he was not present when I got up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Guy's Hospital. The last witness was brought there on the night of the 3rd of Nov.—I examined a wound on her throat and neck—it was on the right side—I found two incised wounds, one about half an inch below the other—they were each about three inches in length, and about half an inch in depth—they extended over the right carotid artery—that is a very dangerous place for a wound—it could not be more dangerous—the artery laid about a quarter of an inch deeper—if that had been cut, her life would have been gone very soon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How deep is the carotid artery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In this case about three quarters of an inch—as it was these wounds were not very serious—they were merely simple incised wounds—the skin was divided, and the superficial veins of the neck also.</p>

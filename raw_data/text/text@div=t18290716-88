            . I am a watchman. I was in Regent-street, and saw two lads and a girl close to Mr. Lee; the prisoner was one - he put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, took it out immediately, and turned into a court; I ran, caught him by the collar, and asked what he had taken from the gentleman's pocket - he said Nothing; I saw the box in his hand, and said, "What is that in your hand?" he put his hand down to his apron - I said, "Come after the gentleman;" I took him along, and he threw down the box - I took him and the box to the prosecutor.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence The watchman called after me when I was half way up the court, and this box came right past my feet; the watchman said I took it from the gentleman - I had just left my work; I was in a hurry, and turned into the court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live at New Brentford, and am clerk to the board of guardians of the Brentford Union. In March, Apil, and May last the prisoner was in my employ as clerk—he had been in my service about six years—it was his duty to assist in the money departmen of the Union, and in the payment of the drafts—Charles Roope was em<lb></lb>ployed as a tradesman to the Union—the sum of 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to him on the 19th of March, from the Union—the cheque now pro<lb></lb>duced was signed for that amount in his favour by the presiding chairman of the board, in the presence of two guardians—it was handed over to me in that state on the 23rd of March—I had to countersign it before it was paid to Roope—it would not be paid by Messrs. Twining without my counter signature—the prisoner came to me about that cheque about the 30th of April, and said Mr. Roope wanted his draft, would I sign it—I did so, and handed it over to him—he left on the 1st or 2nd of</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Parr's Head public-house, Islington, the prisoner was my pot-boy for about seven months; I had reason to com<lb></lb>plain of his getting tipsy. On Sunday, the 26th of July, when I came home from church, I found him in a state of intoxication, which in<lb></lb>duced me to send for a policeman—he was not able to do hit work, and I was obliged to get rid of him—on the following morning my niece made a communication to me, and I went up to the front attic, in which the prisoner slept with another man, named Sale—I saw the prisoner's box opened, and a canister found, which contained two quarts and a pint of gin, and a bung was in the top—I believe the canister to be mine, it is like one I missed—I also found a penknife and case, which were mine, and some tobacco—the gin resembles what I had a sample of—I had missed gin—there was a tin measure found, which I had never seen before—I do not claim that—the tobacco weighed an ounce and a half—I was present before the Magistrate the first time the prisoner was taken there—he said it was part of the remains of an ounce of tobacco that he had bought at a shop opposite the church, and he had smoked some part of it—I had tobacco of the same sort in my house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What kind of tobacco is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Shag—it is quite common—I came home from church a little before one o'clock—I did not see the prisoner about eight o'clock in the morning, he was gone before I came down stairs—I never saw him till I returned from church—I breakfasted about nine o'clock—he was lying down drunk at six o'clock in the evening—I think he had had part of a pot of beer with some friends—I have no garden—my bar-maid's name is Elizabeth, I can not tell her surname—I believe a person was at my house last night, inquiring the name of my bar-maid—I cannot tell when she was engaged, it is about three months—I cannot tell whether she has ever received any letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know where the prisoner was between one and six o'clock in the evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The greater part of the time on the settle asleep—I can<lb></lb>not say how early in the morning he was drunk—my bar was closed, if not locked, during church time—it is locked up with shutters at night—there are two doors to it, which are opened in the day—there are sliding shutters in two grooves, they form a passage—the shutters are sixteen or eighteen inches from the ceiling—there is an entrance from the bar-parlour to the bar—I lock the outer door of the bar, and take the key up stairs—there were no marks of violence on these shutters or doors—I kept three ser<lb></lb>vants, altogether, the house-maid and bar-maid—this is the canister, it was quite full when I found it—I cannot tell what strength the gin in the canister was—the strong gin we buy is 22 degrees under proof—then we sweeten it—we are not obliged to put the strength of it on the cask.</p>

               <p>your gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not below it—I cannot undertake to swear that it is the same strength as any gin I sold that Sunday—we have gin of different strength, according to the price—I sell British gin and hollands—we have it at 22 degrees, and the cordial gin at 17 degrees—this is the same strength as the cordial gin I sold on that Sunday—I can only go by the taste—I had a man in my house named Sale, but he is gone away—he applied to me for a bed, and I would not let him sleep there—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther it was Sunday night or not, but he was never in the house afterwards, he was not in the house when the prisoner came home drunk—it was most likely after this discovery that I told Sale he should not sleep there—he never slept in the room after Saturday night—I never saw him again till after the prisoner was in custody—I never saw him on the Sunday—I said he should not sleep there, because I thought probably there might be some<lb></lb>thing wrong with Sale.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you drink out of your stock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not suppose I sent out for what I drank—I have not taken account of what I and my family drank.</p>

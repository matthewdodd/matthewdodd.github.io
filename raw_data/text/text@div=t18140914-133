               <p>Q. What countryman is the prisoner - A. I cannot say. I was robbed in the public-house. I cannot say whether I was robbed by him or not. I was robbed of fourteen pounds; nine one-pound notes and a five-pound note. I lost it out of my pocket; it was in a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FRANCIS. I keep the Sampson and Lion public-house. On the 20th of last month the prisoner and the prosecutor came into the house with six men in company with him. Mackdonald called for a pint of beer and half a pint of gin; the prisoner called for a pint of beer. The prisoner offered the prosecutor his beer. The prosecutor said, you had better come and sit here. He sat down. The prisoner drank some of his beer; the prosecutor offered him some of his gin. The prosecutor got drowsy; he laid his head upon the table. The prisoner thrust his hand over the table into the prosecutor's pocket, and took the black handkerchief out. I hallooed to him that insisted upon his giving the man his money back; he said he took nothing. I asked him the second time to give him the handkerchief. As soon as he went away I ran after him, and took the handkerchief from him. This is the handkerchief and the money.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is my handkerchief and my money.</p>

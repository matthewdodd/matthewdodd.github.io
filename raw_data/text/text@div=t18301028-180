            . On the 17th of September I made my way into the prosecutor's shop to clear the shop of strangers, as the firemen could not work their engines - I saw the prisoner, and asked who he was; he said he belonged to the firm - I asked his name; he said that was nothing to me - I asked the names of the persons who resided there - he said that was nothing to me; I took him to the station with a brother officer, and found these things upon him.</p>

            . I was on duty, and assisted the witness to take the prisoner - I found these pulls about the prisoner, two of them in his watch-pocket, and the rest in his hat and his other pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not so drunk that you required another man to take me to the station? A. He was as sober as I am - we required another man, because the crowd was so great, and we knew he had these things about him, and they would have been thrown away.</p>
               <p>MR. HAWKINS. These are my property, and were on a shelf behind my counter - the prisoner was not my partner - I had never seen him.</p>

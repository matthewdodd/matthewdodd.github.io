The prisoners Baylies and Welsby lodged with me, they came on the 30th of October, and stopped three weeks and four days, until the 24th of November, when they left during my absence, without notice. I went out about half-past one o'clock, and returned at six, and they were gone. I missed the articles stated in the indictment - Mr. Coe lodged in the house - my things were in two separate bedrooms. I found most of them at Bow-street next morning.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Monday morning, about nine o'clock, I was coming up the Strand, and at the end of Hewitt's-court, I saw several people - I saw Coe standing by the side of Mumford. I found his property in the front garret of No. 3. New Round-court, Strand. Baylies and Welsby were in bed there together. Coe asked Baylies for his property, and she produced a great deal of it from under the pillow. They acknowledged that they brought them away - Baylies said they came there the night before.</p>

            . I lodged at Johnston's. Baylies and Welsby also lodged there. I went out to dinner on the 24th, and returned at half-past eight o'clock at night and missed my things. A coachman gave me information, and next morning I went to Hewitt's-court, Strand, to Acker-man's, a pawnbroker, and gave information there. I remained in the court, and in half an hour the pawnbroker came out of the shop with Mumford and my coat, when I gave her in charge. I asked her no questions - I then went to No. 3, New-round-court, and found Baylies and Welsby there in bed. Wormald came almost directly after, and I found the property produced in the room.</p>

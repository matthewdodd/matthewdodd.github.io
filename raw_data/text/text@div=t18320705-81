             (Police-constable C 100). I was in Crown-street, Soho; I saw the prosecutor calling for assistance - he said he was robbed; I took the prisoner, and found this bag in her hand, containing one sovereign and 1l. 15s. in silver - the prosecutor was the worse for liquor, but knew what he was doing, and stated what had passed, as he has to-day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor with a young woman; he asked us to have something to drink; as we were coming out of the house, he said he wished to speak to the other young woman - I walked on one side; I kicked against the purse and took it up, but I did not know it was stolen: the other young woman owned that she took the purse.</p>

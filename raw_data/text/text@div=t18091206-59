               <p>Q. He went between them. - A. Yes; and snatched the bundle from under her arm, she screamed out. I ran after him up Eagle and Child alley, and never lost sight of him, and coming into Shoe Lane, he throwed one other pair of stockings out of the bundle into the kennel. I was close after him; I stopped and picked up the stockings and pursued him again; he ran a little further, and then dropped the bundle; I catched up the bundle, and followed him and took him into custody. I am sure it is the same man, I never lost sight of him all the time, I was within three or four yards of him when he snatched the bundle. This is the bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Shoe Lane, there was a sing out, stop thief: I saw the man running, he was a head taller than me. I, fool like, was running; I fell down when the officer took me; two or three boys said, I was not him.</p>

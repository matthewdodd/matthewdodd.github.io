It was seven o'clock when I went in to see; I came back again and went to the corner of Vineyard-street; I met a lady, I asked her if she had seen a boy with a bundle; she said she did, and if I turned up there I might catch him; then I went to a house where I had seen him go in sometimes, a person of the name of Cooling, facing the turnpike at Islington; I knocked at the door, I asked if she had a son of the name of William, and whether he was at home; she said no; I told her I had lost a copper pot; she went with me to the corner of St. John-street, to a cornchandler's; it was not the same boy.</p>

I went to several houses, I could not find the pot.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Coles's-place, Elder-walk, Lower road, Islington, and am a butcher. On the 4th of March, 1836, the prisoner was in company with a man named Widdowson—I knew them both by sight—Widdowson went to a house on the right band side, opposite Mr. Parry's, and the servant shut the door in his face—he crossed to Mr. Parry's, and stood some time, as if talking to a person—I went by, and he was taking the things off the hooks in the passage—I went by, and Widdowson came out with something loose in his arms—the prisoner was waiting for hint, and then Widdowson put the things into the bag and gave it to Moss—I followed them a mile and a half, and then I saw a policeman, who ran down Camden-street, and saw them—the prisoner saw the policeman making up to them, he dropped the bag and ran away—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

About half-past eleven o'clock, on the 4th of March, 1836, I went to Colebrook-row, and saw the prisoner in company with Widdowson, who was tried, and transported for seven years—Moss was carrying a bag, containing these things, which he dropped—I am certain he is the person—I did not take him that time—I was looking after him, but could not find him.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion from my inspector, I went to Mr. Carpenter's, and examined these duplicates, and seeing "No. 2, Tarling-street." on them, I went and found, Welsford there, in a bed-room in the front-parlour—when she saw me she said, "Oh, I thought it was Rickards, have you seen him?"—I said, "No, I have not, I came about these handkerchiefs which were pledged at Car<lb></lb>penter's—"she said, "Oh, I have got the duplicate of them, you can have it if you please"—she then gave me these eight duplicates—amongst them was one for the handkerchiefs and the broad-cloth—I said, "You must come with me"—she said, "I hope not, I hope Rickards has not been doing any thing wrong; he gave me the handkerchiefs, and I pledged them"—Mr. Peggs came to the station while I was entering the charge against Welsford—up to the time of my taking her to the station, she did not produce or deliver to me any thing but the eight duplicates—I went with Mr. Peggs to her lodging, to the same room in which I found her—I there found a silk dress, a piece of new Irish linen, four new veils, twelve new</p>

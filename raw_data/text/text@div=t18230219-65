            . I am a school-master, and live in Grove-street, Hackney. On the 10th of February, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, in consequence of an alarm, I went to the door, and saw the prisoners together, passing the field in which my house is. Mance had a bag on his back - I followed them, and sent for an officer, who joined me in Shore-place; we followed them to Cambridge-heath, and as they approached the road, I lost them. I ran round to meet them, but did not. I saw Beal in possession of a bag containing three ducks. I am sure they are the men.</p>

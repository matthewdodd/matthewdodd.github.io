            . I am a turner, and work for my father. I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoner and two or three others walking very close to the prosecutor; the prisoner was arm-in-arm with the one who took the handkerchief - I was not above three yards off, by their side, walking in the gutter; when it was taken I informed Mr. Dawson, and said I would show him the person who took it; they had turned back towards Gray's Inn-lane - it was taken about twenty yards above Gray's Inn-lane: when I overtook them they were between Gray's Inn-lane and Brooke-street, all four standing together - they staid there till they heard us inquiring for an officer, then two went one way and two the other; the prisoner and the man went took it went towards Field-lane - he was secured before I lost sight of him: the others got quite away; I should know them again if they were dressed as they were then.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of St. Andrew's, Holborn. I heard the prosecutor say he had been robbed - the prisoner was pointed out; I crossed, and laid hold of him about the end of Leather-lane - he was then alone; he said he was innocent: I searched him, but found nothing on him. The City bounds are about two houses on this side of Gray's Inn-lane - this was done in Middlesex.</p>

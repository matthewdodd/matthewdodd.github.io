On Sunday morning, the 26th of November, I was in Church-street, St. Giles, between ten and eleven o'clock - I met the two prisoners, who accosted me, and I went into a public-house with them; I had had a little drink on the Saturday night, and was some what the worse for liquor - I had stopped at a friend's house all night - the prisoners then enticed me to go home with them - I went with McCoy to No. 18, <placeName id="t18261207-136-crimeloc802">Church-street</placeName>

            . I am a constable. I saw a mob of people; I went up, and saw the prosecutor, whom some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070065"></xptr>women were pulling about; I took Fox - she said if I would get her away, she would tell me where the watch was; I took her to the watch-house, and she had a child in her arms; I left word that if the mother of the child came, to detain her - McCoy came for it, and was detained.</p>
               <p>FOX's Defence. I am the girl the prosecutor went with - we had been to several public-houses together, and the prosecutor called for a quartern and a half of gin, and had not money to pay for it; the landlord asked him what he meant - he then put his hand into his pocket, said he had some money, and he called for more, but the landlord would not bring it.</p>
               <p>McCOY's Defence. I met the prosecutor and Fox in the street, as they were going home; I went to the house afterwards, and Fox asked me to go and get something for breakfast; I left her my child, and she was taken to the watch-house.</p>

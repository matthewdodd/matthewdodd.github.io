I know the prisoner—he came to my house, between ten and eleven o'clock, on the night of the 16th of January, with four others—they went down stairs into the skittle-ground, which is the cellar—there were two candles in the room when they came in—they went from the cellar up into the smoking-room, on the first floor, where there is a skittle-board—they or<lb></lb>dered a pot of ale, which my wife took them—they put the candle out in that room, and called for a light twice—I took them one—the prisoner was not then in the room—there were only the three of them there who had come in with him—I took them a light twice—the prisoner was in the room the first time I took the light, but not the second—after that, I heard footsteps of a person walking about in the room overhead, which is my bed-room—I took a candle to go up stairs, and met the prisoner's brother coming out of my bed-room—he was one who had come in with the prisoner, and was in the smoking-room the first time I took the light, but not the second time—I collared him, and asked what business he had there, and the prisoner rushed out of the bed-room, with a pillow-case under his arm, containing the articles named in the indictment—he knocked the candle out of my hand as he passed his brother and me—he took the pillow-case away with him full of articles, and made his escape—I did not see him again till I was sent for to Worship-street, three weeks or a month ago—I am certain he is the man—I never saw him before that night—when I saw him at Worship-street I selected him out from five others—I had not been in the bed-room myself for some hours before—the door was not locked at that time—I latched it the last time I came out—the drawers were locked which contained the property.</p>

Mr. Collard, You sent word to me, that if I could get any witness that Barker was concerned in the beer-shop robbery you would apprehend him.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KENNARD</hi>. At the office, the witness Garter swore positively to its being on Friday, the 19th, or Saturday, the 20th—several witnesses in Court will prove that—it was not that she did not recollect the day, but the swore to it positively.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I was present when the witness Gatter was examined before Mr. Codd—she swore the prisoner was in company with her on the evening in the week the robbery was committed, but she would not confine herself to the day—what she said was not taken down—the Magistrate asked her distinctly whether it was Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday—she said she would swear it was neither Monday, Tuesday, nor Wednesday—he then asked if she could recollect which of the other days it was—she said she could not, but she thought it was Friday—he asked her again whether she was sure it was not Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday—she said she was sure it was neither of those three days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She said she was not certain what day it was, but she could find out by getting the paper from her son-in-law, and let the Magistrate know the next time—my witness's evidence is correct—I was not in the house on the night of the robbery—I have been in the habit of passing the prosecutor's door several times every week, and have been served by him twenty times since the robbery.</p>

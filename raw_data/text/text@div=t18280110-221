            . I am an officer. I was in Little Moorfields. I heard a cry of Stop thief! a moment after I passed Buckley's-alley - I turned and pursued the prisoner from the alley to Crow-court, and there took him; a man came up, and said, "That is not the man," but I knew he was, for I had never lost sight of him - I heard the cry, saw him crossing, and go down Buckley's-alley - I secured him in less than three minutes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at the Red Lion public-house, and as I returned home saw several persons together; there was an alarm of Stop thief! I pursued, and was taken; several persons came up, and said I was not the man; the officer said, "I think it is him."</p>

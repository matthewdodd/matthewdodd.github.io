            . I live in Adam-street, Adelphi. On the evening of the 16th of April, about twenty to eight o'clock, I was passing Mrs. May's, and saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140023"></xptr>and another was taller than him, by Osborne's hotel - I passed on, and went to a public-house about twenty yards off, and changed a newspaper. As I returned I saw Herd stooping down rubbing his legs, close to the parlour window. The taller man was opposite the door with a bundle of things under his coat, about two yards from May's door; they had not got the bundle when I first saw them. I could not see what it contained - I found the blinds and the window thrown wide open - the tall one went away directly, and Herd stopped about two minutes rubbing his legs, and then went towards the Strand. I rung the bell immediately he was gone, which was in about five minutes from the time I first saw them. I did not notice the tall man sufficiently to know him again. I knew Herd before by sight - I had seen him and another frequently walking backwards and forwards in Adam-street, between seven and eight o'clock of a morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I am an officer. In consequence of the description I received, I took the prisoners into custody - I have seen them together before. I found 7 s. on Herd, and 9 s. on the other. I took Herd on the night of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor. On Sunday morning, the 21st of January, I was in company with Mr. James, in High-street, Marylebone—I felt a tug, and turned and found the prisoner close at my heels, and be<lb></lb>tween his legs, lying at my heels, was my handkerchief—I picked it up, and at that time my friend said he had lost his—when the policeman came up he searched him, and found my friend's handkerchief on him—while the policeman had hold of his left arm, I saw my friend's handkerchief in the breast of his coat—the prisoner had Mr. James's handkerchief—this is mine.</p>

I was in company with Mr. James Cocking—I have heard what he has stated—he has told it correctly—I saw my hand<lb></lb>kerchief on the prisoner, in his breast, and before that it had been safe in my pocket—we had been walking arm-in-arm till we came to the spot, and then we left each other's arms, but were dose together—this is my handkerchief.</p>

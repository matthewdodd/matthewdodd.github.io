I in some measure effected my escape, when a man tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I had lost any thing? I said I was not aware that I had - I felt, and missed my spectacles and case - he produced them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of September I was in the Park - the Queen was coming down, and a great mob running by the side of her carriage. I suspected something would take place, and ran to the Horse Guards - three persons, whom I knew to be bad characters, surrounded the prosecutor, and tried to get his watch. I believe they saw me and went off. The prisoner immediately backed behind the gentleman; I saw him lift the pocket up with his left hand, take the spectacles out with his right, and put them in his right-hand pocket; I secured him, and took them out of his pocket. With assistance I took him to Mr. Cochrane.</p>

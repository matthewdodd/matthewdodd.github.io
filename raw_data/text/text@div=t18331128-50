            . I am a city patrol, No. 2, and live at No. 8, Richardson's-buildings, Attfield-street. On the 31st of October, the prisoner was given into my custody - I saw him hand the sovereigns over to Mr. John Atherly; I asked him what it was; he said it was three or four sovereigns, which was part of the produce of the wire he had sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been with them now nearly twenty-four years. I conducted myself with propriety when apprenticed, and nearly up to the present time; but alterations in the firm were very disagreeable to me and to all of us, by a person formerly working for them being now brought in as a partner. I conducted myself with propriety, more to my injury than my own profit; and by the last partner coming in, who is a cunning, artful, deceitful man, both to the master and men, I believe to get the whole business into his own hands, he acts all manner of deceit and deception imaginary to all of us; he is always insulting me and the whole of the firm altogether. He has brought in three apprentices, and before my master had but two; I had been earning from 2l. 10s. to 3l. a week, which my own master promised me as long as I continued faithful to him, and that he would give me constant employment to make us a comfortable livelihood; but the last partner bringing in two parish apprentices, he wished to get rid of all the old hands; and by so doing it has made me do the present act, which I am very sorry for. I hope you will consider my long servitude, and the manner I have acted towards my master and shopmates; I have done the greatest kindness towards them, and to my own injury; and my mind was so worked up, I certainly did sell it, but never spent a farthing of the money; master received 4l. of it, and the other pound I lost.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW ATHERLY. The prisoner has been our apprentice and journeyman for twenty years; I don't wish to say anything about his conduct latterly, but I protest against his injuring my partner; who, having been apprenticed to us, and afterwards a journeyman, his good conduct enabled us to take him into parnership - the prisoner within the last three years and seven months has received 547l. - he has not earned less than 2l. a-week for the last six months - I paid him 88l. from January to October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to LAMBERT. Q. How long have you known me? A. About twenty years; I never knew him dishonest, except in a similar act to this, which was looked over.</p>

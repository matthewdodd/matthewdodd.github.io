            . I am the proprietor of the errand-cart. I was in the cart, but I got out at the King's Arms for about two minutes; when I went back Floyd said he had lost a basket; I said it was impossible, as it had been safe about a minute before - in about two minutes afterwards I saw it on the prisoner's shoulder, in Silver-street, near the bottom of Southampton-street.</p>

            . I was in my master's shop, at the back of the King's Arms - I saw the prisoner go by, carrying a basket before him; he asked a milk-man to give him a lift up with it as he crossed the road, which he did - a parcel then dropped out, which he took up, and went on. The woman came soon after, and said she had lost a basket of linen; I ran out, supposing he was the person who took it, and found him with it on his back.</p>

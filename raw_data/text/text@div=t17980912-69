             sworn. - I keep a school in Castle-street, Holborn, Mrs. Lake's child came to my school; the prisoner came to me on the 31st of July, about a quarter after ten, with Mrs. Lake's compliments, and would be glad to have James Lake home, there was a lady there wished to see him; upon that I delivered the child to her; as she was going down stairs, the child had no hat on; I returned, and saw the child's hat lay on the table; I gave her the hat, and she thanked me, and said, the child was not going to return again that morning. I believe the prisoner to be the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt? - A. I believe her to be the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Lake.) Did you send this woman for the child? - A. No; I think it is the same woman that was walking about the street when my servant went with the child to school; there were three of them walking backwards and forwards for almost two hours, before the child went to school, and she had the same gown on then that she has now.</p>

            . I am an officer of the customs. On the 4th of March a few minutes before twelve, I was on duty watching the dock, I went over this bridge, I saw four persons on the pier-head, in a craft, they seemed to be busy engaged, it was a moon-light night, I met Covey at the foot of the bridge; I then went for assistance; in my course to the pier-head I met Ellis, Robinson, and Hanover; we went through a narrow passage, I saw two men on the pier-head, about twenty or thirty feet from the Thames; one of the men I saw is Coombs; I asked them what they were doing, a voice answered nothing; they came towards us, and we advanced towards them; I then asked them what they were, and what business they had there at that hour of the night; they made no reply; myself and Robinson went to the spot where they came from, there we found these eleven bladders containing thirteen gallons of rum, the black bags, four empty bladders, and pump and a claw hammer; we took Coombs, I asked him who he was; he made no reply. The other man ran away round the pier head, into a timber yard, and I lost sight of him. We took Coombs into the guard house, and I lodged him in the care of the serjeant of the guards; Coombs said in the guard-house that he was a taylor, that he came there after a bill that Rawlinson owed him. On Friday night, the 8th of March, Eddis and myself were going down on duty to the West India Docks, we met the prisoner Neale.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, did not know him - A. No, I did not; Ellis knew him, he said he was the person that made his escape from us the over night, he immediately took him by the collar, I assisted, and as we were conducting him to the guard-house on a sudden he twisted and got away from us; I ran after him, he ran about forty or fifty yards before I overtook him. We secured Neale.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me at the time that you first saw the four men at the pier-head that there was a craft laying there - A. Yes, and when I got down to the pier-head it was gone.</p>

            . I am an extra excise watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 4th of March did Barber come to you for assistance - A. Yes, I went with him to the pier-head, I met with these two men, one we took, Neale escaped. I am quite positive Neale was the man that escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the account given by Barber of finding the bladders - A. Yes, I was present all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th of March how near were you to Neale when you saw him - A. I was quite close, so as to see him; I was within a yard; I have known him four or five years; I am quite positive about him. I saw him again with another man near the Royal Oak, on the Thursday night, I did not stop him then. On the Friday I saw him, Barber was with me, we took him in Mr. Curling's ship yard; I laid hold of him by the collar, I said, here he is, this is the man that made his escape; Neale said, what do you want with me, I have nothing at all about me. I took him towards the dock premises, he gave a twist and ran away; Mr. Barber ran after him, and caught him, he then made resistance; we took him about six score yards before we handcuffed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the pier-head enclosed - A. It is enclosed within the boundary wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person except your watchman be there at that time of night for any honest purpose - A. No, not for any good.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the pumps and bladders that were found - A. Yes, they are things that are made use of for the purpose of plunder.</p>
               <p>Mr Andrews. Do I understood you that you went with Barber to the pier-head - A. No, not quite to the pier-head; we found Coombs by the machine that grinds mortar; he was within seven yards and a half where the liquor laid; I stood by Coombs, he could not get away.</p>

            . I am one of the constables of the West India docks. On the 4th of March, at twelve o'clock at night, Ellis came and gave me some information. I went with him and Robinson through the little passage towards the pier head. When I came to the pier head I saw two men, they were about twelve yards from me, they ran towards us.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other escape for them than coming by you - A. I did not know of any at that time. Barber asked them what they were doing, they said, nothing. And at the place where they came from was the place where the liquor was afterwards found.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the place where the liquor was found from the place where you found them - A. About five or six yards; one of the men was the prisoner Coombs, the other man took to his heels and run; I know nothing about him; I found nothing on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030034"></xptr>Coombs but a common knife; Coombs was taken to the Guard house, and these things were found upon the pier of the West India Dock in their possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Coombs did not attempt to run - A. He did not; we stood by him.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my friend that you did not know there was a way for a person to escape - A. There was then, but I did not know it, it is made secure now.</p>
               <p>Q. How could a man get away from the pier-head into the timber-yard - A. There had been a fence, and part of the fence had been broken down; I never observed it before.</p>

            . I am an established Excise watchman. On the 4th of March I was applied to by Ellis to go and assist Barber; I went with him to the pier-head, I observed two men standing up by the wall, where these goods were afterwards found; upon going on the pier head they came towards us slowly; Mr. Barber asked them what they were doing, one of the men said, nothing; Coombs was taken in custody; I and Barber went to look to see if we could find any thing, I called to Hanover that we had found the goods, and upon my calling out one of the men run towards the fence, that divides Mr. Curlings premises from the dock; no person could get in there that was a stranger; I went with Coombs to the guard room, I asked him if he belonged to the revenue; he said, no, he was an extra tide waiter, he had the misfortune to lose it; he said he came down to the pier-head to get a bill of seventeen shillings and sixpence of a man of the name of Rawlinson. I know a gentleman of the name of Rawlinson, a lighterman, I cannot say whether it is the same. There is no house on the pier head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to go and see the place by which the man escaped - A. I did; he escaped round the corner of the post.</p>

            . I am a surveyor employed by the Excise board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the next day after this for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was any deficiency of the rum - A. I did. I went on the 5th, and the deficiency was eight gallons in six casks, on board the Jonathan; I found spills in the bulge of the casks, which were for the purpose of drawing the liquor out. I made allowance for the samples.</p>
               <p>Coomb's Defence. I have lived to near sixty years of age, I dely man or mortal to say, Coombs, you have done wrong in your life. Were I upon my death bed I would take my oath of my innocence. At the watchhouse I offered to strip myself, they said there was no need of that, they had rumaged me close enough.</p>
               <p>Neale's Defence. On Monday night, from the hour of nine to twelve at night, I was in Whitechapel, at the Yorkshire Grey, public house, attending there as waterman. When I was taken by these men I had been down to the Isle of Dogs to get a job, coming home I was stopped by them.</p>
               <p>Coombs called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

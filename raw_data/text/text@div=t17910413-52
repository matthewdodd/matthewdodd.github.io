               <p>I keep a tavern in Goodman's-fields. On Thursday, the 24th of February, the prisoner at the bar, in company with another man, came into my house; after they had been about two hours, they asked the waiter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130054"></xptr>to send in the master of the house; I went to them and asked them their business; the prisoner told me he had got some property to deliver into my hands, to take care of for him until morning; he gave me two twenty pound notes, and two tens: I know the name subscribed to the ten pound note, I know is Gethen; on the morning of the 25th, I delivered them to him again; they both stopped in my house that night; in the morning, upon their asking what was to pay, the waiter took in the bill, and they sent out one of the bank notes, which I changed, and took for the reckoning; in the course of the day they returned again, and they delivered me three notes and six guineas in cash, to keep for them until the morning; they staid in the house that night also; in the morning, a man who dresses my hair sent up to me, that he had something to communicate particularly; and he told me he had seen some handbills in the city, that gave a description of the person he had seen in the yard; I desired him to go and tear down one of the bills, and bring it to me, that I might compare it with the notes; while he was gone I fetched a constable and secured him. When the hair-dresser came back, we compared the numbers of the notes, and found them to be the same.</p>

               <p>When I had these notes, I chanced to drop them going along, a man picked them up; I asked him for them, and he gave them to me, and looking at them I found one short, and I was afraid to go home.</p>

            . On Monday evening between eight and nine o'clock, I was going down Fleet-street. I saw the prosecutor have hold of the prisoner, he charged the prisoner with picking his pocket, I saw him pull the handkerchief out of his waistcoat and chuck it down, I immediately picked it up and gave it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. WORRALL. I am a beadle, the handkerchief was delivered to me, I produce it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief, it is worth three shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Shoe-lane, this gentleman came up to me, and said, you have got my silk handkerchief; I said, I have no silk handkerchief of yours; up came a man, who before the alderman, said he lived at No. 2, Shoe-lane; he saw me throw it down. I heard a woman say, here is a handkerchief; I never saw the handkerchief before I saw it before the alderman. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

The prisoner lived with me, and left me about a month since - I missed many articles while she was with me, but they were attributed to other persons - we parted on the best of terms - I afterwards missed other things - I knew where she was gone, and I found the articles stated, which are my husband's, three weeks ago, yesterday, at her lodging in Little James's-street; I told her, circumstances had arisen which excited my suspicion, and if she had nothing of mine she could not object to let me see her boxes; she was much confused, and said she had not the key; I said I would send for an officer; she then opened a box, where I found a number of articles, and another trunk was full of my property - she wished me to take them, and said, she intended to return them on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you kept this tavern? A. About three years; some single gentlemen lodge there - no other persons. We took it of Mr. Ireland; my husband is a theatrical agent, and our house is mostly frequented by theatrical persons; there was a pair of tongs and a shovel found which I said were mine - the prisoner said they were Mr. Ireland's; I said she might as well say so of all the other articles; she is married, and I have often seen her husband there - he has frequently stopped all night, and gone from the house before we were up; my husband's name is Benjamin Christian Smythson.</p>

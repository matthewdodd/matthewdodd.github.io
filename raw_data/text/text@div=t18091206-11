On the 2d of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come into the warehouse: he took a bundle of ten matts, and went out, he was gone about ten minutes, and then he returned without the matts. I told the foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner leave your master's service. - A. On the 3d of October in the morning, as soon as he was tried to be apprehended, he went off before my master knew of it. He was apprehended about six weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of the matts. - A. Eighteen shillings.</p>

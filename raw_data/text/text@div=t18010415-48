I am servant to the head gardener of Chelsea College: On the evening of the 23d of March last, about half past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner upon the roof of the privy belonging to the College; I called to him, and asked him what he was doing there, and he said he was after a whore; my brother came and assisted me in securing him; I afterwards went up stairs and saw two pieces of lead cut off, and laid by the side of the coping, it appeared to be fresh cut; there was fifty pounds weight of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I heard an alarm given by the servant maid of the house, I came out, and found the prisoner within twenty yards of where the lead was lying; I assisted my brother in securing him, and took him to the guard-house; I then came back, and went upon the top of the privy; the place where the lead had been cut from was quite dry, whereas there had been rain that evening, about six o'clock, and all the rest was wet; we found the lead rolled up, and thrown upon the coping of the privy; it appeared to be fresh cut, the edges were quite bright.</p>

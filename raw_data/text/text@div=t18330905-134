On the 12th of August, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was opposite Mr. Russell's door; I saw the prisoner go and look at a handkerchief which hung there - he then turned round; then went back, got on the step, unpinned the handkerchief, rolled it up, and was putting it into his bosom - I took him to the shop, and found the handkerchief in his bosom - this is it.</p>

On the 2d of May, about twelve at noon, I met with Wilson and Daley, at a public house. We had a pot of beer or two together: we went from there, to one of their lodgings. I lay on the bed and fell a-sleep. When I awaked, I missed my watch; I got up and found the door locked, and the key in the out-side. Sometime after, Wilson came: on her opening the door, I asked her, if she had played the fool, and got my watch. She said, no. I got a constable, and took her before the justice, She said, she had not the watch, but knew where it was. The other prisoners were taken with the watch, and brought before the justice. I looked at the watch just before I went up stairs with Wilson and Daley. I had half a guinea and some silver in my pocket, but that was never touched; I was a little in liquor.</p>

            . On the 2d of May, about four in the afternoon, I met Delay and Avery. Avery asked me in the thieving language it I would buy a trick, and took the chain of a watch out of her bosom. I said, if they would go to a public house I would look at it. We went to the George, in Stanhope-street; we went into a back-room, and Avery gave me the watch to look at, and I sent for a constable and gave charge of them.</p>

He wanted to have to do with me; I asked him for a present; he said he had nothing but half guinear that wanted twenty peace of weight, but he would pawn his watch if I had any body to send with it, and give me a crown, I called up

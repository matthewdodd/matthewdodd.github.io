He was put in the watch-house, but got out next morning by breaking a hole through the brick wall; he was taken a week after. I have not found my property.</p>

On the 2d of October I was with Overshall, and saw the prisoners in company together - they had been together all day. I saw Roe go up to Mr. Davis's shop-door, and take, as I thought, a piece of cloth from the side of the door; Bengey stood close by against a post - Roe walked round towards the prosecutor's back yard, and Bengey followed him. They then returned to the door, took something which I thought was cloth, and went back again - I am sure they are the men - I knew them well before. They are natives of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not stop them at the time - A. They are such desperate characters that I was afraid. I went and informed Davis almost immediately.</p>

            . I was with Cracknell - I live two doors from Davis. The prisoners came up together. Roe spoke to Bengey, and then drew up to Davis's shop-door - some things hung outside. Roe took something, which I supposed to be cloth, then went round the corner, and in the course of a few minutes they returned and took something else - Bengey went round the corner with him both times. It was light. I informed Davis where they were gone. I am sure they are the men. I did not attack them because I knew them.</p>

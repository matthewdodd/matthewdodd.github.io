               <p>What will become of you if you speak false? - I shall go to the naughty man. Mr. Huckel is my master. The prisoner sent me out for liquor; she sent me out frequently for liquor: she was known to the family; her mother was nurse in it: nobody was left in the shop while I was sent out: my master cautioned me of it, and told me, when she sent me out again, to go for the gentleman next door, which I did; his name is Mr. Adams.</p>

               <p>I am a victualler. On Monday, the 20th of September, the boy fetched me: I went into the shop, and Mr. Harper and me found the woman sitting down in the shop; I told her, I suspected her; and we searched her in the parlour, and found these pair of shoes, and a quantity of duplicates, of boots and shoes that were in pawn; the shoes she was pushing up behind her stays; these are the duplicates: we found four pair of shoes, and a pair of boots: the boots were pawned at Mr. Brown's for nine shillings.</p>

               <p>I produce one pair of stuff shoes, and two of leather, which I took of the prisoner at three different times: I have no doubt of the prisoner: the 30th of August, and the 9th and 11th of September; I lent her two shillings a pair on them; these three duplicates (which were found on the prisoner)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270072"></xptr>belonged to me: I have kept the shoes ever since.</p>
               <p>Northers. I made these two pair of leather, but not the stuff ones.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These stuff shoes are mine; I made some part of them: I was teaching a young lad to work: I had not sold them: they were made for a servant in Gerrard-street: the three pair of leather shoes are mine; they were for sale in my shop; and I made some part of those leather shoes myself: these boots I can only tell by the man's work; I had not sold them: the man only made this one pair; that man is gone into the country: the lowest value of the boots is sixteen shillings, and the shoes, one pair, is two shillings and six-pence, and another pair two shillings and six-pence.</p>

               <p>This little boy came to me where I lived servant: he has known me ten or eleven years: I told him I was coming from my place; and one day he came and said, he had heard of a place, and bid me call at their house; I called, and the place was gone; the prosecutor was within; I asked him to measure me for a pair of shoes; I bid him send them to me: they did not come: I called again; the child said, they were not done; I called again, and the prosecutor tried them on, and they were too large: I called several times after, and they were not done: on the Monday morning the child said, he would give me a pack of cards, and I sat down, and he asked me for something to drink, for his master half starved him; I sent him for some peppermint, and went away; and these shoes that the gentleman has sworn to, I bought of a Jew, for half-a-crown, in the street, and had them in my right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Is it true that this woman came at different times for shoes? - She came twice.</p>
               <p>Are you sure all these things were in your shop? - Yes.</p>

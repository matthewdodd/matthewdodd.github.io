            . I am the Police-constable. I received the prisoner on the 23rd of February; this is the handkerchief - it was partly in his hand, and partly in the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor had me in his possession a quarter of an hour before the officer came up; he had put the handkerchief into his pocket, and took it out again - he said he would do all he could to send me out of the country.</p>
               <p>MR. TURNER. When I turned round the other boy ran away, and the other was about arm's length from me - I turned the instant I thought the handkerchief clear from my person - the prisoner was not running; he said he was innocent, and wished me to go to his mother's.</p>

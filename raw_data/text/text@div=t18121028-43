His basket was knocked down by design, more than by accident, and as I turned round I saw the prisoner and his companion behind me. I recollected that I had some papers and valuable things about me. I pursued my way home. When I got near the corner of Fetter-lane, happening to look about accidentally, I saw the prisoner again, and his companion. I considered then that they were suspicious characters. I endeavoured to get before them. I wished to get further from them. I went off the pavement, and just at the corner of Shoe-lane, supposing I was out of their reach, I felt a sudden tug at my pocket. I immediately turned round. The prisoner was at my right hand. I saw my handkerchief drop from him on the ground. His companion at that moment was rather before me. I instantly collared the prisoner, and I picked up the handkerchief off the prisoner's feet. I took him myself to the officer in Poppins-court. He made no resistance. His companion followed me to the officer's door. I found the officer, and I gave him in charge, and I gave the officer the handkerchief.</p>

             sworn. - The things were pawned at Mr. Purse's, London-wall, we suppose, by the prisoner, the ticket being found on her; I don't recollect taking them in, nor can I swear she pledged them; they were pledged in the name of Frances Robins; two of the pledges are of my writing, but I don't recollect her.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS BAILEY sworn. - I am a constable, and apprehended the prisoner on the 13th of June, at Mr. Bennett's house, at eight o'clock in the evening; I found thirty-one duplicates on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. All I have to say is, the morning I was taken, I went and redeemed a pair of sheets belonging to Mrs. Bennett, as I had warning to go; I did pledge the things at the time I had the room; I was going to leave the room on the Tuesday, and to replace all the things, I went and fetched a pair of sheets in the morning; I went to Oxford-road to make a friend to redeem the rest before I left the lodgings; I thought Mrs. Bennett would have been so good, if I would pay a week's rent, to wait while I could pay the rest.</p>

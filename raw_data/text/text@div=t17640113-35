When I put my hand in my pocket again, my handkerchief was gone: the prisoner was then about six or seven yards from me going off, which made me have a suspicion of him; he got to the door: I put my hand through the people, and took him by the collar, and bid him stop a bit; I said, I had lost my handkerchief, and had a suspicion of him: he immediately pulled my handkerchief out of his pocket, and gave it me; I asked him, why he did so? he said he had no work, and poverty drove him to it. Mr. Warcus obliged me to prosecute him, because several pockets had been pick'd in his house. I really believe the poor fellow was in want at the time. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to).</p>

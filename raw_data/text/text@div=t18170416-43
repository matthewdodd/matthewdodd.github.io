About one o'clock in the morning, I was called up by a fire breaking out there. I saw my pocket-book safe the night before. I went to my office desk, unlocked the door and desk, and took out a pocket-book that had some property in it - I did not then think of the pocket-book which had the 30l. in it. I left the door open, and returned again in about an hour, and found my desk broken open and the pocket-book gone. My office is part of the inn-the same gates enclose the dwelling-house and my office. When I took my pocket-book up at night, it had a 30l. and two 5l. notes in it, and a memorandum of the Lynn coach account. The number of the 30l. note was 7079. I did not take the numbers of the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I took the numbers before I lost the note. I believe Mr. Waldegrave rents part of the inn; he is a joint proprietor of it; my pocket-book was just under his premises-he sleeps there. Mr. Marsh lives at Norwich, and lets the tavern and lodging part to Waldegrave. I produce the note.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live in Queen-street, Tower-hill. On the 9th of March, at two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and had a pot of beer at my house, and tendered me a 30l. note to change. I stopped him, as I suspected him. I asked him if he had not got change, as I could not change it - He said he had not. I sent for an officer, who searched him, and found three 1l. notes, 16s.6d. in silver, and 5d. in copper on him.</p>

I live at Hampton, and am employed under Mr. Ryalls, the foreman of her Majesty's river there—it is called the Longford river, and sometimes the Hampton-court Cut—it goes through the Palace gardens, and belongs to the Queen—on the 1st of Sept., a few minutes after six o'clock in the morning, in consequence of information, I went towards the cut—when I got in sight of it I met Piper—he pointed out the prisoner and James Lee to me—I subsequently saw Mr. Jepson—I went to the place where I had seen the two men, and afterwards, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw dozens and dozens <hi rend="italic">of</hi> fish dead and dying in the water—I took someof them out, and afterwards saw them opened by Mr. Jepson and Mr. Benbow—when I first saw the men they went from the banks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Hampton. On Tuesday morning, the 1st of Sept., between six o'clock and a quarter-past, I was fishing with a line in the Hampton-court Cut, by permission of Mr. Jesse, the superintendent of palaces—I saw George Plumbridge—he asked me if I had seen any person on the bank—I said no—I afterwards, at about a quarter-past six o'clock, saw the prisoner and James Lee standing on the bridge, which is a public thoroughfare over the cut, and looking into the water—I did not notice any fish at that moment, but in a few minutes I saw some Ijing dead at the bottom, in the middle of the stream—it was shallow water and clear—I could see them distinctly—I afterwards saw a great many more, some dying, and some dead—they appeared to be under the influence of some</p>

               <p>narcotic—under that impression I took some out, and took (hem home—they were very large roach, one about a pound weight—in the evening I examined them, and found the stomachs of three of them stained with a deep yellow matter, which is a peculiar property of the coceulus indicus—two others were gorged with a paste composed of coceulus indicus—I compared it with some coceulus indicus afterwards—Mr. Benbow was present—I have not the slightest doubt in the world that the fish had taken coceulus indicus—the stomachs of some contained coceulus indicus, in an undigested state—my impression is that the fish stained with the yellow dye, had taken the poison at an earlier period than those who had it in the form of a paste—those stained with yellow were dead—those which contained coceulus indicus were almost dead—if coceulus indicus had been put into the water the night before, that would account for some fish being in a more advanced state of poisoning than others—when dead they would sink to the bottom.</p>

On Monday, the 31st of Aug., between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop for some coceulus indicus—he did not ask for it by that name—I do not remember the name he called it—it is called by so many names—it was the common name—but I sold him half an ounce of coccnlus indicus—he did not say what he wanted it for—before he left the shop I cantioned him—I told him it was transportation to use it—I did not say what for—I was present when Mr. Jepson opened the fish, and agree with him in what he has stated—I am satisfied that what was found was coceulus indicus—I know that it is sometimes mixed with dough and put into the water.</p>

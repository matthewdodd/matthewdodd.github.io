                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Engley—he lives at Rother<lb></lb>hithe-wall now, with my daughter. We left the Castle public-house, which we kept, on the 8th of December last—the prisoner was neighbour and customer, and used to come backwards and forwards two or three times a day—we were in great difficulties, and I got her to pledge some sheeting and some table-linen, and other things—I have found means since them to take them out, and found that a number of them were changed, and inferior things put in, which had her name on instead of mine, this led me to think that she had other things of mine, as I had lost a great many—her husband had come to my house, but he never came except to the tap-room or bar—she has been in our private apartments—a great many things were found at her house belonging to me—I went and spoke to her, and told her if she would give up my things I would say nothing about it—she denied having any things of mine—she said she had nothing at all belonging to me—all these things found in her house are mine—here are four pictures, framed and glazed, one shawl, one blanket, one decanter-stand, some knives and forks, five scale-beams, three umbrellas, five brass cocks, one dark lantern, one tea-tray, two sheets, one night-gown, one apron, five table-clothes, two silk handkerchiefs, three napkins, my husband's set of razors, two German silver spoons, my spectacles, and some other things—none of these were delivered to her to pawn—they were all stolen—they were found on the floor floor at her house, locked up in drawers—the picture and all the</p>

               <p>things—I had not authorized her, when we were in distress, to remove any of these for safe custody—they were taken from time to time without my knowledge—I have discharged one servant through it, though I have since given her a good character—the prisoner was constantly coming as a friend and had free access up and down stairs.</p>

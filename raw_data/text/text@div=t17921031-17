On Monday I was out all day, and came home at night, and Mrs. Bond said she missed an apron, and on Tuesday she missed two spoons; on Wednesday a constable was sent for, and she confessed; the constable searched her, and found several duplicates, and among them was some of Mrs. Bond's property; she was taxed with it; she owned to having taken the wearing apparel, but not the spoons; she had a muslin apron in her pocket; she begged for mercy; Mrs. Bond said it was better for her to confess: they begged her to confess every thing: I was in the room all the time, she never said she had made away with the things.</p>

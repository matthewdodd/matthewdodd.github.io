            . I am the wife of Thomas Reynolds. I had locked the beads up in the caddy - nobody but the prisoner lived in the house - I did not miss them till one bead was shown to me which was found in the shop - this is the property - they are glass, with a gold snap.</p>

            . The prisoner was given into my custody - I was present on a former occasion, when he was convicted - I produce the certificate of his conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office - the prisoner is the person(read).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The things I am now placed at the bar for are my own. I bought them last Christmas - Master had them in his care - I never saw them from the time I was given in charge.</p>
               <p>T. REYNOLDS. It is false; I have had no quarrel with him - he was bound apprentice to me six years ago - he was convicted before, and I took him back again about January last - he robbed me of a considerable deal of money and some heads - I took him up again - these beads were delivered to me at Guildhall to find the owner and restore them - I had them locked up, and never found the owner - he had concealed them with some money belonging to me, and they were placed in my care by the magistrate, supposing them to be the proceeds of some felony - as soon as I took him again he began to pilfer - I did not know where they were till he took me to the place and showed me them - I accuse him of stealing 20s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was washing myself when master accused me of it - the street-door was open - I went into the yard to wash myself - master came and found the beads, and accused me of it.</p>

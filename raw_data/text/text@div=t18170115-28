               <p>GEORGE WICKERS. I am servant to Messrs. Burgess. On the 3rd of January I packed up seven dozen of anchovies in a hamper, and assisted in putting them into the cart, which Purle drove.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PURLE. I drove the cart; as I was coming down Redcross-street I missed the hamper out of the cart. I met Palley, and in consequence of the information he gave me, I ran into the Crescent, and met Handley; I soon after saw the prisoner, in company with another man, who had the hamper on his back. I attempted to seize the other man, but he threw the hamper down and ran away. I secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. The other man had the hamper. I did not see the prisoner near the cart.</p>

            . On the evening of the 3rd of January, I was at the corner of Jewin-street, I saw the prisoner, and another man, behind the cart; they pulled the hamper out of the cart, and rested it on the other side of the way; two men ran up to them and helped it on one of their shoulders, and then all four ran up Jewin-street. I informed the carter of it, and he ran after them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150012"></xptr> - I went with him. Handley met us, and the carter went into the Crescent, by his direction.

            . I live in Jewin-street Crescent. On the 3rd of January, about five o'clock, I saw two men, with a hamper, going on in a great hurry. I met the carter, and went with him to look after them; the carter collared the man who had the hamper, he threw it down and got away. I laid hold of the prisoner.

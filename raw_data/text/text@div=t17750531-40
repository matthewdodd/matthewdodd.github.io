            . I lost a snuff-box set in gold with a little dog upon it with two brilliants set for eyes, and the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment, ( repeating them.) I missed them on the 3d of May from a chest of drawers, in which I kept them. I saw the square silver snuff-box three days before; but as to the other things I do not know how long they have been missing: they were locked up, but the key was left upon the drawers. The prisoner was my <rs id="t17750531-40-deflabel182" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I have recovered nothing but one handkerchief, that I found in the prisoner's possession at Brighthelmstone, a shirt, and a pair of ruffles; I found the ruffles in the prisoner's own portmanteau; in the garret he lay in, after he was gone. At the last examination before the justice, the prisoner confessed he had the two snuff-boxes; but he said, that Mrs. Gallucci gave them to him. I entrusted him and found him honest till this time.</p>
               <p>Question from the prisoner. Whether you did not entrust me with all your cloaths?</p>
               <p>Gallucci. I had my cloaths in the prisoner's room because I had no room in my own, but it was kept under lock.</p>

            . After Mr. Gallucci advertised the things, the prisoner was stopped at Brighthelmstone; there being no house of correction, he was detained in a room, in a public<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310043"></xptr> house: we searched him, and found a handkerchief, in the room where he was, not on his person. (The handkerchief was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gallucci. I am wife of the prosecutor. I discovered the theft. The first article I missed, was the gold snuff-box. On the prisoner's going off, I looked over my things, and missed all the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>My mistress may swear what she pleases: she gave me the things. I have nothing else to say in my defence. I have no witness. I have a good character in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gallucci. I did not give them to him; if he had not stolen them, he need not have run off.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday morning I apprehended the prisoners in Little Collingwood-street; they were passing a house I was in, at the back of the prosecutor's premises. I had heard of the robbery, and at No. 4, in Collingwood-street, on the first floor, found this piece of floor-cloth. Johnson occupied the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is her name Johnson or Williams - A. Johnson. I stopped the prisoners in consequence of what she said. I believe she is a woman of the town - it is a very low neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>R. B. SKILLERN. I was with Hall; his account is correct.</p>

            . I lived at No. 4, Collingwood-street, alone - I have known Collett three years. On the evening before the robbery, Collett told me to be at home, (I did not know him before.) I did not stay at home. On the Saturday morning, between one and two o'clock, when I got home, I saw the floor-cloth in the room up stairs, and about twenty minutes after, Collett brought the holland and screw nuts, and gave them into my hands; my door can be opened by pulling a string - Collett knew that; Annereau followed him in, and they both took the floor-cloth up stairs, and told me to open the door to nobody until they came next morning, between nine and ten o'clock, and if not, at six o'clock in the evening - they came between nine and ten o'clock together. I was in a neighbour's house, with the officers, when they passed, and they were taken before they got to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your name - A. I go by the name of Johnson, my married name is Stevens - my name was Lloyd before I married. I see company at times, but since Christmas have got my living by needlework; the officers came to me between eight and nine o'clock. I had not then told them anything. Annereau was never in my house but twice before. I was sober when they brought the holland - they knew how to open the door.</p>

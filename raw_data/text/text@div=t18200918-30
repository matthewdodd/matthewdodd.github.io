I have never seen them since - it was a red case, and quite new.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Might you not very easy have let them fall - A. It is possible. I had used them at a house in Clement's-lane.</p>

            , a Barrister, of Lincoln's Inn. I saw Mr. Curtis at the corner of Clement's-lane, the prisoner and two others were close by him in the lane, I perceived something red come from Mr. Curtis's pocket; it was taken by the prisoner or his companions - I saw it pass from one to the other. All three turned down Lombard-street, and Mr. Curtis crossed, I went to him, and told him that his pocket-book was taken, seeing it was something red; he felt, and missed his spectacles. I went after them, and laid hold of the prisoner, the other two went off. I saw the prisoner looking at what had been taken, which was in the hands of the other two. I told the prisoner he had been picking a gentleman's pocket, and by that time Mr. Curtis came up. I delivered him to Mr. Curtis, and went after the others, but lost them. I took the prisoner to the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner said he knew nothing about it - A. He did. I saw them speaking to him before and after the robbery, and all three walked away very leisurely. It was imposible for one not to know what the other was doing.</p>

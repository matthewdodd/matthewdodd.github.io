On the twenty-fifth of October, my wife and I went out, and left the prisoner in our apartments. She had been with me a month. We took her out of charity. We went out about six in the evening, and came home between eleven and twelve. We expected to find the prisoner at home. She was gone. We looked round, and missed the half pint mug, and several things. Next morning I made information before Sir

A pair of tea-tongs were found upon her. She delivered up that night the ring and stone shoe buckle. Besides the things, she had on her a black silk that and cloak. We took her to St. Catharine's next day, because she had said over night that the remainder of the things were at her lodgings in St. Catharine's Lane, and that she had sold the place to a silver-smith in the Minories. We went to the cook's shop where she had taken a lodging, and found all the things in the indictment (mentioning them) except the mug and spoon she had sold to the silver-smith. She had taken the black silk gown to pieces. Then we went to the silversmith's. He produced the mug and spoons he had bought of her.</p>

            . I am a silver-smith, and live in the Minories. [produces a silver mug and spoon.] I bought these of a woman the twenty-sixth of October. I don't know her person; she had a hat over her face. I gave her 5 s. an ounce for them. She said she was in distress; and was obliged to sell them. I had no suspicion of her.</p>
               <p>Q. So all is bought that comes to the shop?</p>
               <p>Peacock. No; I give a fair price, and don't buy if I suspect.</p>

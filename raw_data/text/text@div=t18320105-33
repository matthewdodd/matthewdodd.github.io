               <p>JOSEPH EDWARDS. I was left in care of three large houses, in <placeName id="t18320105-33-crimeloc188">Angel-passage, Skinner-street, Bishopsgate</placeName>

On the 19th of December I went to bed about ten o'clock; the house was quite safe - I had an ass in the passage, which parts the two houses; it is arched over - there is no yard between that and the house: I was called up about seven o'clock by my daughter, and found ten or twelve feet of the wall cut down to let the ass out, which was taken away; I found it at Waltham-abbey, in about a fortnight- I have seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not swear, on the Testament, that you would not hurt me, if I discovered your property? A. Never; he said he knew the party who stole it, that he was very sorry a poor man with eight children should be robbed, and he would take me to where it was; but when he had taken me eight miles, he ran away and left me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have no doubt the Jury will find me guilty - if I had done murder I could not have been more tormented in my mind, and knowing the man had a large family I determined to go and tell him where it was- if I had had 7s. I would have got it back; I went to his house last Friday, and told him all about it, and said if he did not mind losing a day's work I would go and shew him where it was - I took him, and shewed him the Green Man - he said, "Don't come in, I will go in and ask if they sell donkies - you go about your business;" I went home, glad that he would recover it; when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050034"></xptr>got home he sent his servant for gin, and gave me in charge - I do not get my living by thieving, or I should not convict myself, which I have done.</p>

               <p>ROBERT DENT. I am a warehouseman to

                  Thomas

                  </persName>
            . On the 26th of November, about five minutes past nine in the morning, I was going to the warehouse; I saw the prisoner and two others on the opposite side of the way; I saw two of them go up the court of Smith, George and Watson; them two came out, and they all went together to the Old Change.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing with them - A. Nothing at that time. They went into the Old Change and turned to the left; in about half a minute I saw them all three return; the prisoner had got a knot on his shoulder; I saw him go into the gate of the court of Smith, George, and Watson; all three came out; the prisoner had a box on his knot; I walked up on the opposite side of of the way, he had got ten yards from the door or thereabouts; I went towards him and said I believed the box was not his; upon which he threw the box down and ran off; I ran after him and cried stop thief; he was taken just at the end of Newgate street; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the box - A. The box was not removed on my return, I believe; I found the box in Watling street, in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the box - A. I did not take any particular notice; I cannot say it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a box on the man's shoulder - A. I did, he threw it down.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back you saw it in the same place - A. Yes; it was carried into Mr. Smith's house by some of Mr. Smith's men I believe.</p>
               <p>JOHN FLINN. I live with Mr. Smith as porter. I knew this box to be in the court that leads up to the house at half past eight in the morning; I did not notice it till I saw it lay in Watling street, about ten yards from my master's; I stood by it till the prisoner was brought back. I helped carry the box into the court again.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that is your box that was in your master's yard in the morning, and you saw it in Watling street afterwards - A. Yes, it is marked PN 104.</p>

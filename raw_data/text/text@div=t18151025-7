            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 3rd of October, the prisoner attempted to pawn this piece of cotton; he wanted twenty-five shillings on it. By the account he gave of it, I thought he could not have come honestly by it; I told him, I would send my boy with him to know where he got it. I told my boy to tell the watchman to take him into custody, and take him to the watchhouse immediately. It may be worth about two shillings a yard, and I don't think it is worth forty shillings; though I dare say it cost more.</p>

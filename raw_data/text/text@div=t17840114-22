               <p>- LANGSTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I live within two doors of the prosecutor, on Friday the 2d of January, I observed the prisoner Lyon go backwards and forwards by the prosecutor's door; he went a few doors below the prosecutor's and from thence brought the other prisoner; as soon as I saw the prisoners come to the prosecutor's window, I run to the next door neighbour but one on the other hand, and told him I suspected there were two men going to cut the prosecutor's window, and I saw them turn away from the window, and I went up running to see if the window was broke, I found the window broke, and we took the two prisoners, and he went and fetched another neighbour.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present in the shop when the tooth-pick case dropped? - I was, I was as close to the prisoner as I am to this gentleman, I heard it drop, it dropped from Rigg.</p>
               <p>(The tooth-pick case produced, and positively deposed to.)</p>
               <p>What is the value of it? - I valued it at five shillings.</p>

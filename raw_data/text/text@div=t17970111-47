               <p>Q. Did the same persons crane down the goods into your cart, upon that day, as used to do it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take the goods to? - A. To Mr. Wilson's house, in Leman-street, by Mr. Wilson's orders.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there? - A. Yes; there were about twelve or thirteen casks of stockings, or coverlids, or something of that sort; they were part of the King's stores; the prisoner and I put them into the casks, and they were taken away to be sold, for the advantage of the prisoner and Wilson, and me; the prisoner had received his share of the money for former things, but not for this; I paid him somewhere about eight pounds the very day that Wilson was taken; I was to have had mine at night, but Wilson being taken I never had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who craned these goods down into the cart? - A. Some men that were on the works; the prisoner was there, and turned them out in the crane, to let them down where Wilson received them; Wilson went with the cart, and I went in the evening and unpacked them; Wilson took them up stairs into his room.</p>

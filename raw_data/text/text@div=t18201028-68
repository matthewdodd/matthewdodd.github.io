            . I have frequently seen the prisoner write, and am particularly acquainted with his hand-writing. The signature T. Gordon to the register is his. In 1814 he shewed me a certificate of his marriage, on the coast of America. He said he was married, and that was the certificate of it; he said he had got it from his wife, and that was all he wanted. In June, 1815, when we came to Portsmouth, he told me he had heard his <rs id="t18201028-68-viclabel373" type="occupation">wife</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Do you know the present Miss Lawes - A. Yes, she has been to me. I was subpoened here. I went to Chatham and Sheerness with her to find Cole. I saw some of the bills posted at Sheerness and Woolwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing a man named Bone at your house a few months ago - A. Very probably I might, but I do not know him by name. I never said it was of no importance whether Cole was alive or not, so that I got the reward, nor that there was a lady in London who would give 100 l. to a man to swear Gordon's first wife was alive.</p>

The prisoner lived with me in King-street, Deptford; he came to lodge with me again the beginning of 1813 or 1814, he was then with a woman, whom he called his wife; she lived three or four weeks with him, and then escaped out of the back parlour window - he had locked her in the room, as they had words, and when he came home she was gone. I saw her about twelve months after with a child. I saw the prisoner two or three times after. He called in the beginning of 1819, and asked if I had seen his wife? I said not since I saw him. He desired me to save his neck - I asked him what he meant? I understood him to say he was going to be married, or was married. I had seen his wife about four years before that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Might it not have been 1810 or 1811 that you saw her - A. No; I can tell by my child's age; he was nine years old on the 27th of August, and he was a little boy at the time.</p>

             - the signature to the register is hers. She lived about two years ago with my mother; she afterwards went to lodge at the prisoner's brother, and married the prisoner - she afterwards died. Before her death I told the prisoner I should see about his previous marriage. He said he never had been married to any other woman but my sister. He afterwards confessed it, and asked for mercy. He had behaved very insolent, and next day he requested permission to see me and asked for mercy. I said,</p>
               <p>"How can you expect mercy, when you married a second wife, knowing your first was alive?" He then said he did not know whether she was alive or dead. My sister had about 2000 l. in the Bank, and other money - about 180 l. a year altogether. He said several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280032"></xptr>times he would give up the d - d business if I would allow him 40 l. a year. I said I would allow him nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your sister's money was left her by her mother at her sole disposal - A. Exactly so. I had no claim to it. She died about the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ a Mr. Pugh, an attorney - A. He wrote to the trustees in January, 1819, my sister was then alive, she died last March. I had some bills printed and circulated at all the sea-ports before her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Nebemiah - A. There was a man of that name who tuned my instrument. I never offered him 20 l. to swear the prisoner's first wife was alive. I do not believe I ever said a syllable to him about the business.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Solemnly on your oath you never did - A. I never did. My sister lived with the prisoner till her death - I could not separate them. She was quite of infirm mind, and had a paralytic stroke, which affected her speech. Dr. Thornton and others have made affidavits of it.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. Miss Lawes lived in my house at Woolwich. He was about to marry her - I only knew of his intent ten days before the marriage deed was executed. Before that I made diligent enquiry for his first wife of Mrs. Brooks and Jones, at his particular request. Miss Lawes knew he was a widower - it was occasionally a topic of conversation, for they were in my house a month before they were married. My brother told me his wife ran away from him in 1813. Miss Lawes was present at her sister's death.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How long was that young lady in your house before he married her - A. About a month, and my wife had known her thirty years; in fact Miss Lawes was a tenant of mine some years ago. I made the enquiry about the years 1814 and 1815, not since. I never mentioned to Miss Lawes that my brother was about to marry her sister - they were acquainted about a month before they were married.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know whether they agreed to marry at first meeting - A. They walked out daily.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As you knew Miss Laws so long, did you not call upon her, and say you was glad you were going to be related to her - A. She was out of town.</p>

A gentleman asked me what I knew, and I told him. Mrs. Millington fetched me to the gentleman's house. I had not seen Shott for twelve months before.</p>

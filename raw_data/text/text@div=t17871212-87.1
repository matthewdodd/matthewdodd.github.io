               <p>What was the value of them? - The single ones would sell for half a guinea a pair, the double jointed ones about fifteen shillings or sixteen shillings a pair; I gave seven shillings and six-pence a pair for the single jointed ones, and thirteen shillings for the double jointed ones; I paid one pound nineteen shillings for the three double jointed ones, out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you ever recover them again? - No, the spectacles were sold to a Jew, and the reading-glass was pawned in East Smithfield; when the prisoner Harding was taken, he had a duplicate of the reading-glass in his pocket; he was taken the Tuesday following; and the duplicate was found upon him, and a long wire in his pocket, and a thing to scrape the putty off.</p>

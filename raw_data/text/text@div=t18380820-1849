                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Robinson, a tailor in Nassu-place, Commercial-road. On the 20th of July I was at the door, and missed a coat—it had been inside the door—I received information, and ran down Cannon-street—I saw the prisoner there, running with the coat, and wrapping it up—I called "Stop thief," and he was taken—I picked up the coat, which I saw him throw down.</p>

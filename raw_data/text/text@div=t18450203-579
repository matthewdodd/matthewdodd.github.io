                  </hi>. I am the wife of Melville Sherriff—we life in Albany-street, Camberwell. On Wednesday evening, the 22nd of Jan. I had a quantity of linen hanging in my garden, which is inclosed, and has a ditch at the bottom—the linen was safe at a quarter past seven o'clock, and was missed at half-past seven—I have seen some of them since in the hands of the officer—I have seen a pair of stockings belonging to Isabella Bagnall, some aprons and other things of Jane Jones, who is my servant—I know all the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of Deacon. The policeman says he was looking out of the window of Probert's house about half-past ten o'clock on the Thursday morning, prior to his being taken—I know he was at my house at half-past ten, and from that till about twenty minutes to twelve—he was cleaning himself to go to look for a place—he cleaned himself in the wash-house in the yard down stairs—the house consists of four room and a washhouse—the laundry is up stairs—he was cleaning himself in the yard down stairs—I saw him there for about an hour, and before that he was in the next house—he then came and cleaned himself for an hour, and then I believe he was at the top of Peacock-street—Mrs. Brown saw him—she is coming, I believe, for Probert—my son has been at work with me—I am a carpenter—he was in place at Mr. Ireland's, a greengrocer's, before he worked for me.</p>

                  </hi>. Probert was at my house last Wednesday fortnight—she came at half-past five o'clock, and did not leave my place till half-past ten or a quarter to eleven—she lives with Brent—I know on the Thursday morning, about ten o'clock, Deacon came to our house for some apples, and he was about the top of the street from that time till half-past eleven or twelve—he was not at his own place.</p>

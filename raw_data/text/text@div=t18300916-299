The prisoner took a lodging of me on the 19th of April as a single man; on Saturday, the 24th of July, I went out about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, returned after eleven, and found my little boy waiting at the door - I had left my wife at home in care of the house, and all this property secure - I occupy one room below, and work in the prisoner's room; this property was chiefly in the bottom room; I have four children by my wife - the eldest is seventeen years old - he was out at the time - my youngest is two years old; I inquired for my wife, and found she was gone, and the prisoner also - the prisoner's week was up on the Monday - he would have been indebted to me about 18s.; I found my place quite deserted, the drawers and every thing stripped; I went up stairs and all my things were gone - my working tools were taken off my bench up stairs; a great deal of the property is my wife's dress; but there was table-linen, pillow-cases, and five or six shoemaker's tools, which were all safe when I left, and the prisoner was then in the workroom - he had not said he was going; I could have placed my life in his hands - my wife had taken two of the children away, I could not find them; I got information from a coachman, and found her at No. 17, Penny's-fields, Poplar, on the 17th with the prisoner and children, and all the property except the bed-tick, which was in pawn - my wife came home that evening, and we have been living together ever since; she had 3l. when she went away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You and she had some disagreement had not you? A. We had a few words through the prisoner poisoning her mind that I was cohabiting with a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told you went to France and left her pennyless? A. I went, with her consent, for three months, to see if I could do better than here - that was sixteen years ago; the prisoner has poisoned her mind under the cloak of Religion - the apparel belonged to her and the two children: he had tools of his own, but these were mine.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coachman. On the 24th of July, at ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked what I would charge him to go to Poplar, near Limehouse-road - I said 5s.; he said if I was not gone off the stand in a quarter of an hour, he would take me - he brought a woman and two children; they got into the coach, he got on the box, and drove to Philip-lane, close by; several bundles were put into the coach there - I drove them to Poplar, and put them down at Penny's-field; the prisoner paid me 5s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was quite dark? A. Yes - I never saw the prisoner before; I am sure he is the man - I saw him take the goods out of the coach; I did not see him use any compulsion to the woman; the goods were not taken from the prosecutor's house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

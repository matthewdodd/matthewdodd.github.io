            . I am servant to Mr. Deacon. On Sunday, the 7th of December, my master employed me to watch the prisoner, who was also in his service, and about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I concealed myself in the shop, and at half-past nine, the street door bell rang; the female servant let the prisoner in - he had no orders to come on Sunday. He went up into the kitchen; then immediately came down into the shop, and took up a tin scoop, went round the counter to a canister of green tea, and took the scoop out full; he walked into the warehouse with it - he returned and took a second, and then a third scoop full, which would be about 4 lbs. together. He came through the shop in a few minutes, and went out - I followed him into the street, collared him, and brought him back. The officer found the tea, sugar, and chocolate on him - the sugar and chocolate were not in sight where I was concealed.</p>

I found above a pound of tea loose in each of his breeches pockets, and in his side pocket more tea, and above a pound in his hat, with paper over it - a can of chocolate in his pocket, and a pound of sugar on each side of his breast, next his skin.</p>

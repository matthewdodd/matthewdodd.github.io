On 29th Dec, between 4 and 5 o'clock, in the afternoon, three men and a woman came there—the prisoners were two of them—the male prisoner called for a quartern of gin, and a glass of noyean—the female prisoner took a white pocket handkerchief and wiped his coat down, as it was raining—she separated from the men; went and sat down at the bottom of the room, and called for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth more gin—one of the men left the male prisoner, and went to the woman—there were then two at the top, and two at the bottom of the counter—the male prisoner then went down to where the woman was, and asked me what the best whisky was a quart—I told him, and he said he would take a pint—I served him with it, and he said, "Put a pint of the best gin in a bottle"—I did so, and altogether it amounted to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which he took out of a small pocket book—I looked</p>

               <p>at it, and not liking the appearance of it I took it to my master, in the bar parlour—he said it was a bad one—he came to the counter and asked the male prisoner where he got it from—he said he got it in change of a <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>—my master asked him where—he said, "At an hotel"—he was asked what hotel—he said he had been <hi rend="italic">spreeing</hi> about and had just come from New York, and bad got between 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the hotel—by my master's desire I fetched two policemen, who were passing the front door, and while I was speaking my master ran out, and caught the man just by where I was standing with the policemen—he told the policemen that that was the man that had offered him the note and he was brought into the passage, and eventually given into custody—I am positive that the note I received from the prisoner was the one I gave to my master.</p>

On Wednesday, 29th Dec, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, my barman brought me a note into the bar, purporting to be a Bank of England note—I examined it, came to the bar, and saw the prisoner Wilson there (I am not a native of England)—I asked him where he got the note from—he said he brought it from his hotel, he had changed it for <hi rend="italic">a ten</hi>, and had spent all the money, and only had this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left—I asked him where he came from, and he told me New York—I asked him about the hotel—he could not tell what hotel it was, or where it was—he said he was out for a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>, and spent all the money, and that was all he had left—I asked him where he lived—he said anywhere, wherever he could—I said it was a bad note—he said, "If it is a bad note, I had it out of change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note," and said to my barman," Let me look at the note?"—I said, "When you tell me your name, and where you got it from, then I might let you look"—I told the young man, in his hearing, to fetch a policeman—Wilson said, "I will see you d—d first," or some such expression, "I will go and fetch one," and turned to go out—he went out at the middle door—I went as fast as I could out of the other door, took hold of him just as he came on to the pavement, and pointed him out to a policeman, and poked him into the passage—up to this time I had not seen the female prisoner—the policeman, Wilson, and myself then went into the coffee room—we searched Wilson, but only found a purse and a knife—the female prisoner then came into the coffee room, sat down, and asked for a cup of coffee—we do not allow females in the coffee room—I ordered her out of the house, and she left—I gave Wilson into custody with the note.</p>

I have no notes about me; I was out all day drinking yesterday"—she asked if she might be allowed to see the man she was charged with; I told her she would, after she was searched—I did not search her—there was nothing found on her relating to this charge—I took her into the waiting room, where the male prisoner was with a constable; she said she had never seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the last witness. On 8th Sept. a person, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came and asked to look at some shirts—I saw him lay something down on the counter, which bad the appearance of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, but I was on the opposite side of the shop—six weeks or two months afterwards I went to Newgate, for the purpose of recognizing the man who passed the note—I saw ten prisoners brought out into the yard, and I recognized the last one in the file, as they were marched round the yard—it was the male prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of notes to the Bank of England. This note first produced is a forgery in all respects, paper and print, and it wants the water mark—this other note is also forged; it is not Bank paper, and there is no water mark, only the imitation of one—they are both from the same plate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But one note is headed "London, 1852," and the other is, "Leicester, June 21, 1852?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The "Leicester" is placed lower down than the "London," but the copperplate engraving is the same; if you place the two notes together, you will see that all the engraving comes on the same line, and there is space enough for "London," "Leicester," or "Manchester," to be put before—a note at the Bank of England is made from one plate, and "London," "Leicester," or whatever place it is, is put in in the type afterwards.</p>

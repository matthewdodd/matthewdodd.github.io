               <p>Q. In consequence of missing them on Monday morning, what did you do - A. I told the carpenter, Sherry, to go to his work; Sherry said he suspected they were in the neighbourhood; I said to him if you will follow your employ I will put up with the loss; he went away and came back again; in consequence of the information of Sherry, I went into the yard of Mr. Knight, a sawyer and timber merchant in Old Nicoll street, Bethnal Green; when I went in I saw some deals; I said, Sherry, them are my deals; there were ten standing by the saw pit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them by any mark upon them - A. Yes; I have had them in my hands at different times, and them deals being so long by me, and endeavouring to use them for the best purposes; four deals I know by the marks on them; there were the marks of three shores on one, and three nail holes, and one of the deals found was a very clean one, fit for mouldings; that was a yellow deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the value of these deals - A. Eight shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. Yes; he lived in Lamb-street, Spital fields.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You knew him very well and he knew you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and him took a bit of ground together - A. No, not taken the ground; I took the ground and he built the houses; we had some words and I discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. And after you discharged him, you spoke well of him and he of you; he and you were not good friends at the time these deals were lost - A. No, not very good friends nor no enemies; when I met him in the street, he did not look at me in a civil manner, or else I should have been ready to meet him.</p>
               <p>Q. After you missed the deals you got Armstrong the officer, and you met the prisoner; he went with you to Mr. Knight's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know these ten deals to be yours - A. I swear to four in particular, and the others I have a perfect knowledge of.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say you know one of them by the mark of a shore and by the nail holes - A. Yes; we had been taking down two houses; they had been standing some time; we have been using them from time to time; that brings me to a perfect knowledge of that board.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you know the faces of all of them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark of the three shores; does your shores leave a different print from others - A. No; that is not likely; when we use a deal we look to the quality; it is the quality of the deal as well as the marks I know it by.</p>
               <p>Q. That makes you, a cautions man; swear to the deal - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your deals are very remarkable, they have some nail holes; your nail holes are different from all others - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are of the same opinion now as when you found them in the timber yard - A. Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have always said you have maintained that opinion. Have you never said that you was satisfied that he was innocent - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you would rather have given fifty pounds than to make the charge - A.Never; and here I am upon my oath, I never said anything of that kind in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went to Knight's was he in custody of Armstrong - A. Yes.</p>

Yes; I was employed to finish some houses in Grey Eagle street, I saw the deals there on Saturday evening six o'clock. On Monday morning I missed them eleven deals; I found ten on the same morning at Mr. Knight's deal yard in Old Nicolls street. I knew them as soon as I saw them before; I got into the yard; I knew them; there were eight of them standing up inside by the gate and two of them laying down by the saw pit.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether any or all of them are Mr. Jeffrey's deals - A. I can, some.</p>
               <p>Court. What length are they - A. Some twelve foot, some eleven, and some ten. This is Mr. Jeffreys deal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010054"></xptr>it has three nail holes; the other deal has a knot.</p>
               <p>Jury I may have ten deals in my yard like these.</p>

               <p>Sherry. This is the fourth deal; I know that deal, it has a large swell; I took particular notice of it, it is a very irregular deal.</p>

About seven months ago the plumber came to lay on a pipe for the water; there were twenty three deals in Grey Eagle street; Mr. Jeffrey desired me to remove them to the adjoining house, and one of these deals he took notice of; instead of one of the edges being square is is round; it is a very rough shaggy deal, one of the ends is round, and a knot in the middle with a hole in it; I made some marks on it with the paving hammer, chopping some wood for the plumber to make a fire.</p>

No: On Wednesday, the 21st of November last, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came into my brother's shop, with a boy and a girl, somewhere about five or six years old; she asked to look at some cloth, I shewed her some; I asked her how much the wanted; she told me the only wanted a small quantity; I told her a remnant might suit her as well, and I sold her a remnant; she then said she wanted a child's great-coat frock; in course quence of having some suspicion of the prisoner, I counted the quantity of prints that I took down to shew her, I shewed her eight preces; I sold her two yards of one; I asked her then if she did not want a frock; she said, no; she put down a seven-shilling piece, and I put up the two yards of print and remnant of cloath in a paper; I took up the seven-shilling piece, and desired her to step further up the shop, and I would give her change; I then went and counted the prints as she was going out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050048"></xptr>at the door, and found there was one missing; I then went and stopped the prisoner, who had got about a yard from the door, she denied it; I told her, that she had been stealing a piece of print; I was then coming out of the shop just before her, and I saw the print lying just behind her in the shop on the ground, about half a yard or three quarters from her, it was a piece of cotton, containing twenty-eight yards.</p>

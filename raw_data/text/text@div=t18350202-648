Bank-note from Drewett and Co., No. 13,789, dated the 19th of November, 1834—it was Mr. Wilson's money—I gave it to him, and he enclosed it in a letter, and sealed it, but nobody saw him do it—it was on Thursday, the 8th of January—I entered the note in the cash-book—Mr. Wilson, that evening, gave me a sealed letter, which I suppose contained that note—it was directed to Mr. John H. How, to the care of John Wilson and Co., hat-manufacturers, Denton, Lancashire—I directed the prisoner to take care of it, as it was valuable, and contained money, and to be sure and put it into the post-office—on the Saturday, I was at Mrs. Colston's, and she showed me a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which I knew to be the note I mentioned—Mr. Wilson is in town, but not in at<lb></lb>tendance—I have not a doubt of the note being the same—the prisoner came back that day, and remained till Saturday, and then left without notice—he was taken at the Northumberland Arms.</p>

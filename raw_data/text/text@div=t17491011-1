In the morning my wife got up and left me in bed, and some time after I heard somebody in my room, turned the curtain aside and saw the prisoner; I asked her what she wanted; she made me no answer, but went away; I got up immediately, and felt in my pocket in order to put my money up, I miss'd it and went down stairs; I mentioned it to my wife, I desir'd the prisoner to walk up stairs, into the one pair of stairs room, and ask'd her if she had not robb'd me; she said she had not; said I, I will search you. I found in her pocket a remarkable sixpence with a hole in it, which I knew I took over night; I search'd her box after she was sent to the Counter, (then Mr. Kitchen was by) and in it I found a pair of old stockings, and a dirty hussiff, in which I found wrapp'd up two 36 s. pieces, one guinea, one half guinea, and seven shillings in silver; the next day I took her before the Alderman, where she told me there was more money than was mine, after I had told her I had found the money in a box; saying one of the 36 s. pieces was her own: the 36 s. piece of mine was not weight, and had a mark on it by the side of the head, I weigh'd it and found it answer to the weight before.</p>

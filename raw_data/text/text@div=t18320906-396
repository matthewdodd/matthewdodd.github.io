I saw the prisoner in company with the prosecutor at the Bull's Head, on the night of the 7th of September - he went out and she followed him; he stopped when he had got a few doors off, and said he had lost his bundle - I went out to him, and said, "I understand you have a 5l. note about you:" he said, "Yes, I have in this purse, and I mean to take it home to my wife and family" - the prisoner was close to him at the time; I pushed her away: a young girl came up to her, and said, "Nance, will you stand some gin" - she said, "I have not a blessed farthing, but I shall soon have some money, and I will treat you;" I said to her, "You had better let him alone, you know he has a 5l. note about him" - she said, "No, I will go home with him to night, so help me God."</p>

             (Police-constable K 160). I went to a house in Bluegate-fields the next morning - I found the prisoner there; I asked what she had done with the man's pocket-book and purse; she said she knew nothing about it - I said, "What have you done with the man's money?" she said, "I have got no money," but I found on the floor a sovereign and a sixpence, and a woman, who was there, said she had seen her that morning with four or five half-crowns in her hand.</p>

I was in the room where the officer apprehended the prisoner; she had come home that morning, and called me at half-past five o'clock or a quarter before six - she said God was good, and she was not without 1l. or some silver - she showed me a sovereign and three or four half-crowns in her hand; I asked her if she had got it honestly, and she said she was as right as the day - she asked me to go and buy some things; we then had a cup of tea, and the officer came and took her.</p>

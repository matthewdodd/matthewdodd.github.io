On 22nd April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in the New-road, and met Wheatley and Holmes near the Hampstead-road—I crossed over to Mason, and we watched them—Holmes stopped at the corner of a gateway, and looked about as if looking for some one—Wheatley walked on—Smith came up a few minutes after, joined Holmes, and then they all joined and walked toward Euston-square, following some ladies—they then turned, and followed some ladies back—they then turned back again, and went as far as Euston-square—I continued to watch from the garden; I was in on the other side of the way, and saw three ladies and a gentleman come out of Euston-square, one of whom was Mrs. Chambery—Holmes made a <hi rend="italic">rush</hi> past them, and the others stopped behind—Wheatley then went up to Mrs. Chambery, and put his hand into her pocket—Smith was then about a yard behind,<hi rend="italic">covering</hi> him—I law Wheatley's hand going backwards and forwards, and in about half a minute Wheatley and Smith both made a <hi rend="italic">rush</hi> past them joined Holmes at the corner of George-street, and they all three ran down George-street together—I made a communication to the lady, went after the prisoners, and saw them all in about ten minutes coming up Drummond-street together, about 300 yards from where they had stopped the ladies—when they got to the area of the corner house, No. 24, I saw another policeman coming, and we made a rush at them—Wheatley made a <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> down on the ground, and I fell over him—I collared him, and told him I wanted him for picking a lady's pocket in the New-road ten minutes previous—he said I was mistaken—I said I was not, I saw him do it—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isidor Levinson, a hosier and glover in the Haymarket. One Thursday afternoon, I think the 12th of December, the prisoners, Golden and Baker, came into the shop together—Baker asked me for a pair of white cotton stockings—I showed them some, after looking at him for a minute or two, as he was extremely agi<lb></lb>tated when I came forward to him—I took the stockings off a shelf—I had no occasion to move from where I stood, as the shelf was within reach—I opened the stockings for them to look at—I looked at the prisoner Baker, and being alone, I did not judge it prudent to accuse him at the moment—there were some handkerchiefs on the counter, and when I produced the stockings, I missed the handkerchiefs—I said, "There were some crimson silk handkerchiefs lying here not a minute before, no person has been in the shop, you must have taken them?"—on which Baker said, "We are respectable young men, we came in here to buy, not to steal, my father's name is Taylor, and I reside in Bond-street"—I asked Baker to take off his hat, which he did instantly—I found nothing there—I then asked him to turn out his pockets, which he did, and I found nothing there—I looked at Golden, and he did something with his hat which he took off, and held before his eyes—I requested him to take off his hat, which he did, and I found nothing—I then saw his left side pocket very bulky, and requested him to turn that out, and I should be satisfied, on which he said something to his companion, which I did not understand, and they instantly rushed out of the shop—my servant came in while I was talking to them, and came round the counter to me, and stood by me till the two prisoners ran away—she ran out after them—I went to the door and called "Stop thief"—I saw Baker go up Norriss-street—Golden ran towards Coventry-street with the pair of stockings naked in his hand—he had tendered me half-a-crown the instant he came into the shop—I had not sold him the stockings—they came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I told him so—he ran away, leaving the half-crown on the counter without waiting for change—I did not see them again till they were in custody at Bow-street—Sergeant Pocock brought the handkerchiefs to my shop afterwards—no<lb></lb>body had been in the shop after I had seen the handkerchiefs safe on the counter, and nobody had the opportunity of taking them, except one of the two prisoners.</p>

I was on duty on Tuesday, the 31st of December, in Belton-street, Long-acre, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner Myers go into No. 12, in that street, which is a broker's-shop, with an empty bag wrapped upunder his arm—he was in there about three-quarters of an hour—he then came out, and had the bag under his arm still in the same state, and went towards Long-acre—I watched him—he did not go out of my sight—he went about one hundred yards up Belton-street, towards Long-acre—I saw a young female come out of the same house as he had come out of—she ran p the street, stopped Myers, and brought him back to No. 12—I still kept my eye on the house, and in about a quarter of an hour he came out again, with the bag on his shoulder, very bulky—he went up Belton-street, towards Long-acre—I followed, and stopped him in Long-acre, and asked him what he had in his bag—he said, "Only a few packs of cards "—I told him I was not satisfied, he must go with me to the station-house, which he did—I searched his bag there, and found six packs of playing-cards, and a number of handkerchiefs and other things—when I pulled out the silk-handkerchiefs he said, "That is my property; I bought it in the re<lb></lb>gular way of trade, down in Cutler-street, Houndsditch"—I know Cutler-street is a place for things of that sort—I did not apprehend Golden and Baker, the person who did is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Baker's-row, Walworth. On the 11th of October, about nine o'clock at night, I was at the end of New-street—I had had some drink, but was quite capable of managing myself—the prisoner accosted me, and said, where was I going—I said, not with her—she drew my watch out of my fob in a moment after accosting me—I told her she had got my watch—she said she had not—I said I would hold her till she gave it up—she said she would not, and she would send word to my wife—I called out, and a policeman came up—I gave her in charge, and as she was going to the station I saw her drop the watch—she denied having it—I did not see it drop from her, but I saw it rolling on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 11th I was returning home, and met the prosecutor and the prisoner in company with the witness—they told me she had taken a watch from him—I asked if he charged her with stealing it—he said he did, and he was confident she had it about her—I immediately took her, made her walk a little in advance, and when we got about a hundred yards I distinctly saw it drop on the ground from her person.</p>

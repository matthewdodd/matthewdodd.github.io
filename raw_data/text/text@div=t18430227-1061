                  </hi>. I am a dentist, and live in High-street, St. Giles's. On the 21st of Feb. the prisoner and two other men came into my shop—one of the other men requested to have a tooth extracted—I examined his mouth, and saw no tooth that wanted extracting; but he fixed on one in the lower jaw, and said he would have it out—I said it was quite sound, but he insisted on having it out—I desired him to walk into the sur<lb></lb>gery—they all three walked into the surgery—I then set the man in a chair to take his tooth out, and on the back of another chair was my coat—I pro<lb></lb>ceeded to extract the tooth, but the man slipped out of the chair, and pre<lb></lb>vented me—I made another attempt, and he served me the same again—I then made a third attempt, and succeeded—I got the tooth out, but I am sure he did not expect it—while I was doing so the prisoner left the surgery, and in a few minutes the other man left, and left me with the man whose tooth I had taken out—he then washed his mouth—he asked what it was; I said one shilling—he said he could afford no more than sixpence, and I took it—I went back to the surgery to put away the things, and missed the coat.</p>

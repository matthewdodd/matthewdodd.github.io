                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Portugal-place, Cam<lb></lb>bridge-road, St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. I was walking past my shop about nine o'clock, on the 6th of April—I saw the door broken, one man inside the shop, and the other out—the prisoner was one—I said, "Halloo!"—they said, "It is all right"—I said, "I don't think it is all right"—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Police," and "Stop thief"—the two men made a rush to get out—there is a sort of wicket-gate, and the other man's hat fell off, and in it was a number of these pieces of woollen cloth he got from me—I ran after him to Northampton-street, and lost sight of him for five or six minutes—I then went back to the shop, knowing I had left it just as the men ran out—then I found the hat outside the gateway, and also a bundle, containing the remainder of the pieces, wrapped up in a silk handkerchief—the prisoner was one of the two men I saw there—I have no doubt, I am sure of him—I cannot say whether he was outside or inside the door—I had left the door safely shut up.</p>

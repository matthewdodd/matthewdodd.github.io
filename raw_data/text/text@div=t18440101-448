                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Docks. I thought it necessary to watch at the south railing of the docks with Somes—we have a watchman on the docks who leaves at six o'clock in the morning—on the morning of the 14th of December I and Somes came to the dock and stationed ourselves where we could see the south quay, where there are warehouses and sheds in front of them—the back of the sheds faced us when we were there—the moon was shining—we had only been stationed there a few minutes when we heard a rtoise from the quay shed—I saw the prisoners come from the shed—Johnson worked there as an extra labourer—they went up to two hogsheads of brandy, and I heard them boring them—I and Somes waited a few minutes, and then went softly to the casks, and saw the prisoners—each was crouching down at the bulge of a cask of brandy, each of them holding bladder to a brass cock—there were no brass cocks there before—I rushed forward and tried to seize Eglington—I fell down, and Eglington succeeded in running away to the jigger-room—he went over the roof there—I called to a policeman—I afterwards saw Eglington in custody—I have no doubt that be is the person—Johnson got away—here are six bladders, two cocks, two gimlets, and two sacks, which I found by the casks.</p>

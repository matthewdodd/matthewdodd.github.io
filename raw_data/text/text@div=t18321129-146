             (Police-constable F 37). The prisoner was given into my custody - he made very great resistance, and begged from the house of the prosecutor to the watch-house, to be forgiven, for if it was made known, it would ruin his character for life; I found this piece of ticking in his hat, and the other castor was secreted in the shop, behind some other goods.</p>

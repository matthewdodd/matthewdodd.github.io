            . I am a printer to Mr. Bell, and locked up the house on the night of the 19th of June, and had the keys in my possession all that night; I was the first who entered it the next morning, at about twenty minutes after seven o'clock, and in going to my breakfast, I perceived the window of the counting house door was broken; I should rather say the glass was not broken, but taken quite out; I knew it was not broken the night before; I observed Mr. Holland's desk was not shut down. I went for the key, and on opening the door, perceived that the desk had been wrenched off; and perceived some indentions or marks of the instrument, with which it had been forced open. My suspicions immediately alighted, on Sweeting. In consequence of that suspicion I went with Clarke, the constable to the Cornish Arms, on Wednesday evening, about nine o'clock; and on finding him there, apprehended him. He was taken to the watchhouse, and the next morning he sent an officer to me, saying he wanted to speak to me; on my arrival he told me he knew some of the parties who had committed the robbery; and said he had received a one pound note, and some silver, for information which he had given to the parties who had committed the robbery. He said that bad company had been the ruin of him. He said one Hill, and a Charles, but he mentioned no surname, had led him to it; he said if I could make an intercession he would be glad; and I said, I would make any intercession that laid in my power. He said he was not present at the robbery himself, but was at the Adam and Eve all the evening. I saw a hammer tried to marks on the desk, which hammer exactly fitted the indentions.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEAN I am a patrole of the parish of St. Clements Danes; and saw the three prisoners at the bar at a quarter before two, in the middle of the Saturday night, between the 19th and 20th of June; they were with two others, and two girls; I did not know Hill before; but I knew Sweeting, I followed them up Catherinestreet, from the Strand, up Brydges street, into Russel street, and so on, until I lost sight of them in Drury lane; I had my reason for looking after them. The next time I saw them was at about ten minutes before three; they were all the same persons again; I was standing at the end of Fountain court, which may be about twenty yards from them. I saw Taylor take something like notes out of his pocket, together with some silver, and I saw him sharing it; I saw him give a three shilling piece to one, and a three shilling piece to another.

I then told one of the watchman, to go round Founting court, as they immediately separated when they discovered I was there; I had no chance of catching any of them then. I apprehended Taylor, on the first night of the illumination for the battle of Waterloo. I did not take Hill into custody until afterwards. I searched Hill's lodgings, on the same morning that he and Sweeting had an examination at Bow street, I found at his lodgings this slater's hammer; I don't know that Hill is a slater. I have seen that hammer tried to the marks in the desk, and from its fitting the marks in every part, even the teeth and all, I am enabled to say, that I believe it is the instrument made use of to break open the desk.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Clements. In consequence of a description which we received from the last witness he was found in his lodgings, and there also the dress he was described to have worn, was found. We did not bring the hammer away at first; but afterwards we fitted it to the marks on the counting house door, and found it fitted the holes which were made in it. We afterwards tried it to the desk, and there it fitted in a similar manner. Here are some pieces of wood which were broken off the door, they have similar indentations, and the hammer also fits them. I don't know what business Hill is; he said, he was a coppersmith. At Bow-street, I was present when Sweeting told Delancy that he introduced the other two prisoners how to commit the robbery; but was not present with them when it was committed; he told Delancy after he had been crying.</p>

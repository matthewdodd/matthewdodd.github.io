            . I lost my shawl on the 12th of last April, before eight o'clock, at night; I was going into a chandler's shop, in Saffron-street, a man came behind me, rather pushed me; I felt him; I turned round, the man was running, with my shawl in his hand; the shawl was thrown over my shoulders. I saw him pulling it off; I never lost sight of him, or the shawl; when he came to the corner of Saffron-street, I saw him throw it down; I picked it up; a young man stopped the prisoner; it was the prisoner at the bar, who took my shawl; I saw enough of his face to know him again. Barnley, the officer, has the shawl.</p>

I was in Peter-street; I heard the cry of stop thief; I ran till I came into Saffron-street; I saw the prisoner throw something down at the corner; he fell down; I catched hold of him; the woman picked up the shawl, and handed it to me; she said, that was the shawl he had robbed her off.</p>

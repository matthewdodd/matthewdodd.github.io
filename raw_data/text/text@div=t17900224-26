I and the beadle went and searched his room, and found his trowsers, a great pair; his room is close to the spot where I attacked him; I took a lanthorn, and took up this alarm-bell: when we went back to the watch-house, he asked for his trowsers, for he was perished with cold; he got into the necessary of the watch-house, and we gave them him: there were two people who saw him about the same spot.</p>

The prisoner was in my father's employ, as footman, in November last - my father came to visit me about the 14th or 15th of November, I know he was there on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020006"></xptr>17th - the prisoner was there with him during the whole time my father was there - he was in the house as footman - he brushed my clothes and cleaned my boots - sometimes he came to my bed-room for my clothes, and sometimes the maid-servant came for them - On Sunday, the 19th, Mr. Keily paid me a 20l. note and a 10l. Bank note - I put them into my pocket without looking at them, as he paid them to me in the road - I did not return home for an hour or two - I had no other notes in my pocket; when I went up stairs to dress for dinner, I looked at the notes, and observed it was a 20l. and a 10l. note - I put them into my trousers pocket - I wore the trousers until I went to bed, with the money in my pocket - this was on the 17th - I gave the notes to my sister that evening, and she returned them to me on the following Sunday, the 25th - I did not open the parcel, but they were in the same state as when I gave them to her, they were wrapped up very small - I put them in my waistcoat pocket, and when I went up to dress for dinner, I changed my waistcoat, and am not certain whether I took the notes out of the waistcoat pocket, and put them in another or not - I don't know whether I afterwards had them about my person, or had left them in the pocket - next morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, upon a clerk coming to the office, I missed the notes and made inquiry: on the Thursday following, I caused further inquiry to be made - I went to the Bank on the Monday week following, on receiving a notice from the Bank - I had stopped payment of the notes - I afterwards went down to Maidstone and saw Myers there, and after that went to my father's house, which is in the parish of Maidstone, at Pennington heath - I took a 10l. note and a letter to my father's house, which I had from the Bank - I could not recognise the note myself - I saw the prisoner at my father's in the butler's pantry - I asked him to step into the servants' hall, and there I charged him with having changed that 10l. note (which I produced) with Mr. Myers, and receiving ten sovereigns for it - Myers keeps a shop at Maidstone - I asked the prisoner where he got the note from - he said, "It is mine" - I repeated the question, telling him to be cautious what he said, and he repeated, "It is mine."</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE (for the Prisoner). Q. Did you make any sort of promise or inducement to him? A.Certainly not - I did not say I would forgive him, or that it would be better for him - I did not say he had better tell me all about it, nor anything of the kind - I did not say I would forgive him if he would tell me all about it, nor anything of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. WALESBY. Q. What did he say? A. He then said, "I found it in the hall of your house," alluding to Clapton - I then scolded him for having changed the note, saying, it was very curious for a servant to find a note in a house and not mention it, and I asked him what he had done with the money; he said he had spent part of and said he would make it up out of his wages - I told him the money was of very little consequence, it was more important to make out who had taken it - I then asked him if he found anything else; he said, nothing - I told him to be very cautious what he said, as he must be aware, from the trouble I had taken in coming down from London, I must be aware of more than he thought of - I told him he did not tell me the truth, for where he found the 10l. there he must have found the 20l., for they were both wrapped up together; there was some little hesitation, and I threatened that I would send for a constable if he did not tell the truth; unless he produced the 20l. or told the truth about it; he then said, he had found them, or the notes, or similar words to that - I asked him what he had found - he said a 20l. note - I asked him where it was - he said it was up stairs, and he would go and get it - I said, "No you won't, John, I will go with you;" I desired him to go first, and I would follow him - I got up to his bed-room within two or three minutes after this conversation - I went into his bed-room, it was about half-past seven o'clock at night; when I got into his room, the candle was out - I met him in the room - I brought a light with me, and I asked him if he had found it - he said, "No;" he was then searching the pockets of the clothes in his drawers, and, after some little time, he pulled out a small piece of paper from a pocket, and inside that paper was this 20l. note, which I produce - I could not at that time recognise it as the one I had lost - I told him he could not possibly be allowed to remain in my father's service, and he had better give notice to leave that day month - I told him I would not tell anybody about it that night - I subsequently had him apprehended; he did not continue in my father's service; he was had before my father the next morning, and Mr. Bean, the clerk at Maidstone; he was desired to go to the Mayor, to clear himself, and he went out of the house and ran away; this was on the Wednesday, 12th or 13th of December, it was the day after I went down - I went before the Mayor, and search was made after him - I saw him at Worship-street, on a Monday, in custody of a turnkey of Canterbury gaol. My father continued on his visit at my house with the prisoner till the Wednesday morning - I had lost them on Monday, but did not quite ascertain the loss till the Thursday.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. It was in consequence of your having said, unless he told the truth, and produced the note, you would have a constable, that he produced the 20l. note? A. Yes; I threatened to fetch a constable, and soon afterwards he produced the note; when he produced it I had no idea of having him taken into custody, not at the time; nor would I wish to prosecute him now if I could avoid it - I am an unwilling prosecutor; my object was to get rid of the business - I carried the notes rather carelessly about my person; it was not the business of all the servants to go up to my bed-room - I had an idea that I missed the notes on the Monday morning, but I fully ascertained the loss on Thursday, as I had an idea I might have paid them to a gentleman who was gone from town, and he returned on Thursday; it is possible I might have dropped them in the hall, but it is not very probable.</p>
               <p>MR. WALESBY. Q.You missed them on Monday morning? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MYERS. I am a pawnbroker living at Maidstone - on the 29th of November the prisoner came to my shop to change a £10 note (looking at one), this is my handwriting - it has "Goodwin, at Tyssen's Esq., Pennington heath," on it - I did not know the prisoner, but that was the name he gave me - I gave him ten sovereigns for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020007"></xptr>note - my brother afterwards paid the note away - Mr. Tyssen, jun. brought it to the shop about a week afterwards and showed it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He gave you his correct address and name? A. I don't know whether that is his name or not.</p>

            , the drawer - he is treasurer to the Hackney Church of England Grammar School - I produced the cheque at Barclay's, and received three £20 and four £10 Bank of England notes - I saw Mr. Tyssen the following day, which was Sunday the 17th - he was just coming out of his house and I was going up to see him - I gave him a £20 and a £10 note which I had received at Barclay's - I have the other two £20 notes in my possession now (producing them), I have paid away the three £10 notes - on the 28th of November Mr. Tyssen sent his clerk to my house to know the numbers and dates of the notes - I had at that time two £20 and two £10 notes in my possession - I gave Mr. Tysson's clerk at that time a memorandum of the notes I had left; he is here to-day - I do not know the numbers and dates of the notes I paid to Mr. Tyssen, but I received them at Barclay's with the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any other notes in your possession? A.No.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARNES. I am a clerk at Messrs. Barclay's banking house, Lombard-street - on the 16th of November last I paid a cheque for £100, here is the entry in my book in my own handwriting, and made at the time - I find I paid a cheque of £100, drawn by Powell, as treasurer of the Hackney Church of England Grammar School, with three £20 and four £10 notes - the numbers are entered, but not the dates - the £20 notes are 15485, 5890, 19763 - when we pay cheques we only enter the numbers, but when the notes come into the house, we enter the dates, and I have ascertained the dates from that first entry - the £10 notes were Nos. 4761, 4762, 18407, 18406 (looking at the £20 note found in the prisoners pocket,) the number of this is 15484 - this £10 note is 18406 - I see on the back of the £10 note the figures 10 and 11 in the handwriting of one of our clerks - I know the handwriting - the other two £20 notes correspond.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TAYLOR. I am principal turnkey of Canterbury gaol - the prisoner was brought to me from Dover, I brought him to London - I took him to Worship-street, and delivered him to Garton.</p>
               <p>MR. TYSSEN re-examined. My house is in the parish of St. John, at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard nothing of the loss of the notes till the prosecutor came down to me - I changed the £10 note, and gave him up the £20 - he said if I picked them up he would forgive me, which I did - he said he should not name it to his father, but I had better give a month's warning and leave, as he should not like me to come to his house again, as he should always be uncomfortable if I was there - I had picked them up in the hall - he said nobody knew he had lost them but his sister - I told him I would make up the remainder - he said he would forgive me and not name it to his father if I gave notice to leave; but next morning he named it to his father, who spoke to the magistrate to detain me; and being a stranger and having no one to defend me, I went to Dover, where I had friends, and was taken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TAYLOR re-examined. He was delivered into my custody on Saturday night, December 14th.</p>
               <p>MR. TYSSEN. I have known him about four months while in my father's service; his brother was in my father's service before - my father had an excellent character with him from a lady at Dover - he had been with some person two years and a half; whether it was that lady or a gentlman at Ramsgate I don't know.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.After you missed the money, and made inquiry about it, do you know whether the prisoner knew the inquiry was made? A. He could not know of it - I merely mentioned it to my father's clerk - it is possible he might have heard that I lost them, after the Thursday, as I caused bills to be posted about the parish - the hand-bills were posted on the Tuesday week after the loss; and I advertised it in the Times and Herald.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MYERS. He paid me the £10 note on the Friday.</p>

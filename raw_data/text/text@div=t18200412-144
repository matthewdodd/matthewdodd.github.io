I found the two blankets and gown next night at the watch-house, and found the prisoner in custody - he was a stranger. I believe the street door was left open.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Seymour-place, Crawford-street, about twenty yards from Shouldham-street. On the 7th of March, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner coming from Crawford-street into Seymour-place, with a bundle under his arm, in company with two other boys who had nothing. When he saw me coming after him he gave the bundle to another boy and ran into Stingo-lane. I went to seize the boy who had the bundle, he dropped it, and all three got away. I picked up the bundle and took it to the watch-house - it contained two blankets and a gown. I had known the prisoner for two years, and described him. I found him in custody next night, and I am certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-dealer at Hounslow, About half-past ten o'clock on Monday morning, the 30th of November, I saw the two prisoners going along the road to Hounslow, with a mare—they came to the Coach and Horses public-house door, where I was, and had a pint of beer—I went to the door, and said, "That is just such a little nag as I should like to buy"—Glew said it was for sale—I asked him the price—Hale said he was going to have it killed—it did not quite look like a dog-horse—I walked with them down to my house, and had the mare taken into my yard—I asked Hale what he wanted for it, where he brought it from, and who it belonged to—he said he brought it from Mr. William Hall's, of Whiphill, I think, near Guildford, but that he had then come from a public-house just out of Hounslow—Hale said I was to give the money, and put down on a piece of paper what money I gave for the horse, so that he should take it home to a relation of his—I told him I would go along with him to the public-house he said he had brought it from—Glew walked off towards London—I put the mare into the stable—and Hale went towards where he said the public-house was—when we got within about five yards of the station, I told him we had better walk in there, and we could see about it—he said "No, I won't," and started off, and ran towards Kingston—I could not follow him, having the gout—I directly gave information to the police at the station—(I saw Hale in cut<lb></lb>tody on Wednesday week, and knew him to be the man)—I gave Glew in charge the same day, about two hours after—he was coming by my door while I was giving the policeman a description of the mare—I walked out, and said, "That is one of the men, take him"—I said to him, "What have you done with your mate?"—he said he had not seen him—I asked if he had sold his little nag—he said he did not know, he had not seen him—I asked him if he was acquainted with Hale—he said no, he never saw him in his life, till he came up against that public-house, and asked him to have some beer—I am positive he is the man—I had never seen him be<lb></lb>fore</p>

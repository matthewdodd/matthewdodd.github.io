I was not at home when it was taken, but I came home soon after; a child told me some men had taken it; I went in pursuit of them; I went as far as Aldersgate-bars; a young gentleman went with me; then I went into Charter-house-square, on the right hand; when in the square, I met two men and the prisoner with them; he had my pot of honey on his head, but before I could come to them they shifted it from one to another. I went to lay hold of the prisoner, and he throw'd the pot of honey on my arm, which, by my preventing it from falling to the ground, least it should break, it prevented me from securing him for a little time; he struck me and us'd me very ill, but at last, I overcame him, and paid him pretty well; the porter of the Charter-house came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Is it feasible to think that I should take the honey away, and am not able to buckle my shoe; I had been to carry a coat to the scowerer's, and went after that into the Square to look after a shipmate of mine; and there I went to do my occasions, I let down my breeches, and this man came and said, You have robb'd me; and I absolutely befoul'd myself in abundance. I know no more of the honey, than I know of the sacred God.</p>

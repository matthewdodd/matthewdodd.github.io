" and looked about on the stones for his money—he did not find any then—he caught hold of the old man's arm, and led him along, and when they got about two steps, Jones came up striking a Congreve light—he went to the side of Birch, and Birch said, "He has got plenty of money under his other flap"—then Jones went and caught hold of his other arm, and in going past a turning, Jones dropped some money, which sounded like silver—Birch said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>that yours? "—Jones said, "Yes, " picked it up, and put it into his pocket—then they walked up as far as Brick-lane, opposite a public-house—Birch told Jones to get some gin—they asked the old man for some money—he said, "No"—they went in together—then they came out and ran up Church-street—I and Chamberlain hallooed out, "Old fellows, we will <hi rend="italic">split</hi>, " and when we got to the policeman we told him of it.</p>

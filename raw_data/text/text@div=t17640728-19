On the 11th of this instant, the day after I was burnt out, I was called down to New-crane-stairs, and was told a man had got a bag of nails out of my yard: there was a boat lying close to the stairs, and the prisoner and a bag of nails were in it; I know the bag to be my property, and the nails I have no doubt about; they are nails that had been burnt in the fire, and such I missed out of my counting house, and found it broke. I asked him how he got them out of my counting-house? he said, he ran after a man that had them, and he got away and left them.</p>

            . I am a waterman. I was called out, and told a man was stealing coals out of a barge: I went and saw the prisoner standing up, with a bag; I felt the bag, and found it to be full of nails; a young fellow had stopped him, and he was standing by a boat; I do not know whose boat it was: it was taken up a-drift. I sent for the gentleman, and when we got the prisoner up into the street, he said he got the nails from another man: he and the nails were very wet, which must be by his coming out of the yard under shore.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, he got so wet by going into the water, to look for an our that he said was lost.</p>

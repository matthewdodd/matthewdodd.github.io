               <p>PRISONER JONES's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the matter, I had been making half a holiday, and I went to Smithfield, and I pulled off my coat and hat and lost them, and coming home the watchman stopped me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jones called eight witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER DENNIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was not at home when these things were found, they said if I would tell the truth how I came by them, they would set me at liberty, and I said, I would tell that before a magistrate; I might be a little frightened at first.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Dennis called three witnesses: who gave him a good character.</p>

I lodge with the prisoner's mother; she sent a little girl to me, and desired me to come home. I went; she told me my box was robb'd, and all my money gone. I told her I had but six shillings, or thereabouts, but there was a Bank note of 25 l. We went up stairs, there I found the paper that the note had been in; my watch was taken from my beds-head; and my shoe and knee-buckles were gone; my knee-buckles were in my breeches, lock'd up in my box. The prisoner had made off, and on Sunday the 14th I found him at Stepney: I charg'd him with taking the things mentioned. He denied it for some time, and at last he owned he had taken and pawned the things for a reckoning, at the house of

               <p>Bond. No, I never did; I went to Sedgwick's and found the watch and buckles. The prisoner owned to the taking of 6 s. out of my box, and a guinea which I did not know of. I found all again, except the note and money.</p>

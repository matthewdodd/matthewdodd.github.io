               <p>THOMAS CHESHIRE. I live with Mr. Graham, in Holborn. On the 13th of September, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18300916-311-crimeloc1592">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FRENCH. Q. Was the other a tall boy? A. Rather taller than the prisoner; he ran behind the boy, but I noticed the prisoner most, as I noticed the position of his arm, and that he had the handkerchief under it - I felt my pocket the moment the boy told me; I did not feel it taken - it is not probable that it could have fallen out of my pocket; I did not feel it taken.</p>

            . I am a tailor. I heard the prosecutor call stop thief! and saw the prisoner coming along alone - I stopped him; the prosecutor came up and said he had stolen a handkerchief; he said, "I am not the person; I have got nothing about me;" but the prosecutor took it from under his arm, between his coat and shirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was alone? A. Yes, when I saw him; I caught him in my arms as he ran; he did not say he had picked it up, but that he had nothing about him.</p>

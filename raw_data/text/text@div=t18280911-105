On the 25th of August I gave him this draft for 4l. 11s. 8d., on Mr. Boyd (looking at it) - I sent him to receive it; he did not bring me back any money - I asked for it; he said he had not received it, for Mr. Boyd was out. On the 4th of September I asked him about it again - he said he had not received it; I asked him for the draft - he had not got it to produce; Mr. John Beaumont told him to go and fetch the draft or money immediately - he went out of the office, came back, and I asked if he had been there - he said No. On the 9th of September he was called into the office; he then voluntarily acknowledged that he had received it, and had never paid it over to me - he has been eight years in the company's employ.</p>

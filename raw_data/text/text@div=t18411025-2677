                  </hi>. I live with my mother at a chandler's-shop in Clare-street, Cambridge-road. On the afternoon of the 18th of October I was in a parlour adjoining the shop, and saw the prisoner leaning over the counter, with his hand in the till—I and my mother followed him into the street—he got away—I examined the till, and missed quite 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'s worth of silver—I had noticed in the till, not half-an-hour before, three half-crowns, and twelve shillings or more—on the same afternoon I saw the prisoner in the street, and gave an alarm—he ran up Patriarch-square, jumped into the cemetery, and was stopped by Hallum—I noticed that he had a' straw hat on in the shop, with a piece of black tape round it, and it was trimmed with the same—he had the same hat on when I saw him.</p>

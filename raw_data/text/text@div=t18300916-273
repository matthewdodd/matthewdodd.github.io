On the evening of the 7th of August a Police-officer called, and produced three lengths of ribbon which had my mark on them - I knew them, but I cannot say exactly how lately I had seen them - I went to Mrs. Collier's, where Brown lived; we found Brown, and asked him who he had received them from; he said from Wesley, but did not say when or where - we then found on Brown five silk handkerchiefs, which he said he got from Wesley to take care of for him; we took Brown to the Police station; I went home - Wesley was out; we broke open his box, and found gloves and other things which are mine; when he returned we showed him the things, and asked when he stole them - he gave no answer; the officer searched him, and found 1s. 6d. in his waistcoat pocket - and fastened to his braces was a kid purse of mine, in which was the 10l. note, two sovereigns, and a crown-piece - I gave him into custody; the note is one I had received on the 29th of July, and marked it - it had been in a cash-box in the desk, but the key was left in it; we left him in the shop, making up grosses of buttons, when we went to dinner, and he said he went through the room, saw the key in the desk, and took it out.</p>

            . Brown was in my employ - Mr. Jones came to my shop about him; some property was found which had been brought to me by a person named Gosling - there were four lengths of black ribbon; I took charge of them for a few minutes, and then sent them out to three different linen-drapers - I asked Brown if they were his - he said Yes, that his mother sent them by mistake with his clothes; I believe these are the ribbons - I gave them to the Policeman, who gave them to Mr. Jones.</p>

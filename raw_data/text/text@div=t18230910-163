            . I am a turner, and live in Peter's-lane, Cow-cross, and have been a constable. On the 28th of June, I was going down Fleet-street, and saw Mr. Bygrave coming towards the City, the prisoner was behind him, I saw him lay hold of the prosecutor's pocket; he let go of the coat, and then walked towards Shire-lane, where he turned up. I informed Mr. Bygrave, and we followed him together - we came up with him about the middle of Shire-lane. I said,</p>
               <p>"Nick, I want you;" he said,</p>
               <p>"What for;" I said,</p>
               <p>"I suspect you have robbed this gentleman of his handkerchief;" we searched him, but could not find it. We were taking him to the office, and in crossing Chancery lane, one corner of it came from under his trowsers, and I pulled the rest out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were only four doors from the City, when you first saw him touch the coat - A. Yes, the prosecutor was walking gently, and gazing over the other side of the way; he let the coat tail drop, and passed the prosecutor before he got to the Bar; I did not see it taken - he could not have taken it in the City.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I kicked my foot against the handkerchief coming through the Bar; nobody owned it, and I put it in my pocket hole, but I had no pocket.</p>

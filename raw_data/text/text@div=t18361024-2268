                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live in Black<lb></lb>smiths' Arms-place, Back-church-lane, in the parish of St. George East. David Stanhouse, a seaman, lodged with me about three weeks—on the 10th of October we all left the house—my wife left last—I went to the King Harry, in Red Lion-street, Whitechapel, between seven and eight o'clock—my wife came there to me in about an hour—Stanhouse was with me—my wife remained with me till eleven or twelve o'clock, and we went home together—Stanhouse went away before us, and did not sleep at the house that night—when we went back to the house I asked my wife to give me the key to open the street door—I unlocked, and found it a usual—I went up stains to the middle room, on the first floor—that was about twelve o'clock or near upon one—I found door forced open—it was the room I used to live in—I came down stairs again—I found the box of the door was forced open, and a large screw on the bottom of the box<lb></lb>staple forced out—the lock had been slipped back, as if it was unlock—there was a latch to the door—no injury was done to that—I did not miss any thing night—I got up just before eight o'clock next morn<lb></lb>ing, and went out—I came, in about half an hour, and went up stairs and in consequence of what my little boy said, I went to the closet, and found a trunk which had been in the cupboard, put out into the room and broken open—there was no lock on the closet—the trunk belonged to Stanhouse—it had been given to him my daughter, and he had the key of it—the prisoner was at the public-house when I went there—he left shortly after my wife came—I think that must have been after nine o'clock—the pri<lb></lb>soner did not lodge at my house—he used to come now and then or in<lb></lb>quite for my son, but he did not live there, and had no business their—he came back again to the public-house—he was absent about hour and a half—the public-house is not half a mile from mine—I went out next morning, about half-past ten o'clock, and looked for a policeman, having suspicion of the prisoner—I told the policeman of the circumstance, and he went and found the prisoner and brought him to me before eleven o'clock—I asked him if he knew any thing at all about David's box being broken open—he said no, he knew nothing at all about it—I said, You had better own it, it will he better for you"—it was not a spring lock on the room door—it was to the house door—I suspected he had got in the back way, as there was a pane of glass broken in the door at the back of the house—it broken before I left the house—there is a bolt inside, and by putting an arm through the window you can unbolt the door—I did not notice whether that door was bolted or not when I left the house—it was open when I came back—there was no lock to it, only a latch—it was shut to—there was only bolt to it—my wife is not here.</p>

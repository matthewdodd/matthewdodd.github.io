            . I am servant to Mr. Hales. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100035"></xptr>20th of July the prisoner called on me as a friend - I knew him before; he is no relation; he staid in the kitchen nearly an hour - nobody else was there; I did not know what way of life he was in; these silver dessert spoons were in the kitchen closet - I did not miss them till the 22nd of July; I saw two of them afterwards at the Mansion-house, when the prisoner was in custody - I did not give him leave to take them; they have master and mistress' initials on them - I had left him alone in the kitchen while I went down to the cellar; the key is always left in the closet.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I went to the prosecutor's, hearing of the loss, and got a description of the spoons printed; I found two of them that night at Collins', in Shoreditch; I found where the prisoner lodged next day, and left word for him to come down to the hall, as the young woman wanted to see him about a situation - he came, and I apprehended him.</p>

            . I charged the prisoner with stealing the spoons; he begged I would not prosecute him, and if I would allow him he would recover the spoons, and replace them - he said he had pawned four, and given one away; I do not recollect his saying where he had pawned them - he said he had destroyed the duplicate.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

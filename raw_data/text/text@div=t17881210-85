               <p>I am servant to Mr. Warner, so is the prisoner; on Monday the first of December he had a job to do two story high; nobody was there but himself, there was a good deal of moist sugar there; the prisoner came down with a candle in his hand to me not lighted to another warehouse, which is facing that he came from; it was a little past seven, he said he had found it very hard to come down in the dark, he lighted his candle, cut about three or four yards of string, and doubled it up, and went out, then I had a suspicion; he went only to the first story, and looked about; he had two candles lighted then, and I saw him turn a paper bag, which in general holds twenty eight pounds of sugar moist or dry, I saw him put some sugar in this bag; I was in a warehouse opposite without a light; I saw him weigh the sugar very particular to some weights, but I do not know what weights; he tied it up, cut off the string and flung it away;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100058"></xptr>and he put out one of the candles, and put the other out of my sight, which blinded me so that I could not see much more, only a little by chance, he came several times without any thing in his hand to look out at the door; at last he came down, but I cannot tell whether he brought down any thing with him, because it was too dark; but he went down into the street before me, I went after him as soon as I could, but I could see nothing of him, I returned and shut the gate, and told my master; soon after the prisoner came back without any thing, and went to his work, which was two story high, and finished it very soon, and he asked to go to his club, and he wished us all a good night; I followed him, and he went to a publick-house, in Bell-court, Fenchurch-street, he had a glass of something at the bar, and came out in about a minute with a parcel under his arm, he stood for a minute and a quarter at the end of the court, looked towards Lombard-street; he went towards our house in Mincing-Lane, I followed him, rang at the bell, and our foreman and another fellow servant and me went after him, and took him before he got to Mark-Lane; our foreman touched him on the right arm, and said, George what have you here? he said sugar; he asked him twice where he had it, and the second time he said he bought it; the foreman told him to take it back, and put it where he had it; he considered a little, and returned with us, and I and the foreman came first, and did not look back directly, but when we did, nobody followed us, and presently my fellow servant brought him into the yard, with the sugar; the parcel was burst, but I was not present; Mr. Warner was sent for, and the prisoner asked his pardon several times, and begged to be excused, for it was the first time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you never challenge the prisoner to fight, and he refused you? - If he did, I forget; I am very little for fighting.</p>
               <p>Was there any warehouse opposite to this, in which the sugar was kept? - One is here, and the other there; very like my master's dwelling house may be opposite; the warehouse is not directly opposite.</p>
               <p>(The prosecutor explained to the court, that the warehouse was not directly opposite, but they might see a part of each warehouse looking obliquely.)</p>

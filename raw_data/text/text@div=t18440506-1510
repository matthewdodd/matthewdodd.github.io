               <p>saw a hole in the flooring, about two feet from the stove, where about eigh<lb></lb>teen inches or two feet had been burnt quite away, no portion of the flooring remaining—after the firemen went away I went down into the shop, and on the counter I saw a great quantity of mortar and sand where the hole had been broken through in the ceiling, and a small portion of tinder of rags in the mortar and sand, that had fallen through where the hole had been broken—I went up stairs after that to the room where the fire had taken place, and saw a hole in this board which I produce—this board was near to where the fire had been burning, next to the joists that were burnt, and in the hole in this board I could see matches, paper, and chips—I found another hole in the floor where there had been a knot in the wood, and in that hole I found this other paper and these matches—I could see them the very moment I turned my light on—on searching the floor further I saw another hole near the window, and in that hole I found this other piece of paper—on searching the landing, leading to the room which had been on fire, I saw another hole. and in that I found some lucifer matches and a paper, which is a receipt—I examined the whole house, but did not find anything but in that room and landing—next morning I went to No. 6, Wenlock-cottages, and there I saw Joblyns—she called to me while I was on the stairs—I told her to put on her clothes and go along with me to her house in Old-street-road, which had been on fire—she said, "O dear! O dear me! what shall I do; my mother is so ill I cannot leave the house"—I said, "You must go with me"—she said, "What damage is done? is the house burnt down?"—I said, "You must go with me and see"—she said, "Is the man hurt?" (or burnt)—I said, "He is not, no thanks to you"—on the 18th I received this policy of insurance from the postman—it is directed to "Mrs. M. Pettigrew, No.21, Old-street-road."</p>

I was present when the search of the house was made—Sergeant Dubois has given a correct account of it—I produce some lucifers which I found at the house—I went to Wenlock-cottages the next morning—I got there first—I saw Joblyns, and asked for Mrs. Pettigrew—Joblyns said her name was Joblyns, and wanted to know my business, saying her mother was very ill—I asked if she knew that their house in Old-street-road was on fire—she said, "O dear me, fire! What a sad thing it is, for we are not insured," or something to that effect—Sergeant Dubois then came up—I had seen some goods removed for No.21, Old-street, about ten or eleven days before—there was a cart at the door, and Joblyns and a man were helping to put the goods into the cart.</p>

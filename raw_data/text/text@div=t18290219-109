            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 10th of February, at half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Kensal-green-lane, on the Harrow-road, about three miles from Wilsden: we heard footsteps coming down the lane - my partner went out and took Briscoe; I seized another person, and said, "What have you got here?" he ran across the road - I pursued, and took him; he dropped a bag with these two fowls in it - he got away, and run off; I returned to my partner, and took Hoare - the two prisoners and the other man were together; Briscoe said if the other man had stood as firm as he did, we should not have taken them; I shewed two of the fowls that were in the bag to Mrs. Berry, and she claimed them.</p>

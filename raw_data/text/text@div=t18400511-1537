                  </hi>. I am gardener to William White, of Upper Tulse-hill, in the parish of Streatham. I was at work on the back-lawn on Thurs<lb></lb>day, the 30th of April, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, and saw a person drop off the porch over the kitchen-door, and heard the glass break belonging to the porch—I called to my son <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> to run to the front-gate—I also ran, and saw the prisoner go out of the carriage-gate—he turned his head aside before he got to the gate, and I saw curls at the back of his ear—I did not hear him say any thing—I followed him—he turned to the left, towards Brixton—I followed him about two hundred and fifty yards, and in turning the corner, I saw him take a parcel from under his coat and throw it down on the walk—I still followed him a hundred and eighty yards, leaving my boy to pick the property up—he got over into a back<lb></lb>garden, and was caught in my sight—I swear he is the man—I lost sight of him for about a hundred and eighty yards, while he passed through Mr. Marshall's garden, but that was the only time—I saw him go into Mr. Marshall's garden, but did not see him come out—I returned a short way back into the road, and saw him, with his coat off, on the road—I had</p>

            ; on the 9th of July I lost out of that house the things in the indictment, one linen gown body, &amp;c. The gown cost me 15 s. and was not made up. I am sure it was between five and eleven, I was out with my milk; my daughter went home first, and came and informed me what was the matter. I suspected this woman, because she used to lurk about. When I came home I met this woman at the door; I went to Bow-street, and they advised me first to go to the Pawnbrokers, and make a search, I did so, but did not find any thing; I came home again, and went up stairs to ask the name of this woman; she came down, and said her name was

The prisoner was in bed; I found one cap, the cap she had on her head, which was mine, and I took the cap as my own, with that Paterson, who was with me, told me if I was sure, to go and get a Constable, and charge him with her; I did, and went up into her room again, and then I saw the body of the gown on the chair in her room, and there was two duplicates taken from the chinks of the boards, but I could not observe particularly from whence they were taken.</p>

They said there was, she came there on Thursday. I went up stairs and knocked at the door, and she opened it, and Mrs. Annam being with me, came in, and she saw the cap was hers; she went out and got a constable, and when he came she said she would give every thing up if there was no more said about it. She produced the gown, and there was two duplicates behind the mantle-piece, one of which led to the shoes, and they were taken out of pawn; nothing else was found.</p>

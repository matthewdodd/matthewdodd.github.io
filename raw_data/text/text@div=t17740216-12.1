            . I rent a room in Oxford-road: I live by taking in plain work; a gentleman over night, on the 14th of April, left me a gold chain; I missed it, and asked the prisoner if he had seen it; he denied that he had; I thought he might have played the rogue with it; the gentleman came next morning it was missed, and I enquired about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>- Isaacs. There is a society I belong to who meet once a week upon business; a man brought this chain, and asked for a guinea upon it; the man said he had it of a man who said he found it; I advised him to return it to the man; the prisoner and the other man were standing at the Gentleman and Porter; I told him I could not get money upon it, he must take it again; he took it, and then I saw him whisper the other person; during that time I said to Mr. Elcock I believed that man was in possession of a chain he did not come honestly by; there were two of them.</p>

On the morning of the 24th of December I was in my parlour, and thought I heard somebody come into my shop; I went, and saw the prisoner standing close by the window; I asked what he wanted - he said a halfpenny worth of buttons; I told him I was sure it was only an excuse, he did not want to buy any thing - I thought he was a bad character, and if he came there again I should charge an officer with him; he went out, and I perceived the window-sash had been pushed on one side - I missed a waistcoat; I followed, and came up to him, took hold of his jacket, pulled it on one side, and saw this waistcoat under it - I took him back, and took it from him; I know it to be mine - it had hung across the rail in the window; I had seen him, pass and look in at the window several times that day.</p>

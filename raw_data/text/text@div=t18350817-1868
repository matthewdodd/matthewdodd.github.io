                  </hi>. I live in Golden-court, Golden-lane. I lost, on the 28th of July, two files, five dozen and eight check-springs, one pair of plyers, and some other things—I have only found this bell-carriage, which was in the privy—I had left all this property tied up in a handkerchief, and my tools were on the bench; and when I came home there were a great many missing, and the rest scattered about—I was kicking up a disturb<lb></lb>ance with the people in the court, when these two policmen came, and asked what was the matter—I told them I had been robbed—they said thay had taken the man to the station-house, and let him go—I made these check-springs myself—it was about half-past two o'clock at night, when I discovered my loss—the door was wide open, the candle was alight, and the cupboard door was open—I missed two images, a tea-caddy, and all the articles stated.</p>

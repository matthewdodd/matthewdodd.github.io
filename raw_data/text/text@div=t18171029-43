Before I could well utter the words he was off. I followed him up Black Horse-yard, and called out, Stop thief! he ran too fast for me. A little before he got to Petticoat-lane he was stopped. I accused him of having my watch - He made some resistance; he was overpowered - He denied having it. A person came up with a light. I found the watch at the very spot where he was stopped. I am certain he is the man.</p>

The prisoner was in her service - she left her on Saturday night, the 28th of July, without notice, and on Sunday morning this property was missed; I went about three o'clock that afternoon, with an officer, to the prisoner's mother's, in Featherstone-street, City-road; the prisoner saw me coming, ran up stairs, and got behind the bed; I went into the room, and said, **Mary, it is no use your running behind the bed" - she came out directly; I said,"Oh, Mary, what have you been doing?" I asked her where the things were which she had taken from Miss Stone - she made no answer; her mother said, "Here is something I have picked off the floor, and was just coming to Miss Stone's, to ask if these things were hers;" we searched the room, and found this property belonging to Miss Stone - I have seen them in her possession; here is a gold coin and gold chain - I should value all the things at about 9l.; no one article is worth 1l.</p>

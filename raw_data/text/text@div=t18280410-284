Last Friday, I saw the two prisoners at the door, but did not see them do anything; I soon after missed a piece of print from the door - in about an hour and a half I saw them again at the window. and Hodges had a large basket in her hand; I went out and looked at the basket, which was covered with a blue apron; they went down the street, and looked at some ear-rings in a jeweller's window - I went to look in the basket, and Welch came and put her cloak between me and the basket, and began pulling her ear-rings, and asked Hodges if she thought they would match; I told Hodges to come back with me; she said, the basket did not belong to her - I said, she could not object to come back with me to our shop; but I took her to Mr. Johnson's shop, and found this print of Mr. Halls, in the basket, and another piece of print, belong to Mr. Needham, of Shoreditch - I went to fetch an officer, and on returning, I met Welch; I told her, she was the very person I was looking for, and she must go back; she said, she would not - I said, if she did not, I would get an officer; I compelled her to go back, and gave charge of them - this is the print; it has our shop mark on it.</p>

On the 29th of April, I gave him 14l., in two 5l., one 2l., and two 1l., bank notes; he was to go to Mr. Bernard's in Shoreditch, to take up a bill, at ten o'clock, I was afterwards applied to for the amount of the bill; I found the prisoner at Worship-street in August last; the constable told me, in his presence, that he said he had been to France with the money. The prisoner said he had been to Calais.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I always paid him his wages - I paid him 2l. There had been a dispute between us about three weeks before - He did not agree for any regular salary - He boarded with me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MERRY. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner at the top of his father's stables, where he was concealed, at Hackney, he told me he meant to go to Russia with the money, and when he got to Calais he could get no farther as he had no passport.</p>

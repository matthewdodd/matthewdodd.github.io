               <p>Who lives in the house besides yourself? - Tenants up stairs.</p>
               <p>How do you know none of them were at home? - That I cannot say; I have no acquaintance with the people up stairs; I am but a tenant, no more than they; I had the lower part of the house.</p>
               <p>Whose house is it? - The landlord's; I forget his name I declare; he does not live in the house; it is all let out in different tenements; they have nothing to do with one another.</p>
               <p>What rooms have you? - Only one room; the door was locked, and the window shut.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was shut? - I believe the window was shut; for they did not open the window for two or three days before that, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>What time did you come home? - Between eight and nine, when I found my door locked as usual; I lost the things in the indictment; I went out to sell my goods; I left them in the room; it was a wet morning; I hung the coat on the back of the chair; the handkerchief and the stockings laid loose on the chair; I sent after the prisoner, and found him; I had a suspicion of him, because he did not come near me that evening; I knew him before; he lodged with me in the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220023"></xptr>room; he is a sea-faring lad; I let him lay out of charity, because I thought he was out of bread; he had no key to the room; I never let him have any key; when I came home the window was as usual, shut down again; I suppose he went in at the window, and when he came out, he shut it down again.</p>
               <p>When you went out, was the window shut or open? - It was shut, but I do not know whether it was fast; it was shut; he was taken in Gravel-lane, with my handkerchief, on the 22d of September, and he owned the fact; I was not present when he was taken; the man that took him sent for me to Gravel-lane; I went to the justices; there I found him, and my handkerchief upon him; he owned to the coat.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said, he did take them things.</p>
               <p>What excuse did he make? - I believe, he said, he took them for want, he did say so.</p>
               <p>It was near nine when you went home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was between four and five when you went out? - Yes, I cannot tell when they were taken out, but he said, he took them between six and seven.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ipswich, and am agent to a bookseller. On the 14th of September last I borrowed a pony, gig and harness, of Mr. Tunmer, to go to East Burdall—I took the prisoner with me in the gig—I knew him before—I believe he has been lodging at Hadley lately—when we got to East Burdall, I went into a house to transact some busi<lb></lb>ness—the prisoner said he would take a drive down the road, as he wanted to see a person with whom he was acquainted—he asked how long I should take to do my business—I said, "About an hour"—he said be would return in that time—he went away, and never returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Guilford-cottage, Little William-street, Is<lb></lb>lington. On Thursday, the 16th of September, I saw the prisoner in the City-road, on a pony—he called to the man who collects the toll, who I was talking to—I ultimately made a <hi rend="italic">swap</hi> with him—I gave him ray pony and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his pony—he said he had had it seven months—he did not say where he came from—a person next door to me knew him, and when I had bought it, he told me he lived at Kennington—that pony has since been claimed by Mr. Tunmer.</p>

I let a gelding-pony, gig and harness, to Mills—I afterwards saw the pony in Callow's possession on the 23rd of the same month—I am sure it is my pony—I could swear to it any where—I saw the chaise and harness at Union-hall, when I was sent for to come up and identify them.</p>

I have for a considerable time missed fat and candles; on the 5th of August, I called Corderoy to me; I told him I had strong suspicion that he robbed me; he denied it. I told him I should search his house; he went with me to his house at Stepney-causeway; in a closet in his cellar I found tallow, fat, and four dozen pounds of candles in a box, and several papers of candles containing two pounds each; he at first said he bought them in Holborn, at last he said he took them from my house; they were my candles; some of the candles were short size candles that we make particularly for sail-makers. I told him I knew they were my property.</p>

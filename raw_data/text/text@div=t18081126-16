On my coming out of the house, I stopped at the corner of the street to make water; the prisoner came up to me and asked me to go home with her; I told her I would not, I was going on board; she shoved back a step or two and came up to me the second time, and said I had better go home with her; I told her I would not and shoved her away with my hands; she came and put her hands into my side jacket pocket, and while I was buttoning my breeches up she made off.

The officers and Hart went and searched the house, I went with them; we went into the room where I saw the prisoner go in; she had gone from thence, the Irishman remained there.</p>

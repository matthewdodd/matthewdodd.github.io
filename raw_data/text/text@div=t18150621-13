I and my son were going to market on the morning of Friday the 2nd of June, and when we had got upon the Common, we perceived the young donkey making a great noise, it was three weeks and some days old. We could not see the mother, and my son remarked that she would not have left the foal of her own accord, and he thought somebody must have taken her. When we got to Notting-gate, we enquired of the gate-keeper if such a thing had gone through the gate, and he told us that two gypsies, one a tall man, and the other a short one, had gone towards London, with two asses. We went on to Tyburn, and there we made the same enquiries, and received similar answers; I directly came home, and sent my son to market, and told young master Atlee when I got down what was become of my ass, and told him his was gone also; he immediately set out for London.</p>

            . I had a female donkey, which I lost off the Common. In consequence of some information which I received from Mr. Lamb, I went up to Smithfield market; I walked about three hours, without seeing my donkey; I was at last taking the last walk round the market, when I saw my ass, and Mr. Lamb's together, and the prisoners near them. I immediately went for an officer, who took them into custody.</p>

About four o'clock in the afternoon, of Friday, the 2nd of June, the last witness came up to me as I was standing in the market, and asked me to inform him where he could get an officer. He told me two gypsies had stolen two donkies off Ealing-common. I asked him if he knew the donkies; he told me, be did; that one was his, and the other belonged to Mr. Lamb. I immediately fetched two brother officers, who went with me where the boy directed us to. I asked the gypsies if the donkies were their property; they told me they were. A scuffle ensued, and they were taken into custody.</p>

            . I was the first man who laid hold of the two prisoners; I was with Grey and Taylor. I was in my apron, and I was not suspected to be an officer. I asked the tallest man, who the donkies belonged to; he said, that they were his. I asked him if he would sell one; he replied, he would: would I buy one? With that I caught hold of him by the collar. The other gypseyman struck at Grey, but missed him, and hit another man, who fell on his face. A scuffle immediately ensued, and at length, after considerable resistance, both the prisoners were secured.</p>

I bought the donkies and I got my little couzen here to help me to get them to London. If I had known that they were stolen, I would not have bought them.</p>

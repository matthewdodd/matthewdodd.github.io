The prisoner came to lodge with us on the Wednesday, and took her lodgings by the week - on the Sunday I saw her door ajar, and a pair of boot-legs in the room; I went in and saw two pairs of boot-legs near the pillow - this led me to suspect; I looked, and missed a sheet - when she came back, I said "You have robbed me of a sheet, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280084"></xptr>man in the next room of the boot-legs;" she said she had not, she had wrapped the sheet round her to keep her warm - she had gone out at seven o'clock in the morning, and came home between seven and eight in the evening; I found the sheet round her person - she had not an opportunity of putting it on when she came home - seven pairs of boot-legs were lost, and two were found just under the edge of the pillow; she had put down three pairs of boot-legs in the yard; five pairs were found in all; two pairs were quite lost.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. This witness gave the prisoner into my charge on suspicion, and said she had attempted to go out at the back door; I took the candle and found some of these boot-legs on the pavement - this sheet was taken from the prisoner's person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told her I had the sheet round me; I know nothing about the boot-legs - a boy slept with that man, and he went up and down - I am innocent of taking them.</p>

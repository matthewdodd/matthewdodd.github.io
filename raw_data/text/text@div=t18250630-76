               <p>JOHN GALE GARRETT. On Sunday, the 19th of June, I was in <placeName id="t18250630-76-crimeloc370">Hanway-street</placeName>

               <p>"This man has been picking my pocket;" he said he was very sorry, and begged my pardon, and hoped I should not do any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I hope you will forgive me, as I am innocent. As I was in Tottenham-court-road I looked at a dog, whom I thought was going to bite me: I kicked him - a coachman came up and struck me with his whip; I asked him what he did that for; he said he would do it again - I then struck him and he struck me, and I ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid to Mr. Richard Higgins—he keeps a tavern at No. 264, Oxford-street, near North Audley-street. The prisoner came to our house on Tuesday evening the 6th of February, about half-past eight o'clock—I am sure it was that evening—he called for a glass of gin and water—I took it to him, and took a Ger<lb></lb>man silver spoon with it—in about five minutes he came out of the room and bid me good night—I went in to take the glass away, and a metal spoon was put in the place of my master's German silver one—the pri<lb></lb>soner came again about a quarter to nine o'clock on the 8th of February—I was told he was the same man that had been on the Tuesday—he asked for some soup—he did not call for any particular sort—I told him we had none—he called for a mutton chop and mashed potatoes—I served him—he rang the bell, and asked for another chop, and paid for what he had before he had the second chop—I left with him the tray and a silver table-spoon, which was my master's property—it is worth about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I left that with the first chop—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he was in a hurry—I then saw the spoon was changed, and a metal spoon put on the table in place of my master's—I went and told my master—my master's son came into the room and accused him of it—he rose up, and the silver spoon fell from his wrist—I am sure of that—the metal spoon was on the table—there was no metal spoon there before—I saw the silver spoon fall by his feet—I saw my mistress pick it up—this is it, and this is the metal spoon—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I sent for an officer—he came, and took him in the coffee-room.</p>

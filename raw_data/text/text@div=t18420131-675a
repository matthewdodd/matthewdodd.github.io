                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Cuttell, a grocer, in Crown-street, Westminster. On the 7th of January, between four and five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, and said he wanted a quarter of a pound of sugar; that he came from Mrs. May, who keeps a beer-shop opposite, and they were making egg-hot—he tendered what I supposed to be a half-crown in payment, but which afterwards turned out to be a bad five-shilling piece—I gave him two shillings, six halfpence, and a penny-piece, in changes—one halfpenny was rather bent—he said, "I have given yon a five-shilling piece"—I took it up, and said, "It is much smaller than a good five-shilling piece, I must light the gas to look at it"—he said, "If you doubt my word, you had better send over to Mrs. May, for there I got change for a sovereign"—I asked him to give me my change back again—he would not, but ran out of the shop—I pursued him—he ran as far as the public-house in Charlotte-street, where he was stopped—I was close behind him, and never lost sight of him—I am sure he is the same boy that came to my shop—I gave the five-shilling piece to the police-sergeant.</p>

            . I had the care of these seven rabbits. On the 5th of February I left them safe, at seven o'clock in the evening, in the shed where they were kept; it had been fastened, so that they could not get out themselves - in the morning, about seven o'clock, the doors were open, and the rabbits gone; they had only to turn the button and take them out - they had taken a doe, a buck, and three young ones, and one laid dead at a little distance; I have seen the buck and doe since - I believe them to he the prosecutor's; the doe has a bad eye, which she had not before.</p>

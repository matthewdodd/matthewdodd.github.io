             sworn. I am a smith, I live at Islington. Last Monday I saw the three prisoners go by where I went to work.</p>
               <p>Q. What time. - A. About half past three in the afternoon, Arthur and Gray went into the cook's-shop, and Williams stood looking in at the window; I went and did my job, and when I came back, it was about three quarters of an hour afterwards, I went into the shop and asked Mrs. Perrot if she had lost any weights, I had one or two chaps for stealing of weights, and I thought they had been stealing of weights. I found a two pound weight, a one pound weight, a half pound and ounce weight upon Arthur; the pound, half pound and ounce weight belonged to the prosecutrix, but this weight, I never found an owner to. I made the best of my way to the City Gardens, I looked over the fields on the bank, I saw Arthur and Williams tossing up in the fields; Gray, the little one, was standing looking on. I went up and told them they must go along with me, I tied Arthur and Williams together and searched them. On 
               <persName id="t18061029-45-person463">Arthur</persName>
             I found a two pound weight in his left pocket; a one pound, half pound, and an ounce weight I found in his right hand pocket, two shillings and seven pence halfpenny in money. On Williams I found sixpence in halfpence. On 
               <persName id="t18061029-45-person464">Gray</persName>
             I found nothing.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Arthur's Defence. As I was coming along I met these two boys, they said they were going a little way, I went along with them; they went in for a pennyworth of pudding, and I went in for another pennyworth of pudding.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. I never was in that shop, I know nothing of the shop.</p>
               <p>Gray's Defence. Please you, my lord, he took the weights out of the scale and put them in his pocket; I asked him what they were, he said nothing. I did not know what it was till the constable searched him.</p>

On the following day I had a constable in the house, at the usual time, in order to search him; I saw on that day the same proceedings as before, respecting his sweeping his filings; I went down just before he came down to dinner into my parlour; I told the constable I had no doubt but he had committed the same depredation as before, and as he was going out to dinner, I desired him to walk into my parlour, I wanted to speak to him; I told the constable to search him, which he did; in the first place he found in his waistcoat pocket a dirty rag, containing about two pennyweights of gold filings and gold solder together, part of which I had marked; in his great coat pocket was found a small old melting-pot, with some pieces; there are certain particles of gold, in old melting-pots, which are more valuable than new; we took him to the Sitting Alderman, and he remanded him till the next day; in the interim we searched his lodgings, there we found, in a dirty piece of paper, in a closet in his room, about fourteen pennyweights of gold filings and a firkin, nearly half full of old melting-pots.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. During the time I was in Mr. Newcomb's employ, I was in the habit of working at home, doing jobs and likewise new work; I have taken gold as part of payment, and I have bought gold of the refiners. In regard to that cloth found in my pocket, I had brought it from home, with intent to go to the flatting-mills with it, not having fire enough at home. I suppose some of Mr. Newcomb's men had a little spite against me, and they had said something to Mr. Newcomb that made him search me, and finding these things about me, he might think them his own. As to Mr. Newcomb's, jun. seeing me file metal into the tray, it is very common, we use metal in our work.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a city officer. On the 2d of March, in consequence of directions, I watched the prosecutors' premises; and about ten minutes to seven o'clock I saw the prisoner coming along Thames-street; I said, Coleman you are suspected of robbing your employers; he said he had not. I said, you have property about you now; he said he had not, and agreed to go with me to the stables. I attempted to search him; he dragged me to a dark part of the stables, gave me a violent kick, and we both fell, and then he got rid of what he had. I could feel something under his apron in the scuffle, and when he had got rid of it he got up, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want of me;" and down the cellar stairs, at that place, I found these raisins, a bag of currants, and a bag of plumbs; they were Mr. Hancock's stables, opposite to his house; a picklock key was produced to me, which I tried to the warehouse door - it opens it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you attempted to search him he began the struggle - A. Yes, I did not see him throw any thing away, it was so dark; he had something bulky under his apron, in the street.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Marchant's assistance, and took the prisoner into custody; he walked about the kitchen in great agitation; the servant said,</p>

               <p>"I am accused of robbing master;" she said,</p>

            . I am porter to the prosecutors. On this day, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I stood at the warehouse door, and saw the prisoner go into Thames-street; my master lives on Bread-street-hill - he returned with Marchant, who took him into the stable; I heard a scuffle, and on going in it was nearly over. There is a cellar under the place; I got a light, went with the officers there, and found a bag of raisins at the foot of the cellar stairs, close to where they were struggling.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the bags on the steps - A. They appeared to have rolled down. I found them there not three minutes after he was secured.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Hancock. I was in the next stable, heard a noise, came out, and the officer called me to help him, but I was frightened - they were struggling close at the top of the cellar stairs; I got a light, and found two bags close to the stairs. I had been in the stable a quarter of an hour before. I fetched the keys out of my master's room - nobody else could have put the property there. There were several trusses of hay close to where he was taken, and about nine days after, when I used the hay, I found a picklock-key among it - I saw it tried to the warehouse door; it unlocked it. The door leads from the place the prisoner occupied in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the hay packed pretty tight - A. One or two trusses were apart from the others.</p>

            . The prisoner was our servant, and occupied a room in our house, which communicates with the warehouse by a door which we kept locked; he had no key to it with our permission, and had no authority to touch any of the property. I know some of this sugar, it being chippings, and a quality we use very little of; it corresponds with the bulk in the cask; we have such currants in our warehouse, and here is a package of Sultana raisins; we miss exactly this quantity. The boxes were broken and left empty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If your servant stole raisins he would not leave empty boxes to be seen - A. He could not take them out. The sugar is broken to pieces for samples.</p>

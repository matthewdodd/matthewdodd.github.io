On the 16th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with a little girl about nine years old, and asked to look at some remnants. I was waiting on another customer, and saw her take the shawl off the counter, and give it to the little girl; the girl put it under her shawl. The prisoner sat on the stool, and the little girl was by her. In a few minutes she looked at the girl-the girl then went out. When she got to the door, I went round, brought her back, and took the shawl from under her arms, covered with her shawl. The prisoner said the child was her daughter. I sent for an officer.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pike. I was waiting on the prisoner - She had a little girl with her. I shewed the prisoner several remnants, all of which she said were too dear. I saw her take the shawl off the counter, put it under her cloak, and then set on a stool. I did not see her give it to the child. The child was brought back, and the shawl taken from her-the prisoner said it was her child. The shawl I was dropped just behind the child at the time.</p>

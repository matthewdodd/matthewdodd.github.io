On the 16th of August, I received it from the Cashier's office; I then traced the note; I observed the prisoner's name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that to be the note which was upon your counter? - A. Yes, I did; there was my own hand-writing upon it; I have had the note ever since; I got it from the Bank. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know it again from that mark? - A. Yes; Mr. Wood laid it on the table, and said, he laid it there to dry before he booked it; the prisoner was there, and said he could reach the note; I said he must have a longer arm than I then; after that, he wanted to go up stairs to see a brother or a nephew of Mr. Wood's that was ill; he did not go up stairs while I was there; I took the money to Mr. Donovan.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You conceived him to be a respectable person, and therefore you readily took it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe you have not put the day that you received it, upon the note? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not see it? - A. Yes, there is 29. 4, which signifies the 29th of the 4th month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Wood). Q. What time in the day did you lose your note? - A. About nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010415-41-verdict221" type="verdictDescription">

I turned round to look at the box, and it was turned bottom upwards, and the middle broke in; while I was looking at the box, they both ran up the lane; the little boy was before me; he holloaed out, stop thief; at the top of the lane I came up with the boy, and we ran together; just as I came opposite the four mile stone, I came along-side Price; I was sure he was one of the men I saw in the lane; it was moon-light and starlight, and snow on the ground; I caught hold of him, and said, you are one of the thieves that cut the box off, and I immediately saw a man on the right-hand side, and charged him to aid and assist in the King's name, which proved to be Pigeon; as soon as I had got hold of him, he said, d-n your eyes, come along, Jack, and immediately a bit of tussle ensued, and I saw a man jump off the path, and he came to me and said, d-n your b-y eyes, we'll do you both; he came to Price's assistance, and fell upon me; and got me down; then immediately he flew over to Pigeon, and made a blow at him.</p>

               <p>Q.When the other came to join him, did you know him again? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Is that the box you found in possession of these two men? - A. Yes, I can swear to it; I marked my name upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You don't mean to say Price was the other man you saw with the box; was it not Peter? - A. No, it was Price; I am sure of it.</p>

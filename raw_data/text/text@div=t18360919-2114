The prisoner was in my service five or six months—on the 8th of August, he was directed to cart a load of wood from St. Helen's to Newington—he did the load, and came home at night, brought the cart home, and went away with the money—I never saw him from then till the 27th of August—if Meschac Izard paid him any money on the 8th of August, it was his duty to pay me—he has not paid me.</p>

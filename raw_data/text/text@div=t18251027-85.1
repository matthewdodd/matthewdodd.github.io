            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bishopsgate-street. On the 17th of October the prisoner brought me some articles - I questioned him closely and he gave me very good answers, but I got an officer to take him to his lodgings; as they were leaving the house he stooped down to pick up a bag; the officer said he need not take it, but leave it with me - I found a number of articles of wearing apparel in it; the officer then went to the place where he stated he lived, but no tidings of him could be heard; I then gave charge of him, as I thought he had been robbing some poor woman - he said he had not; I then said I thought he had robbed some cart, and it would save a great deal of trouble to tell where he had got them; he said he had, and told the officer to go to No. 1, Temple-lane, where he left the cart and the man.</p>
               <p>JANE PIPPIN. I have a sister named Charlotte - I delivered the bundle to the first witness to be washed - I know the articles to be ours.</p>

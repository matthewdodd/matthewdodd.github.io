On Wednesday, the 29th of April, the prisoner slept in the same room with me—I got up first next morning, and went to work at a quarter to six o'clock, leaving him in the room—I did not see him again till he was in custody—three other men who slept in the room still lodge there—on</p>

               <p>Saturday night, at six o'clock, I went to my box, found it broken open, and seventeen sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, a small leather bag, a coat, waistcoat, and a small lock, all gone from it—I had not been to the box since the Thursday morning—I saw it safe last on Sunday, the 25th, or Monday, the 26th—I have found nothing but the leather bag produced—I saw it found by the policeman at the bottom of the prisoner's tro, in the✗ lining—I have had it ever since I was a boy—there had been eight sovereigns in the bag and nine sovereigns and 3 half-sovereigns in paper, kept in this housewife, which was left on the drawers, empty—I have been nine years gathering the money—I know the bag by eight small holes in it.</p>

On the 27th of August I was in the sample room, and Jolly told me to call a man (Milner) out of Mincing-lane, which I did; I then sewed up a bag of sugar, and put a card on it, which Jolly gave me - I did not see him write the card; we put the bag upon the man's back - Jolly told him to take it to the Elephant, in Fenchurch-street; Jolly asked me to lend him 2d., which he gave Milner to pay the booking - the next morning, which was Sunday, Jolly came to my house very early, and said he was very sorry that the bag of sugar had got seized, he hoped I would say nothing about it, and he would never do the like again - the ticket which was on it was similar to this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I suppose you frequently employ people to carry out parcels? A. We do not send out many - we have employed people to carry them; I was afraid if I divulged it I should lose my place, and did not tell my employer of it till the 1st of September, which was the day I myself was taken; I did not at first know that it was going in a clandestine way - I never was in trouble before.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is it usual to put samples of sugar together, sew them up in a bag, and send them away? A. I never saw it done before.</p>

            . I am a porter. I was in Mincing-lane, and was called in to take the parcel; Jolly and Cornman put it on my knot, and gave me 2d. to pay for it; I took it to the Elephant public-house, Fenchurch-street - it was booked according to the direction, which was the same as when I received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.There is nothing unusual in your carrying parcels? A. No; I had not been employed by Jolly before - I knew him well, and lived two doors from him.</p>
               <p>SARAH SKIVOR. My uncle keeps the Elephant, in Fenchurch-street. Milner brought the bag on the 27th of August, and I booked it - here is the entry; (read) "Poplar - Clarke, one bag, 27th of August, signed George Woolford;" he is the Poplar carrier, and signs the book when he takes the parcels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.How can you tell that this entry refers to this particular bag? A. Because so much has been said about it - my attention was particularly directed to it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Does your memory enable you to state that Milner brought the parcel in question? A. Yes, and I remember booking it, and Woolford taking it away- Milner had frequently been in our house.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Woolford, the carrier.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. So he keeps no shop? A. No - the words "Tea-dealer" are over his door; I only went into the passage - there is another Mr. Clarke almost opposite; I never stated that I did not receive the parcel till I got to the Red Lion - I said I removed them from one cart to another there; Clarke did not open the parcel before he said it was all right; it was night when I took it there - the officer followed me to Mr. Clarke's with the parcel, and directly I had put it in the passage and received the carriage-money, he seized the parcel and Clarke; I then went away.</p>

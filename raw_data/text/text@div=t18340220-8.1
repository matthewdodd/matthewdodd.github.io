               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it at an auction you bought them? A. No; I bought them of Mr. Evans, cabinet-maker, High Holborn - he is a manufacturer - I cannot say how long they have been in use - in the day-time, the shop-front is entirely out - I have no shop-boy - I saw them safe at ten minutes after four o'clock - I could swear it was about twenty inches inside the shop, but I said eighteen, to be quite certain - no part of it was outside - I had pulled it more into the shop for safety when I went into the room to tea - I could not have seen it in the parlour if I had left it where it was - the prisoner did not tell me that a gentleman directed him to carry it, and promised him eighteen-pence, nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you live and sleep at the shop? A. Yes: the shop communicates with the dwelling-house, and is part of it.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Silk's, No. 8, Longacre, next door to Mr. Whitaker - on the afternoon of the 20th of January I saw the man take the table on his shoulder - it was the prisoner - I cannot say where the table stood, but I saw him take it on his shoulder - I had only just come out of master's shop - whether it was inside the shop, or outside, I do not know, but I saw him whip the table up on his shoulder very quick, and run off with it - I saw him take it up - he was just by the shop-front when I saw him take it on his shoulder - I saw nobody near him at the time - I am sure he went up Rose-street - he walked very quick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the shop when you saw him take the table? A. About a dozen yards, on the same side of the way - I could see him - he made no resistance with me - he said nothing till he came before the magistrate, when he said a gentleman gave him eighteen-pence to take it to New Church in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman met me at the corner of Rose-street, as I was talking to a young woman who lodged with me twelve months before - the gentleman asked me if I wanted a job - I told him I did - he said if I would take the table to the corner of New Church, to the booking office, he would give me eighteen-pence, and the woman said, "Go on, you cannot get eighteen-pence every day" - I took the table - he said he had to call in King-street, Covent Garden, and would meet me - I was coming from master's at the Savoy, Strand, at the time, where I had done a day's work.</p>

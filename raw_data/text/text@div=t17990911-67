               <p>Q. Did you know what you were arrested for? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was the servant, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did those three men keep you in your lodgings, or take you from your lodgings? - A. They came first and burst the door open; the young person that opened the door they pushed in, and forced themselves up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they take you to? - A. They were to take me to a prison, but I was very much hurt, and one of the officers took me to his own house.</p>

               <p>Q. If I wanted to pawn any thing, supposing it was this tambour cloak, I should take it to the shop of a person, and desire him to let me have the use of some money; then, when I carry him back the money, he lets me have the cloak; - do you understand me? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever do any such thing as that with any of these articles? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor did you know that your servant did any such thing till after she had left you? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer belonging to the Police-office, Queen-square: I was sent by the Magistrate's orders to search the prisoner's room, at Mrs. Wood's; here is a list of the articles that I found in that room, with my name signed to it.</p>

               <p>Q.How did you open the door? - A. It was opened in my presence, I don't think I ever had the key at all; I found the prisoner's boxes locked, there were two of them, I broke open one of them, I opened the other with a key that I found in the box that I broke open; I found a duplicate in the first box, (produces a duplicate of a gold thimble for twelve shillings); I apprehended the prisoner the next day, in the road leading to Chelsea; before I searched her, she gave me this ticket. (Producing it).</p>
               <p>Q.Before that, had you told her upon whose charge you were apprehending her? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Wood.) In what street did you live? - A. In Queen's row, Plimlico; it is likewise called Queen's-row Terrace.</p>
               <p>Court. This duplicate is in the name of Mrs. Mason, King-street.</p>
               <p>Mansden. When she gave me the ticket, I accused her with other things of her mistress's; she said she would take me to the place where they were in pledge, and that she had pledged them by her mistress's consent, and gave her the tickets. I went with her to the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q.Was this after, or before you had searched her box? - A. The next day. After I had found the duplicates in her box, I went to the pawnbroker with her, and she called for the articles; I think there was a spencer and three linen gowns, a tambour cloak, and a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then asked her whether she had any duplicates? - A. Yes, before that; she said she had given them to her mistress: I took her to Queen-square Office, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were any other duplicates found, to your knowledge, besides those for the thimble and the cloak? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any ring upon her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The very first time you questioned her about it, she said she had done it at the request of her mistress? - A. Yes, that is the account she always gave.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what she was going about when you arrested her? - A. She said she was going to Bow-street, to see her attorney.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she tell you who her attorney was? - A. Mr. Combes; she was coming towards the Park.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were present when the duplicate was found in the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mrs. Wood in the room at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she appear to understand what it was? - A. Not at that time, she did not; I explained to her that it was a duplicate of a thimble, and that it was in pawn; she told me that in a bill she received from the prisoner, there was something like a duplicate, and she supposed that was it. I understand the duplicate is of two articles, one belonging to the mistress, and the other to the servant.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you ship the adventures of petty officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you the agent of Mr. Wood, of Calcutta? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.In the character of his agent, were you commissioned to supply Mrs. Wood with money, while he was upon his voyage? - A. Yes, without limitation.</p>
               <p>Q.Whenever Mrs. Wood applied to you for supplies of money, had she them? - A. Yes; this is an extract from my ledger,</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110102"></xptr>Q.Between the 30th of March and the 30th of June, had she any supply from you? - A. The 24th March, she had ten guineas; April 4th, ten guineas; May 16th, eighteen pounds, three shillings; July 8th, twenty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mrs. Wood had applied for twenty pounds when she applied for ten pounds, would she have had it? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever refuse to let her have money? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you have now a great deal more money in your hands than you have paid? - A. A great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Mrs. Wood being arrested, you were sent for? - A. Yes; but I was out of town, and Mr. Luard was sent for.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS LUARD sworn - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an attorney in Gray's-inn; on the 12th of July last, I was sent for by Mrs. Wood, I found her at the private house of a sheriff's officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any bill delivered to you by the prisoner? - A.Yes, the next morning; I had heard of it the day of the arrest, for balance of account for wages, and money laid out in small articles of housekeeping.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the arrest? - A. No, the arrest was for the clothes of the prisoner, of the value of ten pounds and upwards, which she swore in the affidavit she refused to deliver. I desired Mrs. Wood to pay every thing that was justly due to her. I went the next morning; Mr. Armitage met me, and said the attorney was there with the bill; he was here just now: he calls himself Combes, but he is not upon the list. The bill that was delivered to me my agent has lost, since we have attended this Court; the last words of that account were, part of a pledge, half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else about pledges in any part of that bill? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Mrs. Wood? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, from that conversation, that Mrs. Wood understood what a pledge meant? - A. She did not; I had the greatest difficulty in the world to make her understand it; I spoke to her in the English language, and I spoke to her in the French; I put it in every possible shape before I could make her understand it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. A part of that bill was for part of a pledge, half-a-crown, that she had pawned, somehow or other, on account of some pledge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was before Mrs. Wood had made any charge of felony against her? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was drawing Mrs. Wood's attention to the subject of pledges? - A. Not to my knowledge, or in my judgment; it drew her attention to something which turned out to be very bad.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This hill was delivered to you with the article, part of a pledge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it in consequence of that article, that you advised any step to be taken? - A. To go to Queen-square, and get a search-warrant; she did so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had heard of a demand of wages? - A. Yes, pending the arrest; before she was bailed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard from Mrs. Wood that there had been such a demand of wages? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mrs. Wood had been apprized of a demand of wages by her, before she was taken up? - A. I believe so, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt of it? - A. No; and when I say demand of wages, I mean a demand of the balance of a general account of money laid out, and wages together.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. Do you mean the demand of the bill, then? - A. Yes, the balance stated at the foot of this paper.</p>
               <p>Q.Had Mrs. Wood signed that bill at that time? - A.</p>
               <p>Q. In answer to Mr. Knowlys's question, you said you had heard from Mrs. Wood, that this woman had made a demand of wages upon her: now are you correct in that? - A. To the best of my recollection, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was in consequence of your advice that Mrs. Wood went to Queen-square? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Wood shew any reluctance to follow your advice? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the crime of which my mistress wrongfully accuses me; my mistress went with me to Jermyn-street, and stood just by the pawnbroker's till I came out again, to receive the duplicate and the money for the thimble; I gave her the duplicate and twelve shillings; she went to a fishmonger's shop in St. James's-market, and laid out two shillings of it in some salmon for Sunday's dinner; then she went to the poulterer's shop opposite, and bought a fowl at four shillings and sixpence, for the same dinner; the remainder of the money was to pay a grocer's bill that was at home, one pound, two shillings, and threepence-halfpenny. A lace cloak was pledged for one pound, in the beginning of last winter, my mistress gave it me from her drawers, to pledge; the lace is on her handkerchief that she has now round her neck; the money was not enough to pay the baker's bill, and she asked me to lend her my gown and petticoat, because there was not enough to pay the baker; his name is Drake. I pledged them for seven shillings and sixpence: the man brought a note from his master, saying, that he should summons Mrs. Wood if she did, not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110103"></xptr>pay it. Another time I pledged, a shawl for two shillings; the shawl will be produced that was pledged at the same time as the gown, petticoat, and ring were pledged: two shillings went for an ounce of tea and a pound of sugar: before I fetched the shawl home, I pledged a gown and a shawl for four shillings and sixpence, and that was to buy two shilling's-worth of oysters, and a pennyworth of cheese: she gave me one shilling of the money to fetch the shawl home, and I pledged a dirty handkerchief from my own neck, for one shilling, for some green tea, when she was going to have company; and a gold necklace she gave to a French gentleman to pledge at Mr. Turner's, in Panton-street: she gave me the duplicates to keep, as it would hurt her very much if any ladies should see them in her apartment: she went to this French gentleman's for a duplicate, he lived at No. 62, Swallow-street, a stationer's shop, and I brought it home, and put it in my box: she gave this French gentleman a silver tea-pot and stand, and five guineas and a half out of her own pocket, in gold, because the French gentleman was going to be arrested; she left herself without a farthing of money; at that time I bought her a quarter of a pound of bees-sausages, with three halfpence that I had in my pocket; this was somewhere about January: when I came away, my month was up and three days over, and she pushed me out of her apartments, and said I should not stay another moment in her house, nor I should not have my clothes nor my wages, and I now make a demand of my wages, four pounds, ten shillings, and sixpence, and a bundle of asparagus, four shillings and sixpence, which I did not put down in my bill, and I wish to have that, and my clothes. Before I got out of the house I turned back to ask my mistress if all the duplicates were safe; and she told me she had got them safe: all the things that are pledged now was to buy dinners and things when she had company: my mistress gave me two long-sleeve gowns to pledge, and I have got a witness here who was in the house at the time my mistress made me go out with them; she told me if I did leave her it should be the worst day's work I ever did, for she would ruin me and my family; I said, as to my family, she could not hurt them, and as to the duplicates, they were in my name, and I was very sorry for it; she might ruin me, but she could not touch my family. Miss O'Hara was in the room when I asked her if she had got her duplicates safe; I got to the door, and Miss O'Hara was in the room, with the door open: I hope Miss O'Hara will speak the truth between the prisoner and the prosecutor, as her evidence will be of great service to me.</p>

               <p>Q.Whose property was that green box? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever seen that green box before? - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see it last? - A. In Esther's hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did this surprise you at all, that these were duplicates of property belonging to Mrs. Wood? - A.I did not think particularly of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Mrs. Wood was living in a way that you did not expect her to pawn things? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were as intimate as two young ladies could well be? - A. Yes.</p>

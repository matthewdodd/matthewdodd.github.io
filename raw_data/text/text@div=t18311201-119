            . I am a City-officer. On the afternoon of the 23rd of November, I observed a truck near the <placeName id="t18311201-119-crimeloc636">Royal Exchange</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. How long have you been an officer? A.Ten years - I have never been suspended; the prisoner had not got more than twenty yards from me - I had not lost sight of him; I asked him what he had got, and he said he did not choose to answer - when I asked him again, he said a gentleman gave it him to carry from Wood-street, Cheapside, to his house - he did not say to the Spread Eagle; I asked where he lived - he said in Wood-street, Spitalfields; I asked where the gentleman lived - he said he did not know; he did not ask me to go to Gracechurch-street - I went according to the direction on the parcel, to Cheapside, to ask whether they expected such a parcel, and they said they did; the truck was going towards Cheapside, and the prisoner towards Whitechapel: it was dark, but the lamps were lighted.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What the officer states is all false - he asked what I had; I said I did not know, but a gentleman gave it to me to carry to the Spread Eagle - I asked him to go there, but he declined.</p>

                  </hi> I live in New-street, Shadwell. I met the prisoner on 18th April—I went to two public-houses with him, and then to a private house in Keate-street—he went up stairs—I said I should not go up there—he said, "Come in"—I went up—he said he had to call there on a friend, as I understood him—when we got up, he went out for something to drink—he was gone about ten minutes—when he came back he said, "I have kept you a long while waiting; do you know what the time is?"—I said, "Yes, but I think my watch stops"—I took my watch out—he caught it out of my hand, and ran out—I ran and held him by the hand—two men camp in and seized my arm, and the prisoner escaped—this was about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening—I am sure he is the man; I can swear to his voice, as well as his person—I was in his company an hour and three quarters.</p>

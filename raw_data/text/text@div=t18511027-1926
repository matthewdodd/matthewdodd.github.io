               <p>packed upon the top of a small chest of drawers at my house—an arrange<lb></lb>ment was come to between us as to their disposal—after that arrangement, I saw a person of the name of Wolfe Abrahams—they commonly called him <hi rend="italic">Woolley</hi> Abrahams—I afterwards went down to the Mitre, and there saw Abrahams and Myers—after leaving the Mitre, Whicher told me to go some<lb></lb>where; in consequence of which, I went to Senior's house—he kept the Black Dog public-house, Sun-street, Bishopsgate, at the corner of Long<lb></lb>alley—I found him at the end of the bar, by himself—I asked him if he knew any one that would buy any pieces of de-laine—he asked me to bring some patterns down—I took some down on the Sunday evening—I first saw him about 3 o'clock on the Sunday, and in the evening I took him the patterns, and showed them to him—I went home, and cut the patterns off—after looking at them, he said they were splendid goods; he should not buy them himself, but he could recommend me to a man—I then left, and left the pat<lb></lb>terns with him—I went again on the Monday morning—I saw Senior, and he said he would take me down to a man—he said he could not go then, as his wife was ill, but told me to call the next day—I called next day, and from day to day down to Friday—I saw him every day—he said he could not go this day, and he could not go the other day; that his wife was not sufficiently recovered—on the Friday he sent for me—I was at home when the person came—my wife answered the door—I did not see the person that came—in consequence of a message I received, I went to his house—I went into the bar-parlour, and found Sayward and Senior there—they were examining the patterns which I had taken—Sayward asked me what I wanted for them—(that was in Senior's presence)—I said, "A shilling a yard"—Sayward said he could not give a shilling; he would write on a piece of paper what he would give, and he wrote "8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Senior said he could afford to give 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—Sayward doubted whether they were all wool; but after examination with him and Senior, they considered they were all wool—the patterns con<lb></lb>tained both the de-laine and the merino—the price ultimately agreed upon was 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the de-laine, and 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the two pieces of black merino—the price was reckoned up—Senior got a little book; I think they call it a ready-reckoner—Sayward was casting up how much it would come to, each piece—Senior said, "What do you make them come to? I make them come to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece, at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—they cast up the whole lot, so that they came to 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I believe—at that time only the patterns were there—Say<lb></lb>ward said he should like to see a whole piece or two, and asked me if I could not go and fetch them; and I went and got two pieces, and brought them back to Senior's—Senior was still there—Sayward examined them, and laid them out at full length, as they were folded, and asked Senior for a yard measure—Senior got a yard-measure, and Sayward measured them—he did not unfold them—he measured them as they laid, and counted the folds—they were in folds of about a yard and a quarter—Sayward took the two pieces away—Senior gave him two sheets of paper to put them in—there was no other person present on that occasion—Senior's son, George, was in the bar, attending to the customers—I think he is about twenty years of age—after Sayward left, I told Senior that I was to make him some recompense for his trouble in recommending a customer—he said he did not want any money—he said, "D—n the money; give me a piece or two of the stuff"—he gave me two patterns of what he chose, and I took the pieces to him myself, the first Sunday in March—I delivered them in his presence, laid them on the bar-table in the bar-parlour—there was no one else present—a man named Sayers saw me come out—(there were twenty-eight yards in</p>

               <p>each of the pieces I took to Senior)—Sayers said to Senior, "You have been up to some of your old games again, Master George"—it was spoken in a jocular sort of way; in fact, I do not know whether the man ever recollected such a circumstance—those were the words made use of—the goods were ulti<lb></lb>mately taken to Sayward's; but before I left Senior's on that occasion, Senior upbraided me because I let the goods go so cheap—he said I was a d—d bad salesman, and it was a pity I should have such things to deal with—I went to Senior's again on the following Friday, after I had left the goods, for a part of the payment—Sayward and Senior were present—we were outside the bar on that occasion—I believe no one was present—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to me—I had previously received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Senior's bar-parlour, on the Friday night, when the goods were sold—that was in Senior's presence—a sort of receipt was given for the money, in Senior's presence—he supplied the piece of paper—he might have seen what was written on it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I should rather say all this was not written at that time—the "Sixty" was not on it when I put the signature to it—I put the signature in Senior's bar-parlour, in his presence—I believe nothing was said in his pre<lb></lb>sence as to the nature of it, or what it was for—I then left—when the second instalment, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was paid, on the Friday after, the first Friday in March, Senior asked me if Sayward had paid me—I said, no, he had not; he had paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and he said he was <hi rend="italic">fiddling</hi> of me—he said, "Don't you know what I mean?"—I said, "Not exactly"—he said Sayward was afraid that some one would halloo about it—he said whenever he (Senior) sold him any<lb></lb>thing, he always gave him a regular bill.</p>

I am a licensed-victualler—I live now at 48, Brunswick-street, Hackney-road—I know Mr. Sayward, the prisoner, these ten or twelve years—I know William Plampin, who used to live in Earl-street—I have known him nine years, when he belonged to a Lodge of Industry of Old Friends, at my previous house—I know the prisoner Whicher since I have been in town—I knew him when he was employed at Mr. Wood's—I cannot recollect as to Plampin and Sayward coming on any particular day to my house; as I take 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in pennies and twopences, it would be impossible to say any particular persons were in my house on any day—I do not recollect introducing Plampin to Sayward—I do not recollect any sample of merinos and mousseline-de-laines being left with me—I never saw any, to my knowledge—I did not have a piece of merino—I was not present when Sayward and Plampin met at my house, to my knowledge—I did not send my son George to Mr. Plampin's about Feb. last, to come to my house to see Mr. Sayward, not to my knowledge—I never sent him, to my knowledge, for the purpose—I should go myself, if necessary, and I never went myself)—I believe Plampin had not been examined at the time Senior was examined—I think he was examined on a subsequent occasion—Senior was not subpoenaed—I will not be certain whether he attended the first day without a summons, or not; but in consequence of what took place, it was necessary to summon him afterwards—he was not brought there in custody the first day—he might have stayed away if he had pleased—he was under no compulsion to attend—he surrendered to take his trial.</p>

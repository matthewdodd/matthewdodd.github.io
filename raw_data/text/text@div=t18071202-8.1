He walked through the shop into the parlour; I began to suspect him; in about half a minute I jumped off my board and went into the parlour after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the parlour - A. My son, he is about eleven years old, and no one else. I did not see him take any thing, so I gave him a written direction of my shop; he went towards Warren-street. When he had been gone about two minutes a thought struck me about the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your watch hanging. - A. Over the mantle piece in the parlour; it was a silver watch. I gave four guineas for it about eighteen years ago; it was a good going watch. I went into the parlour the moment the thought struck me, I missed the watch; I sent my little boy one way after him, and went another way myself; the boy went towards Fitzroy street, I saw the boy bring him back. I went and met them, he came very peacably by the side of the boy, and no other one with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it. - A. About half past four in the evening, it was not quite dark, it was near dusk; I met them at the corner of Warren-street; the prisoner, myself, and the boy, came into the shop together again.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not lay hold of him. - A. No, he made no resistance; I sent for a constable and searched him, but could not find the watch upon him; the constable asked the prisoner where he lived, he said in North-street; I found afterwards that he lived there, he had been there but a week. I had him taken up again the same evening, about half past ten, by the advice of Mr. Baker. On the next morning the watch was brought to me by Mr. White, a neighbour. I am sure it is my own watch.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PALMER, JUNIOR. Q. How old are you. - A. Eleven last October.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what an oath is - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are come to speak the truth - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were to take a false oath, what do you think God Almighty would do with you after you were dead. - A. I should go to fire and brimstone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming into your father's shop. - A. Yes; my father desired me to pursue him, I did, and brought him back; he came with me.</p>

In the evening when I was in bed, Mr. Palmer and Mr. Baker came; they took me out of bed. searched my drawers, and took me to the watchhouse, and at the office the following morning was produced the watch; and more of it I do not know; I only wish to make the observation, that Mr. Palmer had not seen the watch an hour previous to my going into the place; any person might go in the house and be accused of it the same as I was.

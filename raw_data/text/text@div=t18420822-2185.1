                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live at No. 15, Carter-street, Cutler-street, Houndsditch. On Monday, the 4th of July, I was coming down Houndsditch, and saw a truck, with a box of candles in it—another man put it on the prisoner's shoulder, and he ran away with it—the witness Akers came up—I told him what I had seen, and he ran after the prisoner—I followed him into Petticoat-lane, and there saw the same man that had put the box on the prisoner's shoulder take it off the pri<lb></lb>soner's shoulder, give it to Akers, and he got off—the prisoner got out the back-way, down a little court out of Petticoat-lane—I was going to ran after him, but the Jews hit me, and would not let me do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, in the service of Mrs. Burrows and Son, confectioners in Houndsditch. On Monday, the 4th of July, I was in the shop, and saw a truck with a box of candles—an alarm was given soon after, and I went towards Petticoat-lane, and saw the prisoner with a box of 'candles on his shoulder—I saw him turn into a shop in Essex-street, the party that belonged to the shop took it off his shoulder, and he escaped by a back entrance, which I was not aware of, or I could have taken him—several people came into the shop while I was in there—it was some man in the shop that took the "box off the prisoner's shoul<lb></lb>der—I believe he was the master of the shop, but I do not know it—I knew nothing of him before—I seized hold of the box—I afterwards saw the prisoner in Clerk en well prison—I knew him directly.</p>

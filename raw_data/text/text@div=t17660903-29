               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with any of your things again?</p>

            . I live in Fox-court; she told me it was the property of her husband; I bid her bring her husband: then she shewed me a snuffbox, it was blackish, I believe engine turned, an said that was her husband's; I desired her to bring her husband, and then I would talk to her farther; she went away and came no more: she was taken upon the Tuesday, and examined before Justice Girdler; she was seen to go into my house, so the Justice sent for me, and upon the account I gave, she was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. In order to have seen her husband, you should have stopped the things; you could never expect to see her husband in letting her go away so. I mention this by way of advice, that you may always stop the goods, where you have any suspicion.</p>

               <p>Court. Here are three persons of some credit, by their appearance, every one whom have acted quite wrong; I wish there was more caution used in carrying on the trade. If a person puts a few clean cloaths on, they can easily impose on these persons: you will oblige the legislator to put an end to your trade, in not using more caution; such do more mischief to society, than the thieves themselves do: it certainly is their duty to stop the goods, where there is any suspicion.</p>

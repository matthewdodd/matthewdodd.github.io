                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Great Stanmore. The prisoner James Creecy was in my service for about twelve months; and Reuben had been in my service, but had left me about a month or five weeks before this—on Sunday, the 12th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I gave James Creecy a brown-paper parcel, which contained 20 half-sovereigns—he was to take it to Mr. Tootell, at Edge ware—it was sealed and directed—he was to ask him what message he had to send back—I then went to church, and on my return I saw James Creecy in my yard—I asked if he had been down to Mr. Tootell's—he said, "Yes; I saw Mr. Tootell, and gave him the parcel; he said it was all right; there was no other message"—in the afternoon I saw Reuben Creecy in my stable, with James Creecy—I asked Reuben what he did there, and whether he was not ashamed to show his face there after leaving my service in the way he had—the next morning James Creecy was miss<lb></lb>ing, and did not return—I sent to Mr. Tootell's, and on the following Thursday I went with the officer, and overtook the prisoners about three miles on the other side of Ipswich—I said, "James, here you are"—he said, "Yes, master, what do you want with me?"—I said, "You know very well, I want you to go with me"—he said, "You don't owe me any thing, master, nor do I owe you any thing—what do you want with me?"—Reuben said, "What do you want with me?"—I said, "To go with your brother"—he said, "I don't work for you now, you can't have any business with me"—they were taken to Ipswich, and eight half<lb></lb>sovereigns and some silver were found on James, and also a piece of the paper the money had been wrapped in, directed to Mr. Tootell; and on Reuben eight half-sovereigns.</p>

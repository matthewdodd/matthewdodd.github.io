I lost a tea-tray, on the 22d of November, from inside my shop - I saw it safe about half-past four o'clock. and was called out by my servant a little after six; I saw the prisoner about one hundred yards from the shop - Mr. Gobby had hold of him; the tray had then been taken from him.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live next door but one to Mr. Turner. I was going by his shop, and saw the prisoner with the tea-tray in his hand - when I came up to him he put it down, and walked seven or eight yards; I suspected he did not want to purchase it, and crossed into an opposite shop - I looked through the window, and saw him come and take it again; a person came by, and he put it down again - he came again, took it up, and ran off with it; I ran after him - when I came near to him he dropped it; I jumped over it, and took hold of him - he seemed intoxicated; I took him back to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he got is looking at, like a purchaser? A. I did not think he was a purchaser - he did not look so much at the tray; he seemed looking at the people who were passing; he put it down when any one passed - I immediately followed him; he only turned once before I came up to him; I was only three or four yards behind him when he turned the corner.</p>

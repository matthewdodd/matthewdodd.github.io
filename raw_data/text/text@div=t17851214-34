               <p>Was there anything by which you could know that lead? - Very well, because there had been three pieces of lead in the shop, which weighed two hundred and a half; the coach-maker's man is here, that locked the door.</p>

               <p>On Saturday in the afternoon, Oldfield came to the shop, and abused his father very much, who was at work there, in slating; I reprimanded him for so doing, and he came into the loft, and staid sometime, he then went up another ladder to another different part of the loft, and took a survey of the roofs all round, he staid up about a quarter of an hour, and came down, and I saw him no more then.</p>
               <p>Where was the lead laying? - In the loft, right by where I worked; after taking a survey of the premises, and going up to the roof a second time, he came down and went off; he did not take anything away with him then, I am positive; I shut up shop after that, the door was locked by the apprentice; and on the Monday morning, we watched for him, at a muffin maker's, in Barret's-court, his name was Wilmot; when we got a search warrant, we went up stairs, and found the prisoner Oldfield there, and the lead over in a loft; there was a woman the wife of the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140059"></xptr> Hugh Cooper rents the room, here is a piece of the lead.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose lead that is? - I cannot say, it was cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I am confident it was my piece of lead, there have been four pieces originally, each of these pieces was fourteen inches wide, and sixteen feet and a half long, all the four pieces were cut out of one sheet, and all alike, one was put in this place, the other three were taken away.</p>

               <p>What did Cooper say about it? - He said he knew nothing at all about it, I know nothing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>What length did they make amongst them? - They made just two pieces of sixteen feet six inches and a half over, they had not the half-inch originally; the piece that was dropped by the stables was not tried by me or by any witness here.</p>
               <p>Court to English. The piece of lead that you produced was one of the twelve pieces? - It was.</p>

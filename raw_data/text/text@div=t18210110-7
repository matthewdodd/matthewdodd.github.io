We went to the entrance of the stables, and found three or four of the stable doors broken open - they are in Little Bridge-street. Neal stopped at the gate, while I went to the watch-house to get assistance, and as Berry and I were coming down we heard the rattle spring. Angel immediately rushed by us, and Potter caught him; we proceeded to the stable, and found Ball laying in the manger - I took him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was placed at Mr. Alderman Smith's. Pye said there was a light in the stables; we found three or four stable doors open. I remained at the gate while he got assistance, during which time the prisoner, Angel, came to the gate from the stable with a horse-cloth containing some cart harness and a bridle; seeing me he laid them down at the bottom of the half-gate. I asked what he had been doing? he said another man was up the yard. I sprung my rattle, and he rushed by me; I pursued him, and kept him in my sight until Potter took him. I went back to the gate and remained till Ball was found.</p>

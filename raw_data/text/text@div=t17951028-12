               <p>Q. These articles in the indictment, were they missed at one time, or at different times? - I never missed them at all, except the spoons; when I missed the spoons I charged her with it, and gave her in charge with the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she when you found them on her? - She was in the kitchen, dressing some victuals for dinner; the officer, Lawrence, searched her in my presence, and I see the spoons drop from her; Lawrence took them into his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed the spoons did you send for Lawrence? - I went to my Lord Mayor, and he ordered Lawrence to come with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else that you missed? - Not then; but there was a bag with a matter of a hundred pawnbrokers duplicates, found on her, but only eighty concerned me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in your service? - About eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any character with her? - Yes, a written character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her on that character? - Yes, but I have known her these twenty years, she was a mantua maker formerly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not pledge the things, but with an intent to take them out again, and part of the things are my own.</p>
               <p>Court to Lawrence. You went by desire of the Lord Mayor, to the house of Mr. Brathwaite? - Yes, I went with Mr. Brathwaite.</p>
               <p>Q. You was ordered to search her, I suppose? - Yes, and I did, I took these two silver tea spoons out of her pocket, and a single duplicate, which was hardly dry, a duplicate of a coat of Mr. Brathwaite's; while I was searching her she shoved about very much, and she dropped this bag of duplicates on my right to it, there is about a hundred of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept those duplicates ever since, and the two spoons? - Yes; as soon as I found these duplicates she confessed that they were all her master's property, or a great part of them, and that she meant to take them out of pawn, and begged his pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you recommended her to do so? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her it would be better for her to do it? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you traced any of the property? - Yes, the pawnbrokers are here, their duplicates answer to theft.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time that the officer came to me, I was taking up my dinner; he has got two little boxes of mine, and my silver thimble, and at the same time he did not find the tickets in my pocket, he shook them out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Lawrence. Those things were left at Mr. Brathwaite's, being of no consequence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not find any thing on me but the two tea spoons.</p>

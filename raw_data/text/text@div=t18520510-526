                  </hi>. I am a cigar maker, of 4, Doggitt-court, Moorfields. On 7th May, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in Smithfield, and saw four persons close alongside of me—the prisoner was one—I saw him give a boy a blow on the side of his face—I had no sooner passed on than the prisoner snatched my bundle out of my hand; it contained bread and cheese—he ran off, and I ran after him—I caught him about twenty yards off, laid hold of the bundle, and he struck me a violent blow on the neck—I fell, and he got off with the bundle—I called an officer, and the pri<lb></lb>soner ran away—I never lost sight of him—he dropped the bundle and the officer caught him—I am positive he is the man—this is my handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

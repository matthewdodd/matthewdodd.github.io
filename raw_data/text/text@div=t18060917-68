               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner. - A. I never saw him in my life before I took him. On the 7th of August, at half past four in the morning, I met him at the bottom of the mews at the back of Gloucester place; he says to me when I met him, watchman I have overslept myself, I am an hour beyond my time, I am afraid I shall be too late; I turned round, and saw he had got a box coat under his arm, I thought he did not look like a coachman, I followed him into Portland street, Berkley square, there he went down a little mews; I laid wait for him, I knew he must come back again; he came out of the mews with a footman's coat on, he had changed his coat, I did not see him do it; when he went in first he had his own coat on, when he returned his own coat was wrapped up with the box coat under his arm, I followed him into Portman square, and there I took him into custody; I said to him, my friend, where did you get these coats, he said they are my own, says I, I do not doubt but they are your own, but where did you get them; O lord, says he, watchman I will go back to the place where I got them from, I would not let him go back; he then said he took the coats out of a coachhouse in the mews, where he spoke to me.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoners in the morning, about half after two, in a field just by my house, coming down the road from <rs id="t17850914-141-viclabel670" type="occupation">Captain</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. I saw the pigeons laying in a bag, and I brought them to this place, and put them there, as I wanted to go to work.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Who are these boys? - They are two boys, whose mothers live, I believe, in the parish, and are washer women, they have been frequently with me begging, I would do all I could for favour to be shewn them; there is a well known gang of them, the eldest of whom is not twenty, who are frequently stealing chickens: I suppose they lifted one another up atop of the wall, and then unroofed the hay loft.</p>

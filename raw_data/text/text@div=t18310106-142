             - I said, "Sol, where have you sent them to?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I have sent them to the Jews' synagogue," and if Simmons was not come home, he was taken up for the robbery; he said, "You must go to Worship-street, to inquire there - if you don't find him there, go to Guildhall, and if you hear nothing there, go to the Mansion-house;" a young woman, they call Laura, cohabited with Sol in that room - I went to those three places, and heard nothing of them; I returned home, and in the evening I saw Simmons and Wilkinson, about nine o'clock, at the Crown, at the Obelisk; Simmons asked me if I would take any thing to drink - I said No, and asked where he had been: he made no answer - he pulled out half a sovereign, wanted change for it, and said he had plenty of money; he had nineteen sovereigns and 7 1/2d. - that included the half-sovereign - he said he had got it by property he had stolen from the synagogue; he said this inside the Crown; I had never before seen him in possession of above half a crown, during the time that I lived with him - Sol and Samuel Davis came into the Crown about a quarter of an hour after; I did not sit down and drink there - Samuel Davis said, "Where is Edmund and John?" I said, "In there," pointing to the tap-room- Samuel said, "If they behave wrong to me I will do the same to them;" they then went into the tap-room -Wilkinson and Simmons had left before they got in; Samuel and Sol went straight down to Hicks', the Lion - I went with them; they called Simmons out, talked together, and drank together, but I did not hear their conversation; next day Simmons had two new long coats on, a new belcher silk handkerchief and a new pair of shoes; on the Sunday following inquiry was made of me about another robbery, and Simmons was taken up that Sunday night - I then disclosed to Hammond, the Police-officer, what I knew about it; I was examined four times before the Lord Mayor - it was mentioned at the examination on the Thursday, that a phosphorus-box had been found in the synagogue; I was sent out of the justice-room before I had seen that box - it was shown to me when I came in again, but it was not one that I had ever seen before; another phosphorus-box was afterwards shown to me - I knew that; (looking at a phosphorus-box produced by Ansell) I do not know this - it is not the one that was shown to me the second time.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at it again, and tell me do you know that box? A. Yes, this is the phosphorus-box that Simmons was to take with him - he was only to take a box and a bunch of keys; Ann Hilyard, who drank tea with us on the 20th of December, cohabited with Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. I may be twenty-two or twenty-three in March; I am not a prostitute now - I have been so, but I now get my living by my own work; I began to do so about three years ago - it is not more than a month ago that I lived with Simmons, but I was getting my living by going out to work, except for the four days I was with him; I had known him before that - I had a grand-mother, who lived in Grey-street, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road, once; I have three brothers - I do not know where one of them is; I do not know that he has been transported - I have heard so, but do not know it for truth; it is twelve or fourteen years since I saw him - I have heard of him, but do not know where he is; a gentleman called, who had seen him, but I do not know where - I have worked for Mrs. Rushmeer, and have lived with a lady at Kenning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060072"></xptr>ton; I was never at Brixton nor at the Borough Clink -I was never before a Justice but once, and that was when my father took me up for running from home; I then lived where we do now, in Catherine-wharf, Vine-street, near Waterloo-bridge - it was six years ago; I never was taken up on any other occasion, never tried, and never in Brixton House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave your work to live with Simmons? A. Simmons persuaded me to come from home - when I heard they proposed to rob the synagogue I thought it was shocking - I told

               <p>Q. Pray how long after this (the 20th of December) did Simmons refuse to live any longer with you? A. He did not refuse at all - I told him I had better go home; he did not turn me off, nor did I say I would get him transported for it - I left him on the Wednesday, went home on Thursday, and lived with my mother, in Vine-street; I have no father - Mrs Marks is the landlady of the house where I lived with Simmons - I saw her and Ann Hilyard here yesterday; Hilyard slept with me on the night the synagogue was robbed - I state this on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Hilyard and Mrs. Marks are here; I caution you, are you sure of it? A. Yes: Simmons and I slept together up to Monday, and I expected him home on the Monday night - Hilyard lodged with one Franklin, who she left on the Monday, and asked me if she might sleep with me; I said she might - it was nine o'clock in the evening that I had the conversation with Simmons at the bar of the Crown public-house - I do not know how many persons were there, for I was not in the tap-room; I think there were not above three or four persons at the bar - Simmons said to me, just by the side of the bar, "I have plenty of money, and have done the robbery at the Jews' synagogue; I have nineteen sovereigns, &amp;c." and he produced the half-sovereign - I saw the rest in his hand; he pulled it out of his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not surprised to hear a man, who had robbed the synagogue, tell you about it at the bar of d public-house? A. He was by himself, talking to me at the side; the bar is a good length - I thought it incautious- I did not tell him to put the money back again; I did not get a farthing of it - he offered me 1s., but I would not have it; I had wanted to go home, and leave him on the Sunday, but I could not without going to my sister first, as my brother would not let me come home when I liked; I could not go without somebody with me, after leaving them in that way - I was too dirty to go through the streets on Sunday - I sent to my uncle, who works at the Surrey theatre, before the Thursday, and asked him to lend me 1s., and got my things washed - I did not think it proper to live with the prisoner at all; I was not forced to live with him - I went to live with him willingly, but could not go home when I liked, after running away in the manner I had - I did not think proper to live with him after I knew what he was going to do; he had told me he had learned carpentering and shoemaking, but I did not see him do any work - I never saw him with more than half a crown; I did not like to take the shilling from him, and borrowed it of my uncle -I had gone to my uncle's, and borrowed it on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had the whole of Monday to wash your clothes, and go home? A. No, I had not, for he was at home with Wilkinson on the Monday from ten to four o'clock, and again at half-past six - he went out at ten; I did not go home that night; I do not know why; I heard of a reward on the Monday, when Samuel Davis was taken- Joseph, the brother of Sol, told me of it - Hammond, the officer, was with us then; it was about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, a week after the transaction - I never heard of the reward from Hammond.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you disclose this? A. When they came to me about another robbery, I said it was not the first robbery he had committed, he had robbed the Jews' syngogue - I had no animosity against him; I told him Marks and Hilyard slept in the house, and that Sol Davis slept there: he is related to Marks;

             said the reward was 40l. - I do not except any of it, nor none I want - I would not have it if it were given to me; my mother lives about half a mile from where I lived with Simmons - I am sure it is above a quarter; my gown was dirty and muddy - I had fallen down in the mud; I believe it was on the Saturday night - I had been cleaning all Saturday afternoon, at Mr. Franklyn's, in Bird-street; I did not say a word about the robbery till three days after it happened - I never went by the name of Moses, and never heard myself called so.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to live with him, and cohabited with him some time? A. I went to live with him on the Friday, and left on the Wednesday, when I found he was a thief; I determined instantly to leave him- my evidence is not affected in the slightest degree by the hope of reward - I never had a criminal charge against me- I worked for one mistress three years; I now work for a friend of hers, and have worked for her twelve months.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How do you know that to be the box which was in Simmons' possession? A. By the lable on it - I cannot read; I do not know whether there was a lable on the box which was first shown to me - I know this, because the top was almost out when he had it from me; there was no dispute between me and the prisoner about not having any of the property given me; I never had a dispute with him about money.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he must have stood with the synagogue behind him? A. He did; I saw him quite plain point to the door - I saw his face quite plain; he stood side-ways -I cannot say whether he pointed with the left hand or the right - (the witness here, with her hand, described the manner, in which the prisoner had pointed to the door.)</p>

            . I am a Police-officer, and formerly belonged to Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner Simmons last Sunday fortnight, and Samuel Davis the next day, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I took Simmons on another charge - Seddon was with me at Queen-square, respecting the charge I had apprehended Simmons on, and in consequence of what she told me I apprehended Samuel on this charge - her communication was made to me voluntarily; I attended the examination at the Mansion-house, the first time the phosphorus box was produced - Seddon remained in the room; Mr. Ansell had produced a phosphorus-box - she did not see that before she left the room, to the best of my knowledge - I have a phosphorus-box, that was produced last Thursday - it was produced by the prisoner Simmons; he looked round the office, and wished all the witnesses to withdraw - Seddon and all of them withdrew before he produced the box; he said he wished Seddon to be questioned, if she would not identify the box, as she had one on a former occasion - I cannot say whether this was written down; Seddon came in, and it was shown to her, and then given into my charge - there was no label on it, nor was the head broken in.</p>

               <p>Q. This was last Thursday? A. Yes; a box had been shown to her on the Monday before, before the Lord Mayor - they were not both produced together; I first saw her last Monday fortnight, at Queen-square - I had not sent for her; I beg pardon, I now recollect, on the Sunday night that I apprehended Simmons, Seddon was in company with Mr. Basford, in Richmond-street, Lambeth - he is the prosecutor on another charge; I saw her at Basford's house, about nine o'clock - I had forgotten that before- I first conversed with her on the subject of this robbery, on the Monday morning, at Queen-square; she never told me any thing regarding this robbery on the Sunday night- she never mentioned a word about the synagogue till the Monday morning; no reward has been offered for Basford's robbery - I did not appoint for her to come to Queen-square; she had given Mr. Basford the information; before we went into the office she told me this was not the first robbery he had been concerned in - that he was concerned in a burglary in the Jew's synagogue, in the City; I had not heard of that robbery before she told me the parties who were concerned - this was quite voluntarily, and after the examination she went with me to a variety of public-houses, for Sol Davis, but did not find him; I cannot tell whether Seddon was anxious that he should be taken - she conducted herself properly in giving information; I never heard of her till I found her at Basford's.</p>

             four or five years, and always knew him to be respectable - I do not know what he is, nor where he is; I am certain he is no relation of mine - I do not think I have seen him for a month; he came to my house then; he never lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the four years you have known him, will you give us the name of any place he resided at?</p>
               <p>Witness. Have I a right to answer that question?</p>
               <p>COURT. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Witness. I know once he lived with his father; I do not know why I am to answer questions, that do not concern the business - that was my only reason for asking the question; I cannot give you the exact residence where he did live - I saw him once at his father's, and he might live there; he said he lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he did lodge there? A. No, I saw him at his father's - I have not said that he said he lodged there - you have misunderstood me; when I saw him at his father's he did say he lodged there - I cannot tell you the name of the street where the father lived; I forget what part of the town it was in, whether it was East or West - my memory is rather bad.</p>
               <p>Q. It may be near St. Paul's or near Hyde Park-corner, for what you remember? A. I forget it, Sir - I am sure I forget it; and I forget how long ago it was I saw him at his father's - I do not remember whether it was three months or two years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Consider under what a solemn sanction you are now speaking - do you mean to say your memory is so totally void of retention, that you cannot tell whether it is three years? A. I do not know that it is so long; I think it may be a year ago.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear it might not be three months ago? A. I went to see his father; I only went once in my life - I went because his wife lay ill, and I knew her - his father is living now, but I do not know where; I saw him in the street about a week ago - it was more than a mile from my house that I went to see him; I do not know the name of the street, nor what part of the town it was in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say you went to see a man, whose wife was ill, and you cannot tell what quarter of the town - was it near East Smithfield, or Cheapside, or St. George's in the Fields, or Spitalfields? A. I think it was somewhere near Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You forget about Spitalfields when you were asked about Hyde Park-corner? A. Yes, it was near Spitalfields - I cannot tell the name of the street: the father was at home and Sol - it was day-light; I went with my mother - I am married, and my husband lives with me - I have known Samuel Davis about twelve months; I do not know whether he is related to Sol - I do not mean to swear that; he is a nephew; I have heard say he is a nephew to Sol, not his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do you mean to swear he is not the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060075"></xptr>brother, but the nephew of Sol? A. Yes, I do swear it; I do not know where he lived - he came to see my husband.</p>

            . I live at No. 54, Surrey-street, Blackfriars. The prisoner Simmons lodged at my house, with his father - I let him in at half-past twelve o'clock on Monday night, the 21st of December.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he lodge with you? A. He lodged with his father since he has been from sea - his father has lodged in my house these ten months, in the front room up stairs; they slept, eat, and drank in one room - there are two beds in the room; I saw Simmons, between seven and eight o'clock next morning, washing himself in the yard, as he always did - he had been out late before, but usually came home about ten; I did not go to the Mansion-house - I did not hear of this charge; I asked the father what had become of Edmund, as he did not come to work - he said he was at his sister's; I never heard any thing about the synagogue till last Saturday.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 84. Waterloo-road. I know the witness Hilyard, and have seen her frequently for the last two or three years, and spoken to her - I knew her well, quite as well as I do my own sister; last Thursday night, I saw her at a house which is my own property, No. 36, Herbert's-buildings, where I went for the purpose of trying to get a little rent - while I was asking my tenant's wife for rent which was due, Hilyard came through the kitchen, and went into the yard; she remained there a few minutes, then came back, and sat at the table - she began to cry and stamp her hand on the table, and said, "Oh! my poor chap;" Mrs. Mapp said, "I should recommend you to speak to Mr. Winston;" she said, "I don't know how ever we shall get my chap through it;" I said, "What is the matter?" she said."Oh, they have been into the b - y Jews' chapel;" I said, "What have they got?" she(Hilyard) said."They have got some wedge;" I asked what that was - she said silver, and said she did not know what she was to do, they wanted money; I told them if they would let me see it, I had no money about me, but I could get some - she then burst out crying again, stamped her hand on the table, and said, "Oh, my poor chap. I would not split for one hundred guineas;" she said, the wedge was nigh at hand - I understood her to mean she would not confess upon her paramour, or her young man; she then went into the front parlour, and I saw no more of her - I gave information to the solicitor for the prosecution; the house was searched last night by the officer.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you give information to the solicitor? A. Yesterday; a person in the market had been talking on the business, and I said I thought I could give information - I wanted to get it from her, to purchase it; I thought if I advanced money on it, and placed it in the hand of the inspector of the Police, it might bring the thing to justice - I am not acquainted with Seddon; I have seen her pass my house at night, but do not know how she gets her living.</p>

             re-examined. I live at No. 34, Herbert's-buildings - I never saw the witness, Winston, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. He has stated such circumstances that you cannot but recollect? A. It is all false - I swear I never had any conversation with any body about wedge - I never said, "Oh, my poor chap;" I never used those words in any place - Mrs. Mapp is the landlady; I never had any conversation there on Thursday night with any man - just as I went in doors there was a man coming out, but I never had any conversation with him whatever - I never heard any thing about silver; I never had any silver in that house, or near it, nor knew of any being there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you mention to Mr. Winston the name of your chap? A. I never mentioned any thing of the kind, which he has been saying.</p>

               <p>Mr. WINSTON. She did not mention his name - I have seen her with men, but not with any particular one.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN ELMES. I am turnkey of the County gaol of Surrey. I have a certificate of the former conviction of Simmons - I was present when he was tried, and heard the sentence pronounced upon him; I am positive of his person. (Certificate read.)</p>
               <p>Simmons. I acknowledge that is correct.</p>

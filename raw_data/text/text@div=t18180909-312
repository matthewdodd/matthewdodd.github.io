On the 11th of July, a little after one o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners pass my box - They had nothing with them then. My box is at the corner of Clipstone-street, next to Portland-street. As soon as they had got round my box, two other boys passed - I immediately went round to watch them, as I knew Page before. I lost them all in a moment. I listened sometime, and then heard a talking in the prosecutrix's yard, which is only fenced off by an hedge. I remained there till half-past one o'clock, then went round part of my beat, and returned and listened sometime. I heard something come down heavily, as if somebody had jumped down into the garden - I heard nothing more for sometime. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090098"></xptr>round my beat and called two o'clock; returned, and heard persons talking in the yard. Nobody came out. I waited there, and omitted to call the half-hour, as I thought they might have seen me. I called the hour of three up Carburton-street, and the middle of Norton-street, and returned without finishing my round. When I came to the corner of Carburton-street, I saw two persons come in a direction from the prosecutrix's premises; they were about twenty yards from the house. I drew back and concealed myself, that they might not see me. They came up and passed me; they were each loaded. I followed and asked them what they had? they said Nothing; I desired them to stop and let me see, and laid hold of Turner; he dropped a piece of lead at my feet, which was rolled up. He had another piece and ran away with it. I had taken Page and kept him. I sprung my rattle. Turner was stopped in about five minutes. I am certain he is the man. I found two pieces of lead on Page also, rolled up under his coat. I took them both to the watch-house. I went to the prosecutrix's house that day, and took one piece of lead. I found the balcony partly stripped of its lead. The lead fitted; it appeared fresh cut. I found a knife on Page, which appeared to have cut lead.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The transaction began about one o'clock-Yes. I waited there till three o'clock. I am sure they are the men who passed my box. I stopped them in Cirencester-place, which is two hundred yards from the house. I saw the lead dropped.</p>

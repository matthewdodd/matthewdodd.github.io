               <p>- SOLOMONS sworn. - The prisoner called upon me on the 25th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning; I never saw him before; and asked me if I would buy any duplicates of him; I told him, I never buy any dupicates, I must see the goods before I buy them; he must take them out first; he said he could not do that, because he wanted money; he left me the duplicates, and after he was gone a few minutes, he turned back and asked me how long it would be before he could have an answer what he could get for the goods, when I should redeem them; I told him he might call in the afternoon, I should send for the goods; I asked him if they were his own property, he said yes, they were; he came about four o'clock, and I told him my daughter was gone for them, and if he would come in again about seven, I would be there; my daughter came back, and said the duplicates had been stopped; the next morning the prisoner came about seven o'clock, and I detained him.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up these duplicates, wrapped up in a piece of blue paper, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was a very large morocco pocket-book, as big as a bible; it contained papers of very great value to me, and two protested notes; the loss of them has been the ruin of me.</p>

On the 27th February last, about a quarter before seven in the evening, the prisoner and another person with her came into my shop and enquired for some French cambrics.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed, did you think it necessary to follow them - A. Yes, and before they got out of St. Paul's church yard, they were joined by a woman who was standing outside, I followed them as far as a dozen doors down Cheapside, they then stopped and held a parley. I passed them and went on the opposite side of the way to see what they would be after; just as I got across they parted, and the two that was in my shop went into Mr. Giesler's the furrier. I crossed over and passed the shop, and the third person was looking in the shop door. I immediately ran home, put on my great coat and a silk handkerchief round my neck, because they should not know me; when I returned to Mr. Giesler's shop, I found the third person was still standing there; the prisoner and another woman was in the shop, and just as I crossed over the third person opened the door and went in. I immediately crossed again and took her station and looked in the shop, I saw the prisoner at the bar sitting on a stool, the others were standing up. I immediately saw her stoop down and pull up her petticoats as high as her knee, and apparently put something up her petticoats, but I could not see what; she then pulled off her patten and put it on the counter, and attempted to tie it; I thought I see her put something up again; she then stood up and they came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. All three. - A. No; the prisoner and another woman; when they came out of the shop, I fell back towards St. Paul's church yard, I followed them but a few steps before I saw the end of the tippet hanging down between her legs, I ran after her and caught hold of it and pulled it down, and down came another along with it. I immediately got hold of her arm, I said you have stole the tippets. I called to several gentlemen going past to stop the other person, they did not, I took her into Mr. Giesler's shop. I shewed them the tippets, I marked them and delivered them to the constable.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home, it was a very wet night. I had my pattens on as I was passing this door, I thought my patten felt very heavy. I thought it was full of dirt of the street, I went to stoop down to knock the dirt out of my pattens, that gentleman laid hold of me and dragged me into the shop. I know no more of it than a child unborn.</p>

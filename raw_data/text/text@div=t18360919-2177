                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police-Sergeant C</hi> 7.) I was on duty in Piccadilly at seven o'clock last Tuesday evening. I saw the prisoner Connor standing against the area-railing, in front of No. 80, which is next door to the Duke of St. Alban's—as I got near to him I heard a noise in the area, as I sup<lb></lb>posed—I looked down, and saw a man's head, as if gliding away to avoid sight—I remarked to Connor, that in all probability it was a cat—he said, something in an under tone that I could not exactly understand—I thought it was not that he knew of—I waited till Sheen came up, and gave Connor into custody—I then saw Hayes come up the area steps—I ordered him over the gate—he climbed over, and I took him directly, and took him to the station-house—I went down, and found twenty-five feet of leaden pipe, together with a hammer and a knife—it appeared to have been re<lb></lb>cently hammered and cut—there appears to have a pipe to run along the bottom of the area—this pipe corresponded exactly with the piece that remained—when they were at the station-house nothing passed between them that I heard—a knife and two keys were found on Connor.</p>

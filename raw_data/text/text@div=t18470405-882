                  </hi> I am a clerk in the Alliance Assurance-office, and live at No. 16, Stonefield-street, Liverpool-road, Islington. About five o'clock on Monday evening, the 22nd of March, I was in King William-street—a horse had fallen down in the street—I stopped to look at it, and perceived a pressure at my waistcoat pocket, as if of some one wrenching—I noticed the prisoner near there—he was in front of me—he passed round, and appeared to be holding out his hand as if passing something to another per<lb></lb>son, who leaned forward as if receiving something from him, and they ran through the crowd—I was not able to discern his features—he said words to the purport of "Here it is," as he passed it to his companion—he was stand<lb></lb>ing before me when I felt the pressure—I seized hold of him by his arm, and charged him with having my watch—he denied it—it was while I had hold of one of his arms that he appeared as if passing something—I felt as if something was wrenched from me—the man who appeared to receive some<lb></lb>thing from the prisoner ran through the crowd and got off.</p>

               <p>RICHARD VAUGHAN. I live in Windmill-street, and deal in waste ivory. The prisoner, Laing came to me, and said he had a lot of ivory to sell, and if I would meet him at the New Inn, in Tottenham-court-road, at ten o'clock the next morning, I should see it. I went, and the prisoner, Gibbs, came to me there, and asked me if I was looking for a tall young man, dressed in blue? I said, Yes. He told me he could shew me the articles, and took me to the corner of Norton-street - Grindley opened the door. They took me up stairs, and shewed me the ivory, which was in the wainscot between the first and second floors-it appeared like a cupboard - I should not have thought of finding any thing there; it was s secret place. They shewed me about a hundred weight of ivory-Grindley and Gibbs only were present. I bought 23lbs. at 2s. per pound - They brought it to my house. Next morning they brought 90lbs. more, which I said I would sell for them, if I could - I bought 50lbs. of it; the remainder was taken away. Grindley and Laing brought it, and I paid them for it by a little at a time. The prosecutor saw it about a week afterwards, and claimed what I had left of it.</p>

Grindley sent to me from Newgate, I went to him - He said he was starving, and asked me to pay him the remainder, I refused - He said I should get no good by it. I did not know them before.

            . I am an ivory-turner, and live in Bowling-green-lane, Clerkenwell. Grindley and Laing came to me, and said they had some ivory to sell. I asked them what business they were? they said they were cabinet-makers. They brought about 40lbs. down that evening. I questioned them how they came by it? they at last said they were commissioned to sell it, and gave different accounts. I said, it did not appear that they came honestly by it, but if they would bring the proprietor, I would buy it. They never came again.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Adam and Eve-court, Oxford-street. On the 30th of November I met the prisoner, Laing, and another man, in Berwick-street - I knew him before. He said a friend of his had got some ivory to sell. I told him to call on me the next morning, which he did, and said it belonged to his friend's mother. I said I wanted a little. He asked if Mr. Langfield (who is my master), would buy any. He said he had sold some to Kinsman and Vaughan, but his friend's mother was very ill, and wanted ready money for it - I told him my master would give him ready money. He took me to Marylebone-street to see it. Just as I got to the door, I met Grindley; he said it was his mother's house, but she was in the country. Laing left me. Grindley shewed me four pieces of ivory, which weigbed about 60lbs. I bought about three-quarters of a pound of him for 2s.6d. I recommended him to Laban to sell some.</p>

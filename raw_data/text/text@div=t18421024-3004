                  </hi>. I am a widow, living in Palace-place. Great Scotland-yard, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields—it is my dwelling-house—I let my first-floor. On the 30th of August the prisoner came and looked at the apartments, approved of them, and said he would bring a friend to see them—he called next day, and we told him the rent was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—he did not object to it—I asked him for his card—he apologised</p>

               <p>for not having his card-case that day, but pulled out a bill of Exchange, which he said was for 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he wished to get cashed by Lord Forres<lb></lb>ter—he gave me the name of Baron Amill Kollor, attache to the embassy of Prince Esterhazy—he called next day, and on my entering the drawing<lb></lb>room I found him examining my liqueur-case—he rose, and said he should feel great confidence in taking my apartments, as he had seen Lord For<lb></lb>rester, who he understood had known my husband—he admired my liqueur-case very much—I said I had been trying to dispose of it—he said he should like to become the purchaser, and asked the price—I said, "20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said he should not object to give me a cheque for the liqueur-case, and also pay me one month in advance, on getting this bill cashed by Lord Forrester—upon going into the parlour, it happened that my jewel-case was there—he took up two diamond rings and a pin, and said, "You have something very beautiful here, I suppose you would not be disposed to part with these?"—I said, "Not both the rings, but I should not object to part with one, and also the pin"—he said, would I allow him to shew them to Lord Forrester—I allowed him to do so—at that time nothing had been said about the price, or buying them—he said he should return at seven o'clock with Lord Forrester, who would satisfy me as to the reference, and be would pay the rent in advance, and also for the liqueur-case, when his lordship had cashed this bill—he returned at seven o'clock alone, and said his lordship was not able to come, but he returned supposing I might be uneasy, as I had trusted the pin and rings in his charge—he seemed con<lb></lb>fused, and wished to know if I would go as far as the Wyndham Club House with him, as his lordship was dining there, and as he had promised to cash the bill, I should have the price of my liqueur-case and the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance—I said I should most certainly wish to have my rings returned—I took the prisoner to be a gentleman—I went as far as the door of the club-house, in St. James's-square, with him—I did not see him go in—it is very easy to <hi rend="italic">whip</hi> round the corner into the other street—I waited nearly two hours—he did not return—I made enquiries and went home—the next day I saw the real Baron—he was nothing like the prisoner—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation—I went somewhere down by Westminster—these are my rings and pin—they are worth from 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never sold or parted with them to him, on any condition.</p>

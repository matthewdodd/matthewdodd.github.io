I endeavoured to seize the hand that kept the watch, I was afraid that she was going to drop it on the flags; I had not a moment to spare. By her halloaing out a man came up, I was hussled about by him. I secured her. I said my good girl you shall not part with me till I give you into custody. I took her to the corner of Hart-street, there I saw a watchman coming towards me, I gave her in custody; she struggled, but it was useless; I brought her to the watchhouse in Covent-garden along with the watchman; he had one arm and I the other. When she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260011"></xptr>came into the watchhouse; the constable of the night searched both her pockets and her bosom. I told him I suspected that she had not my watch, I thought the accomplice took it from her because I was dashed against a pile of bricks against the box door of the theatre, under the piazzas. The constable found no watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man - A. He vanished from me. I never let the prisoner go till I gave her into the charge of the watchman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This was at one o'clock at night - A. It wanted twenty five minutes to two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober - A. I drank a little; I was hearty and perfectly sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many women under the piazzas, were there not - A. I did not see one; I was not with her two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that she held you in a manner that you could not extricate yourself - A. No; not till she pulled my watch out with her left hand, and slung it behind her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time she took your watch she had only one arm on you - A. When I was first seized she had both her arms round me; she disengaged one of her arms to take the watch from me; I secured her when I missed the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when you first spoke to her was there a man in company with her - A. No; nor woman neither.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman came up, I ask you upon your oath, did you say one word to him about any man assisting her. Did not you mention it first at Bow-street, and not at the watchhouse - A. Her accomplice came up and hustled me, and then it was he look the watch from her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that after the officer took her in custody she was searched for the purpose of examining whether she had the watch or no - A. Truly.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, what was that done for, if you knew at the time that the man took the watch from her - A. I was quite sensible after the hustle she had lost the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were it not at Bow-street the next day you stated that the man assisted her and took away the watch - A. I stated at Bow-street that her accomplice came up, and I suspected that the accomplice had taken the watch from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was at Bow-street and not at the watch-house, the first time you mentioned it - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been spending the evening - A. I had been on a party of pleasure; we had two pots of beer; we went up in a boat to Wandsworth.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never seen the watch from that time to this - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge you may depend on it. This man was speaking to three women under the piazzas; he left them and came to me; I had not been with him three minutes before he said you have my watch. There were some people followed us, but I did not know them; he never mentioned at the watchhouse that I had an accomplice.</p>

On the 7th of November the prisoner went with me from Layton to town; I received at Mr. Oliver's, in Kingsland-road, about twelve o'clock in the day, a paper bag of silver, also a parcel of halfpence and soap; I was to take them to Mr. Fraser - I put them into a basket in my cart, and covered the horse-cloth over it; I was going home - the money was safe when I was at the Castle, at Clapton: the prisoner was with me all the time, but did not get into the cart after we had the money- he walked behind the cart, and I by my horse; he got on the hind part of the cart in <placeName id="t18291203-14-crimeloc74">Hackney-road</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you give him a ride? A. No: I knew him before, but the load was heavy - we both rode going, but not returning; I did not give him any of the property - he might have rode four miles in the cart.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th, about a quarter-past three o'clock in the morning, coming down Black Horse-court, with a girl on each arm; I found on him a bag, containing 12l. 4s. 6d. in crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, and in his pocket 3s. 6d., with a bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>RICHARD OLIVER. I am a grocer. I received a cheque from Fraser on the 7th of November, and gave Bearsford 14l. 4s. in silver, half a cwt. of soap, and 3l. in copper - there were three crowns, about 5l. in half-crowns, 2l. in shillings, and the rest in sixpences; this is the bag, and this bill of parcels with the soap and account of the money was in it.</p>
               <p>FINLAY FRASER. I sent Bearsford for this money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did he tell you he had a stranger riding in his cart? A. He told me he suspected the prisoner had it, and that he rode with him to London, but not back.</p>

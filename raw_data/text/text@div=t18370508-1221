                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Queen-street, May-fair, on the 13th of April, about half-past ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner carrying a bundle—I asked what he had got, and what he was going to do with it—he seemed rather confused, and made no answer—I then asked where he got it from—he wished me to go to Little Pulteney-street—he said a man gave it him to carry, but he did not know where to—I took him to the station, and found in the bundle a table-cloth, and four napkins—made inquiries, and found whose it was.</p>

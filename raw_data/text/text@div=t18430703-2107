                  </hi>. I am a cattle salesman. I was in Smith field-market on Friday, the 9th of June, and had five wether sheep for sale—the prisoner came and bargained for them—it is the custom if the sheep are not paid for at the close of the market, they are generally locked up till they are paid for—the party purchasing them is expected to pay the money at the banker's where the sheep are entered—he is informed where that bank is—on paying the money for them into the bank he receives an order for the delivery of them—the pri<lb></lb>soner has never paid me for the sheep—I had never seen him before that day to my recollection—at the close of the market, the sheep not being paid for, were locked up in Turner and Clark's yard—I came to town again on the Monday—I saw the prisoner again, on the following Friday, in the market—he bar<lb></lb>gained for seven sheep and five lambs—he did not pay for them—he was afterwards driving them away and I stopped him—in consequence of that I sent my man to inquire about the five sheep I had sold him the week before, and from information I received, I took him with me to Turner's yard, and he was apprehended that day.</p>

On Friday the 9th of June, I took five sheep to Clark's yars—the prisoner went to the bottom of the yard with me—he said he had purchased these sheep, and wanted me to drive them down to Mr. Oliver's, who is a butcher, and I should have something to drink—I drove them out of Clark's yard, but not to Oliver's:—I had not received in<lb></lb>structions from my master where to drive them—I saw the prisoner again on the Monday—Mr. Clark showed me this order—I saw it produced to the prisoner on the Friday after, and he said it was his writing, and that he had sold four sheep to Mr. Buckope, and one to Mr. Oliver.</p>

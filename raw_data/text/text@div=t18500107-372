                  </hi>. I am a stationer at Blackheath-hill, in the parish of St. Alphage, Greenwich; sometimes it is called Greenwich parish. On 10th Dec., I shut up my shop at ten minutes past ten—a back door leads from the passage into the yard—I shut that and latched it, and pushed the bolt, but am not sure it went into the socket—if it was not bolted, any one could open it from the outside by lifting up the latch—the back parlour window was shut—I came down next morning about twenty minutes past seven, and found the back door, and back parlour window open—there was a desk in the parlour, where there was copper money the day before to the value of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., done up in newspaper placards in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packages, and there were three 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packages of farthings—the prisoner James was in the service of my next door neighbour—I believe all these packets of coppers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, and I can swear to one.</p>

On the day before Good Friday I sent my child out to where his father was working, between twelve and one o'clock in the day—he was dressed in a corduroy jacket and trowsers, nearly new, and a handkerchief—he did not return till a quarter to six o'clock in the afternoon—the jacket and handkerchief were then gone.</p>

On the afternoon of the day before Good Friday, I was standing at the corner of Black horse-passage, waiting for a female friend coming out of Shoreditch poor-house—I saw the prisoner, she had hold of a child by its hand, who had a corduroy suit on, and a kind of red pinafore, and a handkerchief round its neck—she was dragging it along, and the child was crying—this is the child—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—she took it, and set it on the rail in Black-horse-passage—she said she would cut its head off if it did not leave off crying—I said, "Whose child is that?—she said, her brother's, and she was going to take it to her mother—she took it down Black-horse-passage, and in about two</p>

On Sunday, 6th Aug., I was on duty in Battersea Fields—there was a fair there—I saw the prisoner there with a convicted thief—they went behind a gentleman, and he put his hand to the bottom of his pocket, but got nothing there, they then went up to where there was a weighing-machine, and a number of people round it—the prisoner put his hand into Bird's pocket, and took out this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "Have you lost anything?"—he put his hand into bis pocket, and said, "I have lost my handkerchief"—I took the prisoner—he had one corner of the hand<lb></lb>kerchief in his hand—Bird claimed it, and went with us—on the way to the station we went along a bank in the fields, twelve or fourteen feet high—the prisoner said to Bird, "Pray, let me go"—he said, "No"—the prisoner</p>

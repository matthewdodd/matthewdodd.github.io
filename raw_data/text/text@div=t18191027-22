On Saturday, the 24th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I gave her my trunk to take to Mr. Hill's, who is a glover, and lives at No. 8, Cockspur-street, as the Brighton coach was to take me up there. On Monday she returned about six o'clock, and said she had delivered it at the private door of No. 8. I asked her who took it in? She said a young gentleman. The box was directed with my name as a passenger to Brighton; it contained the articles stated in the indictment, which were worth 20 l. at the least. On Monday I went there to go by the coach, and Mr. Hill asked me for the trunk; I said I had sent it on Saturday. I found that it had not taken been there - Mr. Hill's son was the only person in the house. In consequence of this I did not go to Brighton, but went in search of the prisoner; I got a warrant. She was taken on the 15th of October on another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270014"></xptr>charge; I found her at Queen-square office. I have seen my two brooches since in the possession of the pawnbroker - I have recovered nothing else.</p>

            . I live with my father in Cockspur-street; no other young gentleman lives in the house. On Saturday, the 24th of July, no trunk whatever was delivered that I know of - none was delivered to me. There are ten people in the house, but my father and myself are the only men - the prisoner did not come to the house. When Mrs. Byerly came, enquiry was made for the trunk, but none could be found; my mother was going to Brighton with her.</p>

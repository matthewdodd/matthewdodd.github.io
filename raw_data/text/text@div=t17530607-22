            . I am a watchman, and as I was going for a draught of beer I saw a man in Pear-tree alley, right against the gun, and heard some half-pence scatter on the ground: I said, friend you are full of money, I'll help you to pick it up; he said he could pick it up himself. As soon as I heard his voice I knew him, he had lately drawn beer at the black dog in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you find him from the prosecutor's house?</p>
               <p>Godson. It is about ten yards distance : he said he was going to carry this money to his mistress's summer-house at Hogsdon, there lay a bundle by him: then he said, the goods and money were his own, and that he was going to the Parrot in the Land of Promise, so I said, I'll see where you go. We went till we pass'd the Parrot, then I seized him and told him I believed he had committed a robbery: he said, indeed so I have, at a house near the Carlisle, that he had broke into the house at one o'clock, that he heard the clock strike while he was in the house. The bundle produced in court, being the things mentioned in the indictment, and depos'd to by the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Cardigan in Wales. On a Friday, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon I met the prisoner in Smithfield—I am sure he is the man—I spoke to him first—I had just come home from abroad, and I thought I knew him in Wales, previous to my going abroad—went up to him and asked him if he was a Welchman—he said, "What makes you think that?"—I said, "I think you are," and pre<lb></lb>posed to go and have some drink—I had five sovereigns in my purse when I went in—we had some gin—I cannot say how much—I was not drunk—I changed a sovereign, and we had three or four half-pints—I had pulled the other sovereign out—we took a walk, and went into a house in Hol<lb></lb>born to have some more gin, and then we went into a house in Fleet-street and had some drink—I was getting rather tipsy and asked for a bed—the landlord said I could have one—I had the four sovereigns then—I had a double-bedded room there—I went into a bed by myself, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—the prisoner was in the room with me—he went to the other bed—I went to sleep, and left my money in my trowsers pocket on the pillow of my bed, and between twelve and one o'clock some person came in and awoke me, and asked me if my money was gone, and it was—the prisoner was there then.</p>

                  </hi>. I superintend the carding engine at Messrs Christys', and I had the care of the wool—the prisoner was employed there under me—he had access to the wool there—this is a mixture of wool and coney wool—it is German wool and rabbit wool—Messrs. Christys' had such wool in use constantly—this is red wool, South American wool—they had some of that sort—this other is mixed German wool in a prepared state, they had some of that—this other is a sample of mixed English wool, washed but not carded—they had such as that—we are constantly exporting it—it is quite wet from the washing—this is a mixture of German wool, and three torts of rabbits' fur, which is a mixture I believe no other house in the trade uses—I never heard of any house keeping it in a similar way—this is used in low priced hats, a hat of about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have been with Messrs. Christys' twenty-two years, and about twenty years in this depart<lb></lb>ment—looking at the whole of this wool I have not the least doubt but that is their property—the name of the firm is William Miller Christy, and others.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Christys it it purchased in the market—it first comes to my hands, I deliver it to the washers, and they to the carders—there are three washers—Brooks and five boys are the carders—it should then come to me—it is dressed and placed in the premises—this sort is taken from the carding room to a build<lb></lb>ing opposite, and weighed out into the bodies of hats, or sent away in the bulk—as soon as it is discharged from the carding engine it is put into use—we have no particular repository for it before it is put into use.</p>

I came to town on the 1st of August, and went to lodge at John Smith's, who keeps a lodging-house—I stopped in the house five days, till I lost my money—I went there two days after I came from on board the ship—I had ten sovereigns, three half-sovereings, and three shillings—the prisoner was in the house—I had never seen him before—he asked me if I could lend him a couple of shillings, as he had lost a ship—I said I would look by and by, and see if I could give him a dinner—as soon as I had my dinner I went to sleep—I had my money safe in my waistcoat pocket—when I awoke it was gone, and the prisoner was gone out of the house—when I went to sleep the prisoner and Mr. Smith were in the room—the money was taken out of my pocket while I was asleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Valentine and Orson public-house, Long-lane, in the parish of Bermondsey. I have a cellar, the door of which is outside the premises—it is usually secured by four bolts inside. On the 26th of Nov., at ten o'clock at night, I saw that door bolted safe—I went to bed about a quarter before eleven—about two o'clock a constable's rattle awoke me—I got up, went to the door, went into the cellar, and found a board forced off the door from the outside, that would enable a person without to draw baek the bolts, and let themselves in—none of my property was stolen—getting into the cellar would enable the parties to get into the house—I afterwards went to the station, and saw the prisoners in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 277.) On the night of the 26th of Nov., a few minutes before two o'clock, I was near the prosecutor's house—I heard a rustling, like some person treading on coal, in a lane that runs down the side of the prosecutor's house—I went and found a piece of board about nine inches wide, had been wrenched off the prosecutor's cellar-door by some instrument—I looked down into the cellar, and perceived a faint light on the wall, and in a minute or two I heard footsteps faintly inside, and whispering—I went for assistance, and got police-constable M 51—on coming back to the cellar-door they had a light inside—I heard them whispering quite plainly, and called to them to come out several times—the light was suddenly extinguished, and the prisoner Green made a spring through the broken door, and tried to escape—I seized him—he struggled with me a great deal—he did not succeed in getting from me—I sprang my rattle—police-constable M 195 came up, and assisted to secure Green—while doing so he called to me that another man was coming from the cellar—Green was still struggling with us—I did not myself see Anderson come out of the cellar, but I took him as he was then rising off his feet from the pavement, about a yard from the cellar-door—we took them both to the station—I found some lucifer matches on Anderson.</p>

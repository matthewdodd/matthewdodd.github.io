               <p>SAMUEL OUTRAM BACON. I live in York-place, City-road. On the 17th of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was in <placeName id="t18261207-6-crimeloc36">Fore-street</placeName>

            . I am a constable of the City. On the 17th of August I was in Fore-street, and saw the prisoner with Grainger in company, who was tried here in September; I saw them together, close behind Mr. Bacon - I watched them, and at the corner of Aldermanbury-postern, the prisoner took the handkerchief, and went towards Aldermanbury with it - Grainger crossed over into Moor-lane, and the prisoner went into Moor-lane with him- they went up a passage in the lane, and I saw him give it to Grainger - they looked round, saw me, and then separated in different directions - I laid hold of Grainger, and took the handkerchief from his pocket - I had seen him put it there; I took him with me into Basinghall-street, and Mr. Bacon claimed it - I afterwards found the prisoner in the House of Correction, and took him into custody, when he was liberated from there, on the 10th of November - I am certain of his person; I knew him well before; I found but one handkerchief on Grainger.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I assure you I am entirely innocent - I have been brought up to reverence the laws of God and my country - I entreat you to look well to the evidence, and hope you will remember the paths of youth are slippery.</p>

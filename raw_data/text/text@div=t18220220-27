               <p>"Take care of your watch, Sir." I took hold of my watch-chain, pushed the prisoner away, and I think she fell down - the blow I received knocked my hat off, I picked it up, felt for my brooch, and it was gone; I ran to fetch the watchman, I noticed the prisoner had a scar under her nose I found a watchman in St. Martin's-lane, and told him the girls were coming round a corner into St. Martin's-lane - I seized the prisoner and gave her in charge, I am sure she is the woman, she was secured in three minutes. My brooch was found by Jones; the other girl escaped as soon as the prisoner was seized. On the Sunday following, Jones's father came to me, and said his son had found the brooch, and he had pawned it for 2 s.; the Magistrate ordered it to be delivered to me.</p>

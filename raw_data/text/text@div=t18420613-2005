About fire mi<lb></lb>nutes before one o'clock, on the morning of the 6th of June, I was coming out of a public-house—the prisoner was in the house—as I passed through the persons who were collected there with him, the prisoner raised his left arm, and with his left hand pulled the pin out of my scarf—it was a large gold pin, with turquoise stones, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw him pass something with his left hand to a female who stood on his right—she did not go away—I do not know what became of her—I went to the door, called a policeman, and about a second or so after I charged him with the robbery, the people of the house opened the door, and allowed the pri<lb></lb>soner and three or four more to go away—I followed the prisoner, and gave him in charge—his companions went away without waiting to see what was to be done to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the trade warden in Pentonville prison—there is a ward there in which trades are taught to the convicts. On 9th Oct the prisoner was in confinement in the prison under sentence—on that day he was in the trade ward—he was learning the trade of a shoemaker—he was provided with a set of tools such as are used by shoemakers, a knife, a rasp, a seat, a file, a hammer, pincers, nippers, and rubber—on 9th Oct. I observed the prisoner do something which was contrary to the rules of the prison—he was turning, in order to speak to other prisoners while at exercise in the rope yard—he nodded his head to speak to other prisoners—the rules of the prison with regard to speaking to other prisoners were per<lb></lb>fectly well known to him—they were read to him on the first day of his admission, and they are read once a month during the time they are in the prison—he can read them himself, he is a first class prisoner and able to do so—they have a copy of the rules hanging inside the cell doors—I did not speak to the prisoner about this at the time, but I gave orders to another warder who was there to send the prisoner to his cell—next morning I reported what I had seen to the governor, that was my duty—the prisoner was taken before the governor at a quarter past 9 o'clock in 'the morning; was present—the governor said it was bad conduct, and he should punish him for so doing, and he ordered me to open the door to send him to his cell again—no punishment was ordered at that time—he works at his trade in his cell—the prisoners have bells in their cells, and as they ring them a number projects from the wall, so that you can see which prisoner wants yon—about 20 minutes past 12 o'clock I heard the prisoner's bell ring—I went to his cell and opened the door, but did not go in—he said he wanted a sole for the shoe which he was then making, as the sole he had got was not large enough—I told him I would go and get a sole for him, as I had not one with me at that time—I went away, and returned in about two minutes—I went into his cell and picked the shoe up off his seat, and the sole as well—he liad thrown the sole on the floor for me to pick it up, when was there before, but I would not stoop to pick it up for him—I then took the shoe to go and get a sole for it, and as I was leaving the cell with my face outwards, the prisoner came behind me and struck me in the left shoulder—I turned round and said, "26, you have struck me; I shall report you in the morning for this occurrence"—he then sprang on me, caught me round the upper part of the muscles of the arm and wrestled with me to try to throw me down—I had the use of my arm, and the shoe in my hand with the last in it, and I struck him over the head three or four times till he released me from his hold—he then took a pair of claws, which are tools used for closing, brought them across his shoulder, and said, "You b——, I will knock your brains out for you"—I then retreated baok<lb></lb>wards</p>

               <p>wards out of the cell and shut the door after me—I called out for the assistance of warder Laffan—he came on the third time of my calling, but previous to his coming, I felt a severe pain in my shoulder every time I breathed—I told him that 26 had struck me, he said, "Good God! there is a knife sticking in your shoulder now"—and he pulled the knife from my shoulder—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I gave this knife to the prisoner it was nearly as wide at the point as it is at the end, it was only a piece of a knife without a handle, used for scraping the bottom of the shoes—he has sharpened it and placed a handle to it—the handle belongs to a seat file which I have here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—the knife has been sharpened at both sides and at the point and filed down at the back—I gave it to him on the 4th—there had been no angry words between the prisoner and me before this, no further than my reporting him for being idle and neglecting his work—I never told him of it, it was not my duty to do so—he knew I should report him, by sending him in from the yard on the previous day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon at Pentonville prison. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of 10th Oct. I saw Bevan—I found him bleeding from a wound in the back—I examined it—it was a punctured wound, about half an inch in width, with a direction downwards and outwards, just above the blade bone, and from the symptoms shown by the warder afterwards, I ascertained that the knife had penetrated the chest and wounded the lungs—the wound was of a dangerous character; it was just above the blade bone, on the left side, between the blade bone and the spine, about two inches and a half from the central line of the back—it had reached the Iung—the bkde is about three inches long—I did not expect that two inches oould have reached the lung, hut it had done so, for he spat blood as he went home, which blood would only have occurred from the lung having been wounded—it must have been done with considerable force.</p>

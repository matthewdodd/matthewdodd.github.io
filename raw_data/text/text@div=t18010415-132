             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am in the service of Messrs. North and Company: In consequence of information that we received, I marked some stick liquorice; I saw two sticks of stick liquroice, and four bags of stone blue, in Mr. North's stable; Jewell was sent out with his cart: immediately upon his being gone, I went to see if the stick liquorice was there or not, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this? - A. On the 4th of March, from four to five o'clock; I then followed the prisoner up Ludgate-hill as fast as I could, till I got to <placeName id="t18010415-132-crimeloc738">St. Paul's Church Yard</placeName>

               <p>Q. Has one of those pieces of Spanish juice any mark upon it? - A. Yes; there is an R upon one of them; I asked Brettell how he came by it, and he said Jewell gave it him; I then asked Jewell how he came by it, and he said he had taken it from his master's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garney. Q. What did you say to him before he said that? - A. Nothing more than I have stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he took it out of his master's warehouse, or that he found it in the stable? - A. To the best of my recollection, he positively said he had taken it out of the warehouse.</p>

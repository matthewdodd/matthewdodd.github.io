               <p>I was robbed the 9th of November last at the bottom of Queen-street; six men came down Queen-street and pushed at me, and one of them run against me, and drew my watch out of my pocket; it was a silver watch, with a steel chain, and two glass seals and a metal key; the prisoners were two of the men.</p>

               <p>How long were they coming up to you and pushing you at the time they took your watch; how much time did it take up? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a long time; they might have done it in much less time I should think; will you venture to swear, that in the course of a quarter of an hour, when they were shoving you about, that you can swear to their persons so as to know them again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You will positively swear, that they are two of the six men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe which of the six it was that pulled your watch out of your pocket? - Yes; I caught hold of him; it was the prisoner M'Carty, the man in the blue jacket; the first time I caught hold of him I got the watch from him.</p>
               <p>Was the other man with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to assist him at the time? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Master Harman, this was on Lord Mayor's day, and in Queen-street, near the Three Crowns? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of course there were a great many more idle people looking on besides you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And on such occasions every body was shoving here and there, and so on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is a part of the fun of the day to push and shove, and throw dead cats, and make it as inconvenient as possible? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the shoving was the common shoving that happens on those occasions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And in the midst of the shoving you lost your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This probably was a new sight to you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>In plain English he is, and has been, for several years past, a common thief-taker; when was it you and Freeman talked this matter over? - Last night in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>So I thought; what was it that Freeman said to you last night in the Old Bailey? - He did not say any thing at all; he said I should be here to day.</p>
               <p>And he told you to swear there had been a good deal of shoving about? - No; he did not.</p>
               <p>When did Freeman tell you, that if you swore there was some shoving, that would get two forty's? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>Do you know there is any reward? - No; I do not know there is any reward.</p>
               <p>You never heard it? - I did hear it.</p>
               <p>Who was it told you? - Several people.</p>
               <p>Who are they? - Those that were with me in the publick house in Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>And they told you, though you lost your watch, if there was no force and no shoving about, there would be no reward; but if there was, there would? - They did not say so.</p>
               <p>What did they say? - They said, if you are sure of the men, I did say, I am sure of one of the men that took the watch from me; then they said, I should consider about it; and I should not swear any thing more than what was true; that was the thief-taker.</p>

               <p>I want to know who it was that told you, that if you convicted these two men of a highway robbery, you should have your share of two forty pounds rewards? - There were a great number of people.</p>
               <p>Pray Sir, did Freeman never tell you that in your life? - He said nothing yesterday only, he said I must come to-day here and I should get the trial.</p>
               <p>That is, if you would be sure of the men, and if you would swear that they shoved you? - No.</p>
               <p>Speak the honest truth; has not Freeman told you, if you swore that these men shoved you about, you would have the reward? - No; he never said any such thing to me, only to be here to-day.</p>

               <p>Recollect yourself, was it not Jacob Freeman who wrote down the instructions for the indictment? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that nobody wrote down the instructions; look at these honest gentlemen, and give your answer? - I do not know any of these gentlemen; I do not know who was writing.</p>
               <p>Did nobody, Sir, for that was what you swore just now; who wrote down the instructions? - I do not remember.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What have you in your hand? - A watch which was picked off the ground, the bottom of Queen-street, on Lord Mayor's day last; I saw it picked up, a labouring man picked it up, that was standing close by; I do not know his name, he did not mention his name at the time; but some how or other his directions were lost.</p>
               <p>Has that watch been in your possession ever since? - Yes, it is in the same state it was when I received it.</p>
               <p>(The watch shewn to the prosecutor and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know it by the seals; there is no particular mark on the watch itself; there is a blue glass in one, and a green glass in the other; on the blue seal there are three lions, and on the other side there is a man; and on the other, there is a freemason's seal; I lost that day such a watch, and such a chain, and such seals; I swear they are the same that was taken out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>When the prisoner M'Carty, according to your account, had taken the watch out of your pocket, what became of it? - He took it out, and I saw it hang in his hand; he gave the watch through his right hand, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120048"></xptr>the prisoner Hartman; afterwards it was found on the ground.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards was it taken up? - It was found directly; I do not know who it was that found it.</p>
               <p>From whom did you receive it, Mr. Freeman? - Freeman. As I had hold of the prisoner Hartman, I heard the watch drop; I could not stoop myself, therefore another hand picked it up; the prosecutor had the other fast, and the prisoner Hartman's hand was clinched; the moment Roberts laid hold of him on one side, I laid hold of him on the other; at that moment the watch dropped and the glass broke; I did not see M'Carty; I know nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Roberts is another thief-taker? - I do not know what he is; I am a constable.</p>
               <p>He belongs to the insurance office in the city? - He certainly is a thief-taker, because he took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Which of the shops do you belong to? - I am constable to his

             the Duke of Bedford; I belong to the public office in Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>Then you are the common runner of an office? - Yes, Sir, I am a constable.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a runner belonging to that office? - Two years and a half.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, you have had no conversation with the prosecutor, Mr. Harman, about any reward? - No.</p>
               <p>This man is not forthcoming that picked up the watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any body gave any instructions for this indictment? - I gave the instructions; we were all together; I gave the instructions to the clerk, and he took it.</p>
               <p>In writing? - In writing.</p>
               <p>Who wrote it? - I believe Roberts wrote it; I am not sure whether I wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>For a highway robbery? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>I dare say, as you are only a late constable, since May last, you know nothing about rewards? - Yes, I do very well; I know this, that in case the men are convicted, the county certainly are to pay that sum.</p>
               <p>And you are to have your share of that sum? - Most undoubtedly; I know no other way of doing it but as a capital offence.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - Yes, I do swear so.</p>
               <p>How often have you attended here? - I have attended here, I suppose these four or five years.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know, if these men are only convicted of stealing without force, it would not be capital, and there will be no reward? - I saw the force, I told my Lord Mayor so, and I put my hand up to my breast at the time; that I have sworn to-day is the same; if the men were to be acquitted of the force, there would be no reward; but I saw the force committed: I do not come here to talk about the reward, I come here to speak the truth of the robbery; I know this, that if I indict a person, I should indict him the right way.</p>
               <p>I desire an answer to my question; do not you know that, if these men were not indicted for a highway robbery, there would be no reward? - No, to be sure there would not.</p>
               <p>If they were indicted for a simple larceny there would not? - No, not for ten-pence.</p>
               <p>Ten-pence! what do you mean by ten-pence? - Did not you say simple larceny.</p>
               <p>I did not say perit larceny; now Mr. Freeman, if he was indicted for privately stealing, there would be no reward? - I saw the robbery committed.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTS sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 9th of November I was going down to the bottom of Queen-street; there was a mob of people assembled together, and I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner contending with each other; I asked what was the matter; and the prosecutor immediately, said, he had lost his watch; I immediately pulled Hartman out of the crowd; Freeman came and assisted; and we took him up to a public-house; the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120049"></xptr>followed us, and said it was his watch; I did not see the watch taken up; I did not see the other prisoner there; he was taken before the Lord Mayor, and the prosecutor swore positively to him; he said he was not the man who took the watch out of his pocket; but it was another man shorter than him; and he should know the man if he saw him; and that the man who took it, gave it to Hartman, and that Hartman dropped it as soon as he saw me; this was said in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Court. These men seem to be pretty much of the same size; now, did you see the other man in company with Hartman at this time? - No, I did not; when I saw Hartman, I knew him for some time; I did not look for any body else; I am a person employed by the proprietors of the General Insurance Office, in Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there a great croud? - A great many people there; the first that I observed, that I knew, was Hartman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Roberts, Which of the fire offices do you belong to? - Neither.</p>
               <p>Which office was it that you was talking of? - The General Insurance Office; it is made pretty public now, No. 102, Bank-buildings.</p>
               <p>What are you talking of; do you mean that that is advertised? - Mr. Weller is the proprietor of it, I believe.</p>
               <p>What is your department in that office; treasurer or paymaster? - No, Sir, to apprehend people that commit robberies.</p>
               <p>In plain English, a thief-taker. I suppose the best part of your emolument is the reward? - No, I have a weekly salary; I have heard of the reward as well as other thief-takers; I was employed at Bow-street four or five years ago; I have not been in that capacity for these two years past.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, if you turn your eyes round, you may see some people that knew you at Bow-street: how happened you to quit Bow-street? - I believe it was about a mob or riot that happened at the handsome milliner's in Coventry-street; there was another person of the name of Roberts, and I were there at the same time.</p>
               <p>So you was dismissed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of you wrote the instructions for the bill of indictment? - One Threadway wrote them: I have never talked of the reward to any body.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with Freeman about the reward? - No, not respecting the reward; but we have been speaking about whether they would be convicted.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you never talked to Freeman about the reward? - Yes I do mean to say that never a word but about the apprehending the men; I told the prosecutor no more than I tell the court.</p>
               <p>Have you never had any talk with him about 80 l.? - I do not know that I have; I never said any thing about what he was to say; I told him that if in case he applied to the Court for his expences, I dared say they would allow it him; I never told him of 80 l. I will swear I never talked to Freeman about the reward; I have told him there are rewards paid.</p>
               <p>What reward did you tell him? - I told hiw in case a man was convicted of a highway robbery, there would be a reward of 40 l.</p>
               <p>When did you say that? - I cannot say, I might have told him such a thing, but not about these two men, but I will not swear positively; I might.</p>

               <p>I was not at the place; I had no shoes on that day.</p>

               <p>I had no work, and I went to see the shew, and a parcel of men shoved me against this man.</p>

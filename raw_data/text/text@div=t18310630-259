On the 3rd of May, at half-past three o'clock, I was in Wentworth-street; I saw the prisoner come out of George-yard, carrying a blue bundle - he looked aslant two or three times, then turned to the left and walked gradually on; three or four of his companions came to him and asked how he got on - he went to No. 55, Wentworth-street, where he was taken into custody - the end of Wentworth-street goes into Osborne-street; I saw a horse and chaise - there was a lady in it; in about ten minutes I saw Mr.

             talking to the lady sitting in the chaise - he then went to Lambeth-street; he did not go to the house I saw the prisoner go into, but to the office; he complained of the loss of a blue bundle, and I went with Healy to the house in Wentworth-street, that I had seen the prisoner go into - Healy entered the house, and came out with the prisoner; that was about three quarters of an hour after I saw the prisoner go in with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you search the house in Wentworth-street? A. No; I did not go in- I had not known the prisoner before; I am sure I am not mistaken in his person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This money would have been more safe in your pocket? A. Yes; the man ran with his back towards me, but he turned his face two or three times - I did not say I could not swear to the prisoner; I said it was a very serious thing to swear to a man, but I had no doubt upon my mind - I only meant that there was a possibility of a doubt.</p>

            . On the 3rd of May I went with Kingston to No. 55, Wentworth-street - I went into the house, and inquired below who was up stairs; they said a woman who lay in, and that was all - this was about four o'clock in the afternoon; I looked through the crack of a door, and saw two persons lying in bed - I went in, turned down the bed, and found the prisoner in bed with a female - he had all his clothes and his shoes on, and so had the female; they had both been under the clothes - I brought the prisoner down stairs, and asked Kingston to look at him - the prisoner said he was in bed in consequence of his shirt being washed; he had no shirt on - I had got from Kingston a description of the man I was in search of, and the prisoner's appearance corresponded with that; I took the prisoner up to Whitechapel - I had another with me, and as we were going up the passage of the office Mr. Braduack pointed to the prisoner, and said, "That is the man;" I said, "You must be very particular, it is a very serious thing;" he walked up and down the passage two or three times, looked at the prisoner again, and said, "I am confident that is the man;" he persisted in asserting that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I dare say the gentleman described him as a man without a shirt? A. No, Sir; the prosecutor said that it was a serious thing to swear to a man, and so did I - the prisoner went with us to Whitechapel, in custody; I cannot say whether it had struck four o'clock - it was a short time after the prosecutor alleged he had lost his bundle - I searched the house, but found nothing belonging to the prosecutor; the woman who was in bed was Elizabeth Hall, I believe - she was taken and discharged.</p>

            . I keep a shop for my mother, at the corner of George-yard, in Wentworth-street.

It is a dangerous place, I might have been knocked down - I saw no one about; my life would not have been safe - if there had been any Policemen about I would have tried to have stopped him, but it would have been madness without; I think it was between two and three o'clock - there were two or three men round the gig; I knew them by sight - the first thing I saw was the man who took the bundle made some remark to the gentleman in the gig, as it stood at the Two Brewers - the streetkeeper was going by, and he ran past me; he watched the street-keeper past, and then went and took the bundle - he passed me, and ran down George-yard.</p>

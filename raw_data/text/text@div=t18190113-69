            . I am servant to Mr. Lambert, Jewry-street. I saw the prisoner lurking about the cart, then saw him go and take the coat out. I went to see for the driver - he came out - I told him. The prisoner went towards Rosemary-lane. I went for an officer, but could not get one. Williams and I followed, and saw the prisoner coming out of a court leading to Rosemary-lane with two others; one of whom I saw lurking about with him, and was with him when he took it. Immediately as they saw us, I heard them say to each other,</p>
               <p>"separate." They parted. The prisoner walked a little way - I took him. I am sure he is the man - I knew him before.</p>

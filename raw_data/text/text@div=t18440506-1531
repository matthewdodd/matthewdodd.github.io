I came to London to receive some money—I called on a Mr. Braham, who told me to call again at four o'clock—I went to a beer-shop—the prisoner came there in about five minutes—I told him where I had got to call at four o'clock—he said he had got some business to do at half-past three, and we might as well spend our time together till then—we went round to Charing-cross, and <hi rend="italic">to</hi> a beer-shop there, and saw a man named Jones, who said if any man could show him money like his, he would give them 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to carry to the poor of the parish, but he would not give it except they could show money like his—we then went to a public-house—a pot of beer was called for—the prisoner pulled out a note, and showed it to Jones—he said to me, "Pull out your money"—I said I had only got 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I showed them that, and at four o'clock I went back with them to Chancery-lane—we went into a public-house, and had a pot of beer—the prisoner went out for a short time, and when he came back I went to Mr. Braham, and received a check—when I came back the prisoner said, "You can convince the squire," and I showed them the check—Jones said, "That is not gold and notes like mine"—we then went over Blackfriars-bridge to a public-honse, had a pot of beer, and then to the Half Moon, in the Borough, and had a pot of beer there—Jones then left us, and said he must go and tell his lawyer where he was going to be till nine o'clock—the prisoner was there then—Jones came back, and spent the evening till near nine o'clock—he then left, and gave the prisoner 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for us to spend in</p>

            . I am a comb-maker. On the 26th of June I was in the City-road, and saw Mr. Perkes there - I heard a cry of Stop thief! went into the middle of the road, twenty or thirty yards from Perkes, and saw the prisoner running away, and another in his company - I saw the prisoner drop the handkerchief, which I picked up; I continued the pursuit, and he was stopped by a City officer - I showed the handkerchief of Perkes, who claimed it.</p>

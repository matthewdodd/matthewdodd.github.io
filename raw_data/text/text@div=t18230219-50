            . At Christmas last, I lived at Milton, in Barking, and was going to move to Barnet, and sent by the Woburn waggon, ten boxes, and a small cask of wine, on the 13th of January, and on Thursday morning, the 16th, I went to the Bull, public-house, at Whetstone, in consequence of what I had heard, and found one box missing it contained wearing apparel; they were numbered from No. 1, to 11. I missed No. 5 - Jarvis shewed me some pieces of things cut up at Whetstone, which I believe to be part of my goods. I got a warrant in consequence of this, and searched Mardell's house at Whetstone, and found eight of my neck handkerchiefs, with the marks at the corner cut off, and the corner rounded at the end, but not hemmed, and found other articles of mine there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did not you tell him, he might as well tell where he got them - A. No. We went there about a fortnight after the 16th of January.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What size was the box - A. Three feet long - one person could carry it; but the others were too large.</p>

Mr. Brunton came about them at seven o'clock; I then examined the stable door, and found the staple of the lock had been drawn, and a package taken. I gave the key to Baker when I went to bed.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Pancras. On Wednesday, the 29th of January, I went with a search warrant to Mardell's, with Mr. Brunton - he lodged on the first floor, and was at dinner with his wife. I found some fancy trimming, and in an unfurnished room below, which was locked up, I found eight handkerchiefs with the corners cut off. Mardell's wife gave me the key of the room; I found nothing else there. Mardell denied all knowledge of it, or how they got into his possession. I neither held out threat or promise - I said I thought he might save me a great deal of trouble if he would say where the rest of the property was; he still insisted he knew nothing of it - I asked him for the key of his stable, knowing he was an hostler; he said that was of no consequence. I said unless he gave it to me, I should break the door open, and search it - he then said he would go, and fetch the remaining part of the property; he left the room - I followed him very close; he unlocked the stable door, and went up a ladder into a loft, I followed. He got into a large corn bin, about three quarters full of corn, and handed me out a large bundle, consisting of some bombazeens, a plated cruet frame, and several articles of wearing apparel. I asked if that was all, he said, Yes - I searched myself, and found a smaller bundle. I took him into custody, and asked where he got the things; he made no reply then, but afterwards said he had them from Louse Jack, (meaning Baldock.) I then went and apprehended Challis, the hostler, and then to a cottage at Barnet, rented by

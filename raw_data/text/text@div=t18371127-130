                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper, and live in John-street, and am married. On Saturday night, the 11th of November, I was in King David-lane, and met this young woman, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and she made free with me—she asked me to go home with her, and she took this money from my waistcoat pocket in the discourse—I went down opposite the Crooked Billet, and passed up the back lane—it was on my way home—I was a little tipsy, and she flattered me, and enticed me there—she laid hold of my arm—we stopped talking there a while, and she took 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, and three duplicates—I had nothing to do with her—she talked about my going to a house, and I would not—I lost four half-crowns and one shilling—I did not get it back—the policeman found the tickets and money on her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received the prisoner from the prosecutor on the morning of the 12th, in Shadwell High-street—I asked her what she had done with the duplicates and money—she said the man was mistaken; she never saw him before—I saw she was uneasy, and I took her to the station, and found three duplicates, four half-crowns, five pence, and two halfpence—she said to the sergeant, "That is not all his money."</p>

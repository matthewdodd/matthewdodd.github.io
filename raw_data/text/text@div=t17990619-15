            .(The case was opened by Mr. Alley.)</p>
               <p>ROBERT JOHNSTONE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you robbed on the 17th of May? - A. On Friday the 17th of May, I was walking down the Strand, about one o'clock, and just as I was crossing <placeName id="t17990619-15-crimeloc85">Hungerford-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17990619-15-crimeloc85" type="placeName" value="Hungerford-street"></interp>

There were two gentlemen present, whom I never saw before, and who attend here to prove the fact.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time was this? - A. It was, to be certain, between the hours of twelve and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that in Church-court there were no other persons walking up and down? - A. I mean to say there was no other person near the prisoner and I when I accused him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had the pocket-book? - A.Upwards of six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark that you know it by? - A.There is a memorandom in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in it at the time? - A. I presume it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it? - A. I am pretty certain it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Having had it six months, it is a little the worse for wear-is it worth more than eight-pence, or ten-pence? - A. The notes are worth a hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Independent of the notes? - A. I think it is worth a shilling.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see the book in the prisoner's possession? - A. I did, I saw him drop it; he dropped it in this manner, (describing it); I recovered all my property.</p>

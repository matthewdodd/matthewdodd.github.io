             handed me the bundles, and I was going over the way to lodge them, and the girl was following me all the time, and said, they were her property, she knew what she was about, I said, she should not have them till the fire was put out, I went over to assist at the fire, and when I returned, I found the girl had got one of the bundles out of the house, she had one of them in her cloak coming out, I asked what she was going to do with the bundle, she said, it was her property; then the watchman came up and said, he would take her to the Compter, if she did not put down the bundle, then she put it down.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do with the bundles? - After the fire was extinguished we went to get a pint of purl, after running about in the wet, and it being a very severe night; and we went over to Mr. Burridge's, and he sent his servant over for the bundles; they were the same bundles.</p>
               <p>Where did the fire appear to have begun? - In the box where they go into the back door, round the side of the shop where the linen was; the floor was burnt; I did not go down into the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your house at any time in the night? - Yes, the 27th, about a quarter after three.</p>
               <p>You was in bed I suppose? - I went to bed about nine, she knocked at the door as hard as ever she could, I went and asked who was there, says she, for God's sake let me in, I am almost froze to death, my master's house is all burnt down; says I where does your master live; I knew the girl, but had not seen her for two years and better; she followed me up stairs and took hold of my coat; I struck a light, and saw a little handkerchief in her hand; I said what have you got there; says she it is some of my master's property, and you will take care of it; I said what is there in the handkerchief, I saw one watch at the corner of a buckle; I left the handkerchief on the table, and ordered my wife to take care of it, and not let the girl go out of the house; I said I will see whether the house is burnt down, and I went out to see whether there was a fire; I knocked at the door several times, and somebody made answer within, the fire is all out, let nobody in but friends and neighbours; I locked my door and took the key with me; when I went down, I heard this young woman say, you can see whether she has been in bed or no, and somebody went down stairs; I went back again and taxed the girl about it, and she cried and would not speak; I told her I believed she was a very bad girl, and my wife made her strip herself stark naked; she had a white cloak and a white apron, and a bonnet with a ticket on it, and under that white apron there was a black apron that she worked in; so they stripped her, and put a sheet round her, and she lay for two hours; I afterwards brought her down to her master's bringing her down about two hundred yards, pray says she, Mr. Baker, for God's sake do not take these things home to my mistress, for she will kill me, but either them or make away with them.</p>
               <p>Court. What was in the handkerchief? - I do not know at that time; she then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140101"></xptr> cried out, oh, Mrs. Spriggs has ruined me; what, says I, she has been persuading you to do this I suppose; aye, says she, she has these six months past; going along I asked her concerning this Mrs. Spriggs; she told me the first thing she had Mrs. Spriggs before this time was childrens caps, and after that she said she could never get shut of her, for if she did not give her something else she would tell her mistress; she said she gave her oranges, and what they call lollipops I believe, something which the Jews sell.

               <p>Burridge. This handkerchief contains buckles which were in my own bed room, and three silver watches which were in my glass-case, they are mine, I am quite sure of them.</p>

               <p>Them watches were in my master's window, and I took them out because they should not be burnt; my mistress often flogged me; and if it had not been for my master my mistress would have been transported. My mistress made me steal six ducks, and she burnt the ducks in the fire afterwards, and fowls and a young pig she made me steal. My mistress has made me steal money from my master.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Where did you get this girl from? - From Shoreditch; these watches are all from my own room.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you miss these watches before the fire or after the fire? - Not till I went up stairs.</p>

            , The circumstances of your case are such, that the Court cannot pronounce sentence upon you, without taking some notice of them. Young as you are, you appear to have arrived to a degree of wickedness, that renders you an unworthy member of society, and likely to become very dangerous to it; and notwithstanding your tender years, if you had been capitally convicted, it is hardly probable that your Sovereign would have thought fit to have extended his mercy to you; you were not only guilty of robbing your master and mistress from time to time, aggravated as that crime always is by breach of trust, but of the much more heinous crime of setting fire to their house, and endeavouring not only by that to destroy their property, but their lives. There appears therefore to be no hopes of your ever making a safe or useful member of society, at least in this country, the laws of which you have attrociously violated; but not having been convicted of a capital offence, the Court can only sentence you to be <rs id="t17840114-66-punish361" type="punishmentDescription">

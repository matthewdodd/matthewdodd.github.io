                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Cobden, and live at No. 12, Alpha-road, Regent's-park. On Thursday, the 7th of March, I left No. 73, Newman-street, where I was staying, and went to Oxford-street, about twelve o'clock in the day—I had a purse in the pocket of my dress, containing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a sovereign and a half, and some silver—I returned to Newman-street, some little time before half-past twelve, and shortly after missed my purse and money—this is the purse—I think the bank-note in it is the same—mine was divided like this.</p>

               <p>I saw Hood place his hand against a lady's pocket—they turned back,-and followed the lady, who was going towards Tottenham-court-road—Hood walked by her side, and Mathie about a yard behind him—when they got a few yards past the Princess's Theatre, I saw Hood place his hand underneath the lady's pocket, which was in front of her dress, put it into her pocket, and draw out this purse, which he handed to Mathie, who was about a yard be<lb></lb>hind him—Mathie put it into his pocket, and both ran away as fast as they could, towards Tottenham-court-road—I followed and took them into cus<lb></lb>tody, at the corner of Berners-street, and said, "Halloo, my lads, I have got you this time"—after conveying them about 200 yards, Mathie drew the purse from his pocket, and dropped it on the ground—I called on a gentleman who was near, to hold him while I picked up the purse—he ran away about three<lb></lb>parts across the road—I never lost sight of him—the gentleman stopped him and brought him back—I took them to the station, and found the purse con<lb></lb>tained this note and money—I found 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver on Mathie, and on Hood this whistle, this knife, three halfpence and a comb.</p>

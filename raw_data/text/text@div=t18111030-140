            , her husband, was employed by me as a journeyman lady's shoe maker. I settled with him every Friday night, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How much could she earn a week. - A. Twelve shillings upon an average. On the 4th of October, I paid the prisoner one pound sixteen shillings and threepence, upon her coming in the usual way, and presenting the book I paid her. She takes the book up stairs to my foreman, his name is Young, he signs the book, and I pay upon that signature. She brings the husband's book, and always came and took the money for the husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any means of knowing that this is not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300065"></xptr>the husband's making out, and his writing - A. No, I have not. This is the book that she presented to me, I supposing it all to be right paid the money; the bills have been made out in the same hand-writing for three years. This largest book is the book she brought me. I never saw the book my foreman signed and made out until she was apprehended; this book has my foreman's signature, it is fourteen shillings and twopence; that is the book she should have presented to me; but upon presenting to me this book, twenty pair making and binding, one pound sixteen shillings and threepence; I paid her that sum.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. M'Laren. The prisoner came to me on the 4th of October to make out a list of her husband's work; I made it and signed to no more than fourteen shillings and two-pence, that is the wages of the week for ten pair. The other book is a forgery.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence; called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

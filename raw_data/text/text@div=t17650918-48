            . I was coming from Kensington about three in the morning, on the 14th of July, and saw two men under the Park-wall, about an hundred yards distant; the other man ran away: the prisoner came to me, and said he was troubled with the gripes, and wanted me to let him have some milk; I having no measure with me, could not let him have any. He went to the other end of the dunghill to case himself; I had seen him put two baskets down: he walked farther off, I went and saw there were eight ducks, seven pigeons, and two cocks in the baskets; I took the baskets from where he had hid them, and carried them into the middle of the road. I sent a boy for my fellow-servant; the prisoner stood and peeped, to see what I did with them: when my fellow-servant came, he ran away, and we after him, took him, and brought him back, and secured him.</p>

               <p>As to the things I am innocent; I saw them in the road; I went by them, and picked them up; I thought I had as much right to pick them up as another man: I had been about half a mile out farther that morning, to take a walk; I am a soldier.</p>

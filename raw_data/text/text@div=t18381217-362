                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Jones, a pawnbroker in Holborn. The prisoner, Ellen Morris, came to me on the 27th of October, and offered this watch in pledge—I asked her whose it was, she said her husband's, that her name was Williams, and she lived in Parker-street, her husband was a plumber and painter, and worked in the Strand—she did not give what I considered a satisfactory account, and I went for an officer—as I returned I saw the prisoner, Francis Morris, waiting outside—and on my going in at the side-door, he called the woman out—I directed the officer to follow and take her—she had left the watch behind her—I then went to the George-street station, and took the watch—the inspector told me to send the watch to the gentleman at Mile-end, as there was some little difference in the description, and the gentleman would know it—(I had received notice of it)—the prisoner, Francis Morris, said he had bought the watch, and given 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and an old metal watch in exchange for it—he is a policeman, and had his police uniform on, and his great coat buttoned up close.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of police. I re<lb></lb>ceived information respecting the stealing of this watch—the prisoner, Francis Morris, came to the station-house of his own accord—he was dressed as a policeman in his uniform—he inquired whether we had a female in custody on suspicion of having stolen a watch—(the watch was supposed to have been stolen in the K or Mile-End division, which was the prisoner's own division)—I asked him how be came to know any thing of it—he said, early in the morning he had sent the female, who was his wife, to pledge the watch in Holborn, and finding she did not return, he started from home to look for her, and passing through Middle Row, he met a female friend, who told him she had been taken to the station-house on suspicion of having stolen the watch—he said that on Thursday morning, the 25th of November, he had been to a public-house in Mile<lb></lb>end-road, where he met a person with whom he had exchanged a metal watch of his own, and had given 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that one—he stated that there was only the watch, without any ribbon or appendage attached to it—he said he was married, and I asked him where, he said, in Ireland—in consequence of what he said, I said I should detain him—I then sent for the prisoner Ellen Morris into the charge-room, and asked her what her husband was—she said, "a painter and glazier"—I said, "Is he not in the police?"—she then burst into tears, and said, "He is—I know nothing of the watch—I never saw it till this morning"—I found the key of the watch at the prisoner Francis Morris's lodgings.</p>

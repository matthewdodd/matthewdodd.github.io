I was about to cross the road, when the prisoner came up close to me - he looked at me, and I looked at him; he snatched a reticule from my hand, and ran down Sutton-street; my brother followed him - he was brought back to me in about five minutes. I believe it to have been the prisoner.</p>

            . I was with my sister, and had hold of her harm - she was crossing the street. I did not notice any person come near her; but when she said she had lost her reticule, I saw the prisoner run by me. I pursued him to the first turning in Sutton-street - he was then stopped - I had not lost sight of him - I saw the reticule in his hand as he was running; and when he was stopped I saw it just at his heels. I picked it up, and gave it to my sister.</p>

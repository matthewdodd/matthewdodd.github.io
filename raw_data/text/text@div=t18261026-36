            . I am a marshal of the City, I traced a note into the prisoner's possession, and on the 29th of August apprehended him; I applied at the house between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, to know if he was at home; they said, No, he was out of town, and would be absent a fortnight - I afterwards returned, and said, I had a warrant, and must search - I found him in bed; we were waiting some time for his brother, who was in bed in the first floor back room; I heard the window thrown up, and immediately afterwards heard something fall from the window of that room; I went into the yard, and found this miniature-frame tied up in brown paper. I produce a 10l. Bank note, No. 9786, dated the 7th of December, 1825, with the name"Drury, 17th of August, 1826," written on it.</p>

The prisoner was brought to the watch-house at half-past eleven o'clock; I heard a pair of trousers had been found on him, and I asked him if he had anything else; he said he had not - I searched him and found a flash-note for 50l. in his pocket-book, and this pair of trousers in his hat; he said, he had had them washed at No. 3. Union-street - I took him there, and the woman said to him, "You need not wink at me; I neither know you nor the trousers;" he said, he had belonged to the Willing Maid - there is a collier of that name.</p>

I was standing in my master's office, at the corner of Savoy-street; I saw the prisoner with the coats across his arm - Ford took them off his arm, and sent for an officer; the prisoner attempted to get off; I said he should not - he struck and kicked me very violently till the officer came up.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Matthew Flint—we carry on business as mercers, at No. 63, Blackfriars-road, in the parish of Christ-church—it is our dwelling-house—we have no back-entrance, but our premises reach to the back of the premises which face Collingwood-street—Mr. Davies's premises are in Collingwood-street, and our premises abut on Mr. Davies's—on the night of the 13th of June I left my pre<lb></lb>mises all secure by locking the door and taking the key to my bed-room—next morning, about half-past six, I received some information from my maid-servant—I went down stairs very quickly—there is a door which leads from the house-part of my premises to the shop—I had seen that door secure before I went to bed, fastened by a lock, and in the morning I found that door was broken open—the box of the lock appeared to have been forced—very many things in the shop were in confusion, and I missed silks, ribbons, handkerchiefs, and dresses, and a number of other things—the value of all the property missing was from 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is a door by which we can go from the back part of our house into the yard—I found that door open—it had been opened from the inside—there is a window looking into the back yard—that had been up at night, and was down in the morning—there is no fastening to it—I know it was pushed full up the night before, when I locked the back door—on going into the yard I found a rope ladder, which was attached at top to my neighbour's rafters, and at the bottom attached to my dust-bin by some gimlets, and at the foot of that ladder there was a quantity of papers,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184207040124"></xptr>
               <p>which had covered my silks and goods the night before—there were two pieces of wood to the ladder to keep the ropes apart—a person could go by that to Mr. Davies's, across a roof, and get into his yard, and then through a door into Collingwood-street, without going through any house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 31.) On Tuesday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 14th of June, I went to the prosecutor's premises, and saw the rope-ladder in the yard—this is it—I should think it is fourteen or fifteen feet long—it was placed up against Mr. Davies's premises, which adjoin Mr. Naylor's yard, and from Mr. Davies's yard you could get to Colling<lb></lb>wood-street—I received information, and went into the New Cut—I saw Brown and Mason, and another person in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Cole was driving it—I assisted another officer to take them to the Tower-street station—the other man has since been discharged—on the following morning, (Wed<lb></lb>nesday,) in consequence of information, I went with Cuddy to No. 19, Wellington-place—Cuddy there took possession of a number of pieces of wood which were in a cupboard down stairs, and some clothes from a drawer—a woman who called herself Mrs. Brown, was there—I did not know her personally—I afterwards saw her at the examination as Mrs. Brown—Brown knew her—she came to the office while he was in cos<lb></lb>tody—three of the witnesses were asked if they knew her—I do not know that she spoke to Brown—Brown claimed the clothes that were found in the drawer, as his, at one of the examinations.</p>
               <p>

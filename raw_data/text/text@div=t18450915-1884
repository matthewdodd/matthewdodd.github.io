                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Clay Hall public-house, at Old Ford. It is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Mary, Stratford, Bow—the prisoner used to be pccasionally at my house—Mr. Spring has a bed-room at my house—on Monday the 28th of July, about eleven or twelve o'clock at night, I went outside the house to fasten the garden gate, and saw a glimmering light in Mr. Spring's room—I knew there had no business to be a light there at that time, and felt alarmed—I went in-doors and alarmed my sister and Mr. Spring—they went up stairs—I went to the foot of the stairs, and there stopped—I saw the prisoner coming down the stairs—I asked him what he was doing there, or what he was about—he said he wanted to go to the water-closet—I said, "Have you not been into Mr. Spring's room?—he said, "Yes, Mr. Spring sent me—with that I allowed him to pass, supposing all to be right, on his way to the water-closet at the back of the house—I saw him no more till he was apprehended—he could not get from the back of the premises without getting over a wall or a high railing—I afterwards went into Mr. Spring's room with Mr. Spring and my sister—I discovered a strong smell of burning, and a good deal of smoke in the room—I then looked about the room, and perceived different parts of the ashes of paper</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, lodging with Mr. Hulme. On Saturday, the 26th of July, I had a sum of money for the purpose of paying my men—on the Monday, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I put some of the notes into my writing-desk—there were eight 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, seven in one place, and one was folded in an envelope, and put under some papers, for the purpose of paying a bill—I afterwards went to Sydenham—I returned about eleven on the Monday night—I then went to my desk, and placed four sovereigns on the seven notes—they were then safe, exactly as I had left them in the morning—I locked my desk, and came down stairs—I had also a pair of gold shirt-pins, in a piece of paper, there—I did not see them in the evening—I did not look for them—there was another desk in the room, containing a silver hunting-watch—the key was in that desk—I saw that safe about eight o'clock on the Monday morning, not afterwards—I did not see the prisoner that night—I had seen him in the morning about half-past eleven—he then said he was going to work at Mr. Adams's factory, at Fairfield, in the afternoon, and asked if I would lend him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would pay me at the end of the week—he said he owed Mr. Hulme a few shillings, and he had no doubt he would allow him to keep on to the end of the week—in consequence of something I heard from Gardener, I thought it necessary to lock my room door in the early part of Monday—I saw nothing more of the prisoner till he was apprehended—I did not send him to my room that night, nor at any part of the day.</p>

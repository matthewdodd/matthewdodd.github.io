               <p>Court. You got pretty drunk? - I had been a little tosticated, and just seemed to slumber with my head a little on the table, one man came and seized me, and took my gold, and threw my papers under the table, the prisoner took my gold, one came and took my money, and the other held me up till he took all my money out of my pocket, and threw all my papers under the table, I was sensible, but not capable of guarding myself, the woman of the house took the papers up, and one of the men threw a guinea into the woman's hands, I knew the man, and was in his company for some time, I was as sober when he came into my company at first, as ever I was in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was not the woman? - No, she had no concerns with it, she knew the men, and gave them an idea that I had this money about me, I received this money in Bread-street, and I met this woman in <placeName id="t17830910-68-crimeloc388">Bread-street</placeName>

               <p>The prisoner has employed a set of villains to use me ill, so that I walk in danger of my life, I am in the silk manufactory, I live in Frying-pan-alley, I was in some part of the house when the three men were there, there was Fielding, Palmer, and Cosgrave, they were all three drinking together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was one of the company.</p>
               <p>Newton. They were all three in the box drinking together, Fielding, and Palmer, and Cosgrave, and the woman during the time she was there was on the opposite side of the table; some time after they had sat drinking together, Fielding comes and sits on the other side of Cosgrave, after they had set some time, the woman went away; after the woman was gone, the prisoner got under the table, and was there some time, he then came and sat close by Cosgrave, who was then between the prisoner and Fielding; in that situation they remained when I left the house, but before that I heard Fielding say to Palmer that the sailor had more than twenty guineas in his pocket, I then left the house, and on the next day, Saturday, coming through Frying-pan-alley, I saw the prisoner and his wife fighting, he was bleeding, I heard the woman say, you rogue give me the six guineas you had of the sailor, which you gave me last night and took away again, he said she should not have them, I went to the publick-house and met the prosecutor, and he had taken Fielding who is now absent, he said he had taken one of the men, I told him he had got the wrong man, he went back with me, and the woman then was down upon the prisoner, striving to get the money out of his pocket, the prosecutor immediately went into the house, as soon as he got into the house, several of the whores and bullies, and such like people, rushed upon the prosecutor and rescued the prisoner, I took the prisoner twice myself and they rescued him; when I took him the second time he was sitting in a publick-house in Bunhill-row, I told him he should go with me, he desired me to come into the yard, he then acknowledged he had twelve guineas of the man's money, and that he had given the other man three, he then offered me two guineas and the change that was in the publick-house, if I would excuse him.</p>
               <p>What did you say to induce him to make this acknowledgment? - It was his own voluntary offer, I said nothing at all to him.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him it would be better for him, or that perhaps he would be excused?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100107"></xptr> - I said nothing to him, he begged I would excuse him, I told him, I would fetch the sailor to him, and I went to Mr. Wilmot's, I neither made him promise nor threatening, the Justice sent a headborough and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are you sure you had twenty-three guineas and seven shillings in your pocket, when you first went into the public house, and seated yourself in the box? - Yes, I was quite solid when I went in, I was just what you may call merry, I am positive on it, I was plundered of it before I came out.</p>

               <p>Did you see any body creep under the table at any time? - I was the greatest part of the time out of the room.</p>

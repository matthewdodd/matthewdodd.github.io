            . I live in Vale-street, Camberwell. I was in St. Paul's church-yard, and saw the prosecutor and a gentleman walking before me, and the prisoners walking behind them; I was standing talking to a gentleman, and saw one of them stoop and take up the tail of the prosecutor's coat; he put his hand into the pocket, and I saw him draw something out, which I believe was a handkerchief - I ran and told the gentleman; he stopped one of them in Canon-alley - I saw them both in the watch-house in a few minutes, and am certain of them. I am a sugar-refiner.</p>

I was in St. Paul's church-yard, with Mr. Trueman; Brunatti informed me Mr. Trueman's pocket was picked, and pointed up Canon-alley - I immediately looked, and there was nobody in the court but the prisoners - Mr. Trueman took Birch, and I secured Jones in a court between Paternoster-row and Newgate-street; I saw him drop the handkerchief - a boy standing by took it up and gave it to me; he said nothing; I said, "This is the boy who has got the handkerchief;" Trueman immediately let go of Birch, and seized Jones - Birch immediately ran off as hard as he could, but was secured; I have no doubt of him.

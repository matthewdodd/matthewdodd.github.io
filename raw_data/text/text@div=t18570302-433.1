                  </hi>. I was an inspector of the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> division of police. On 31st Feb., from directions I received from the authorities of the Mint, I went to Castle-buildings, Bermondsey, about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning, accompanied by inspector Bryant, and other officers; the street door was fastened, I broke it open with a sledge hammer, and on entering saw the male prisoner coming down stairs with the side of a bedstead in his hand—he called out loudly, "Emma!"—I rushed in, and a scuffle ensued at the bottom of the stairs, which, I believe, was intended to prevent our going up—I pushed him into the yard, and he was seized by inspector Bryant, and sergeant Brannan—I left a constable outside in case anything was thrown out of the window, rushed up stairs, and found Evans, a policeman, pulling the female prisoner from the fire, and pushing her on the bed as she was stamping on these pieces of plaster of Paris mould (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was a clear bright fire, and a number of counterfeit shillings on it, three of which I picked off, two partly burnt, and I saw several melt, which I could not succeed in getting—there was a ladle on the fire containing fused white metal—I also found this counterfeit florin, and this file with white metal in the teeth—in a cupboard in the room I found this galvanic bat<lb></lb>tery in action, and a jar confining solution, a portion of which I preserved; also a number of bottles containing acid, and all the implements for making and coating counterfeit coin—here is a piece of tin with plaster of Paris adhering to it, as if a mould had been made on it; it was more visible then, it has been rubbed—I also found some wet sand, which is used to scour the coin, and some plaster of Paris for making moulds.</p>

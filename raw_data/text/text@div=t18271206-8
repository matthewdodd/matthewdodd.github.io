            . I have belonged to the Police many years, but am now suspended, having met with an accident. On the 9th of November I was standing about thirty yards from the end of Fleet-market, when the Lord Mayour's procession was going by; the prisoner rushed by me, to two of his companions, and I heard him say to them, "I have done it;" they directly, in a whispering manner, said,"Get out of the crowd;" I followed him out of the crowd, laid hold of him at the end of the market, and said, "What have you done, young chap?" I put my hand into his side pocket, and took out this snuff-box, and then took out a pair of scissars - he said, "You have no right to take the scissars, they really do belong to me;" I did not see Mr. Greenfield till the Tuesday - a friend of his, who knew the box, happened to be in the office, and Mr. Greenfield came and claimed it. The prisoner told me, as I was going to the Compter, that he had picked it up in the kennel on the bridge; it was quite clean; his companious disappeared the moment I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>MR. GREENFIELD. I am quite certain this is my box; it was in my outside coat pocket, and could not have fallen out; I was not on the bridge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming over Blackfriars'-bridge, and saw the box in the kennel - I picked it up, wiped it with my handkerchief, and put it into my breast pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Howland-street, Fitzroy-square, and have lived there seven years. The prisoner, Aitkin, has been in my service three years and a half—when I reduced my estab<lb></lb>lishment, she left for two or three months, and then returned—she left of her own accord, then called and said she regretted it, and I took her again—she was in my employ when I discovered the robbery—the prisoner Gibb is her mother—Aitkin used to go out for a holiday about once a month—she might have gone out oftener without my knowledge—about the 17th of October, I was arranging my plate, and missed ten tea-spoons, and some large forks and spoons—I called Aitkin up immediately, and said, "Ann, I have lost some of my plate"—she said, "Impossible"—I said "It is gone: go down stairs, and think, and then come back and answer me"—she went down, and after some time I rang the bell for her, and said to her, "If you will restore my plate, I shall keep you in my house; how<lb></lb>ever own it to me"—she afterwards gave me two forks and a table<lb></lb>spoon—that was after I had the conversation with her-two days after<lb></lb>wards I missed a silver paint-box, and two active Spanish bonds for £170 each—the bonds have never been found—when I missed the paint-box, I</p>

               <p>said to Aitkin, "My paint-box is gone"—she denied knowing anything about it, but confessed it afterwards—when I asked her about it, she said, "What could I have done with it?"—I said "I really don't know what you have done with it, I only require to have it given to me"—I men<lb></lb>tioned pawning to her, and she seemed horror struck at the thought—I mentioned the bonds, and she denied all knowledge of them—she at last requested that I would wait till the next Tuesday night at half-past nine o'clock, when all would be made right-a gentleman named Finden called on that Tuesday evening, on the subject of some drawings—after he called, I laid to Aitkin, about five o'clock, "Ann, strong measures must be taken with you, for my plate and bonds are gone"—she again requested that nothing should be done till half-past nine o'clock that evening, and I gave her liberty till that time—she left my house once that evening for about ten minutes—I remember a ring at the bell that evening, and Gibb, Aitkin's mother, came in—I said to Gibb, "Your daughter has stolen my plate and bonds, give her good advice, and all may be well yet"—Gibb said, "What could my daughter do with plate and bonds? it is impossible"—I told her Aitkin had confessed about the plate—Aitkin then came in, and Gibb said to her, "If you have stolen anything from your mis<lb></lb>tress, own it at once"—I then went into the back parlour, and on my re<lb></lb>turn I found an officer there with the prisoner Richards—I said to Richards, "Do you want Mrs. Parke, or do you want Ann?"—she said, "No"—I asked her whether she was Ann's sister?—she said she was, and she gave up some duplicates immediately—the officers said they would search her—she said she would not speak to the men, but she would own the truth to me—the officers brought Aitkin into the room, and asked her, "Do you know that person?" pointing to Richards—Aitkin said, "As I hope to live, I never saw her all the days of my life"—Richards said, "Ann, Ann, am I not your sister?"—Aitkin then admitted that she washer sister—I heard another ring at the bell, and Berkshire came in—the officers then took all the prisoners away—on the Friday following I missed nineteen tea-spoons, and three dessert-spoons—I had tied them all up together in Aitkin's presence, she knew where they were, and had access to the place, and every place in the house, but they had been locked up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to my mother, who is a pawnbroker, at No. 41, York-road, Lambeth. I produce a tea-spoon, pledged on the 10th of May, 1838—I have the duplicate—it is attached to it—I have another tea-spoon, pawned on the next day—I have the counter duplicates to all these things, also a shirt and a napkin—I produce a silver box, pawned by a female, who is not in custody—I know the female perfectly well—she had been in the habit of using my shop—she was dressed ex<lb></lb>ceedingly well—she said it belonged to her aunt—I have an opera-glass, pledged by the same lady—she did not look td me like a servant—the initials "H K P" are on the spoons—they were pawned in the name of Brown-here is "H K P," a horn, and a Latin motto, on this silver box—it was pawned in the name of Brown—I produce two sheets, pledged by the same person, a table-spoon, and two dessert spoons-"H K P" are on three of them, and "S L" on the other, from the same lady—on the 22nd of October I saw the prisoner Gibbs—she produced a duplicate of four spoons, pledged for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and wanted to redeem part of them—she asked for the table-spoon—I wished her to pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that—she could not give it me—she paid the interest, and had a fresh ticket made out—these spoons were pawned by the same lady-Gibb wanted me to take 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the table-spoon, and I would not—I have compared seven of these duplicates with seven that Mitchell produced, and they all correspond.</p>

I have a dessert fork and the duplicate—it was pawned on the 27th of August by Gibb—on the 30th of August three table forks were pawned by the same person—they have been in the house two or three years off and on—I thought, by the way she spoke, that she was a char-woman, and had pawned them for her mistress—she said, "They are mine,"—she had pawned property three or four years, and came and paid for them, which put me off my guard—there are initials on them—I did not ask her what her mistress's name was—they never will give us the name if we ask them—she said, "They are mine"—I thought she was sent by some person—I knew her in the neighbourhood for six or seven years—I</p>

            , a Smuggler; I have seen him pay him four and five guineas at a time; the first Monday after the heads were put on Temple-bar, I saw him there, I said, Blackcap, what do you do here; said he, I am reduced very poor, and said, he wished he never had been a rider with Henley, or any of the gang, and had it not been for a butcher, who had took him, he must have wanted : I eat and drank with him; we had a quarter of a goose at a little cook's shop near the Butcher row.</p>

               <p>Swinden. I went to see Masterson in Newgate, and being curious to see the cells, I saw Dixon there, I said Blackcap, is it you? I am sorry for it; he said, they have swore against me falsely.</p>

               <p>Swinden. I cannot tell where he lived in 46; I have known him about five years; he has bought my goods for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any servant he kept?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I knew one Major that he kept about a year ago, there was another man used to come down to our house, when he has wanted a joint.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I used to call him Jack; it was, I believe, two years ago.</p>

               <p>Swinden. It was not, I knew his nephew well</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name?</p>
               <p>Swinden. I don't know; I don't believe the prisoner would be guilty of perjuring himself ; and I really believe Dixon lived with him, as I do that I am here, but Dixon did not tell me where he lived, fearing I should tell Henley.</p>

I am a Brandy and Wine Merchant, I live in Thames-street, near the Custom-house; I have known the prisoner about half a dozen years or more: I knew him in Hanover-yard, I have dealt with him for meat divers times since the year 1746; his people came to my house with the meat, sometimes I paid them, and sometimes I paid him, when he came that way; I have been at his shop, and have seen a man at work in it.</p>

               <p>Taylor. Really I would not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask all those evidences that have been produced against me, in regard to my general character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Baker. What is his general character ?</p>
               <p>Baker. He never wrong'd me of any thing, I have heard he has been a common-bail ; people have been to my house to enquire after his character, whether he was a sufficient man to be bail for people.</p>
               <p>Q. What answers did you use to make to such questions?</p>
               <p>Baker. I always answered, I believed him not a sufficient man for such purposes. I heard him once offer to swear himself worth 500 l. which is not a year ago, at the Judge's chambers.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have believed him worth 500 l. had he swore it?</p>
               <p>Baker. No, I should not.</p>

            . I live facing St. George's-church, the prisoner's general character is very bad: that he will swear any thing ; it is the common report of the neighbourhood, he is one that is hired to swear in courts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boozsher and Sharpless confirm'd the testimony of the last witness, as to his being a common bail.</p>

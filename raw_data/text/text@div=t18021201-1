               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was chairman to the Duchess of Somerset; that he went into this house to have a glass of brandy and water; that some boys had made a bonfire; that he got up in the window to look at it, and had the misfortune to knock the glass down, upon which Mr. Page immediately seized him.</p>

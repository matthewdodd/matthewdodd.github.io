                  </hi>. Last Thursday week, between six and seven in the evening, I was in London-passage—I had eighteen-pence in my pocket—I saw the prisoner there, and he pushed me three times against the post, and put his hand into my pocket, and took out my eighteen-pence, it was all in pence and halfpence—he ran away, and I hallooed after him, and called after him by name; I know him well—I saw him next day, and told him I was too poor, I could not allow him my eighteen-pence; since he had robbed me of the eighteen-pence, I asked him to give it to me; he said, "You b—b—I will knock your brains out," and he had a large stick in his hand—he was taken into custody about half an hour after.</p>

I took the prisoner at the Old Friends' beer-shop, London-passage, St. Luke's.—I told him I wanted him for robbing a woman of eighteen-pence; he said he knew nothing of it—I told him he must go with me, and he went down on his knees and held the legs of the table, so that I should not get out, and said did I want to get him transported—he asked a man who was there to get the money and pay the woman—Gorman came in, and said, "That is the man who robbed me of eighteen-pence"—I took him to the station.</p>

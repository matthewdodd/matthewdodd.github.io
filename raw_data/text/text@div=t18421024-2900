                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Hazlewood, a grocer, at Hoxton. I was in the parlour at the back of my shop on the morning of the 3rd of October—I heard a jink of money in the till—I looked up and saw the prisoner leaning across the counter taking money out of the till—I saw the money in his fingers—he saw me and ran away down Hoxton—I went to the till and saw that between 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were gone—I went to the door and saw he was stopped by somebody—I had looked into the till a quarter of an hour before, and it contained between 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., when I looked at it afterwards there was no silver in it.</p>

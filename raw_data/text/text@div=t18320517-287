On the 30th of April I returned home, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening; I had gone out at half-past nine in the morning, leaving all my property safe - when I returned I missed the property stated - the value of all I lost was 120l. - have seen nothing since but the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How was your property secured? A. My pocket-book was in my trunk, which was locked - the trunk was broken open, and the pocket-book was gone; my Christain names are Francois Ambrose, but I always sign Francois Rameau - I am not certain how it is on my passport.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you known by the name of Francois, or have you used in this country the name of Ambrose? A. On particular occasions I call my name Ambrose.</p>
               <p>MARY BENSON. I am landlady of the house in which the prosecutor has lodged for upwards of five years. I remember his going out on the morning of the 30th of April - I was in his room that day, about five o'clock in the afternoon - it appeared all secure, but I am not in the habit of looking over his wardrobe - the door was shut and locked; I sent a person up to his room about a quarter-past nine o'clock, to light the fire - she came down immediately, and I went up to the room; I found the door unlocked, but shut - I had the key myself; the person who got in must have opened the door with another key - I missed the property; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who went into the room at a quarter-past nine o'clock? A. A person I had to assist me; I had given her my key, and she called me up - she only just went up stairs and came down again.</p>

             (Police-constable D 16). On the night of the 30th of April I was on duty near Barlow-street, and an officer told me of a robbery at No. 7, Little Barlow-street, where Mrs. Benson lives - I went there, and found the prosecutor's room in a disturbed state; I went to give notice to the inspector - several persons were about, who pointed out the prisoner as a man who had been lurking about the house - I walked after him; he turned a street, and ran off through several streets; I followed, and took him - I asked him why he ran; he said he wanted to go home - this was past eleven o'clock; I took him to the station, and found on him the duplicate of the waistcoat which had been pawned that day for 7s., in the name of

               <p>THOMAS GAYDON. I live opposite Mrs. Benson's; I saw the prisoner that evening walking about several times, and pointed him out to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When did you see him? A. About half-past nine o'clock was the first time - he was about, I dare say, for half an hour, and then went away; I took particular notice of him, by his watching round the house.</p>
               <p>FRANCOIS RAMEAU. This is my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you had it? A. About three years; I do not know that I had seen it that day, I had two or three days before - I left it in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The pawnbroker has stated quite false; it was pawned between twelve and one o'clock.</p>

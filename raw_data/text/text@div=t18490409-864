                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 5, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street, I have known the prisoner about six months from this time—he lives at No. 6, at the back of us. On Wednesday evening, 17th Jan., I was in Angel-alley with Eliza Graves, about seven o'clock—I saw the prisoner as he was going to the shop with some work—he came back about eight—he seemed rather angry—I asked him what time it was, and he said about eight—he asked me where I had been, and I said no further than the door—while talking to him John Sumner came by: I went to him, and was talking to him about ten minutes—the prisoner saw me talking to him, and when the conversation was over the prisoner was gone—Graves went in search of him—I followed, and found him in Skinner-street—I put his cap on his head, and he knocked it off and flung it over the wall at the back of his own house; I recovered it and took it to him—he then walked into Back-alley—I then went indoors into my own house—shortly afterwards, in consequence of what Graves said, I went out again—he had sent for me—I asked him what he wanted—he said that was his business; I should see what he wanted with me if I waited time enough—he then seized hold of my right hand—I asked what he held my hand so tight for—he said that was his business—I got my hand away, and he seized me by my dress—I kept asking him to let me go in doors; he would not—I turned my head from him, about ten minutes, to talk to Graves, and as I was going to ask him again he fired a pistol at me—he had still hold of my dress with his left hand—I saw the pistol—it was about half a yard from me—I felt that I was wounded on the side of the head—I fell down twice—Sumner came and picked me up, and when I came to my senses I found myself at the hospital.</p>

I am single, and live at 9, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate—for some time before 17th Jan., I knew Emma Tyler, Sumner, and the prisoner; we were all intimate together—the prisoner and Tyler had been keeping company about three months—I saw Tyler and the prisoner together, on Wednesday evening, 17th Jan.—I saw Sumner come up—Tyler left the prisoner to talk to him—the prisoner did not say anything about that; he stood by while she was talking to Sumner—he seemed displeased, and went away directly into Skinner-street—I and Tyler afterwards went and found him in Skinner-street, sitting on a post—Tyler took off his cap, and he went up a place called Back-alley, and I and Tyler went indoors—I afterwards went back, and the prisoner asked me to fetch Tyler out—Tyler asked him what was the matter with him—he said that was nothing to do with her—Tyler and I then Went indoors—about ten minutes afterwards the prisoner said to me, "Go and tell Emma Tyler I want to speak to her"—I told her, and she came out—we went to the prisoner—he was then standing by our gate—he said he wanted to speak to her very particularly—she said, "Let me hear it, if you please"—he made no reply—we went to our door, and he flung his cap over into his own yard; he desired me to fetch it, I refused, and I, the</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On Wednesday evening, 17th Jan., about half-past ten or eleven o'clock, Tyler was brought there—I examined her head, and found a gun-shot wound on the left-side, and about two inches further on there was another wound, about the same size—there was not much blood; she was very faint, the blood being stopped—the wounds, from their shape and size, were evidently caused by a bullet—the bullet appeared to have entered at the lower wound, and made its exit at the upper one, traversing about two inches under the skin; it had gone close to the bone, which was bared, but not fractured—the side of her face near the wound was scorched and blackened by the gun-powder—I probed the wound, but found no bullet—I put her Under the charge of Mrs. Osborne, the nurse, and she has been in the hospital ever since,</p>

On Wednesday night, 17th Jan., Tyler was put under my charge—next day I dressed her head, and found in her hair, above the top wound, this piece of lead, or copper, like a bullet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was so much discoloured with the blood that I could not tell what it was—I gave it to Mr. Mason.</p>

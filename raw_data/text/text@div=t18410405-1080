                  </hi>. I live at the Bell Inn, Newgate-market, in the parish of St. Faith under St. Paul. On the night of the 1st of March, I went to bed about ten o'clock—my house was not closed then—my wife was the last person up—next morning, at three o'clock, I was alarmed by the lad who gets up at three—I found the bar-door open, and the till had been taken out—the drawer in the bar-parlour had the lock forced open, and some silver money taken out, and some copper taken from the ledge by the side—I missed seven silver tea-spoons, two punch-ladles, a silk handkerchief, some cigars and sheroots, a great-coat, a shawl, two pairs of gloves, two billiard-balls, and a pair of sugar-tongs—they were all taken out of the bar-parlour, except what was taken from the till—it appeared the persons had come in at the coffee-room window—there were no marks of violence there—the window was generally not fastened, as we are enclosed by gates each way, and it is in general left a little open—I found a panel had been taken out of the bar-door, which is usually locked at night—the panel was taken out of the top, which shoves up, and then they had unbolted it to let themselves in—the prisoner Pond had been in my service, and left me last August—the two other prisoners I know nothing of.</p>

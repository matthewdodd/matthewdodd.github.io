On the 9th of August, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house, and asked for a glass of ale—I served him—he asked for another, and produced a half-crown from his pocket after drinking part of the second glass—it came to four pence—I told him I considered it was not a good one—he said he thought it was, but he had another he would give me—he produced another from the same pocket, which I considered good, and took it—my brother, who is a policeman, was in the house, and he came down before I parted with the bad half-crown—by his advice I kept it, and gave the prisoner into custody—he asked why I detained him when he was disposed to pay me—I marked the half-a-crown, and gave it to my brother—I asked the prisoner if he had any more coin—he said he had another half-crown, and produced it—I kept the good one till he came to Union Hall, and then received fourpence, and when he was discharged, gave it to him.</p>

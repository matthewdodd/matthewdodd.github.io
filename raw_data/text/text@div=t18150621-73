            . The prisoner at the bar was in our employ; and up to the time that I discovered this peculation, nobody would have given him a better character than I should. In consequence of an information I received from his landlord where he last lodged, I went to his present lodgings, and there I found an immense quantity of pawnbrokers duplicates, some dated three years ago, others less; we went to the different pawnbrokers, and the last we went to, we found two pair of women's shoes pawned but a few days previous; I told Mr.

             the constable, that he was to take him into custody when I gave him the word; Read kept close in the neighbourhood; I sent the prisoner into the warehouse, telling him to look out six pair of men's shoes, quickly; he went into the warehouse, and remained after the other men were gone, full ten minutes: as he was going out, I gave the word to Read, who took him into custody and brought him back into the shop. On searching him, we found a pair of large men's shoes, one in each breeches pocket, the shoes are new; I can swear to them.</p>

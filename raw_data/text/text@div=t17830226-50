               <p>I am assistant to Mr. Armstrong, the last witness cried out stop thief! Mr. Armstrong and I had been arresting a gentleman for about 200 l. and we were coming home with the gentleman; the prosecutor cried stop thief! and I went after him, and took him, he was not out of sight, nor above thirty yards off; when I brought him back, he had got the butter under his arm, and the knife stuck in it, I am sure it is the prisoner; I believe the prisoner's friends gave the prosecutor some money to make it up.</p>

               <p>I was coming home last Saturday night was fortnight, and it began to rain, and I ran very fast, and that gentleman knocked me down, and said, you have got a tub of butter, I said I had not; and they took me before a Justice, and I was committed; and the prosecutor came and asked me if I had any friends, I said yes; and he said, if I could get any thing from them, I would settle the affair; and he went to them, and got half a guinea, and signed a note, here is a receipt for ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know nothing of the law, and two men came to me, and took me to a publick house, and said I could bail the prisoner if I pleased; I said, I had no objection if the Justice pleased; I was over persuaded, but did not know any thing of the affair.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Suppose this amounts to compounding of felony, and to be a crime in the prosecutor, that is nothing at all to the crime committed by the prisoner; and with respect to

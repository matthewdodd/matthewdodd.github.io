I came from Carshalton on the 16th of November; it was about 9 o'clock at night when I got to Westminster-bridge. I came all through the city to Tower-hill, to the Victualing-office coffee-house. I staid there, I believe, two hours or better: I was both tired and a dry. After I went away I found myself a little in liquor. I was quite sober when I came there, but I was not any thing incapable.

I believe I staid rather too long. One of them said to me, you seem to be a little in liquor, and I am so too; we had both better leave our watches with the landlord, which we both did. After I had got out of doors, I returned, and asked the landlord to give me my watch again. I thought I should not be that way for some time. Then I went out of the door to go home, as it was very late. The prisoner at the bar came and clasped me round the neck; I dare say I was not six yards from the door, and swore she would give me a kiss; she had got my head backwards. There were several people, men and women, pushing me about; she put her hand into my pocket, and took out the money; there were 15 guineas in my pocket, and I found only two guineas and a 5 s. 3 d. left. I cried out, hold her, I am robbed. I never let go of her; she took 13 guineas out of my pocket, and some silver. I never parted with her, though I was pinched to such a degree, that my arms were black and blue; and I had been several times on my knees, yet I kept hold of her, and delivered her into the hands of the officer.</p>

            . I was constable of the night; going my round at one o'clock, about 100 yards distance, I heard a person cry, I have been robb'd. When I came up I found the prosecutor and prisoner struggling together. The prisoner was trying to get away; at first the man said he had been robb'd, but did not mention the sum; he charged the prisoner; and she charged him. I took them both to the watch-house, and there he charged her with having robb'd him of 13 guineas. She was searched, and only half a guinea found upon her; she said she had not the money herself, but she knew who had; and that if she thought she should have been taken, it should not have been he and another such that should have taken her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>They say so many false things against me I do not know what to say. When he gave the constable charge of me, he said I had taken 100 l. and a gold watch; then he said 300 l. and then 2, till the gentlemen at the victualling-office came and advised with him; then he said he had lost 13 guineas. He was in company with a woman in the public house: after the woman was gone, he got tossing up. The landlady said she would appear in my behalf, but she would not come for fear of losing her licence.</p>

            . I went to the watch-house the next morning. I know the prisoner by sight. The prosecutor came there, and said he did not want to hurt her, if she would tell of the woman that had the money. I lent her half a guinea the very morning of the robbery, in order to get a gown and things out of pawn, to prevent her having the anger of her parents. It was a crooked half guinea.</p>

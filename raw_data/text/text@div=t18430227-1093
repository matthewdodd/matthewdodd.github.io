                  </hi>. I am foreman to Joseph Etherington, of Morgan's-lane, Tooley-street—the prisoner was a labourer in his employ—in consequence of some circumstances I thought it necessary to set a watch, and after some time I searched the prisoner's house with a policeman—I found a quantity of mahogany, some other boards and wood, and wood bricks, and some other pieces, which appeared to have been cut off over night and taken away—they were my master's, and part of them are here—I can swear positively that this is Mr. Etherington's wood—this is a piece which I cut myself, and this is a tool made to cut mortices in—the value of the whole is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found a hammer and two chisels, one of which I can identify—the prisoner said I was quite at liberty to search his house—when I found these pieces of mahogany, I asked if he could look me in the face, and say that they were not Mr. Etherington's—he said, no; they were Mr. Etherington's, and he brought them off the premises.</p>

I took the prisoner, and searched his house—I found a quantity of wood in all parts—this piece of mahogany was in a dog-kennel, and some old rags put over it—I found a quantity of tools—here is a rasp, a hammer, and two chisels—these were under the stair-case—I asked how he came in possession of so much wood—he said a car<lb></lb>penter lodged with him, and left him six months ago, and went to Dover; that he owed him some rent, and left him the wood—he tried to make his escape out of the window, and I took him.</p>

I was desired to sell for him by contract; and the the furniture, altogether. I placed the prisoner in it to take care of it, and to shew it to such persons as wished to see it. She is a married woman; I think I placed there on the on the 40th of June last. On the 18th of last month, by the prisoner's husband's master I was informed; he came down to me, and told me; that he had been informed by the husband that she had been making away with the property. Her husband is a chair-maker by trade. From which I went to Marlborough street; the magistrate sent me with an officer to the house to search it, to see whether, the property was stolen or not. I searched it, and found the articles in the indictment missing, and a great many others. There was missing two blankets, two sofa covers, eight chair cushion covers, two pillow cases, a swing glass, five bedside carpets, six bed curtains, 4 hearth rugs, one baize cover, four flat irons, a set of bed furniture, and a pillow; all these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260065"></xptr>things were taken out of the house. The prisoner had not given me notice that she had left the house. When I went to the house the husband was there. I expected to find her there. I accompanied the husband to the house where he thought she was. I found her in a room in Windmill-street, where she delivered to me part of the duplicates of the property she had pawned. I then requested she would accompany me to Devonshire-street, where the officer was in waiting; and when she got to Devonshire-street she delivered part of the duplicates to the officer, and part I have received since. She has been in confinement. I took her to Marlborough-street office, She was there committed. On the husband I found no duplicates. I do not think he was accessary to it, nor did he know it, in my opinion. These are the the duplicates I received of her when I found her.</p>

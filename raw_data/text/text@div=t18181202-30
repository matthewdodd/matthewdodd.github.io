I turned round, and saw the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, and looked under her cloak, but did not see my handkerchief - nobody else being near, I suspected, and followed her towards the Bank, and saw by the motion of her arms that she was putting something into her pocket. At the corner of Bartholomew-lane, I saw her draw her hand from her cloak - I thought she was making a motion to somebody, a boy came to her, but did not speak to her. She went about half way down the lane, crossed over, and looked round. I went to her, and said, My good woman, you have got my handkerchief, and you had better give it back to me. She said she had not got it, and I might search her. I said I was sure of it, and if she gave it up, I would take no further notice. She still denied it, and said I was welcome to search. I said I had no power to search her myself, but I should send for an officer. She said I was welcome. I ordered her to walk before me to the Rose and Crown, Broad-street - I followed very close; when she got in, I begged of her to give it up to prevent any further trouble - she still denied it. I sent for an officer, he took her into a room up one pair of stairs, while he was searching her right hand pocket, I saw it fall from her petticoats, half of it was still in her clothes, she still denied it - it was mine.</p>

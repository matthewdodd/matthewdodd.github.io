            's family, in which Mr. Howman did live, before he was page to the Prince of Wales; she said, her father was coachman there; and the reason she gave why she was to have the stockings was, that she had found a ring some time ago, which her father had put into the hands of Mr. Howman, with intention to have it raffled for, but he had never had it done, and her father was dead, and she applied to Mr. Howman, in consequence of this ring, and he had desired her to get a pair of buckles, and a pair of stockings; she said, she was servant to a perfumer in Bond-street, the corner of Bruton-street; there was no perfumer there I told her; then she said the corner of Grafton-street; I said there was no perfumer there; she requested me to send somebody with her; I told my young man to down with her to Mr. Howman; and immediately after she went out of the shop, I had occasion to send for her back; then I desired her to go into the parlour, behind the shop; I told her, I believed she had something about her that did not belong to her; she said, she had not; I said, I am very sure you have, I desired her to go into the parlour behind the shop; she said, she had nothing but a few ivory combs; and she turned herself round, endeavouring as I supposed to get out of my way; and I saw her drop one pair of silk stockings, which I took up.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of that one pair? - Fifteen shillings; I took them up, and said, these are not all you have, she said, she had nothing more; but I saw her drop a second pair; I immediately sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the two pair? - Thirty shillings; I gave that for them; I am very clear they are mine.</p>
               <p>In the first place, is there any shop mark upon them? - Not at that time there was not, I had sold two pair of the same pattern, they were both of the same sort, but a different pattern; she was very troublesome in the parlour, and called out murder very often; Mr. Allanson came into the shop after me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Allanson swore, he saw the stockings drop, and the prosecutor swore, he did not.</p>

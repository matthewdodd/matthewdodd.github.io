                  </hi>. I live in Wenlock-road, City-road. I was in Lower-Marsh, Lambeth, about 8 o'clock on a Saturday evening—I do not know the day—I was looking at a man selling glass pins—I felt my pocket shake—I felt, and my handkerchief was gone—I looked round, and saw the prisoner throw it from his hand on the ground—I did not tell the Magistrate that I saw the prisoner draw his hand from my coat-pocket—they took down what I said, and read it to me—it was correct—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>—"I saw the prisoner in the act of drawing his hand from my coat pocket with my handkerchief in it")—I did not see him take his band from my pocket with the handkerchief in it—I saw him drop it—I caught hold of him, and gave him in charge—he said he did not take it from me.</p>

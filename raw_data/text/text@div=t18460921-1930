                  </hi>. I am gatekeeper of Kensington-gate. On Tuesday morn<lb></lb>ing, 1st September, about five minutes after five o'clock, I was opposite Mr. Gray's nursery, and saw the prisoners Moore and Jackson—they were close to<lb></lb>gether, and appeared in company—Moore had two pictures, similar to thete—they walked together to the end of Park-house, and there I saw Jackson take one of the pictures from under Moore's arm, and they walked into the meadow by Park-house—they were coming in the direction of London—I came on to the Halfway-house, which is about 150 yards further—I unlocked the gate and turned back—I then saw Jackson and Moore again standing at the end of the wall of Park-house, without the pictures—they came out into the main road just opposite me, and walked on towards Kensington—they then met the other three prisoners, who were coming in a direction from Mr. Dewsbury's house—they were nearly opposite to it—they stood together about a minute, and then they all returned towards the meadow—I went to my own house at Kensington-gate, I unlocked the carriage-gate, and went into the high road to see if I could see the prisoners any more, and I saw the five coming back again towards Kensington-gore—I could not tell whether they had been to the meadow—I think they had hardly had time to have done that—they turned down Kensington-lane—I found Dunbar, and told him—he and I went to the meadow—we found nothing—we went to the station and got another officer—we all three returned to the meadow and found these two pictures, under a large mortar board with a quantity of tiles on it, we also found this ivory work—box—we took the property to the station, and the box was opened—I am sure the prisoners are the persons—I afterwards found one of these chimney-ornaments in Hyde—park, and the park-keeper found the other—I afterwards found this holland in the plantation of the park-the gita were locked, but they might get over, or they could put these in by potting their hands through the railing.</p>

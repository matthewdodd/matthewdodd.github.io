                  </hi>. I am footman, in the service of Mr. Thomas Todd Mardon, of Wirapole-street, Cavendish-square—Christie has been butler then for ten years—he had the care of the plate—it had been put away for some time—in August last it was taken out, counted, found right, and given again into the care of Christie—he had the key of the boxes—Ri<lb></lb>chards has been in the habit of coming to my master's, to see Christie, and came sometimes when we had parties, with my master's knowledge. On the 6th of Oct., about half-past eleven, or a quarter to twelve o'clock in the day, as I went out on an errand, I passed the butler's pantry—Richards and Christie were in it—in about a quarter of an hour I returned, and met Richards at the corner of Wimpole-street, coming in a direction from the house—I went in, and saw Christie there—he went out soon after, and did not return any more—the next day a policeman came—the plate chest was opened, and a dozen table-spoons, and two dozen table-forks, were missed from it—in looking about afterwards, I found some duplicates—I gave them to the policeman—these are my master's spoons and forks, and have the family crest on them.</p>

               <p>always conducted myself in a proper way, and never thought of doing anything wrong, until last August, when I engaged George Richards to assist me in clean<lb></lb>ing the furniture; while up stairs with him, I was called by the housemaid to show me that the wardrobe doors had burst open; I then looked into it, and saw a small portmanteau and a bunch of keys; I unfortunately opened it, before the housemaid and Richards; after that I shut the wardrobe, and went down to clean the furniture, and while with Richards, cleaning the furniture, we commenced talking to each other; but previous to that, I told him I was in arrears of rent, and several other little bills, and he told me I need not be in want for no money, for he would go and pledge these things for me; so, in the course of two or three days after, I unfortunately let him go with part of the plate, and then, some days after that, we went with some more of it; when that plate that belonged to the portmanteau was pledged, I began to feel very uncomfortable and uneasy in my own mind, and I told Richards so; then he advised me take some of the plate that was under my care, to take out what belonged to the portmanteau, and I did so, with the intent of taking them out again; I have given myself up, with the expectation of Mr. Mardon and the Court showing me mercy."</p>

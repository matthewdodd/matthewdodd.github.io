            . I am daughter of Joseph Lloyd, and live in Gloucester-row, Hoxton. On the 26th of June I was out with my sister; we went into a pastry-cook's shop, and bought some cakes - I took out four shillings, and gave to my sister; she took it, and put it on the ledge of the window outside the shop, when she came out, as she was giving me the cakes - she had not got her hand on the money, but by the side of it; the prisoner took it, and ran away - I ran after him, calling Stop thief! I do not know how far he got before he was taken; he gave me back two shillings, and said he threw the other two away - we found them; we got the whole four back.</p>

I went to the shop with my sister - she gave me four shillings; I put them on the window-ledge - my hand was close to them: the prisoner came behind me, and took them over my shoulder; I saw his hand - it was black: he ran away - we called Stop thief! my sister got two shillings from him, and a man picked up two and gave her.</p>

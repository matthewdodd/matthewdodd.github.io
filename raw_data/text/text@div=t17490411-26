The prisoner at the bar and a woman with him came into my shop the 17th of April, and asked for some check, I shewed them some: the woman took up a shirt that lay on the counter and ask'd the price of it. My sister shewed her the piece the shirt was cut off from; she bought a piece for a pair of shift-sleeves, and put down half a crown, and as I was looking for change the man went out of the door; my sister saw something under his coat. He staid about four minutes, and came in again, and asked the woman if she had not bargained, and they went out together: as soon as they were gone, my sister said, that man has took something out. I miss'd a piece of cloth in a moment. My sister ran after him, and I call'd the maid and sent her after them.</p>

             . The prisoner came to my sister's shop and took the piece as before-mentioned, I went after him, saw him and he saw me. I followed him into St. Giles's Vinegar-yard; by that time there was a person came after me crying, stop thief! she was our maid, my sister had sent after me; for I had not courage enough to call out; then he ran, and I call'd out, stop thief! he ran into a publick house, I went after him and took him, but he had nothing at all upon him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came into my house on April the 17th, between five and seven and call'd for half a quartern of rum. He followed me and drank the rum, and let the glass down in a great hurry, and said something I could not understand, took this piece of cloth from under his coat, did not pay for the rum but left the piece of cloth. I concluded he designed to pay for the rum when he fetched the cloath; I thought that might be what he said, though it was spoke so low that I could not hear it perfectly .</p>

            . On the 30th of March Mr. Rogers, the Alesbury carrier, took my brother from helping me to load his waggon, and set Narroway the prisoner to help me to load it, in Saracen's Head Inn Yard, Snow Hill. The wife of Mr. James brought a parcel. I either gave it to Narroway, or bid him take it, while I went in to book it. I had put another parcel into a flat. and ordered him to put this to that; but instead of that he took them both, and has since confessed it. He had been employed there before. He was taken up the next day and carried before justice Willoughby, and there confessed he put it into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Mr. Robertson. I am a constable. On the 30th of March there came one Mr. Yeomans, a pewter buckle maker, about eight o'clock at night, who told me they were offered to me for sale. (He wanted me to weigh them.) I told him they were not finished, and I suspected they were stolen. He said the man was drinking in Ship-Alley. I went, and found the two prisoners there with Yeomans's servant. I enquired of Darby how he came by the buckles, who said he had found them that evening on Tower-Hill. Narroway said he was by and saw him pick them up. Then I told Darby he must go to prison. I had them lock'd up in the Tower Gaol, in Wellclose-Square; the next morning I had them before Sir

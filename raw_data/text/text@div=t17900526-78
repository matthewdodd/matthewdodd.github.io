               <p>I am a cooper, in Mary-le-bone-street, Golden-square. On Saturday, the 1st of May, between six and seven, I saw one of Mr. Hodges's carts coming up Oxford-street loaded with sacks: I saw the prisoner Palmer bring one sack loaded with corn or sugar (God knows what it was; it might be saw-dust) and carry it into Marlborough's house; the cart went on, and stopped about ten yards up Francis-street, while the man came our. In the afternoon, between four and five, I saw another of Mr. Hodges's carts; I was coming into my house; it was loaded with sacks in the same manner, and this same man, he did not take it from the cart; that I do really believe; for the carman put it on his shoulder; but he brought it from the cart to Marlborough's house; I saw him come out; the cart and he went up Francis-street likewise: as to Marlborough, I know nothing of him; but he certainly carried the sacks into that house; what was in them, God knows, whether corn or saw-dust.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not examine at either of the times, what number of sacks were left in the cart? - No.</p>
               <p>Whether this was a sack picked up in the road, after the compliment was compleat, you cannot say? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>What is a trouncer? - When I have had coals come in, they have asked me if the trouncers should trim them; that is all I know: I recollect, in putting it down, it fell in the street; I thought the carmen were worse than him, for they gave it to him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit whether there is enough to let in this fellow?</p>
               <p>Court. His evidence is certainly competent.</p>
               <p>Stevens. I used to work at the coal-wharf: I was the first carman, on the 1st of May, I had a load of oats, fifteen quarters, to carry to Castle-street, Oxford-market.</p>
               <p>Did you go with it safe there? - I went up Mary-le-bone-street, and the other partner with me took a sack off his cart, and told me to go on.</p>
               <p>Where did he carry it to? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You mean Palmer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was the carman, and he the trouncer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you came to unload, how many sacks had you? - He told thirty full sacks.</p>
               <p>Were there thirty full sacks? - I do not know; I did not tell them when they were loaded.</p>
               <p>Had you taken up any sack in the way? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the sack that was taken from your cart, one of those that were loaded at Mr. Hodges's wharf? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260072"></xptr>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been a thief? - I never was in gaol before.</p>
               <p>You did not help to take it off? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>That you are quite sure of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did it without your consent, I warrant you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were to carry the thirty sacks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you carried him thirty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So they took you up for this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you was sent to gaol? - Yes, worse luck.</p>
               <p>Was afraid of being hanged, if you did not tell this story? - I tell no more than the truth.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you say that he took that sack without your knowledge? - I did not know he took it off; he told me to stop the cart, and I stopped.</p>
               <p>Do not you always walk together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not the cart always tied? - I did not help him to take it off.</p>
               <p>Who did?</p>
               <p>Darmer. A man or boy, God knows which it was, helped him; he could not take it off himself.</p>

               <p>Did not the gentleman give you a bill for the thirty sacks? - He gave the other man the bill; I saw the man put a sack from my cart.</p>
               <p>Do you usually let a man take a sack? - I never did in my life, not before this time, nor at this time; I was not sure that he took it from my cart.</p>
               <p>You said this moment, that you saw him taking it from your cart? - I saw him with the sack on his back; I did not know any thing at all more than seeing the man with the sack on his back; I was along with the cart.</p>

            , the Prisoner at the Bar, brought to me a large Copper Funnel .</p>
               <p>Q. To what Purpose did he bring it to you?</p>
               <p>Carter. To sell, my Lord. He ask'd me 14 d. the Pound for it. I ask'd him what it was. He said it was the Head of a large Furnace. I ask'd him what he was, and he said, a Distiller. I said it was very odd, that you should be a Distiller, and ignorant what it was. My Lord, he told me that he liv'd at Henly upon Thames, that he was a Distiller, had come to Misfortunes, and must sell it. So when I question'd him about it, he said, if you don't like it, or don't think that I came honestly by it, I'll leave it, and go fetch a Person to my Character. With that I told him I would not have the Things left, without he said himself. At last, a Gentlewoman, a Widow of a Common-Council-Man of our Ward, who was some Relation to the Prisoner's Father, desir'd me not to charge an Officer with him. He equivocated in several Shapes. At last, he said, his Wife had bought these Things of a Woman that sold Rags and old Iron. Said I, what do you imagine your Wife might give for it? He insisted upon it, that she might give a Great 2 Pound. He told me his Father liv'd in St. Giles's, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260010"></xptr> also his Brother. They directed me to the Prisoner's House, but his Wife deny'd him. I went in the Broad-Way, Westminster. I ask'd there, if there were not several Gentlemen that keep Distiller's Shops thereabouts. Pray do you know any one in particular, I said. They said, pray what is your Business? This Morning I stopp'd a Copper Funnel, which I imagine was some Gentleman's Property hereabouts, because the Person lives hereabouts that brought it. Upon this we went to a Person of the Business, Mr. Lowrey; and it appear'd that he was the Person that had lost the Funnel. Upon that we charg'd the Constable with the Prisoner. From that we went before the Justice and he was committed upon a Suspicion, because then Mr. Lowrey had not seen it. The next Day Mr. Lowrey came to me to see the Funnel, and swore it was his.</p>

               <p>Prisoner, This Man, when I came to bring the Funnel , stopp'd me: I emptied it out of my Sack, and they desir'd me to sit down by the Fire, and I sat down. They brought a parcel of People into the House, and stopp'd me and frighted me. They ask'd me whether I had any Money in my Pocket. But the Broker said, he would stop me with it, but not charge me with the Constable, and wanted me to run away. I sent to my Father to Broad St. Giles's ; and when my Brother came, he made him Pay 6 d. for sending his own Boy. The Broker told me I had a pretty deal of Impudence to ask 10 d. the Pound for it .</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner . I'll only mention this, that if this Man had been conscious he had committed the Felony, 'tis certain he might have made his Escape.</p>
               <p>Barthia Whitefield . I went to Mr. Wilson's, the Prisoner; he said to me, don't you never light on no Copper Pots, no distilling Things, I can see them lie about in Shops. The first Thing I ever took was two Funnels, and he bought them of me. About a Fortnight after, I took this large Funnel. I was in Company with him at the Time I took it. He said, the Shop is clear, you may now take it. He receiv'd it of me, and gave me 3 d. the Pound for it.</p>

               <p>In order to set this Matter in a clearer Light, we shall give the Close of his Lordship's Charge to the Jury. Gentlemen, you are to put the whole Matter together. The Evidence seems to lie pretty strong against Wilson. His having stolen the Goods in Possession, carrying them about in a suspicious Manner, as I find he was found in three different Stories, these are strong presumptive Evidences of Guilt. What he has to take off that Presumption was, that he was instrumental in apprehending of Barthia Whitefield; if you would make any Use of her Evidence, it must be taken together : That is, that she did steal it, but that Wilson was present at the Time that she took it.</p>

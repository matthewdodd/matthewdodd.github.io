On Sunday, the 2nd of December, I returned home between nine and ten o'clock. in the evening—I went in, as usual, at the outer door—wheu I got up stairs to. the first noor back room, which is my. bed-room, I found the door had been opened by a false key, and missed a desk and se<lb></lb>veral things, which had been safe when I went out—I had locked the. desk on Saturday evening, and there was then four sovereigns, three half sove<lb></lb>reigns, and about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in it, with some little bits of broken silver, and six copper paintings, called transparencies, for jelly-moulds—I missed a quantity of Britannia metal spoons from a drawer in the room, a few. brass hooks, a small lamp, one or two metal salts, and two bell-pulls—it is usual to. leave the street-door of the house un<lb></lb>locked, for the accommodation of lodgers—I saw Mary Ferguson on this evening, after missing the things, and in consequence of what she said, I went to the bouse of the prisoner Burgin, No. 14, Gray's-build<lb></lb>ings, which is about three minutes' walk from our house—I found him in bed—I said, "I want you, Burgin"—he said, "What for?"—I said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Gee's-court is in the parish of St. Marylebone—on Monday morning, I went to No. 12, and in the top attic I found Keefe—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I took him to the station-house—Burroughs was after<lb></lb>wards brought in by young Mr. Emanuel—I produce the pieces of broken silver.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. This broken silver is my father's property—it was given me by Burroughs, when I took him—it was kept in the desk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Burgiris Defence</hi>. On Sunday afternoon, about two o'clock, Burroughs came up to me in Gee's-court, and asked if I intended to rob Mr. Emanuel on the following evening—I said I would have nothing to do with it—he pressed me, and began swearing at me, and called me a coward—I walked away, and went to my aunt's, in Gray's-buildings—about four o'clock the same evening he came and called me—I came up to him—he asked if I intended to do what he asked me—I said I intended to do no such thing, which my aunt could prove if she was here—he went away, telling me he intended to do it, and he would make a good <hi rend="italic">haul</hi>—I came down the court, about six o'clock, and saw Burroughs—he said he had got three ingots of pewter, some spoons, and a desk, and he had them down at No. 13—I said I would have nothing to do with them—he went down into the kitchen, came up, and told me he had got some money, and asked if I would have any part of it—I said not, and saw no more of him till I was taken—I went home about seven o'clock, to my aunt's, No. 14, Grty's-buildings—Abraham Emanuel came up, and accused me of the robbery—I was in bed, and had been about two hours before he came—he said Mary Ferguson could swear she saw me standing in the passage ten minutes before that, and this was about ten o'clock at night—I said I would get up and go to her with him—I did, and asked her if she saw me in the passage—she stuttered about it, and seemed to say "no" at first, but he persuaded her, I suppose, to say "yes," but she would not go to the station-house.</p>

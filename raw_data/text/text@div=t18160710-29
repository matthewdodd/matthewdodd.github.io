            . I have known the prisoner between five and six years; he has been a shipmate with me. I took him home to sleep with me at my lodgings on the night previous to the day in the indictment. I went out the next morning, leaving him at my lodgings, and I left the things on the table, that he might get his breakfast. I left the clothes named in the indictment in the room in my chest, which was not locked. When I returned, the prisoner was gone, and my room door was locked, and the key was left with the landlady; I have never recovered my clothes again.</p>



               <p>DANIEL WATTS I live in Cable-street, St. George's in the East. The prisoner offered to sell me a blue coat, and white gown. The coat had yellow buttons, as the prosecutor has described it. I observed the size of the coat, and thought it was one that would it Dale. I asked him if the coat was his own; he said, it was. I asked him what made him sell it, and he said, he was very much distressed, and he said, the gown was his girls; I bought them of him. I saw him again afterwards. I told him go to some regular clothe's shop, and they could give him more than I could. He said he sold the coat to an old woman in Rosemary-lane; he said, he sold it for eight shillings, and some gin.</p>

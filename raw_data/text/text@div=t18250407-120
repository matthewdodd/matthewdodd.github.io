               <p>"By God, I am innocent! I am innocent! I am done! I am done!"</p>

I heard the cry of Stop thief! at the same time, and saw persons running - but could not distinguish who they were; I sent an acquaintance, who was with me, to the watch-house for on officer, and gave the watch to him; the prosecutor claimed it as his, at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the watch from Lesar - it was claimed by Higginbotham. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and ran out of the watch-house, and came up with the prisoner and Boison, who had got hold of him; some person in the crowd said,</p>
               <p>"That is he," and I took charge of him directly. As soon as Higginbotham came he charged him with having stolen his watch. While we were there some person said a woman had found the watch; I went to the corner of Holywell-lane, and got it. When I collared the prisoner he said,</p>
               <p>"I am innocent;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Why did you run?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I did not run;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You are now out of breath" - he then said,</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About half-past seven o'clock that night I left work, and went to a public-house, after being up all Friday night - I staid there a few minutes, and when I came out, by Church-street, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran, and this witness came up, and said</p>
               <p>"You are the man who has stolen the watch," but I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

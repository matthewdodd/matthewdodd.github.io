                  </hi>. I am coachman to Dr, Bell. On the evening of the 5th August I took three portmanteaus and deal box to the coach-house in catherine-wheel-alley—the entrance is out of New-street, Bishop<lb></lb>gate-street—I put some of them inside the carriage, and secured the others on it, ready to start in the morning—the coach-house is in yard which has four dwelling-houses in it—the prisoner, Martha Priest, lives in one of them—I went about ten minutes after five o'clock on the morning of the 6th of August—I found the coach-house door closed; but the lock was broken—It had been locked the night before—I saw marks of violence on the coach-house doors—the wood was dented in, as if by some heavy pres<lb></lb>sure—the portmanteaus were in the yard, against Martha Priest's house, and were broken open—a part of the property was left, but a great deal was gone—It was daylight—I informed my master, and then called at the watch-house, and the officers went with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Algar-place, Essex-street, and am an unfortunate girl. I knew the prisoner, Henry Priest, for about a fortnight before the robbery—one morning in August, about eight o'clock, he came to my room—I do not know what day—I have since heard of Dr. Bell's robbery—It was the same morning; he brought a morning-gown, a black silk dress. and a white handkerchief, in a basket—Rosetta Brown saw these things—he asked her to pawn the morning-gown—she went to pawn it—he left about six or seven o'clock in the evening—he mentioned the rob<lb></lb>bery in Rosetta Brown's presence—next morning he came again, and brought some clothes in a round basket, and a microscope—he went out and took the things away—I do not know where he took them to—I saw a work-box in his possession—(I have seen it since at the police-office,) and a morning-gown, and a box of letters for children—I gave that to Elizabeth Mullany—he told me there had been a robbery committed in his mother's yard, and that he did it—that it was a gentleman and lady going into the country that had been robbed, and that there were some portmanteaus—he asked me to fetch his mother, and meet him at a public-house in Montague-street—I went to his mother's, and asked for her; she came to me—I saw her at her own house, the first house in the yard—when we were going along, she told me she had not time to put the things away before the officers came quick upon her; and when she could not pot them away, she burnt them—I am sure she said that—she mentioned some lace which she burnt—this is the work-box,</p>

I SAID, "NO"—she said he was at her place, would I go with her—she took me to a street near where I saw "Rose-lane" written up—she said if I would wait there, she would go and fetch him—I staid about ten minutes, and saw her com<lb></lb>ing with my son, and another young man—I said to my son, "Henry, where have you been?" and the young man who was with her said, 'Do not stand here, we will go to a public-house, and have a pint of porter"—I then said to my son, "What have you done?"—he said Mr. Bell's place had been broken open—that he did not do it, but he knew those who did do it, and he wished me to get him a shirt, as he was determined to go into the country.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Newspaper Association Office. I am a friend of Messrs. Kopsch—I was at their office on Saturday, the 24th of February last, from seven o'clock till after nine o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner there—he was backwards and forwards—he occasionally came in, took up a pen, and wrote at the desk at the opposite side to where I was sitting—I was perhaps three or four feet from him, the width of the desk—it was a double desk—he could write any thing without a person on the opposite side seeing what he wrote.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the principal officers at the Mansion-house—I took the prisoner into custody on Monday, the 26th of Febrary, the same day I had been sent for to Glynn's banking-house—I found him at Mr. Kopsch's, in Crown-court, Broad-street—I told him I took him for pre<lb></lb>senting a cheque at Glynn's—he said nothing—I searched him, and found on him a letter containing two pieces of paper—he never spoke at all.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The letter being ready was a valentine, upon which was written, "Answered</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th of February, to Miss Widdows, Church-street, Stoke Newington." The papers were memorandums of several sums of money, one of which had "A. J. Kopsch and Co." written several times upon it</hi>.)</p>

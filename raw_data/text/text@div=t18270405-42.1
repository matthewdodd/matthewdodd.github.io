On the 9th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, a lady came in for half a yard of silk, which I cut off, and placed the remainder in the window, which was broken, but there was the lid of a box placed against it, with a roller to keep it steady. I went on the other side of the shop, to serve two women, and in ten minutes I heard a noise at the window, as if it was being cut - being alone in the shop I called the young man, who ran out; I went round, and missed this seven yards of black silk, but not the ribbon, although it was taken - a person could reach it after pushing the lid aside. The officer brought the prisoners to the house the next morning, with it. I had not notices them about.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty on the 9th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in High-street Whitechapel, where I stopped the two prisoners - I took them into a public-house, and on Ashley I found this seven yards of silk, and Holland threw down this seven yards of ribbon - they told us they had found it under a gas-lamp, at the back of the London Hospital, which is about half a mile from the shop - the silk was rumpled up, under his coat, not in any paper - the streets were dirty, but there was neither dirt nor dust on the property.</p>

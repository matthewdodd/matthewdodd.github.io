On the 30th of March, about two o'clock, Moses Joseph came and brought a watch, a gold seal, and two keys; he wanted 15 s. for them; I asked whose they were; he said his brother's, who worked in Russell-court - I kept it, and told him to send his brother; a young woman came in soon afterwards, and gave me information - I went into the street, and saw Joseph looking at my window - I did not then see any body else; I sent a young man to take Joseph, which he did; I then sent for an officer. I saw Pitts pass the shop before the officer came - I called him in, and asked if he knew any thing of this young man; he said Yes: the young woman recollected him as being one of the boys who had spoken to her in the street; Pitt then said to Joseph,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you tell the truth?" Joseph said,</p>
               <p>"I don't care a pin about it;" I said,</p>

            . On the afternoon of the 30th of March I was in Exeter-street, going to see the last witness - the three prisoners were standing with their backs to the English Opera-house; Mortlock, whom I knew, crossed over, and asked if I would do him the favour to go to a pawnbroker's to own a watch which Joseph had been to pawn for 15 s. - it was a silver watch, with a seal, two keys, and a black ribbon; I said I did not like to do it; I then went on to Bennison's, and told her what they had said; I went to pawn a gown at Mr. Turner's - as I went down the court the prisoners asked me if I would own it then, and said they would watch me to see if I did; when I got to Mr. Turner's door Joseph again asked if I would own the watch - I said I would see about it; when I went in I saw him looking through the window; I told what he had said, and soon after Pitt came by, and I said that was another of them.</p>

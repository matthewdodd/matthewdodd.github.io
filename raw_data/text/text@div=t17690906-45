            . I am a pawnbroker in Bird-Street, Oxford Road. The prisoner came to my shop, and offered this spoon to sale on the 21st of August, in the morning. I told him the arms or name had been scratched out, and asked him how he came by it; he said he found it upon a dust-hill, in Mary-le-bone, near the place where I live. I asked him who had erased the mark out; he said that was done by a man that belongs to one Mr. Ward. I said I would go to that man; he did not agree to that, but said he would go and bring the owner. I asked him who he lived with; he said his master's name was Quin, and that he lived in Piccadilly. I took him to Sir John Fielding's, but Sir John was not at home; then the prisoner told me Mr. Burgell was the owner of the spoon. We sent for Mrs. Brooks, and she said it was her master's property. The prisoner is about seventeen or eighteen year old.</p>

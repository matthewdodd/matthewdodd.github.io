               <p>MR. FORBES. I am one of the landing waiters of his Majesty's customs. I was coming up Fleet-street along with Mr. Jones, on the evening of the 17th of May, between six and seven o'clock, I saw him seize Spencer and say, you rascal you have picked my pocket of a handkerchief, he was so close to him at the time, that he touched his clothes; Mr. Jones let him go and seized the other prisoner, who immediately dropped the handkerchief, Mr. Jones picked it up. I followed Spencer and took him in custody, the prisoner then told me that he had not been in Fleet-street that day.</p>

               <p>Brown's Defence. As I was walking in Fleet-street there was a man walking before me, it was not the other prisoner, he threw a handkerchief at me.</p>
               <p>Spencer's: Defence. I am innocent of it; I never was nigh the gentleman, within four hundred yards; there was a man went by me with a white jacket, I was going up to Somerset-house. I was stopped and put into a house; I said, what for; he said, picking my pocket; I said I never picked your pocket. Ask him if ever he put his hand upon me, before I was brought back by the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was in the act of seizing him, but seeing the handkerchief pass, I thought it was best to take him with the handkerchief, I then seized Brown.</p>

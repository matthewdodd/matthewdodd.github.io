                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Leuid Goose, and live in Caroline-buildings, Lambeth. On the night of the 10th of December, I went with him to the Marsh-gate public-house, inn the Westminster-road between eleven and twelve o'clock—the prisoner and several other per<lb></lb>sons were there—I knew him by sight before—the prisoner said to my husband "Will you stand some gin?"—my husband said "No"—I counted my money out into a bit of paper, at the same time, because I was going to put it separate from 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I was going to spend in tea and sugar that evening—I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when my husband refused to give any gin, the prisoner said, "You b—I will serve you out for it"—I then went out, and my husband followed me—when he came out he was struck by the prisoner several times—I could not perceive that the pri<lb></lb>soner was intoxicated—he struck my husband in the head and in the face mostly—a great many persons had followed us out of the public-house, and the prisoner was one—when we got to the Marsh-gate, my husband was hit again and stunned—he staggered, he had no sense in him—he was perfectly sober—a man, who is not in custody, said, "Now then, the left"—that man had hit my husband before, and knocked him down seve<lb></lb>ral times—the prisoner then seized my hand directly, and snatched the money away from it, saying, "Let go, you b----" he wrenched open the the hand, and run away immediately—I lost my boa at the time, but I do not charge the prisoner with that—the prisoner had an opportunity of seeing me counting my money at the public-house—I saw him look at me at the time. I am certain he saw me counting it, but I do not know that he knew the amount—he stood right before me, looking at me—my hus<lb></lb>band was greatly ill-used—they fractured his jaw—he lost nothing—I am certain what I have said is correct—he took from my hand 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was wrapped in a bit of newspaper.</p>

               <p>between eleven and twelve o'clock, with my wife—there were several men and woman there—the prisoner knew me before—he asked me to give him some gin—I did not answer him at first—he asked me again, and I said I should not—he then asked me again whether I would not stand a quarter—I said I should not; I did not see why I should stand gin for him—he then began to have words, and I told my wife we had better go out—she was putting some money into a piece of newspaper which was open in her hand—my wife went out first, and when I got to the door I received two violent blows in my mouth from the prisoner—they were fol<lb></lb>lowed up close—I was afterwards struck by several more persons when I go out—I was hit to a stand still, and my mouth was all in a gore of blood—a number of persons gathered round me—the prisoner followed with them—he walked alongside of me, and said if I had stood the gin the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> would not have happened—I had then got about a hundred yards from the public-house, towards my home—I was knocked down several times—I was then very near a hundred yards from the Marsh-gate—the Marsh-gate is nearly two hundred yards from the public-house, and I was about half-way from each—they wanted to drag me down a dark lane there—they said, "Bring the b----down here, and murder the b----down the lane"—they said that once I had them in my power, but I could not help myself—(I once belonged to the police)—with that somebody came up behind me and struck me with his fist, or something else, and fractured my jaw with the blow—I could not see what the blow was inflicted with—as soon as I could recover myself I was obliged to make my escape, for the mob was so strong on me—I did not fall from the blow—I went all <hi rend="italic">ajaw</hi> into the road—I went down through the gate—I was not knocked down—I gathered myself up—my hands were grazed—after I received the blow in the face I fell sprawling into the road, off the foot-path, on both my hands—I gathered up my hat and ran away, and the mob after me—I went home and stripped myself, for I was smothered in blood and mud—I changed my coat and hat, and then came back to look after my wife at the Marsh-gate—I was absent about an hour—I found her with a policeman at the Marsh—gate turnpike—she had no boa on then—she had had one when we left the public-house—I had given her the money on the Saturday evening, and saw the silver in her hand at the public-house—I have known the prisoner a long while while I was in the police—he never interfered with me, and I never had a word with him—I have since ascertained he was in liquor, or else I do not think he would have done it—he was always civil, and since I have been out I have been in the habit of seeing him every day—I com<lb></lb>plained directly to the police—my wife mentioned the prisoner, I believe, to the police, the same night, but not in my presence.</p>

I suppose it is the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with Goose?"—he said "Yes, it is—I said, "Very well, I am going to have a pint to beer, and will walk to the station-house with you"—I had the porter, and went to the station-house, and remained then while the policeman went to fetch Mrs. Goose—when she came she gave me in charge, but I had never seen her in my life, to my knowledge, before—I said it was a very hard case I should be given in charge, and I would not be locked up that night, but would come in the morning, if I was to be given in charge—I told the Magistrate I was very tipsy, and had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with the man, but the wife I never saw before.—if I had not been tipsy I should not have insulted him or any body.</p>

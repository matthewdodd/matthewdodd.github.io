            . I am watchman of St. Ann's. I met the prisoner in Market-street, on the 8th of November, at half-past four o'clock in the morning - she said she was an hour too late for her washing: she had these sheets and candlesticks before her - I followed her across the turning, and asked what she had - she said a sheet, which she was going to take to wash at her sister's - I said,"Here is a candlestick;" she said, "Yes, I am going to clean it" - I took her to the watch-house; she objected to the sheets being examined by a man, and took the candlesticks out herself - she gave me two false addresses - I at last found the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am cousin to Mr. Hawkins, and live with him; the candlesticks were in the parlour, and the sheets on the bed, at four o'clock on the 7th of November - I never saw the prisoner; I believe she must have got in through a servant who was rather in liquor.</p>

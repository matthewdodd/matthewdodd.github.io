On the 31st of July, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Newton-street, Holborn—I saw the prisoner carrying something heavy in a sack—he took it to a marine-store shop—I followed him, and took the sack off the counter—I asked what he had got in the sack—he said he did not know, but he was engaged by another man to carry it, and he was to have 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I waited a few minutes—no man came—I looked out, and saw no man—I kept it a few days, and found it had been taken from a workshop in Green Dragon-yard, Holborn—I have seen the lead fitted by two plumbers, and it fitted to the nail-holes.</p>

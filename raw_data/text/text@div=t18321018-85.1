            . In the forenoon of the 1st of October, I was standing at my shop-door in Wardour-street; I saw the prisoner with another boy about his size - they were walking close behind the prosecutor; I saw one of them make a motion to his pocket; the prisoner then took his handkerchief out, and walked down Edward-street - I went and told the prosecutor; just before I got to the prosecutor, I saw the prisoner shift the handkerchief to the other boy; they then went towards Kemp's-court - I secured the prisoner in Kemp's-court; I had only lost sight of him while I spoke to the prosecutor - I followed them, and saw them together again.</p>

I was going along the court; I saw Mr. Blond and Whitehead - they took me, but found nothing on me; another boy said "There he goes!" and the man ran after another lad - they then brought the handkerchief; I was indicted here before, and you gave me ten days and a flogging; when I went to my father, there was no home for me, and I was doing something to try to get into the refuge, as my father told me to go on the same rig again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale slop-seller, and live in Houndsditch, the prisoner had been in my service three or four years to cut out work. On the 10th of March, as usual, he left work about hall-past twelve o'clock to go to dinner—I desired the foreman to follow him and desire him to re<lb></lb>turn—he came back with my foreman—he could not have gone more than two or three yards—I asked him if he had any property of mine—he said no—his hat was then taken off, and two pieces of fustian found in it—I sent for an officer, and I told the prisoner I was pretty certain he had got more—he then drew two more pieces out of his trowsers, which I desired my clerk to mark.</p>

On the 1st of April, the prisoner took a lodging at my house, for the night only. Clarkson had lodged for five weeks in the same room that the prisoner slept in. The prisoner slept there two nights, and paid me 6d. per night for the bed. On the 2d of April, about a quarter before four o'clock, previous to day-light, I was alarmed by the watchman. I am quite sure I had fastened the house. I found the prisoner gone, and the door wide open. There was no appearance of violence-it must have been opened from within. Clarkson missed his things. The prisoner was taken the next night.</p>
               <p>PETER CLARKSON. The prisoner lodged in the same room with me for two nights. There was another man slept in the same room who was blind: my things laid on a chair. About five o'clock in the morning, I was awoke: it was just day-light. The prisoner was gone: he had not said he was going. The blind man remained in bed. When the prisoner was taken, I saw some of my property again.</p>

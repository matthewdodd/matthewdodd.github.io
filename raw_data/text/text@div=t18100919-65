On the 21st of August, I went to fetch twenty eight pound of tea from Mr. Jeroms, in the Poultry, for my master; I took it on my shoulder and carried it as far as Bishopgate-street, there a young man accosted me; he asked me what I had got in the bag, and where I was going; he left me at Sun-street. I carried the tea further on, he came up to me again, then he asked me whether I would have any beer, there was a cart coming on, he desired me to put it in the cart, it would be a rest for me; he took it off my shoulder and put it in, that was in Norton Falgate; we walked on as far as the Black Dog, in Shoreditch; he stopped at the public house and gave me some beer, he wanted me to go in the Black Dog, I would not go in, the cart went on. While I was standing at the Black Dog, I saw the cart stop at Mr. Wests, the grocer, in <placeName id="t18100919-65-crimeloc357">Shoreditch</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. No. I was about twenty yards off, I ran after him, crying out, stop thief, directly I saw him take it out. He went down Swan-yard, I ran after him; a gentlemen stopped him with the bag on his shoulder in Webb-square. He was out of my sight, it was five minutes before I came up to him, he had the bag on his shoulder, Mr. Stamford<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190038"></xptr>took him in custody; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said, he was going to take it home for me.

               <p>Q. Are you sure the person that was stopped in Webb-square, was the same person that you saw take it out of the cart - A. Yes.</p>

On the 21st of August I saw the prisoner coming down Webb-square, coming out of Shoreditch, he was walking very fast, he had a bag under his arm; Collins came up to me, and asked me whether I had seen a man go past; I told Collins which way he was gone. Mr. Gilbert took him in custody, and they sent for an officer.</p>

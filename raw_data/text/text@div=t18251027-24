               <p>JAMES HENRY CRAWFORD. The prisoner was in my service. After he left me I went with the officer to the house of Dr. Jenner - I found him there and said "You have got yourself into a pretty situation;" he denied robbing me at all: I said it was useless his denying it, as I had seen part of the articles at his lodgings: he then fell on his knees and begged I would forgive him - some of them are new.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. Since May last - he had a good character.</p>

These were cast away clothes, and were in a box of which Mr. Crawford has the key: I took the razors to get cleaned; he went to put on the trousers and they would not button, and he gave them to me to put in the box; I left the house in a day or two, and took the box, to let him have them when he wanted them.</p>

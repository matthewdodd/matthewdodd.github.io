                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Saturday morning, the 29th of January, I was in company with Trew, an officer, in Montague-street, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner, in company with two men, about the middle of the street, about a mile and a half from London-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner had a bundle—the other two separated from him, and crossed over—I stopped the prisoner, and asked what he had got in the bundle—k said it was dirty things he was going to take to have washed—I asked where—he said, "A little lower down"—I examined the bundle—it con<lb></lb>tained three clean sheets, rough dried—he said he had brought them from on board a ship which lay at Limehouse-hole—I asked the captain's name—he said, "Kirk"—I asked the ship's name—he said, <hi rend="italic">"Goldsmith</hi>"—I took him to the station—the prosecutor claimed the sheets.</p>

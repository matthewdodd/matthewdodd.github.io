I turned round; I did not observe the prisoners near me; an officer came up, and asked if I had lost my handkerchief; I felt, and it was gone from my inside coat-pocket; it was safe shortly before; the officer produced it - I went back with him to the public-house, and found the two prisoners in custody.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOSEPH CADBY. I am a constable of Clerken well. I was with Colton on the 16th, in Beech-street, and saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor and his friend; I watched them - I saw Sterne leave the other prisoner and cross over to the other side of the road - they were near the prosecutor at that time; after Sterne had got on the same side of the way as we were, Clement 
               <persName id="t18330103-102-person1036">drew</persName>
             the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket - he crossed over, and had hardly reached Sterne before we took them both into custody - the handkerchief was on the ground; I did not see from whom it dropped; Clements caused a scuffle in endeavouring to escape; Sterne was quiet, and did not at all endeavour to escape; they were close together when the handkerchief was found; there were one or two other persons passing, but not in their company.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You never saw Sterne with it? A. No, he was on the other side of the way when it was taken; he did not offer to receive it, and made no resistance; but said he was willing to go any where.</p>

            . I was in company with Cadby on the opposite side of the road - I observed the two prisoners behind Mr. Pidding and another gentleman; Sterme crossed the road, and about two minutes before he had got across, I saw Clements take something from Mr. Pidding's pocket - he crossed over, and had hardly got to Sterue before I laid hold of him, and the handkerchief was dropped; I did not see him drop it - Cadby picked it up by his feet, and he ran away; Sterne did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Sterne attempt to take any thing? A. He did not, nor did he attempt to take it up.</p>
               <p>Clements. He said at Worship-street that I did not run away, but made a rustle out of his arm - I did not run at all, I only stooped my head down.</p>

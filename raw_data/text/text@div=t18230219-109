            . I am a Bow-street officer. On Sunday, the 19th of January, about ten o'clock at night, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner Cherry's house, at No. 8, Almonry, Westminster - she was in the front parlour; I asked if she had not got some one concealed in the back parlour; she said No, there was no one - she took the candle up, and went into the back parlour with us; we saw nobody there, but I saw a cupboard with a padlock on it, and asked what she had got there - she said there was nobody there, nor anything belonging to any one. She immediately blew the candle out, and went into the front parlour. I said I insisted upon seeing what was in it, the candle was lighted, and she unlocked it, pulled a bag out, and tried to conceal it in front of her. I caught hold of it, and asked if she knew what it contained; she made no answer - I opened it, and found a silver tea spoon, a knife with a silver handle, and other articles of plate. After that she said it belonged to a man who was up stairs. I went up and found Kinder laying on a bed with his coat off, and two women in the room, (there were two men down stairs.) I asked Kinder if he had got anything below; he made no answer, but said afterwards that what was there was his own. He gave me his name, but refused to say where he lived, and said it was hard to detain him as it was his own property. I took them to Bow-street, and found a bill of parcels in the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She tried to conceal the bag - A. She put it between her knees. There was nothing else in the cupboard but old rags.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Snowsell. There was a bed in the back parlour, and only one person could get between it and the cupboard. Cherry went to the cupboard, dragged the bag out, and put it between her legs; it was concealed under some old rags. Cherry had put the candle out.</p>

            . I am a working jeweller, and do business for the prosecutors. On the 15th of January, Kinder brought some plate, and took some back - I believe I myself delivered him the knife, but I am not certain.

               <p>KINDER'S Defence. My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury, however imprudently I may have acted, I feel concious of no intention to defraud my employers - I have indeed been guilty of great excesses, but is it possible to suppose I should let the plate remain in the bag till Sunday. The woman was ignorant of my conduct.</p>
               <p>CHERRY'S Defence. I gave him the key to look into the cupboard, and did not conceal the bag, but gave it him out of the cupboard, and said I did not know what it contained. The prisoner gave it me to take care of, and I gave him the key to lock it up himself. I gave the officer two candles, and insisted on his looking all over the house.</p>

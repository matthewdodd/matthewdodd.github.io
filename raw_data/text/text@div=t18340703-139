            . I live at No. 41, Lothbury, and am housekeeper to Mr. Pearce. On the 17th of May, the prisoner came in the morning with a boy, and swept one chimney - he came again in the afternoon and swept two more - I then paid him 3s. for them, for his master, Mr. Badger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. When was your attention drawn to this circumstance? A. About a fortnight after it took place - I put down this money in my pay books, but it is not here - I did not say, when I paid the prisoner, "This is for Mr. Badger" - I said, "There is the money for sweeping the chimney."</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you give the boy some halfpence? A. Yes, I did - I sent to Mr. Badger, and this person came about nine o'clock in the morning, and about four or five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Lecount by at the time? A. No - I am the only person who receives money, and the only person who can write - if the boys bring the money, and I am not at home, they pay Mr. Badger or Mrs. Badger - they have paid the servant; but there was no servant there then.</p>

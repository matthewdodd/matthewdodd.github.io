            . I keep Mr. Peak's house. On the 8th of August, about ten minutes before eight in the morning, I was going up with a tea-kettle of water, I saw somebody going up the two pair of stairs, I called to him, I said, oh, Billy, why do you go up in such a way; at my speaking he went up stairs so softly, it was impossible for any body to hear him; I heard him come down; I said, oh dear, how you frighten me; I did not know him. I heard something rattle in his apron; I was frightened, I thought he had been in that room to take something; I shoved open the room door, I called after him, oh, you have got the time piece.</p>
               <p>Q. From what room was the time-piece taken - A. From the one pair front. The prisoner ran down stairs, I ran to the street-door, and called for assistance; Mr. Swinton came and took the prisoner in the coal cellar; he brought him up stairs; he had not the time-piece, when brought up stairs; I had seen the time-piece not a quarter of an hour before.</p>

Yes, this good lady came in and said there was a thief in the house, I went down stairs, and there the prisoner was shut up in a bit of a coal cellar; I said what do you do here; he said do forgive me, I have not got any money. I then said what have you done with the timepiece. He went with me into the other cellar, and pointed out where it was. I took it up, and gave it to

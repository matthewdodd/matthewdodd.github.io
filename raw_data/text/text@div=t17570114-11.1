            . The day after the prosecutor was rob'd he came to my house, and told me he had got in liquor, in Petticoat-Lane, in a court, where he had been rob'd, and said he should take it as a favour if I'd go with him and see for the persons that rob'd him. I went with him. We light of Pressman and Bennet. We laid hold of them. I asked them how they came to serve the young fellow so. They said if he would not hurt them they would let him have his things again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he promise them he would not?</p>
               <p>Conner. He did. I asked them where they were. Pressman said the watch was very safe, and in an honest person's hands (which was the prisoner Standard.) I went to Standard's house. As soon as she saw me she fell on her knees and said, '' Lord! Mr. Conner, what must I do? I was '' going to bed and Pressman put a watch into my '' hand, which I understand she did not come honestly '' by.'' I said, where is the watch? She said, '' Here it is, and I am frighted out of my wits.'' Then I came back again, and Pressman and Bennet told me the knee buckles were pawned.</p>
               <p>Court. The knee-buckles are not laid in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost them at the same time.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these shoe buckles produced, are they the same?</p>

               <p>I have so far to say that all these women are clear. I know nothing of them, but only as neighbours. Barnes came up to have his shoes clean'd, and there is a fidler lives over that room; he hearing a noise had a mind to stay. Philips was lying upon the boards. He gave her twopence, and two-pence to the fidler for playing, and sent for six or seven pots of beer and purl, and not having money enough he sent his watch seal to pawn by Philips for money. Let him deny it if he can.</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all about it.</p>

               <p>I never saw the prosecutor in my life, this woman (looking to Pressman) came to me and put this watch into my hand; it was very warm, I did not know what it was. I lighted a candle and was frighted when I saw it. I went to a friend and said I was ruined for ever, and in the morning when Mr. Conner and the prosecutor came to my house I delivered it to them.</p>

             (Police-constable G 79). At four o'clock in the morning, of the 29th of June, I was on duty in Leather-lane; I saw the prisoner in the <placeName id="t18320705-178-crimeloc944">George and Dragon-yard</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear I had the coat on my back? A. Yes; I pursued you - you were taken close against me: I was within two yards of you.</p>

The officer opened the bundle, and took the coat out of it, and now he says I had it on -I met a man, who asked if I would earn a shilling or two; he said if I would go with him up the yard he would give me something to carry, and at ten o'clock in the morning he would pay me - he gave me the bundle.</p>

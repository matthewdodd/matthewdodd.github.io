                  </hi> I live at 7, St. George's court, Bluegate-fields. On Friday night, 28th Jan., I was at the Lord Lovet beer-shop, with Julia Lyons—the prisoner came in and called me—I did not go, and he called me again, and said he only wanted to speak to me for a few minutes outside—I consulted with Lyons, and then went with him to the Duke of York, and had a quartern of rum there—we then went to another public-house, and had some beer and rum—about twelve o'clock he went home with me, and we went to bed together—I could not go to sleep, and in the course of the night he asked me if I could not go to sleep—I told him no, and he said he could not go to sleep—he went to sleep after that—I awoke about seven—I told him I wanted to get up and do my washing—we both went to sleep for a little while after that, and about a quarter-past eight I told him that two young women up stairs were getting up, and I must get up—he said something, but I can hardly recollect what—we had had no quarrel on the Saturday previous—he asked me what day it was—I told him Saturday—something was said about the word "goose," but I cannot recollect what—he stuck a knife into the front of my throat, which bled—I cried, out, "Murder!"—I told him, while my throat was bleeding, I would forgive him if he left off—he did not leave off—I cannot say what more happened, for I had no feeling—I did not faint, but I could not tell where he was stabbing me—he kept on stabbing me—after some time I called out for Catherine, the young woman who keeps the house; and he said, "What! not dead yet?"—a young man then broke open</p>

On Friday night, 28th Jan., the prosecutrix and prisoner came to my house and went to bed in the down-stairs room—I slept in the room immediately above them—there are but two rooms—between eight and nine o'clock on Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing I heard Kale cry out, "Murder!" and say that her throat was cut—I had not heard any disturbance before that—I got up and went into the room—she was then on her face and hands at the foot of the bed with her chemise on—she was in the attitude of getting away from the prisoner, who was stabbing her on the backside—there was a good deal of blood on her—I went up stairs to tell a young woman who was with me, opened the window, and called "Murder!"—a young man going past burst the door open—he got a poker from next door, and staid till the policeman came—Kale escaped into the street—a knife was afterwards found in the room—I saw the prisoner's hand moving, as if in the act of stabbing.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, at High-street, Shadwell. On 29th Jan. I was called to 7, St. George's-court, and examined the prosecutrix—I found numerous wounds on her body—she was bleeding profusely from some of them—there were two superficial wounds on the right side of the head, one on the front, and rather to the right side of the throat, a deep wound on the back of the neck, a very severe wound on the upper right arm, penetrating to</p>

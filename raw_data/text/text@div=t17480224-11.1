             was just gone by with a mug, which they supposed to be silver, so drunk, that he could hardly stand; he went into an entry, and endeavoured to put it into his pocket. This is the mug. I asked him whose it was, and he said it was his. The Prisoner is a silver-smith, and I did not know but he might have it to do something to; I looked at it , and found no fault but a bruise on the side; and I suppose he hit it against something, in order to get it into his pocket. I saw a Castle upon it, and I went to Mr. Broome's, who keeps the <placeName id="t17480224-11-crimeloc63">Castle at Cow-Cross</placeName>

               <p>Mr. Broome. This is my mug.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green (Constable.) This mug was delivered to me at Justice Poulson's, and he ordered me to keep it till it was called for.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see it in the custody of the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Green. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not hit it against any thing to bruise it, but I run against a post and bruised it . I did not know whether it was silver or pewter.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to bring the mug out of the house?</p>
               <p>Pris. I was going home with a pint of beer in it, and was very drunk.</p>

I went to the house; it was a house I had ready-furnished, which was not then occupied, but was ready for a tenant; it was about two or three hundred yards from my own house. I examined which way they came in, and found a pane of glass was broke in a window in the yard to come at the bar; I perceived farther the traces of their feet; they had forced the bars. I was sent for to the Justice's; there I saw most of my things; and the prisoner did own that they were my things, and came out of my house. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

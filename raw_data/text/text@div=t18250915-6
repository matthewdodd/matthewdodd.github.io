            . On the 26th of August I was staying at Mr. James Window's, my brother-in-law, who lives in <placeName id="t18250915-6-crimeloc40">Upper Bedford-place</placeName>

I was down stairs about twelve o'clock, directing the wine-merchant's men where to put the wine, and observed a man walk out of the pantry, with a bundle in his arm - I asked what he wanted; he said he came after a groom's place; I asked why he went into the pantry - he said he did not go in, he only knocked at the door; he then put down the bundle outside the pantry window, in the area, and went away up the area steps; the servant fetched me the bundle - it was not out of my sight: it contained a silver coffee biggin. The wine merchant's boy came into the area, and I sent him in pursuit, and the servants also followed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Are you certain what parish the house is in? A. I have seen the rates paid, and am certain it is in St. Pancras.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Window, and had the care of the plate. I know the coffee biggin perfectly well, and saw it in the pantry closet on the morning in question. On the alarm being given I went to the closet, and missed the biggen and milk-pot, which I had seen safe not ten minutes before. I then went after the prisoner down Bernard-street; he came running down Wilmot-street: he saw me running without a bonnet, and ran quicker. I called Stop thief! he threw down the milk-pot in the area of No. 9. Grenville-street, and was stopped and given into custody. I am sure he is the man - he was never out of my sight; I saw the milk-pot thrown down: he pushed it through the iron railing, and dropped it.</p>

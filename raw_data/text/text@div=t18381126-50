                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live at Hadstock Folly, Bucks. On the afternoon of the 29th o£ October, I saw my black gelding safe in the field—it was branded with J Y on each hoof, and had a switch tail—the gate of the field was shut—I went next day to the field and the horse was gone—I traced footmarks out at the top gate down the turnpike road leading towards London—the prisoner bad lodged at my house two or three nights—he came on the 27th under the pretence of buying cattle—he came again on the 28th, and stopped at my house all night, and about three o'clock in the next afternoon he went away, saying he should return that night, but he did not, which made me suspect him—I afterwards received information from Bates, and found my horse at Smithfield—it is worth from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also lost a bridle and saddle out of my stable.</p>

On the 30th of October, about one o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came there with a black horse, which had a white star on the forehead, and was marked J Y on all four hoofs—the tail appeared to have been cut off clumsily with a knife or something, not as a carrier would do it—he told me he had rode him fifty-two miles that day, and wished me to take care of him—the horse was fed in the stable, and he afterwards came and borrowed a pair of scissors of me to square the horse's tail—the horse was turned into the field for two or three nights, and afterwards Greenwood and another came down on the 7th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, and bargained with the prisoner to buy the horse, and they took it</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in bones, and live in Cow Cross, Smithfield. On the 7th of November, I was at Holsden-green, near Wilsden, in company with Sutton, and saw the prisoner—he asked me if I wanted to buy a horse, as he had one to sell—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have one turned out in the field that will suit you"—the ostler fetched it up—he told me he gave 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said I could not afford that, I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he agreed, and I got the horse, but did not pay all the money then—on the 9th I sent Whitty with it to Smithfield to be sold—I have seen it since in Bates's custody—it is the same horse.</p>

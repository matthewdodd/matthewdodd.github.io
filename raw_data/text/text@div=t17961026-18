               <p>I am a Custom-house-officer: On the 19th of this month, I took the two prisoners coming on shore, one with forty pounds weight of sugar in a bag, and the other, eight pounds, upon <placeName id="t17961026-18-crimeloc108">Wiggins's Quay</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there more sugar in the lighter than this? - A. Yes, there was; when they were coming on shore, I insisted upon seeing what they had got, and they said it was scraings; I examined the bag, and found it neat sugars, except about half-a-pound of scrapings mixed with it in the bag; the small bag was nett sugar; Saunders had the large bag, and Phillips the small one; the watchman upon the lighter said, blast you, you have made a better day's work than I have.</p>

               <p>What time of the day was it? - Between the hours of one and two.</p>
               <p>What else did you see? - I did not see any thing more; my wife will give you an account of what passed afterwards; I did not suspect him, because I thought he was going to the person who lodges up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>MARGARET DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>It was past one when I heard a great noise.</p>
               <p>Do you know what day of the week it was? - Thursday, the 9th of August, I went up one pair of stairs, I found the door fast; I went up to the two pair of stairs, and I found that door fast; I was going up the other pair of stairs, and I met the prisoner coming down with a pair of sheets in his hand; as soon as he saw me, he dropped the sheets behind him, and wanted to sit down, I would not let him; he appeared to me to be very ill, or drunk, or something.</p>
               <p>Who lived up three pair of stairs? - Nobody; my husband and I slept in that room.</p>
               <p>Produce the sheets.</p>
               <p>(The sheets produced.)</p>
               <p>Are those the sheets you took up, and that you saw the prisoner drop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are they your sheets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where had they been? - This sheet lay on the bed the night before, and this sheet lay at the bed's foot.</p>
               <p>When had you seen them last? - I left the room about ten in the morning when I came down with some soul clothes.</p>
               <p>Were they there then? - Yes, my Lord, and I locked the door.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120023"></xptr>Did you go up stairs after you had found the sheets on the stairs? - Yes, immediately after, and I found the room door burst open, and all the things strewed about the room.</p>
               <p>Are there any particular marks on those sheets? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know them, any further than by meeting the prisoner upon the stairs, and finding the sheets there? - When I went up stairs, I missed them from the bed, and he left the under sheet lying upon the bed, he did not take that off.</p>
               <p>Then you found the under sheet on, but the upper one was gone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How could any body get in? - I locked the door and laid the key on the chimney-piece in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Was the door open when you went up? - The hinge of the door was broke off, and the lock was still on.</p>
               <p>Did you see the sheets in the prisoner's hands? - I saw them dropping behind him at the time; I knew he had broke the door open when I saw the sheets.</p>
               <p>Was the noise you heard, like the noise of breaking open a door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any marks on those sheets? - No marks, but when I saw them I knew them.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to swear with certainty that they are your sheets? - My husband has some cloth of the same.</p>
               <p>Jury. There can be no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not in my senses.</p>
               <p>He says he was not in his senses; you say he appeared as if he had been drinking or something like that? - He did, and he seemed to sit, but I would not let him.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to him? - I told him directly I saw him, that he broke the door open, and he said he wanted to go to sleep.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you ever seen him before? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>As I was going out between one and two; I saw a man standing at a distance from the door; when I came home I heard a noise up stairs, and presently I saw my landlady and the prisoner coming down stairs, and she had hold of him by the lap of his coat, she asked me if I knew him; I told her I had never seen him before that I know'd of; I asked him what business he had up stairs, and he said he come to put up the heel of his shoe; I told him it was very odd for him to come there to put up the heel of his shoe, and he must have come there on some other business; and then he said he came to seek his sister.</p>
               <p>Had he any sister there lived thereabouts? - No.</p>
               <p>What else passed? - I asked him his his sister's name; when I asked him that he could not give any answer, and he said he wanted to sleep, then there was no more passed, then Mr. Davis detected him.</p>
               <p>Did he appear drunk, or mad, or insane? - He rather appeared in liquor.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was very much in liquor and don't know what I did; I happened to be at the prosecutor's house, and had got a little beer more than ordinary; and as I was coming along, I saw a man come out of this house and drop a bundle, and I went and picked it up, and tumbled down in the entry: I work for Mr. Felton of Highgate; I have got a wife and five small children; I never did such a thing in all my life; I always work'd hard for my bread, and never did such a thing since I was born.</p>

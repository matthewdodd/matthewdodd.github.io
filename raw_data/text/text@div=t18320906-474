               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Three in the morning is rather a late hour? A. Yes, rather later than usual; these cigars have been kept by the Excise since the Magistrate delivered them up - I am certain they were not removed at three o'clock in the morning for fear of the Excise; I was detained there by two gentlemen from the Piazza-hotel, sitting smoaking there, and it would not do for me to turn them out - I am an Englishman; I have adopted the name of Henriquez, which is over my window, owing to my connexion with the Havannah and Spanish America - I have given receipts in that name.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe what Jepsom and the other man did at the shop door? A. No; they went to it, and it opened at the instant - I had known Barrett before, but I do not know that I had seen him on a coach - I had known Jepsom by sight for twelve months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And saw him fifty times a day? A. Yes, but I cannot tell what day it was; I have a constant place - I have before been in shops, and at various places; I never was in business: I do not know

            . I vam street-keeper of Covent-garden market. On the morning of the 30th of May I saw Read, about seven o'clock - from what he said I went to the Piazza, near the prosecutor's shop; I saw Barrett driving the hackney-coach; I stopped it, and found these two bags of segars, and five bundles tied in an apron - I took them to the station, and gave information to the prosecutor; I found the shop closed; we could not get in- I believe it was fastened with a latch; I knew both the prisoners, and had seen them about the coach-stand, among the hackney-coachmen and cads, but I do not know that I ever saw Barrett drive a coach before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you seen the prisoners in company? A. I do not recollect that I have - Barrett was driving a coach, No. 154, belonging to Mr. Bird, of Rathbone-place - I took it to the Green-yard, but I believe it has been restored.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you perfectly sober? A. I was; I have known Barrett six years; he drove a hackney-coach five years ago, and since then he has been a sort of cad - I have seen him about I cannot tell how lately before. I took him; when I took him, he said he had been engaged by two gentlemen in James-street, to drive round to the Plazzs, and to stop at the Piazza coffee-house - he said he was driving Shirley's coach for him while he got his supper; I believe he said her Shirtley-deshed him to drive one fare, and then return; he did not say that Shirley had then sent him with another fare, nor that he drove a fare to Islington; Mr. Bird and his man (who I believe is Shirley) attended at the office, but I do not think he was examined - I put the coach and horses into the green-yard - I have heard a deposit was left, and they were given up - I attend the market as a street-keeper; I did not apprehend Barrett at all - I indicted him, and a true bill was found, I believe, on the last day of last Session.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever see Jepsom, and the persons you call his friends, in company? A. Not in our shop; he had just gone out when they came in - I have seen them at Mr. Smart's public-house, in Drury-lane; I lived five months with Mr. Parry; his is not a divan, but persons smoke there sometimes - we shut up at twelve or one o'clock, or sometimes later; I left about one o'clock on the night of the 29th of May - there was no one there smoking then.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Vauxhallwalk, and am an earthenware and stone-manufacturer. I have lived there forty-eight years, and been in business twenty-five - it is within a quarter of a mile of Vauxhall-gardens; I have a daughter named Susan - she became of age on the 29th of May, and we went to Windsor; Mrs. Wood, myself, and my two daughter in a chaise - Mr. Wood and the prisoner Jepsom in a gig - we left Vauxhall-road about six or seven o'clock in the morning, and we got home again about two in the morning of the 30th - we stopped at Windsor till late, and then went to Hampton, where I have several friends; we took tea there, and did not leave till eleven at night, and in consequence of that we were so late in town; the whole party came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060182"></xptr>house, and stopped there an hour - Mr. and Mrs. Wood are tenants of mine, and live next door; they and Jepsom left my house together about a quarter or twenty minutes after three - Jepsom was asked to stay, but he refused, as he lived in town.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is that daughter here? A. No, she is in Staffordshire; my youngest daughter is at home - Mr. Wood is here, but I believe not Mrs. Wood: she is ill - I saw her at my house this morning: I do not know where Jepsom lived in town - he came with Wood that morning; my daughter was Christened at Lambeth church - I have not brought the register of her haptisin: we got to Windsor about eleven o'clock - we dined there, but I cannot say at what inn: we left about eight o'clock in the evening; I think we dined about two - we got to Hampton at halfpast nine or ten; the ladies had tea, and Jepsom, Wood, and I had two or three glasses of brandy and water - I have the bill now in my pocket; I know Hampton - I went to take a son of mine to the Bell there some time before, but that night we went to the Lion, kept by Mr. Lawrence - I got this bill on the day I paid it; I had it accidentally in my pocket to-day - I believe it is not usual to have bills marked "Paid" at public-houses.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. What had you drank in the day? -A. We took our own provisons, and half a dozen of wine and two bottles of brandy; we had four glasses of brandy and water at Hampton - we had not finished our own brandy; we brought one bottle home, and I think three bottles of wine; I have only known Jepsom since Wood took my house at Lady-day last - I have seen him come backwards and forwards; I understood he bought and sold, but I do not know what - I do not know his character or his circumstances; Mr. Wood asked him to go with us that day, I did not - I do not know that my house was searched last night; the officer was there, just to ask where Mrs. Wood lived - I did not know another person named Wood; Mr. Wood's house was searched last night - I am quite sure it was past three o'clock before Jepsom left my house on the 30th of May; it was past two before we got home - we were sober enough to know what we were about, to take the horses out, and put them up - we went to bed as soon as Mr. and Mrs. Wood went home: I was told I should be wanted to give evidence soon after Jepsom was taken; Wood told me of it; I will swear I have not got this bill since Jepsom was taken.</p>

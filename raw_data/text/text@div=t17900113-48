               <p>Concerning the tinder-box that was found on the prisoner, it was my property; I gave it him; I know him to be a hard working honest man; I never heard any thing else of him: I know his friends.</p>
               <p>Court. A man snatching a thing from a person is not a robbery; about four score years ago, it was held so by a very great authority; now the law is, that there must be some violence used by the thief, towards the person that is robbed; independant of the mere act of taking the things out of their possession; or there must be a struggle: now, in this case, if the bundle had been taken from the person, it would have mounted to a robbery, but the taking the umbrella does not amount to a robbery; as far as the bundle was in question, there was a struggle between them about it, and if after that struggle, he had got the bundle by force, it would have been a robbery: it is very much like snatching off a man's hat; if done without any threat or menace, it is a felony, and not a robbery.</p>

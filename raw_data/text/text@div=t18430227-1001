                  </hi>. I live with my father, John Irwin, who keeps the Anchor and Hope beer shop in Spencer-street, St. George's. On the 6th of Feb. I saw the prisoner with a person in the tap-room at my father's—they came about twelve o'clock, and stopped till nearly three—I then missed the pri<lb></lb>soner, and did not see him any more—after that James Beard came and spoke to me—I lifted up the window and saw that the brass cock was broken off from the pipe that runs from the kitchen up the wall, and to the butt—the cock was not broken, but I saw the the pipe without it—I have never seen the cock since—it was my father's property—I had seen it attached to the pipe the same morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Whitmore-street, Hoxton. On the 7th of January I was at the Bell, at Hoxton—I placed two sovereigns and three half-crowns on the table—the prisoner, who was in the room, took them off the table before my face, and went off—I told my son to follow him—he caught him in the passage—they both fell down—he got up, struggled, and ran off—I lost sight of them both—I am sure he is the person.</p>

I was at this publichouse—my father got up, and said, "That man has robbed me"—I detained him—we both fell on the floor—he got from me, and ran—there was no one there to run after him—I followed him to the Green Man, and there gave him in charge, about half-an-hour after the money was lost—no money was found—he was in company with one or two others at the Green Man, who he seemed to know.</p>

I took hold of the prisoner near the Green Man—he asked me what I wanted him for—I said, "For felony"—he said, "What felony?"—I said, "For robbing Cull"—he said it was no such thing—coming up to the Green Man, he said, "There is a person in here, that can satisfy you that what this man says is incorrect"—he then broke from me, and went into the house—I was not strong at that time; indeed, I am under the doctor's bands now—I afterwards found him in Hammond-square, behind some bricks—he went from there to Dennis-place—he there struck me, bit my hand, and threw me down—"Now," he said, "you b—y b—r, I have got you, I will serve you out"—I called out, "Murder"—he ran away, and I lost sight of him altogether—I was laid up for ten days in consequence of his violence.</p>

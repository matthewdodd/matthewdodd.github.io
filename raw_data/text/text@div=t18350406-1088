                  </hi>. I keep the White Hart Inn, Stockwell-street, Greenwich. The prisoner has been my household-servant for about two months—I missed money on various occasions—in one week I lost 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a drawer—I marked four half-crowns and twenty shillings on the 4th of March, which I put into my till about eleven o'clock in the evening—I went into a room opposite the bar, where I could see through a window what took place in the bar—I saw the prisoner (after watching her mistress to see that she did not see her) open the till, and put her hand in—I waited where I was, and then saw the prisoner go to a table next to where her mistress was, take a bunch of keys, and walk to the pri<lb></lb>vate drawer, where we keep notes and gold—she opened the drawer with a key and put her hand in—at that moment I went to her and said, "Now I have detected you; I have long suspected you, and now I have found you"—I called Mr. Fagan, and told the prisoner to give up all the money she had taken from the till—she at first denied that she had taken any, and then said, "It was only half-a-crown"—I then took the other out of the till, and told Mr. Fagan it was marked, and what she had on her was marked in the same way—we found two shillings and half-a-crown short, and they were found on the prisoner.</p>

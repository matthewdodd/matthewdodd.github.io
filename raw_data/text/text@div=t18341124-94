On the 5th of November, I went with Tilt to watch for the prisoner, Taylor, near Tottenham—I saw him coming along the road, driving Mr. Ellis's load of hay—we followed him till he came opposite the White Hart, when the waggon stopped, and I saw the tarpauling move—I then saw a truss of hay, and took it to the office.</p>

I have had no hay in my possession"—I apprehended him, and gave him to Vann—we took the two prisoners and the hay to the office.</p>

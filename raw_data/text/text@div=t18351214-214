I am in the service of John Davies, a silk-mercer, in Dover-street, Peccadillo, in the Parish of St. George, Hanover-square; it is his dwelling-house, On the 8th of December, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a noise in the parlour abjoining the ware house—the noise appeared to be in the warehouse—I immediately went there, and found the prisoner, who was a perfect stranger to us—he had a a roll of silk—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he wanted Captain Johnson—I said no such person lived there, and took him into custody—he threw the silk into the place he had taken it from—when I first saw him, he had it in his hand—I fetched a policeman, leaving the prisoner in the custody of a young man—the silk is worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

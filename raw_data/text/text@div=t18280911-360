On the evening of the 8th of September I was in the back room, and caught a glimpse of a hand taking something from the window; he came close to the counter, and took something from the window, and either gave it to another man at the door, or else he passed that man and the other came in - I went to the door, and called Stop thief! my husband followed me- I passed one of them just in the shop (I believe that was English;) my husband followed the other, who was running - English walked out after the other; he did not run.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JONES. My wife called out; I came out - she said, "There he goes;" I saw a man running, and pursued him; English (who was just at the door) put his foot forward to trip me up; I think it was intentional - I still followed the other man; I lost sight of him as he turned the corner, and when I turned I found him in custody - it was Just; I believe him to be the man: I put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110171"></xptr>my hand on his shoulder, and he dropped the starch on the ground - it was one of my parcels, and on returning to the shop I missed one parcel of starch.</p>

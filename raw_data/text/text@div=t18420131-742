                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Seymour-terrace, Chel<lb></lb>sea. On the 12th of July last the prisoner called on me about a house of mine at Kensington—she represented herself to be a lady from Axminster, who kept her carriage, and had no children—she said she supposed I wanted a reference—I said yes, and she referred to Mr. Squires, her agent, who advanced her income—I saw him, and he represented himself as a lawyer—I rather objected to him, as I do not like lawyers—he then told me he was a stock-broker, and his name was in the list; in consequence of this I let the prisoner the house at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—I went there on the 6th of January, and saw the prisoner going out at the street-door—I said, "Good day to you, Mrs. Price"—she said, "I did not expect you to-day; I am go<lb></lb>ing out to dye a gentleman's hair"—I went in, and she conducted me to the kitchen—I had left a large chest under her care, which contained a consi<lb></lb>derable part of my property, and the first thing I noticed was that the seals of the chest were broken—I said, "I have not got the key of the chest here, but I charge you with breaking the seals, and I shall send for a policeman"—the policeman came, and we proceeded over the house, but, before that, the prisoner said my things were pledged, and that was the only crime she had done—I then missed the bed-furniture, the knives and forks, which she had pledged three days after she came into the house, and the rest of the articles named.</p>

I confess to pledging the other property, but no fraud was intended, as I expected I should have had the means to redeem them before detection could occur; and I beg to state, that I have received information since my confinement that funds will be shortly at my disposal, which I have ordered may be immediately applied to the payment of all just demands."</p>

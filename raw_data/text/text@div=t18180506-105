            . I am a hawker, and live at Laleham, about two miles from the house. I went to the prisoner's house in consequence of what my wife told me, and asked him if he had any lead to sell? he said he had; I asked him if he came honestly by it? he said he did - He did not shew it to me. I thought I would make further inquiry; I heard Mr. Winch had lost some, and told him. On the 16th of April I went to his house and weighed the lead; I again asked him if he got it honestly? he said, Yes, but would not tell me where he got it. The constable and Mr. Winch came in and took him. We found 212lbs. of lead there. I took the pipe to the house, and it fitted in every respect.</p>

            . I am constable of Shepperton. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house with the lead; next morning I went to his house, and found a pipe, weighing 19lbs. which fitted the house exactly; the rest was cut into too small pieces to fit-it was gutter lead. The prisoner said he helped to steal it.</p>

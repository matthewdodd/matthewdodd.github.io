On the 1st of January I lost four quarters of malt out of a lighter: my people informed me they watched till eleven o'clock at night, and missed it at midnight. In the morning I missed eight sacks ; I myself saw them safe about nine or ten o'clock over night: the barge lay at Horsleydown. In the course of the next week some malt was found at one Hill's that I can swear to. There are two accomplices. The prisoners were taken on their information, and committed.</p>

             and Wheeler went to a barge at Smith's Wharf , Horsleydown, on New Year's-day, about eleven at night; the barge was very near full of malt; we took eight sacks out of the barge, and carried them to Kings-head-Alley , Ratcliff-Highway, to the house of one Petro, a Dutchman, and shot it in an empty room, and then threw the sacks into the Thames: we saw Tavener in the morning; we told him we had four quarters more for him, and gave him direction to go to Mr. Hill and sell it; he brought sacks to put it in. Tavener had deceived us; so we got a cart, and took it to Mr. Hill's ourselves; then the prisoners and I went to an alehouse; I went into another room, and Hill paid Wheeler and Morris for it. Wheeler told me they received four guineas, and gave Hill a receipt for it: they gave me twelve or fourteen shillings: my master, on missing the sacks, taxed me with it; and I confessed it; the prisoners were taken up before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tavener . Where did you see this malt at first?</p>

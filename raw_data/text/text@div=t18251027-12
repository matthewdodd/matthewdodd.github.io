               <p>MR. JOHN WAITHMAN. I live in Fleet-street. On Sunday, the 2d of October, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking down <placeName id="t18251027-12-crimeloc68">Fleet-street</placeName>

I collared him, and took him as far as my own house, and gave him in charge; he begged hard for mercy, and said he would never do such a thing again.</p>

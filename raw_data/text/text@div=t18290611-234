            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. I was on duty on Sunday morning, at a quarter-past two o'clock, in Bath-street; I saw the prisoner with something in his apron; I asked what he had there - he shammed intoxication; he said he had two fowls which he bought last night for 1s. 6d., that he had been drinking with some of his shopmates, and had staid till that time; I took him to the watch-house, and Mr. Cresshull identified the fowls - he produced the cock before the Magistrate, which matched the hens; they are a black Spanish breed - he described them before he saw them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The watchman asked what I had got there; I said,"Two fowls;" he said,"Did you nail them?" (that is steal them) I said,"No, I bought them in Ratcliff-highway for 1sd;" he said "If you will give me 5s., I will let you go:" I said No, 5s. was not to he parted with in that way, for I had bought them at the Eight Bells public-house.</p>

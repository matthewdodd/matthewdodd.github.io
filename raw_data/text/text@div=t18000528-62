             sworn. - About a quarter before three on Saturday morning I was along with our constable; we met with the prisoner Ware in Queen-street, near the Three Cranes; the constable laid hold of him first, he had no bundle at that time, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Clarke. This was originally one bag; it is one bag cut in two; the number corresponds with the numbers in our notes that we received with the goods.</p>


               <p>Wood. This is one of the bags; it is same kind of cotton as the rest that I sent along with it.</p>
               <p>- MERRITT sworn. - I am horse-keeper to Mr. Bottomley, upon the same whars: About half past four o'clock on Saturday morning I found a quantity of loose cotton upon the dunghill; I acquainted Mr. Pickford of it; I watched all Satur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280062"></xptr>day night till Sunday morning, and nobody came to fetch it; and then I put it into a sack, and put it into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Clarke.) What is the value of this cotton? - A. The whole would fell for about twelve pounds; this wool that is here is worth about seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the wharf to the place where the men were found? - A. A quarter of a mile or more, perhaps half a mile.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bradley. Q. Were not your men at work upon the wharf all night? - A. They were at work upon the wharf till near one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Bradley defence. My comrade and I were coming along the Strand, by the New Church we saw a bale lay, we thought it had fell out of some cart to waggon, and we took it up.</p>
               <p>Ware's defence. I have nothing to say but what Bradley has said.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Bradley called his serjeant, and Ware the publican upon whom he was quartered, who gave them both a good character.</p>

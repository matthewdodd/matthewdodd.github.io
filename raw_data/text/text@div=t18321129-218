            . I am the prosecutor's sister. The prisoner came to me on the 24th of November, at two o'clock, to hire the truck; I saw him standing at the door, looking at it - I went and asked him his business; he said he wanted the lightest truck we had got - I told him that was the lightest we had at present; he said if I was sure it was not the lightest he was not in a hurry, and would wait an hour, till I could get him a lighter one - I said the lightest we had was out; I went to the back of the house, found a lighter one, and said I was sure there was not a lighter one than that; he said, "I suppose you want my direction?" I said Yes - he said, "Give me a bit of paper;" he gave me his direction on my brother's card: we let trucks out at 3d. an hour - I saw the truck next morning at No. 4, New-street-hill, Shoe-lane, Holborn, at Mr. Burrows' - he gave me his direction,

The prisoner brought a truck to me, on Wednesday, the 21st of November - he said he wished to have it sold; I asked if it belonged to him - he said it belonged to Mr. Upcott, who was just taken to Whitecross-street prison, and wished to have it sold directly, as he was in distressed circumstances - he asked for 10s. on it, which I refused, but at last let him have 5s.; I sold it for 28s., to Mr. Budden.</p>

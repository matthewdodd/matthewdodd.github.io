On the 24th of December, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to the house with a very decently dressed man - they went into the parlour together: the prisoner came to the bar in about ten minutes, and called for a pint of beer, which he took into the room; the man came out in about a quarter of an hour, and had a glass of brandy and bitters at the bar - while he was drinking that the woman came out: she took no notice of the man, but walked across the passage, and out at the door; I suspected something, went into the parlour, and the clock was gone - it stood eight or nine feet from the ground; I did not observe that she had any thing - I immediately went out, leaving the man in the house; I saw the prisoner, and secured her, with the clock under her cloak, and gave her in charge - I think it is worth 5l. - she had paid for the porter herself.</p>

This woman was brought in as one of the poor of the parish, the 2d of December last; on the 4th the people of the house missed two check'd aprons; we suspected her being the person that had taken them; we took her up and charged her with taking them, she owned she had taken them and sold them in Long-lane for 1 s. 4 d. We took her before Alderman Alexander, he being the sitting alderman, there she owned the same, the gentlewoman is here in court to whom she pawned them.</p>

I heard her say in the compter, she did steal the two check aprons; I asked her where she had carried them, she said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160015"></xptr> to Long-lane; to where there ? where cloaths hung out; accordingly I went to this place with the master of the work-house; we asked the woman of the house if a black woman had sold or pawned two linen aprons; at last she said she had bought two check aprons of a black, and one of them she had sold; we saw the other, it is here in court. Before the ald erman she acknowledged she had taken the two check aprons, and had sold them to a woman in Long-lane.</p>

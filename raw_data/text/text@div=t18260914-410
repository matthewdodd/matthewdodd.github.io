            . I live in Princes-street - my husband is a boot-maker. On Saturday, the 6th of May, the prisoner, whom I had not seen before, came to my house with a woman whom I knew; the prisoner said she had let that old lady have a pair of decanters to get some fruit for her stall, and on the 4th of May she had let her have another pair to get some clothes for herself; she wanted me to lend her the money, and go with her to get them out before her mistress knew it; she said she lived with a lady in Regent-street, who performed at the Opera; I went to Mr. Cameron's, the pawnbroker, in the Strand, with the woman, but I did not get the decanters out; Mr. Cameron had stopped them - I did not own them as mine; I had known the old woman by seeing her stand every day with fruit at the corner of my kitchen window; I found there were six decanters at Cameron's - she said there were but four.</p>

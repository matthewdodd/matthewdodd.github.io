            . I am an appraiser and was at Bagnigge-wells. Butcher said he had lost a sovereign; I took hold of the prisoner's hand; some persons came up and wanted to let her go; I saw her hand behind her, took hold of it, and took the sovereign out of it; the officer came up and found the other two sovereigns and a piece of rag; she said "It makes no odds to me whether he gave me a sovereign or a shilling." I said "Where are the other two?" She said she had no more.</p>

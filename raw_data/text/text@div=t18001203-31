               <p>Q. Do you keep India bonds in a drawer, not locked? - A. They were absent ones, such as sailors give for wages; I missed two watches, and the other articles in the indictment, (repeating them); the prisoner had been servant in the house about four weeks; I sent for a constable, and had her apprehended; I had a very good character with her; the officer searched her, and found all the articles upon her; I can swear to them; my wife's is a French watch; silver gilt; I know it by the chain; the silver watch belongs to a man that is gone to sea; and the silk handkerchief, and the neck handkerchief, belong to Captain Arthur; his daughter is here to prove them.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Police-office, Shadwell: On the 6th of November, Mr. Bodman sent for me, to take his servant into custody; I searched her box, and found a silk handkerchief, a pocket handkerchief, a neck hankerchief, a towel, and a pair of silk gloves; I sent her to look for her pockets, but did not let her go out of my sight; I thought I saw her attempting to secrete something; I immediately laid hold of her, and took two watches out of her right-hand, (produces them); I then took her before the Magistrate.(The property was deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The things that were in the box, my mistress made me a present of; the officer searched my pockets, and found nothing there; my mistress told me my pockets were very dirty; she lent me her pockets, and the thimble was in that; when I was looking for the pocket where the dirty clothes were, I saw these watches; I took them up in my hand, and one of the officers laid hold of me directly, and took them out of my hand; it was an open house for every one.</p>

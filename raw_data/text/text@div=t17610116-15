               <p>Q. Do you know who took them?</p>
               <p>Spencer. The prisoner was found in the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he belong to the house?</p>
               <p>Spencer. No, he did not. We secured him till such time we had looked about, to see what was lost. I missed the things mentioned, we search'd the prisoner, and found them upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Spencer. He said he came in to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get in?</p>
               <p>Spencer. He got in at the warehouse-door, thro' the warehouse which goes up to the dwelling-apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you find him there?</p>
               <p>Spencer. It was between five and six in the evening</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I cannot tell which. I knew but little of the man; I had known him before, but not much of him. [The things produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Q Did you take him before a magistrate?</p>
               <p>Spencer. We took him before the lord mayor: there he did not deny the taking the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own he took them?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I cannot say that.</p>

            . The prisoner came in I believe while we were at dinner, and went from the warehouse to the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house?</p>
               <p>Franklin. At the house of Mr. Hayter: our maid saw him in the dwelling-apartment, and called out to us below. Some went up. I was at the warehouse door, and as he came down I stopt him. We had him into the kitchen, and kept him there, while they went up to search what was missing.

               <p>The gentleman is something of a relation to me, and I had got a little by the head, and I went in there to sleep. I did not know what the things were; when I took them they were very black.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner any relation to any person in the house?</p>
               <p>Spencer. He claims some very distant relation to Mrs Hayter; they have been very kind to him in giving him victuals and cloaths; but he will not keep in any place. What imployment he is in now, I do not know; he is a very weak man.</p>

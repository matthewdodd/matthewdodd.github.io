                  </hi>. I am shopman to John William Fryett, of High-street, Shadwell; he is a pawnbroker. On the afternoon of the 16th of October, my attention. was called by Robert Clark, to something which was alleged to have happened—I missed a violin from inside the door—I went into the street, and Clark pointed out Godfrey—I pursued, and found him with the violin concealed under his apron—I took it from him—there was another person running on, some little distance before him—we lost nothing but this violin, which is the property of my employer—there was person like the other prisoner with Godfrey, but he got away at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Johnson, a hatter in Shadwell. On the 16th of October, I was standing by our door, which is opposite to Mr. Fryett's. I saw the prisoners standing by the door—M'Gowen snatched at the violin, and after two attempts he got it, and handed it to Godfrey—I am certain he is the man—he ran away at that time.</p>

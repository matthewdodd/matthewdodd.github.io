I said nothing about being <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>—he asked me if I had put the things away—I said no—he said, "If that is the case, I shall not say any thing about it"—about two months before, my mother came to live at the prosecutor's house—she got me to move her things there, and from that time told me not to go hungry, but to go there whenever I wanted victuals; and on Thursday, the day before this happened, I met Burrell—I went and knocked at the door, but nobody came—I went again about five o'clock, and the shoemaker's wife next door came out and said my mo<lb></lb>ther was not at home, but was gone down to my sister's—I went away and next morning went with a man named Rutherford to Barnet, and slept</p>

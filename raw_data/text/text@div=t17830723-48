               <p>Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>You perceive how slight and trifling the offence is with which I am charged; an illiterate and ignorant man presumes to intreat your lordship's assistance, he has no friends or money in this very aukward and critical situation, but he humbly craves the humanity of this most honourable Court, being two hundred miles from home, living in Yorkshire, and his wife and family there.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner here fainted and some water was ordered by the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you been in town?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About three weeks, I came with some horses, I bring up horses for dealers, there is Mr. Dymock, in Oxford-road, has been two or three times with me in prison, he is gone to some fair, and the gentleman where I lodged came to appear to my character three or four times, but he thought my trial was not to come on to night.</p>
               <p>Court. If you have any people of credit in town to give you a character, let them come on Tuesday.</p>

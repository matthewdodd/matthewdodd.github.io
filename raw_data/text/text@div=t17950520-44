               <p>Q. Was his cloak left in the tap room? - No, next to the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many other people in that room besides you and the prisoner? - There was myself, Mr. Smith and his mother, and the prisoner, and two more people; I left the room and went into the bar, and the prisoner was in the room when I left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the other people left in the room with the prisoner? - Yes, two more people; but the prisoner was the last that left the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go into the room and find him alone? - No, I was the next person that went into the room, I went in for my cloak, and he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the room by himself? - Yes, and he came to the bar, I see him through the bar window, by himself, Mr. Smith was gone out about some business, and I said to Mrs. Smith -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your cloak? - Yes, I was going home, and I called at a pawnbroker's in Shoe-lane, and I found it at the pawnbroker's; I knew it by the lace, and two joinings in the hood, and it is my own making.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This little room where you went with Mr. Smith and his mother, opens into the tap room? - No, it opens into a little passage, close by the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, there were two persons there, strangers to you, besides this man, and you left these persons in the room likewise, as well as this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For a considerable time? - It might be half an hour, or not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. You left these three persons in the room, and they went out at different times? - The woman and the other man went out partly together.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in a room adjoining to the tap room? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day? - The 16th of April, on Thursday; I believe it was about five o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner came into the room soon after; there were two or three people there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any cloak was missing of Mrs. Clarke's? - I had occasion to go out on a little business, when I came back I was informed that a cloak was lost; a person was going into the country from my house, I told her I would see her to the stage, and after that would go to as many pawnbrokers as I could; that evening, going down Shoe-lane, I went to Mr. Cottle, and found the cloak there; Mr. Clarke was with me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Who were these other persons who were in the tap room? Do you know their names? - I know each of their names, I have known them for some time, they have used my house.</p>
               <p>Q.And so had the prisoner? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not come in with these other persons? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house is a house of a good deal of business? - We do a good deal of business.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a good many people in the tap room? - It is a time of day that we are rather slack of business; our business runs in the morning, middle of the day, and evening,</p>
               <p>Q. Probably not less than ten or twelve at that time? - I cannot say the number; in the course of the time the prisoner at the bar was in the house, there might be fifty people, but not to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner came the next morning again? - No, I see the prisoner the same evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you inform him there had been a cloak lost? - I did. The day following likewise I see him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you then inform him again of a cloak being lost? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, though he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200137"></xptr>of a cloak being lost, attempt to make his escape? - No, he did not; I told him that I thought he was sober by this time, and spent all his money; he told me that he had not spent all his money, and particularly mentioned the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. That he had not spent all the money that he had got for the cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined before the justice, was not you? - Not till after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. You were then on your oath. Did you ever mention any thing like this before the justice? - I was not asked any question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this then or not? - Yes, I perfectly knew it, for he insulted me when I went to him, he acknowledged he had spent the money he had got for the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. He insulted you? - He made use of language that is not proper to mention in this court, nor any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. So you knew this before the justice, and never mentioned a word of it? - I considered it would be impertinent in me not to mention more than I was asked; the justice put many questions to me, and when I was on an argument, he said, it is not necessary for you to say any thing, but answer the questions I ask you. I I give you my word I forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. I should like some how or other, to know what he said to you, because we see how far your forgiveness goes. How did he abuse you, did he call you a thief? - No, he did not; when I went in, he says, Smith, how are you, my boy? you are a good natured fellow; I said Mr. Thomas, I am come about more serious business; he said -</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - This I think was the day following.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day that he told you that he had not spent all the money for the cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you took him up that day? - I will recollect myself if you please. He was taken up on Saturday, but I think he told me this on Friday. The prosecutor lives in the country. He was taken up at the Coach and Horses, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the very place where you had seen him before, in the same place where he had made this confession to you as you would have us believe? - He certainly did.</p>

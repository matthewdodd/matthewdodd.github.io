the indictment.</p>


               <p>Q. Which did you see first, the prisoner or the articles? - I took the prisoner myself, in the Hambury, Westminster, the next morning, between the hours of seven and eight, I found some of my property; he told me where it was; it was at Strutton Ground, at the corner of the same street: he had sold the things for a guinea and a half; he went with us, the constable and him, we took him into a coach with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it all? - No, I found the best part of it; the constable has got the property, which was found there, he told me that he broke the box open in the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was apprehended, the constable and him told me if the property was found I would be immediately discharged? - Yes, but he would not tell me, he always refused to tell me of some things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he made the discovery? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise to discharge him? - Not at that time; I did in the morning as soon as I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you where the things were, did not he expect to be discharged? - Yes, but he never told me; there are a great many things lost, which he never would discover.</p>
               <p>Q. He told me in what manner I should go after them, but I would not go by myself in such a manner, without a constable, he said I should go into a house and, say damn your eyes where are my things, my bed fellow brought into this house, the last night? but he never discovered where it was.</p>
               <p>- BOOTH sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - Going of twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been sworn before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you tell a lie, or a story, or swear that, that is false; have you been taught what will become of you? - Go to hell and into everlasting fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Now mind you will be punished here and hereafter if you don't tell exactly what is true? - At half after nine o'clock on Tuesday, that man came to my mammy, I don't know the day of the month, and he asked my mammy for the key of the room to go to bed; then my mammy gave him the key, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290082"></xptr>he went up stairs, and he came down with the box and made a noise in the passage; I ran out and saw him in the street, he was facing a shop where there is a great light, and I saw the box very plain; I ran in and told my mammy as soon as I saw him, and my mammy told me to go and call Mr. Sparing; and I went and called him, and he came down.</p>

I had seen him about a twelve month before, but not to say any thing to him, there was a young man with him; I asked him if they were his own? and he said the things belonged to an acquaintance of his; but I did not ask whether the young man belonged to them or not, he laid them down, and he asked two guineas for them; I told him that the clothes were old, and I could not afford to give him that for them; I gave him a guinea and a half, I did not ask him whether they were his or not.</p>
               <p>Court. I hope you will not go on in this way, if you do you will stand at the bar? - I never bought any before that were so unlucky.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; I produce the property found at Mrs. Daws's, I got it there on Wednesday the day after the robbery was committed; I have kept it ever since. (Produced and deposed to by Mrs. Daws, as the things she purchased; and by Sparing as his property.)</p>
               <p>Sparing. The womens clothes are my sister's; she is here to swear to them; they were in my box, I had them to keep for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the constable apprehended me the constable and another young man was with him, an acquaintance of the prosecutor, and I was in liquor, when they first apprehended me; when I got sober they both came to me to the watch-house, and told me if I would tell where the property was I should be discharged; I told them I could not tell where all was but I could the best part; he said that would do; and the constable said so himself, that I should be discharged.</p>
               <p>Court to Constable. Was that so? - It is strictly true, he was very much in liquor; in the morning when I took him, the prosecutor told him if he would tell where the things were he would forgive him; indeed he offered him money, but he would not tell then.</p>

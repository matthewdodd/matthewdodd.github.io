            . I am a patrol. I was in Holborn between twelve and one o'clock, and heard a cry of watch in Bull and Gate-yard; I went, and saw the prisoner, who first charged the prosecutor with assaulting her; he said he was robbed of a sovereign, a half sovereign, and a purse; I took her to the watch-house, and found a few shillings on her - I said I would get the watch-house keeper's wife to search her - she then dropped the purse at her feet - I then said "Where is his money?" she said "Here," and then gave up a sovereign; she had denied having any sovereign for twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she say it was not his money? A. No; they both called watch - the prosecutor was never near the purse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him with three other females; he went and treated us all - he and I went to this room, and as we came out he wanted me to go back - he struck me, and gave me in charge, as I would not return the 5s. <rs id="t18270215-198-verdict1070" type="verdictDescription">

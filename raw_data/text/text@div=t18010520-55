               <p>Q. What may be the value of the eight shirts? - A. Forty-shillings; I went to the Poultry Compter to her and begged of her to tell me where the other things were; I found nothing at her lodgings; I went again to her, and upon her person found seventy-one duplicates concealed between her stays and her body; I then went to ten different pawnbrokers; I delivered the duplicates to the constable; the pawnbrokers were all summoned before the Lord Mayor; but not one of them attended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. How many times was she taking these things? - A. I saw her take the check shirts twice, and the white ones once.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you interpose when you saw her take the two jackets? - A. I did not think it proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you wished to wait till she should commit a capital offence, that you might hang this woman? - A. I wished to see that she was a thief.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did she take these things one after another as fast as she could take them? - A. Yes; she was not ten minutes about it.</p>

            . On Christmas eve last the prisoner came and asked me to walk with him to Chelsea to his usurer whose name is Cammel. I went with him, and we had two pints of beer. Coming back I asked him if he had received his money, and he pulled out five or six guineas. When we came to his house his wife was a little disguised in liquor, and they began to quarrel. Presently after that a gentleman's servant knocked at the door, (I had seen him before at the Red-Cross in Tothil-Street) and said, Dick, I have brought the things. He had a looking-glass in a cloth in his hand, and there were two men with him, one of whom had a bed, and the other had the other things in a case. I saw the prisoner give the gentleman's servant 5 l. 10 s. for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner's business?</p>
               <p>Borroughs. I never knew him trade in any thing before; but he told me that he was going to take a larger house, and he wanted these goods to furnish it.</p>

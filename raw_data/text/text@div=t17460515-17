            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Best. On Friday the 9th of this Month I was going by an empty House of Mr. Moor's, at the End of Finch-Lane in St. Martin's in the Fields. Some of my Neighbours told me, there was a Person had brought some Lead out of the House: I went up to him, as he was standing with some Lead in his Hand. When I came to him, he said he was sent for it. I ask'd him if he had any Key; he said, No. I then said, Are you sent to get in at the Window? He said, he was sent for it by a Person in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What Lead was it that you found in his Custody?</p>
               <p>Best. It was Part of a Leaden Gutter; it might be about 50 or 60 lb.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Best. He told me he would not stay, he insisted upon taking the Lead away. I turn'd myself about, and seeing many of my Neighbours there, I ask'd them what I should do; they advis'd me, by all Means, not to let him go. I was speaking about sending for Mr. Pearse the Constable, and soon he came, and I charg'd the Constable with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more of this Matter?</p>
               <p>Best. I had him before Sir

            , and he begg'd I would shew him as much Favour as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing before Sir Thomas?</p>
               <p>Best. Yes, to his Clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. What were the Clerk's Words?</p>
               <p>Best. He said, Do you acknowledge the stealing of this Lead. He then immediately down'd upon his Knees, and begg'd that I would shew him Mercy. He said it was Necessity that drove him to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Day was it he enter'd this House and took the Lead?</p>
               <p>Best. About Nine o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear frighten'd like a Thief when he was taken?</p>
               <p>Best. The Prisoner said he was in Liquor, and could not tell what he did.</p>

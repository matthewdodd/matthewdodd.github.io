                  </hi>. I am carman to Henry Limbey, of Greek-street, Soho, who is one of the firm of Chambers and Limbey, wholesale tea dealers. About twenty minutes after five o'clock in the afternoon of the 12th of September, I stopped with ray cart at the Custom-house quay, in Thames-street, and left the horse and cart, as the gateway was under re pair—on returning to my cart, I missed a small chest of tea, which I had to carry to the King's Head, Borough.</p>

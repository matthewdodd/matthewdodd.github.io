On the 10th of March about five in the afternoon, the prisoner came to me and asked me if I wanted him. I said, no. He had a mug in his hand. I asked him if he was going to get some beer; he said, yes. Then John Deal gave me some information. I called the prisoner back, and told him that I was sorry to be obliged to search him. I searched him. I found in his pantaloons seven pieces of copper; they weigh better than four pounds altogether. I told him I was exceeding sorry that he that I placed so much confidence in, had got my property upon him. He then said, I had ruined him; I replied, if he went on in that way he would soon ruin me. I sent for an officer; he took charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pieces of sheet copper that you found about him of the same sort that you manufacture in your premises - A. Yes, and in the state they were in they were worth about six shillings. That is all I know of it.</p>

             marked a piece of copper that laid on the prisoner's bench. He laid it there again. The prisoner was gone to his dinner then. He left it on the prisoner's bench, and desired me to notice it. After the prisoner came from dinner, he went about his work. The piece of copper remained on the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to think the prisoner took any copper - A. I saw him cutting more copper; the copper that I saw him cutting ought not to be cut. In cutting the copper he bent it; he laid it on the bench, and levelled it, made it strait again; he then took the pieces of copper off the bench, and the piece that

He took the pieces out of the tub again; he put them in at the window of the place, where we scour our work; we generally take it in at the door. After he had put it in the scouring-room window, I did not see what he did with it. I saw him take some of his work out of the spirit-tub; he took in at the scouring room door, and scoured it. After he had scoured it, I saw him come out of the scouring-room with the other pieces of copper in his hand, but not seeing the pieces of copper that he put in at the window, I suspected he had secreted them. I then informed Mr. Sheen what I had seen. I went to the spot where he had put the pieces of copper in at the window; I found they were removed. I informed my master. I still continued to watch him. After some time, he went into the work-shop; he took a mug out of the workshop to get some liquor, and left the work-shop; I followed him, and when he came to the street he saw me coming, and as I supposed, he was waiting to see which way I was going, and when I came up to him, he was looking at the church clock; I told him his master wanted him; he came back. He was charged with stealing the copper. He was searched. The copper that

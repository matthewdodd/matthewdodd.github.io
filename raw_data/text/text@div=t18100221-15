On the 8th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, I had occasion to wait upon a barrister in Lincoln's Inn. On return a quarter before nine, I found the people in my house in a state of consternation, on account of a robbery that had been committed. I found, by my foreman, that the house had been robbed of a quantity of unfinished work which was going from my press. It is a new work I am printing for Mr. Longman, called the Scottish Chiefs, to be published in five volumes; it has never been out of my hands; there was no other person could be in possession of it; I lost, as near as I can guess, a thousand sheets. On the morning after, I went out in search of the property; I went to Mr. Jones, a cheesemonger in Fleet-market; at the far end of the shop I saw a bundle tied up; I discovered it to be a part of this property; and my suspicion fell upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. He is a <rs id="t18100221-15-deflabel90" type="occupation">journeyman printer</rs>

My suspicion fell upon him in consequence of his having frequently applied for work, and generally on an evening. I got a search warrant, and the officer Hawkins found out where he worked; we searched his lodgings and found nothing; we took the prisoner from his work, and then requested him to come to Mr. Jones's, the cheesemonger; and when we took him into Mr. Jones's parlour, Mr. Jones recognised him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. In what part of your printing shop had this paper been placed. - A. In my wareroom; I did not place it there, I knew it was stored there. They were missed by my foreman; when I came in, he pointed out the sheet, and said, we are robbed again, this sheet is gone.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, No. 5, Fleet-market. On the 8th of this month, about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner came in, and asked the shop-man whether I could buy any waste paper; I was called out; I told him to wait, as I was busy telling some silver; they told me the gentleman was in a hurry; I said, then send him in; the prisoner came in to me, I asked him what he wanted a pound for the paper; he said, five-pence; I looked at it; I said, these are regular sheets; he answered, they had been misprinted; I said, it was not the paper that exactly suited my trade, it would not hold the brine; he replied, perhaps you wish to have some old ledgers or bill books; I said, that is the paper that is suitable to me; I said, I would give him fourpence halfpenny, he took it; it weighed eighteen pound, I told him to take it in the shop; my son weighed it, and paid him six shillings and ninepence for it. I am sure the prisoner is the man, and that is the paper; he told me he had sold a great deal to Mr. Skinner, the tobacconist. Mr. M'Creery called on me on the next morning; I told him I would be at home about two o'clock. He brought the prisoner in, and another man very much like him; I pointed out the prisoner, I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness; I know the prisoner, he came into our accompting house while my father was counting some silver; he came with paper; my father told me to weigh it, I did, and gave him six shillings and nine pence for it. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of it; at the time that Mr. M'Creery was robbed, I was at home; when the officer came to take me in custody, he said, take no notice to your fellow workmen, I have a warrant against you. There was nothing found in my possession at all, I had nothing but a five shilling piece. When Mr. M'Creery took me down to Mr. Jones, there was another person that looked like me; Mr. Jones did not know which of us it was; he took my hat out of my hand; he said, he knew me by the silk hat, and he observed, that I was genteelly dressed when I brought it. My earnings is thirty-six shillings a week; I have had several situations. I did not go to Mr. M'Creery's to work, because I was told he was a particular man, and that I should be like a negro there. No man has stood more to his work than I have done; every body, that knows me is surprized that such a thing should have happened.</p>

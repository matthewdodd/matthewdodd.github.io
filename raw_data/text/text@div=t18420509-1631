                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Animal's Friend Society. About half-past nine o'clock on the night, of the 13th of May, I saw the prisoners and two others come out of Field-lane, and proceed down Farringdon-street—the prisoners took the right hand, the other two the left—they proceeded up Ludgate-hill—I saw Williams lift up a gentleman's pocket, but he was not able to extract any thing—they then west into Cheapside, and tried another gentleman's pocket—Jenkins then went into two pastrycook's shops—after he came out, I went in, and made inquiries—after that Moran went into Wills and Withers', a hosier's shop, in the Poultry—Jenkins and Williams waited on the opposite side close together—I Watched them, I suppose, for ten minutes—they watched Moran very attentively—as he came out they made a signal to him, and they both ran across the road to him—Williams took off his hat, and put something into it which Moran passed to him—I then went into the shop, and made inquiries—when I came oat the prisoners were gone on a-head—I then proceeded on till I got a constable—I told him to take Williams while I took the other two—after a desperate resistance I captured the other two—they beat me and kicked me, but I kept hold of them—they laid down, entwined their legs in mine, and tried to throw me—I was obliged to call for assistance.</p>

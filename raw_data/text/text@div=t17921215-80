S. K. She left my service more than five months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was it she left your service? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any account of these spoons you have lost? - I have from the pawnbroker. It is a painful task for me to appear against any poor creature, but I have suffered so exceedingly by servants, that it is necessary to make an example of them: a servant went and enquired, and found them at a pawnbroker's in Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker. I produce the spoons. (Deposed to.) The first table spoon was brought the 22d of October; the tea spoon some time in September; but I cannot say positively the day; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150120"></xptr>the other table spoon this month. I have known her upwards of five years to use our shop; I received them all of the prisoner at the bar; I supposed she was a servant; I knew her using the shop; bringing the things; she had not brought any plate before, but she had brought other things; she had brought her own gowns, aprons, and so on; I had known her some time, and she always had a good appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have known whether she was a servant? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know, whether you thought she was a person likely to have plate of her own property? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What name were they brought in? - One was pledged in the name of Kirby, and the other in the name of Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no suspicion, by her using two names, what was the common name? - Brown and I heard that she had been married lately, and had changed her name.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did she get on these pawns? - The tea spoons 18 d. and the other two table spoons 6 s. each.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought she had got up in the world, and mended her circumstances, coming out with the silver table spoons? - I saw the letter was K.</p>

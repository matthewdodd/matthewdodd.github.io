I called the watchman, and as she was going to the watch-house she dropped the half-sovereign upon the flags; a young man picked it up; she dropped the shilling a little further on.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I was on my way home, and heard the prosecutor call the watchman - he gave charge of the prisoner for having robbed him of 11 s. - the watchman took her by the wrist, and she dropped the half-sovereign; I picked it up - she dropped the shilling soon after, which the prosecutor picked up.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and live in Houndsditch. The prosecutor called me, and said he was robbed of a half-sovereign and a shilling - I took hold of the prisoner's hand, and led her a few paces. I saw her hand fall, and the half-sovereign fell, and the shilling soon afterwards - I have no doubt that she dropped them.</p>

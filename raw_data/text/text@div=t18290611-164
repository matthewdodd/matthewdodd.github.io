On the 15th of April I went from the top of the warehouse to the counting-house, about three o'clock in the afternoon; when I returned into the warehouse, I had information from one of our porters; I looked round, and immediately missed a bundle, containing two reams of demy paper - I immediately went out into St. Brides'-passage, and saw the prisoner in the custody of Denny, with the paper in his possession - he gave no account of it; I knew it by the Excise mark - I took him into the warehouse, where he said he had been in bad company, and got intoxicated - he seemed so, but the paper weighed 50 lbs., and he ran away with it.</p>
               <p>PETER DENNY. I was formerly in Mr. Bonsor's employ for twenty-one years; I saw the prisoner with a slip of paper in his hand, and looking up as if to find a house; he came round opposite Mr. Bonsor's, then turned his back to the shop, and looked through the shop windows several times - he waited a considerable time, and at last went in, and brought this bundle of paper out in half a minute; I followed him down into St. Bride's passage, and the paper fell off his shoulder - I was picking it up, and the slip of paper fell out of his hand; Mr. Lamb came and laid hold of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Denmark-street, St. Giles. On the 13th of Oct., about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was standing at my street door, going to open it, when the prisoner came up to me, and put a paper into my hand—I was surprised at it, but judged it might be a letter from some person wanting relief—I was proceeding to read the superscrip<lb></lb>tion by the light of the lamp; and while doing so, the prisoner made a snatch at my watch with his right hand, and then with both hands he broke the chain over my neck, got the watch, and ran away—it came out of my pocket at once by the force of the first snatch at the chain—I ran after him—I had a cloak on, and something in my hand—I was quite confused at the thing, and before I got to the end of the street the prisoner was taken—I</p>

I am the wife of Mr. Fessard, a cook, at No. 31, Crown-street—about half-past twelve o'clock on the night of the 13th Oct., I went out to get some beer, and as I was going through Denmark-street I saw Mr. Menzies part with a friend—I saw the prisoner go up to him as he was at his door and deliver him a letter—I am certain he is the person—I saw Mr. Menzies turn towards the lamp, which stands very near his door, and I saw the prisoner make a snatch at the person of Mr. Menzies, and directly after run off—Mr. Menzies called out, "Stop him," and ran—I ran too—Mr. Menzies fell—I ran on swifter than he did, and saw the prisoner go into George-yard, and into a narrow part there—I was afraid to go up, but I stood till the policeman came—I pointed him out to the policeman, and he was taken—I am certain he is the man.</p>

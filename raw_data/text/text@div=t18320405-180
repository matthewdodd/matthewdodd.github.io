            . I am a saddler. I was at the Court- I was nearly on the floor; I saw the prisoner there, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran from my seat, and went to the door which leads towards the lobby; I saw Mr. Boar holding the prisoner - he said, "The seal is in his hand, try to take it out;" I went towards the prisoner, and saw the seal in his right hand - three or four were trying to get it from him - I at last got it from him, and said, "Here it is;" I then gave it to the officer - the prosecutor claimed it, and the prisoner denied that he had had it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BOAR. I am an accountant, and live in Kennington-lane. I was at the Court; I heard a scuffle, and the cry of Stop-thief! I was in the passage, and ran round to the lobby, where I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor struggling; I seized the prisoner by the right hand, in which I saw a seal, which Mr. Crute got from him - there was a violent struggle, and a person, who is not present, was forced to bite his hand to make him give way; I dragged the prisoner into the room, and gave him to the officer.</p>

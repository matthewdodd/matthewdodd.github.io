               <p>I am a plater of silver. Coming down Cow-lane, I met the prisoner with the child; the child was crying, and said that was not the way home; I went up to her, and asked her whose child it was? she said it was her brother's; seeing the child without a frock, I asked her where the frock was? she made no answer; I saw the frock in her hands, and took it away from her, and delivered it to Roberts, a constable, who was coming by at the time; the frock was in her hands, almost covered with her apron: the constable has the frock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had not an apron on? - She had a checked apron on.</p>

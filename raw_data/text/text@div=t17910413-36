               <p>I am a baker: I saw the prisoner on a Thursday come out with a bundle under his arm, I went and asked the servant maid if she had let any body out, she said no; I ran after the prisoner, and he turned the corner; I lost sight of him then, and he threw the bundle down; I passed by the bundle, and pursued the prisoner and took him; he begged of me to let him go, as he was afraid he should be hanged: I believe the brewer's man picked up the bundle, I saw it in the servant's hand in a very short space of time afterwards; the bundle was caried to Mr. Wright's who came out and laid hold of the prisoner, and came along with me for a few yards, and turned back again to fetch his coat, and returned again, and the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Who gave Winch the bundle? - The Justice; I am sure it is the same bundle the prisoner dropped, and the same I saw him bring out of the house.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the man you lost fight of, and afterwards took, is the same man you saw coming out of the house? - I am.</p>

               <p>What was done with the bundle? - The constable had it, and took it to Clerkenwell-green to the Justice's; I did not see who picked it up.</p>

I found the pavement washed quite clean—it seemed as if coals had soiled the road—directly I got there Curley came out of No. 58 with a sack with some coals on his shoulder—asked him what he had got there?—he said, "Coals"—I said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said, "To take them to my sister's in place of some I borrowed"—I took him into custody.</p>

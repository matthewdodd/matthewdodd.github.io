             said, they belonged to his brother.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Was any promise made to Thomas Beams to say any thing about them? - A. None.</p>
               <p>EDWARD TREADWAY sworn. - On Tuesday, the 19th of April, I went to the house of Mr. Philpot, in Holborn; Mr. Philpot gave me charge of his servant; Robert Beams. On searching his box, he gave me this silk handkerchief; he said it was his master's property, and that he had had it about a month, or six weeks; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you make him any promise to induce him to tell you that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Philpot. I know the pattern, there is no mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.You don't know that this property belongs to you, but from what the prisoner said? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had such handkerchiefs? - A. Yes, a great many, while he lived with me.</p>
               <p>JOHN JONES sworn. - I saw the handkerchiefs in Mr. Ovey's drawing-room, the prisoner, Thomas Beams, was then present; I questioned him as to the time these handkerchiefs had been in his possession; he replied, two years; I asked him of whom did he receive them; he said, of a Mr. Cook; that he became acquainted with Mr. Cook by accidentally meeting him in the Park - that about a month after such acquaintance commenced, he told him he had a quantity of silk handkerchiefs in pawn for five pounds - that he bought them of Cook for the identical sum for which they were pawned, namely, five pounds; I put the question, how came Mr. Cook to sell you the handkerchiefs in pawn for five pounds, for which he must have paid five pounds and some interest; to that he gave no immediate answer. About one o'clock in the morning, I went with Mr. Ovey to take him to the watch-house; in his way to the watch-house, Thomas Beams requested to go back to Mr. Ovey's house - that he had something further to say respecting the handkerchiefs; on returning to Mr. Ovey's house, he admitted that all that he had before stated was false - that he had the handkerchiefs from his brother, who lived with Mr. Philpot, the corner of Turnstile, Holborn; I went to Mr. Philpot to inform him of the circumstance next morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner Robert was searched? - A.I went up stairs after the box had been searched, and heard him admit that the handkerchief was Mr. Philpot's.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether, or no, before you heard him admit any thing, any promise was made to him by you, or any one in your presence? - A. No, on the contrary; the moment he said he had something further to state, provided Mr. Ovey would forgive him, I prevented a reply.</p>
               <p>Q. This applies to Thomas; I was asking you what you heard that applied to Robert? - A. I heard nothing that applies to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw Robert in the shop before he went up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then say, it would be better for him to confess? - A. I did not.(The handkerchiefs were produced by Treadway, and two of them, which had the marks on them, were identified by Philpot.)</p>
               <p>Robert Beams's defence. Mr. Philpot and Jones say, that they never held out any promise to me; when I came into the parlour, Mr. Jones said, it was a serious case - that a number of things were found - that it did not signify any thing to deny it- if I expected any favour, the best way was to confess; he said that several times; and when they took me to Bow-street, Mr. Philpot and Jones pressed me very much to confess, and said, it would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250007"></xptr>be best, if I expected any mercy, for many things were very clear against me; when I would confess nothing, he went again in a rage into the Office. After the examination, when my brother and I were committed, we went into the Brown Bear; Jones came and sat down by me, and said, it was a very bad business, if I could make any discoveries, it would be the better for me; I told him I had nothing further to confess; Mr. Philpot came to me, and said, there were two silk handkerchiefs my brother sent into the country; I said, I knew nothing of it, I knew nothing of the concerns of my brother; then Jones and Philpot left us, they pressed us very hard to confess. On the Sunday following, I think it was, Mr. Philpot came to me alone at the New-Prison, Clerkenwell, and said, if you have robbed me to any considerable amount, if you confess it, it shall not operate against you; this he repeated several times then, and at other times.</p>
               <p>Thomas Beams's defence. I have nothing to say in my defence.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jones.) Is what the prisoner says, true? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Philpot.) Is what the prisoner says, true? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Robert Beams. I used frequently to want goods for friends; Mr. Philpot said I might take any thing I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Philpot.) Did you suffer him to take goods? - A.The shopmen sometimes want goods for friends, but they are always entered in the accounts.</p>
               <p>Robert Beams called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

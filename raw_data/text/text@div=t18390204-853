                  </hi>. I am a horse slaughterer, and live in Green-street, Borough. The prisoner has been in my service—I had occasion to discharge him, and afterwards preferred a charge of breach of the peace against him for threatening my life, but his wife interceded for him, and I did not prosecute—that is about three months ago—he lived in one of my little houses—I had taken proceedings to get possession of it, but had offered him no offence whatever up to the 10th of January—about a quarter to five o'clock on that evening, I was coming from my house to the opposite premises, and saw the prisoner coming up the street—he hallooed out, "Hoy, stop, I want you"—I was opening my gate, and he came up and knocked my hat off with a stick, and said, "How do you like that, where is Mr. Pople?"—(the pri<lb></lb>soner had been to my house in the early part of the day and ill-used me and Mr. Pople, who was in the house at the time, had rescued me from him)—I was in the act of stooping to pick my hat up, and he struck me across the head with this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) several times, as hard as he could—it broke on my head, and while doing so he said, "I have got a little sharper instrument that that for you"—I think it has been a prop—Brady, one of my men, came to my assistance, and led me out of the yard—the blows cut my head—I was almost drowned in blood—Mr. Newth attended me and is doing so still—I am forty-nine years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at work in the prosecutor's yard on Thursday the 10th of January—I saw the prisoner come—he brandished this stick over his head, and requested Mr. Winkley to fetch Mr. Pople to him, that he was then prepared with a stick—he wished to fight the prosecutor, and said he was prepared with a sharper instrument if necessary—he knocked the prosecutor's hat off and said, "D—your eyes, what will you do now?"—while the prosecutor was in the act of picking up his hat, the prisoner struck him on the head with the stick, with all his might, three times—I do not know whether the blows all fell on his head, but some did, for I saw the blood flow in torrents from his head—I assisted him across the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Great Suffolk-street. I was sent for to the prosecutor, on Thursday evening, at five o'clock—I examined his head and found an extensive contused wound, about three inches long, bleeding very profusely on the left-side of the scalp near the temple—it appeared to be produced by a round blunt instrument, like that produced, it would produce just such a wound—he lost a considerable quantity of blood—in my judgment I should consider it a very serious</p>

               <p>wound—he has hardly recovered the effects of it now—he has been under my care ever since—the skull was laid bare, it was a ragged braised wound. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM TAYLOR</hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 14.) I was called to take the prisoner into custody—he was running up the street at the time, and went into a public-house—I followed him in, and as soon as he saw me he took up this stick to make a blow at me—I immediately took him by the collar and took the stick from him—I took him to the station-house, and found this clasp-knife on him.</p>

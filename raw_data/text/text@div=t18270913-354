            . I am a waiter at the George and Vulture. kept by William Mariner. On the 17th of August a person, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came and had some soup, between one and two o'clock; he had a silver table spoon with it. I did not see him go out; a person came from Baker's coffee-house - I then went into the room where he had been, and missed one spoon out of thirty-six, which were laying on the tables there - this is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130144"></xptr>one of them - they were all right about an hour before he came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How can you swear to the prisoner? A. I believe him to be the man; the spoon has our mark on it; the spoon was not taken from the basin.</p>

            . I was dining at Mr. Gibson's coffee-house. I found the prisoner there, and heard a dispute about a spoon - I saw him sit down at a table where there were three spoons - he took a newspaper in his hand, and, in a few minutes, there were four spoons - nobody could have put it there but him; nobody else had been near the table.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear this is not one of the three spoons which were there before? A. Yes, it is much smaller than them.</p>

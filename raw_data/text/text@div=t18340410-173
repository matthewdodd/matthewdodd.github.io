            . I was at the Cock, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner there at half-past two o'clock - the prosecutor was rather tipsy - I saw 5s. 10d. in his cap, on the tap-room table - the prisoner was close to him - I saw him take the money - he paid for a pot of beer out of it - he then went out with it, and said he was going to be shaved - I made sure he would return, as they seemed very good friends - he went away with the money and the bundle that the money was in, while the prosecutor was asleep.</p>

             (police-constable S 28). I took the prisoner - the prosecutor charged him with robbing him of two half-crowns, a 6d. and 4d. - the prisoner said, "Why had you not mentioned this when you saw me at the Elephant and Castle at Camden Town?" - the prosecutor said he had never seen him.</p>

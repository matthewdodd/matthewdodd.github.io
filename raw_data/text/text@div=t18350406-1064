                  </hi>. I am a licensed hawker. I was at the Boot, in Milton-street—I had four shawls, tied up in a paper parcel—I was sitting in the tap-room—I did not see the prisoner come in—he was in the house—I put my parcel either on the seat or on the table, it was between four and five o'clock—I did not see the prisoner at all—I do not know who took the parcel—I have not found it since—I did not hear Mrs. Martin say she saw two persons go out with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was landlord of the public-house, but have left it since. I remember the prosecutor being there—he went to light his pipe; and while he was gone towards the fire, to light it, the prisoner, who was the waiter, came up to the table, took the brown paper parcel off the seat, and went towards the bar with it—I thought he was bringing it to the bar for safety—when the prosecutor returned from lighting his pipe, he asked if I had seen the parcel—I said, "Yes; I saw Thomas, the waiter, take it to the bar, and I believe it is all safe, or all right, but I will inquire"—I went to the bar, and made inquiry—I am quite sure I saw the prisoner take it away—I do not know what became of it—he went out of the tap-room, towards the bar, and might have left the house without my seeing him—when he returned to the room, I asked what he had done with the parcel—he asked what parcel I meant—I said I meant Byrn's parcel, which he took off the seat—he said he knew nothing about it—I said, "You do know something about it; I saw you take it off the seat, and I will make you find it"—he was my pot-boy—it has never been found.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of July, I was going down Saffron-hill. I saw the prisoner and another man with a large bundle. They were in Field-lane; I was in Saffron-hill. I saw them go into a house, where they bought things of this kind; I followed them. It was about half-past two o'clock. I went into the back room; I there saw the woman of the house looking at the coats. I asked her who brought the coats; she said she did not know. I told the men, I knew they had brought them there. They said they did not. I took hold of the two men; one of them tore out of my arms. I kept the prisoner. I saw him with the coats before he went into the house.</p>
               <p>- I am a hostler at Newington. I took these coats of Mr. Rose, but of the chaise, on Wednesday at nine o'clock. I live at Newington Butts.</p>

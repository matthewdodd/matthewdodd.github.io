            . On the 17th of October I went with Clements to search a room in Sherrard-street, Golden-square, where the landlady told me the prisoner lodged with his brother - I found a box. which I got the key of from the prisoner, I think, but I will not be positive - he was in custody; I told him I had searched his lodging, and found these prints and other things, which I suspected were Mr. Fairbairn's; he said the prints were his own, and he could prove where he bought them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no lock or key to the box; the prints were in a bundle on the table, and some under the table. Witness. I will not be positive whether the box was locked or no; the prints were in the box - the pasteboard and paper were in a bundle, partly; I had two keys from him - one was a door key.</p>

               <p>MR. FAIRBAIRN. These prints are mine; these three belonged to a work in the shop, which was waiting for the index - they are illustrations of Bowyer's History of England, and these others belong to the Florence Gallery; I had seen them a day or two before, and urged the prisoner to move them to another part of the shop, as the wet had come in - this book and portfolio we had not seen, as the prisoner had done them when we were out of the shop; I know this marble paper and the Morocco, which correspond with my materials; this pasteboard I had had in use, and here are some marks of glue on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Fairbairn has sworn falsely to many of the articles. and so has the witness; the box was not locked, and the prints were on the table - this paper and board may be bought at any stationer's in London; the prints are common enough, and the fillet is lent to many binders.</p>

             was Ruffle's servant, I never saw the prisoner with the waggon. Appleford's meat produced 21 l. 2 s. and the other 5 l. About eleven o'clock in the morning, after market hours, the prisoner came, and said he had called for Ruffle's money. I asked whose money? he said, Mrs. Peacock's and Mr. Appleford's. Seeing him a stranger, I asked him where his fellow-servant was? He said, poor fellow, he has met with a very bad accident, for on Sunday one of the ropes of the waggon broke, which made the horse go on, and one of the wheels passed over his body; and on his return home, no doubt, he should find him dead. I then paid him two 5 l. and sixteen 1 l. notes, and 2 s. 2 d. He said he had lived upwards of four years with Ruffle. I asked him if he knew Collins, who had just left Ruffle? he said, Yes; and Mr. Ruffle was extremely sorry that he had left. About a fortnight after I saw him in custody.</p>

            . I am waggoner to Mr. Ruffle. On the 12th of October I left Coggleshall at six o'clock, with this meat in my waggon; I fell in with the prisoner at Boreham, he walked as far as Chelmsford with me, then went with a cart, and joined me again near Brentwood. I supped there, and then went on to town. He went into the cart, joined me again at Romford, and came to town with me, on a horse which I had behind my waggon. I had told him the meat was going to Cross; he assisted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210056"></xptr>me in taking it out, and heard me tell the porters to take it there. He never paid me the money for the meat, nor did I authorize him to go for it. I met with no accident on Sunday. I afterwards applied to Cross for the money, and found the prisoner had received it. They described him, and I found him out.</p>

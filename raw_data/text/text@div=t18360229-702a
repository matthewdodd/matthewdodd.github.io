                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, Ebenezer Dewer. We are founders and smiths, and live in Old-street—we make tools—the prisoner was our apprentice for nearly five years—in the course of the last two years I have missed a great many tools—in consequence of information which I received on Thursday, the 11th of February, I went to the station-house and got two constables—Warton, another of my appren<lb></lb>tices, accompanied me—Pierce at that time was a workman of mine, and lived at No. 8, Wilson-street, Old-street-road—I went to that house with War<lb></lb>ton and the two policemen, and in the lower room of that house I found a quantity of tools on the floor, and some in a box—I knew some of them to be ours—I selected such as I knew, and gave Pierce into custody—after that I took a constable back with me to my own manufactory, and took the prisoner into custody—I told him I believed he had got some of my tools—he said he had not—he afterwards said he had got some of them—I said I had found some of our tools at Pierce's house, and Pierce had said they belonged to Sully—the prisoner said he had not got any of our tools—that he had not taken any of out tools—I said Pierce said he had taken them, and that they were at Pierce's house—he said he had made some tools and taken them home with him, but he had made them in his own time—most of the tools I found at Pierce's had marks, but a chisel had my name on it—it was not present when I was speaking to him—there were screws among the tools and I know them by the paper they were wrapped in, the hand-writing of out clerk, who has left us, was on the paper—the prisoner had no authority to carry away any tools or articles from the premises, nor any authority to make tools on the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8 Wilson-street, Old-street. I was in Mr. Dewer's employ for about three months—the prisoner and I worked together at the shop—about a fortnight previous to the discovery of these tools he told me he had got a great quantity of tools at Exeter—I asked him particularly if they belonged to him—he said he had bought the best part of them, and some his father had made—and he asked if I would allow him to bring them to my house—I said, if they all belonged to him I should have no objection—he said he would write a letter on the following Saturday night, and take it to his cousin the afterwards said he took the letter down himself to his cousin at the water-side) he came back to my house on the same Saturday night—I asked him if he took the letter—he said he did, that he had been onboard a long while, and had some wine and grog on board—he said the vessel was going to start the following day, and the tools were to come up the following week from Exeter—and on the following Monday week he told me the tools had been sent in a cart to Helmet-row—he asked if I would allow him to bring them to my house on the following Tuesday—he said he had been to a friend of his in Hel<lb></lb>met-row, and all the tools had arrived—my house was afterwards searched—the tools had come to my house on the Tuesday night after the con<lb></lb>versation on the Monday—I met the prisoner by appointment that night at the corner of Helmet-row—I engaged a truck and took Warton with me—the prisoner took me to a court in Helmet-row—to Harding's—and I assisted him out of the cellar with a box of tools into the truck—there was one good-sized box, and to the best of my knowledge two or three small ones—I took them to my house, and the prisoner unlocked them and put the tools on the ground—I had requested Warton to come with me to watch the truck from Helmet-row to my house, and to come in half an hour afterwards—I took Warton there, that if the tools belonged to Mr. Dewer he might give information—I took him as a witness—I had spoken to him on the Monday previous—I had a suspicion that they belonged to Mr. Dewer—when Warton came in, Sully saw him, and exclaimed, "I am done"—Warton said he had instructions from Mr. Dewer to come and in<lb></lb>spect the tools, and if any resistance took place he would call a constable—it was a previous arrangement between Warton and me that he should say so—the prisoner begged of us not to tell—I requested Warton to come with me and acquaint Mr. Dewer his tools were in my house—Warton said he did not like that—I then proposed that the property should go back—and the prisoner said he would take all Mr. Dewer's property back—the property was selected the following evening—the prisoner filled all his pockets with the tools, which he said belonged to Mr. Dewer, and said he should take them all back to the shop the next morning—I took a great number of drills and turning tools from my house to Mr. Dewer's and put them into my cupboard—I was taken into custody the same day—I put them into my cupboard at Mr. Dewer's factory—the apprentice came to me that morning and asked if I had brought any tools back. and I believe on the following Friday a policeman took them—I put a mark on them—Mr. Dewer produced a chuck in the shop at the same time, and the drills fitted it—Mr. Dewer came to my house on Thursday, the 16th of February, I believe—I did not know the tools when I saw them seattered on my floor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I told the prisoner that I had found some tools at Pierce's, and that Pierce said they belonged to him—he said he had not taken any at first, but afterwards said he had taken some, and that he had made some and taken them too—I found a great quantity of tools at Pierce's—I can speak positively to this tap or hob—my father had it many years before me—I cannot tell when I last saw it on the premises—here are a parcel of screws, which bear the date July 19, 1834, and the name of Knight, written on the paper by one of the clerks—I cannot say when I last saw them—here are two brass bushes, which I have every reason to believe are mine, by the dimensions of them—I cannot say we have lost them, because we keep a stock by us—here is a pair of spring dividers, which I am certain are mine—I cannot say when I had seen them last—here is a chisel, with my name partly obliterated—it is one of the prisoner would be likely to use—here is a screw tool—I cannot say when I saw this last—it is my property—I never sold it—I know then two bolts to be my property—I lost them about a fortnight before—I found them at Pierce's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was it that Pierce said some of the tools belonged to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I saw Pierce at his house, on Thurs<lb></lb>day, he said they did not belong to him, they belonged to the prisoner—that was at the moment I discovered them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>Mr. Garrow. The asking for change was a signal? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was a custom, and of course the other Bowerbank knew it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The other prisoner bought an apron for 4 s. 6 d.? - I believe 5 s.</p>
               <p>Was the apron you found on the prisoner of the same value as that she bought? - Yes, and of the same quality.</p>

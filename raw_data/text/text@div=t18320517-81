On the night of the 23rd of April the prisoners came home to the workhouse with Stubbs and Joyce, a little before eleven o'clock; they rang the bell violently - I got up, and said, "Who is there?" Stubbs said, "Here are four of us;" I went down, and stopped the crank of the bell - they then kicked at the door; I called up some men who were in the house, on whom I could depend; we armed ourselves, in case they should break the foor open, as they thretened to do - they at length went away; I just went out, and ascertained that all was quiet, and sent the men to bed again - after some time Stubbs and Joyce came back, and said the brew house was broken open; the copper is beavy - it would require two persons to move it.</p>

            . I live in the workhouse. On the night in question I came home with the two prisoners - what Mr. Bowen has stated is true; I then saw the two prisoners go over the wall, and I went over in about ten minutes afterwards, to lay down in the oakum shed - I saw the two prisoners taking out the copper; they put it over the wall, and went away - the copper was found in a dunghill half a mile off.</p>

               <p>JOHN JOYCE. I am a pauper in the workhouse. I was with Stubbs - what he states is correct. I was not intoxicated; we went to the Jolly Farmer, and as the landlady could not get an officer, she gave us a pint of beer to go out.</p>

               <p>Flood's Defence. On the Easter Monday night these men were very much intoxicated; they could not tell who took the copper - the oakum shed is ten or fifteen yards from where the copper was; we were so intoxicated that we could not get over a wall ten or fifteen feet high - we could hardly get along.</p>

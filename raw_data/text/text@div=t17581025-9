               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Barnsley live?</p>
               <p>Mascall. He lives in Newgate street; I went to the counting house and asked my master if I should lend him one, he said yes by all means; I lent him one, he carried it away, he crossed the way to Mr. Barnsley's but did not go in, but kept going on towards Newgate, I went and overtook him and took it away from him, and brought it back on my shoulder, and he walked away, then I was advised to go and secure the man, which I did; I took him to Mr. Barnsley's and asked him if he sent him, he said he did not, but he had been at his house to borrow one but a little before, I found afterwards that he had been also to two or three places on the same errand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Barnsley? is he here?</p>
               <p>Mascall. He is a Quaker and will not swear.</p>

               <p>I was at work in Pater-noster-row, my master used to deal with Mr. Barnsley, and since I have been out of my time I have bought things of him; being a little acquainted there, I went to desire him to lend me such a thing, he said he could not; I desired to know whether he could recommend me where to borrow one, he said he could not, except I could get it at a cheesemonger's or a grocer's; then I went over to the gentleman's, and said I came from Mr. Barnsley's and begged for a half hundred weight, he made no dispute at all but went to his master and brought one out; I was going up Warwick-lane, and the young man came to me and said his master would not lend any weight out of the house, I said then there it is, and gave it to him again; after that he came and said, young man you must go along with me, so I went readily; if the court pleases, I would have Mr. Barnsley's maid called.</p>

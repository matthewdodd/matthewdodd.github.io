             sworn. - The prosecutor came to my house on Tuesday the 7th, and staid till between six and seven, when the prisoner came in; the prisoner went into the back room, and called for a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner putting the prosecutor to bed? - A. Yes, I followed them up stairs, and I asked him what he did there; it was a liberty I did not allow; he was then putting Dodson to bed; his cloaths lay upon the ground close by the bed where he got into, and I desired him to get into the other bed; I desired the prisoner to go down stairs; he said he would not go, he would stay there for five minutes; I took both the candles in my hand, and was going to leave him in the dark; but finding he would not come, I left one candle; but before that I had picked up his clothes off the floor, and put them in a chair; and I then had the chain of the watch in my hand; I went down; I had not been down three minutes when I saw the prisoner come down stairs; and he said, you had better give 
               <persName id="t18000115-37-person357">George</persName>
             some anniseed, but warm it first; I directly thought there was something amiss, and I immediately ran up stairs; he went out to the door with a pipe, as if he was only going to the door; I went up stairs, and saw that the breeches had been moved; I examined the breeches, and found the money and watch and every thing gone; the prisoner did not return.</p>
               <p>- WATTS sworn. - I am serjeant-major of the Tower Hamlets militia, second regiment; I assisted to search the prisoner; I found this watch upon him; the knife and the money was found upon him by the next witness.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH JERNO sworn. - I am a serjeant in the Tower Hamlets militia: I found a pen-knife and a pocket-handkerchief upon the prisoner. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Dodson. This is my watch: I am sure I had it when I went up stairs; the knife has the two first letters of my name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your watch cost you? - A. About four months ago I gave two pounds seven shillings for it; the chain cost me six shillings and sixpence, and the seal four shillings and sixpence, and the knife one shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was drinking with Dodson at a free and easy club that is held at Mr. Gibson's, he was very drunk, and I took off his clothes, and put him to bed; he desired me to take his watch and other things to take care of them.</p>

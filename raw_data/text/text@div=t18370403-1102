On the 1st of January last I was in Drury-lane, in the evening—I had dined—I saw the prisoner there—she was not dressed exactly as she is now—I went to a house in Charles-street, Drury-lane—she was very anxious to have some drink—I had part of it, and I have reason to believe it was <hi rend="italic">drugged</hi>—I went to bed, and fell asleep in a very short time—when I awoke in the morning, the prisoner was one—I missed my coat, waistcoat, silver watch, snuff-box, my breast-pin, and cash, and all, except my breeches—I saw the prisoner again on the 27th of March, in Hart-street—I followed her, and I said, "How do you do to-night?"—she did not speak at all—she did not seem to know me—I am sure she is the woman—I said, "What is the matter with you to-night? you and I are old friends; why don't you speak?"—she still continued to deny that she had ever seen me—I said, "It is of no use; you are the person that robbed me; if you restore my property, free of expense, I shall not prosecute you"—I met a constable, and gave her in harge—I was drunk, but my recol lection is pretty good—I was infected with drink—upon my solemn oath, I swear she is the person.</p>

The prisoner lodged there twice with her husband, or a man that pasted as such, of the name of Johnson—she went by his name—on the Saturday fortnight, before I was examined, I went to her to get some rent—I had asked for it before—she gave me the ticket of what she said was her husband's coat—there were three more duplicates that I got from her—I do not know whether this is the ticket of the coat—I did not look at it—I gave the ticket to Scott, my master—the first two I gave my mistress.</p>

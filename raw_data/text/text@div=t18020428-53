Yes, it came clean out; I immediately laid hold of the man that took it, which was the prisoner; he handed it to a man at his left hand, who made off with it; I still kept hold of the man who took it; I told the young man to go and fetch the watch man; he went, and fetched the watchman, and in that time the other man had made off; then one of them came back, and asked what was the matter, and the soldier wanted to get away; he said, do you think I have got your watch? I am a King's man; and then opened his outside coat, and shewed me his red coat under it; I told the young man that was one of them, and he secured him.</p>

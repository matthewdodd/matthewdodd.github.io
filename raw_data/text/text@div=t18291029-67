About the 12th of October, in consequence of information, I went to Reeve, a pawnbroker, of Snowhill, and recognized three umbrellas in his window, as our manufacture; they had no ticket on them; I went into the shop and saw lvey, and from what he said I had the prisoner apprehended; Ivey came to our door and pointed him out - he recognized him immediately, and gave us every facility he could; the cost price of two of the umbrellas is 18s. and one 16s., that is rather under the cost price - the retail price is 25s. and 27s. - they would readily fetch that in the trade - we should have an intermediate profit; I charged the prisoner with stealing umbrellas and parasols; he said he had sold none to any body except Reeve; I never gave him authority to sell any.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Yours is rather a large business? A. Yes; we sell a great many of this description; the prisoner's father is a tube-maker, and worked for us - he makes frames.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Reeve, of Snowhill. The prisoner has been to our shop about twenty times within the last six months, to pawn and sell umbrellas and parasols; I produced to Mr. Rutter some umbrellas which the prisoner sold; I bought two of them myself of him. and paid him 12s. for the large one and 11s. for the small - I cannot say whether I bought the third - they are quite new.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know his father? A. Yes; but I do not recollect ever seeing him at our shop; he repaired umbrellas for us - he did not keep a shop; he has been dead about three years.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live on Snow-hill. I have bought umbrellas of the prisoner, but neither of these - here is one on the table which will not fetch 6d. more than I gave; the Magistrate sent for me three times before I went; as I knew nothing about it I did not think it necessary to go - I did not at all suspect the prisoner, and should not have objected to buy fifty a week of him; I knew him and his friends.</p>

            . These are the umbrellas I bought for 11s. and 12s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose there are many umbrellas in your shop? A.Several; I know I bought these of him, because I had none others in the window, nor in the shop at the time; I do not consider there is 6d. a yard difference in the quality of the silks; I gave what I thought a fair price, and only asked 14s. for them when Mr. Rutter came to ask the price.</p>
               <p>MR. RUTTER. These are our umbellas, they are the best quality that are made in London - I have stated less than the cost price; the frames are marked with the initials of our workman; and for eighteen years I have never seen a silk with this particular border except what was made for us; I cannot say they were never sold, but I believe not - I never allowed him to sell them.</p>

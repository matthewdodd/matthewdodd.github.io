               <p>I was robbed the 21st of September in the afternoon, the things were taken out of my jacket pocket unknown to me in <placeName id="t17931030-63-crimeloc338">Rosemary-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was in the purse? - Two half crowns, a shilling, a sixpence, a sixpence that was not passable and some half-pence, I cannot justly tell how many; I had it in my hand not above five minutes before it was taken out of my pocket; I had paid for a pair of stockings that cost me seven-pence in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid for them in the shop or in the street? - I dropped a halfpenny out of my hand, and the prisoner picked it up and gave it to me, I put the money into my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at that time that you put the purse and money into your pocket? - It was, and I turned myself round and a Mr. Pratt came and told me that I was robbed, and I felt and found my purse was gone, I did not know who had it nor did not know what was become of it; I and Mr. Pratt went up a little alley to see if we could find out who the thief was, but I could not find him, and I did not make any further enquiry that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find him in the alley? - I did not; I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any reason since to suppose that the prisoner has taken your property? - I have no reason at all otherwise than by evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know no more about it than nothing at all, I never saw the man at all in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Had you taken observation of him enough to know him again? - He was standing right opposite to me while I was dealing for the stockings; and I dropped a halfpenny out of my hand, and he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q Is there any one time that you can fix that your money was taken from you? - No one time at all, I did not feel the least thing in the world of its going.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a coal heaver.</p>

               <p>I was in Rosemary-lane, the time the prosecutor speaks of, I saw the prisoner at the bar follow Mr. Dando, and I saw him turn his jacket and take the purse out of his pocket, and had it in his hand, and then he ran away, I stepped up to the prosecutor and told him his pocket was picked, and told him where the man went, and as soon as we got to a little court we lost him for that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of the purse? - It was a brown dark canvas bag, dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the prosecutor put in this bag when he put in the change? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the prisoner after this? - On the Monday following, this was on Saturday night, on Monday we see him again.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was the prisoner you see? - I know it was the same person, I had seen him before then a good many times, I have no doubt of his person, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on him? was he searched? have you any thing more to say about it? - No.</p>

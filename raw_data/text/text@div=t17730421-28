            . On the 6th of April, between eleven and twelve, as I was going up a turning into Sherwood-street, I heard the cry of stop thief: there was a coach about twelve yards from me: I saw a person running without a hat; I lifted up my cane, and he jumped from the foot-way into the coach-way; I followed him and struck him on the back of the head with my cane; that stopped him; there was a gentleman with me at a distance that followed him; his name is John Hall; I thought Mr. Hall had him fast, but he got from him; I followed him to Shug-lane, and there I struck him once or twice; Mr. Hall said take care he has either a knife or pistol; I took up my cane to strike him again, and he run at me, and struck me with something in my eye, I believe it was a pistol; I knocked him aside and fell down; I got up again on the foot-way; he ran towards where there was a cry of stop thief; he then returned back again, and I struck him again; I was rather spent at that time; Mr. Hall came up to me, and asked me whether I was wounded or hurt; I said no, not at all; he said lend me your cane, I can run faster then you; he took it and run after him, and knocked him down; I came up instantly, and Mr. Hall and I gave him up to the watch; we went to the watch house; we did not know what he had done; the next morning we had him before Sir

            . On the 6th of this month I spent the evening at a coffee-house in James-street, Golden-square, with some gentlemen, two of whom live in the square; I and another came down Sherwood-street, at twelve o'clock; almost facing my friends in Charles-street, there was a coach and some people about it; I passed by, but had not been gone above ten or fifteen yards before I heard the cry of stop thief; I turned about and saw a man run away and two other men in pursuit of him; the foremost of the two men was pretty close to him; I imagined he had been some pick pocket; I ran into the coach-way with intent to seize him as he passed by; he however got past me, and ran down Shug-lane; the same man that I saw nearest him first, pursued him down Shug-lane, and was very near him; the other man and I followed him.</p>

            . Mrs. Richardson left these goods at Mr. Lewis's, till I had an opportunity of bringing them to town. I took the box from Mr. Lewis's, put it upon a wooden horse that I carry my lamps upon, and it was lost from thence - I am a lamplighter. The goods were advertised with two guineas reward. I went in search after the Prisoner, and found her near the Packhorse on Turnham Green, and the lace upon her. I said, I take you in the King's name, on suspicion of theft; for I had no warrant. She said, she would go with me with all her heart.</p>

            . I saw the Prisoner setting on the pole of the horse. I saw her some time after with a box of lace in a handkerchief. I saw her afterwards at Chelsea, and she had got a basket full of goods, and a shift, an apron, and other things. I said, she had had good luck. She said, when the King went out of Kensington, she had a gift given her. I said, she had better luck than I; for the King did not give me any - she sells pins and thread. As she opened her basket, I saw three pieces of headlace in it.</p>

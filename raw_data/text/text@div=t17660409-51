            . I was concerned with the 2 prisoners at the bar, in robbing this gentleman's yard; it was in the night; I cannot tell the exact time. I and Braine were on the outside of the gate, and Haines got within side, and he put us about 300 weight of tobacco under the gates. We carried it to Rosemary-lane in bags, and sold it to a tobacconist, named Cosgrove. I was taken up first, in Houndsditch, as I was going to Haines's house, for stealing a quantity of linen; and I made a discovery of this. As soon as I got into Clerkenwell-bridewell, I sent for Mr. Clay and told him of it.</p>

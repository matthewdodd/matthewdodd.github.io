On the 3d of May, at ten minutes past six o'clock at night, I stood by while my wife locked the door - we went out, and returned home at twenty minutes before nine; the door had been unlocked, and was fastened inside - it was twilight; I broke it open, and found the prisoner there - he was a stranger; my wife had deposited four sovereigns and a half in a drawer, and they were gone - the shawl and other articles were removed from the bed-room, and were on the stairs loose: my family have the whole house - I do not know the value of the property.</p>

             REED. I was returning home, and saw some persons at the door - I heard there was some one going up stairs; I went up the next house, and called to the people to watch at the bottom - no one came out at the top, and I went down; we broke the door open - I went up stairs, and found a flower-pot removed from the window, and several articles of wearing apparel on the stairs; I went down again, and found the prisoner in the cellar at the foot of the stairs - he said, "I am he: there is only me, don't be afraid" - I took him up.</p>

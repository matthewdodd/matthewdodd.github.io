On Saturday, 6th May, I was in company with constables Harvey, Neville, and Hawkins, in George-street, Foley-street, Tottenham-court-road, and saw the prisoner Alexander come from No. 27, in that street—I crossed over with the other constables, seized him by the arm, and told him I belonged to the police, and had directions to take him into custody, on suspicion of having in his possession counterfeit coin—I pushed him into a shop, put my hand into his waistcoat pocket, and found in it two half-crowns and ten shillings, separately divided by paper to prevent them rubbing—he said, "It is all right, you have got me <hi rend="italic">to rights</hi>"—I also found four half-crowns, five shillings, six sixpences, and seven fourpenny-pieces, all good—I then took him to the house he came from,</p>

                  </hi> I am the author of a work entitled, "The Art of Work<lb></lb>ing in Metals"—my attention has been particularly drawn to that subject—these articles produced are four voltaic batteries with wires, which have a plate of silver attached to one end of them, and zinc on the other—one end is bend, and has evidently received a deposit of silver—the object of this apparatus is to supply the voltaic force, to pass through a solution containing silver, and to deposit silver—these four cups would be for the pur<lb></lb>pose of receiving such a solution to deposit on any other metal—any metallic substance inserted in the solution, would be at once coated by this process with silver—the solution produced by the officer, stated to have been in the battery, contains a mixture od sulphuric acid and sulphate of zinc—the sul<lb></lb>phate of zinc would arise in the action of the battery; sulphuric acid being required to charge the battery—the solution in the cup would produce the same effect, being acted upon by the voltaic battery—it contains silver—this sixpence, taken from Wilmot's hand, is evidently coated with silver so depo<lb></lb>sited—these three sixpences found in one of the cups have evidently been in</p>

               <p>but a very short period—the process was just commencing—I cannot judge how long they had been subjected to the process, as that would depend on the strength of the charge—there is a greater deposit on the first sixpence than on these—they might have been put in at different times, or if put in at the same time, might have a different amount of silver on them—they are evidently base—the first is not silver (<hi rend="italic">bending it</hi>)—I have torn off some of the silver, and the base metal underneath can be distinctly seen—I should think that sixpence could not have arrived at that stage in less than a quarter of an hour or ten minutes, but it is a doubtful point—the things pro<lb></lb>duced are quite complete for the purpose of silvering base metal—I put one of the solutions into the of the batteries, and another into one of the cups, and put into it one of the half-crowns produced by Brannan, uncovered, and I got this distinct deposit of silver on it—these shillings are all covered with silver deposited by the voltaic agency—they are quite complete—judging from the solution not containing a large quantity of silver, I think the pro<lb></lb>cess must have been conducted rather slowly, at any rate a quarter of an hour, or even longer—I was about two hours casing the half-crown, but there was very little solution—these sixpences found on the table have been sub<lb></lb>jected to the same process—they are perfectly covered, and are very well done—they would of course be wet when taken out of the cup.</p>

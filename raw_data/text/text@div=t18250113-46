            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Sunday I was desired to watch this house - I placed myself in a house opposite, and saw the prisoner let in about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, by somebody - next morning about nine, I saw him come out, and followed him into a shop in Cromer-street - I went in; he was talking to a woman - I found a pair of women's boots in one of his pockets, and two pairs of shoes in the other, another pair in his hat, and a key in his coat-pocket, which opens Peart's parlour-door, which leads to the shop.</p>

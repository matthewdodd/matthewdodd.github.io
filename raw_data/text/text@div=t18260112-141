            . I am a carpenter. I was working at Watkins' house - I went to the roof, and saw the prisoner standing in the gutter of the third house - I said "You thieving rascal - what do you want there;" he started off, and went across three houses, and I after him - he slipped through a roof, and got down into a house; I called out,"He is in the house" - he then jumped out of a window, and was taken, I believe, but I did not see him. I went back, and found this lead rolled up in the gutter, where I had first seen him; he had a hat on when I saw him, but I can swear it was the prisoner - he left his hat in the sepair of stairs room.</p>

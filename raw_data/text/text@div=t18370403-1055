                  </hi>. I am a horse-hair manufacturer. On Sunday morning, the 25th of March, between two and three o'clock, I had come from a friend's house, and met the prisoner at the corner of Fieldgate-street—she was a stranger—she asked if I would go with her—I said "Yes"—we went into Greenfield-street—I paid her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had one half-crown and three shillings, and other money in my waistcoat pocket—I did not miss that till I had parted with her about ten minutes—I then went to look for her again—I found her, and charged the policeman with her—I told him she had robbed me of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she denied having the money—I was pre<lb></lb>sent when a half-crown was found in her mouth—I am sure she denied having it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw these parties together—the prosecutor gave the prisoner into custody for robbing him—he got to the station-house, and then he counted his money, and said it was a half-crown and three shillings—I asked the prisoner if she had got any money—she said, "No"—I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence out of her hand—she said she never saw him at first, and then said she had seen him—my brother officer took the half-crown—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>

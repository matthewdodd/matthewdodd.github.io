On the 8th of February there was a fire at my house; I lost a leather trunk out of my house containing a brown suit of clothes, a brown velvet waistcoat and a pair of velvet breeches, a pair of stone buckles set in silver and a linen handkerchief. I missed them in the evening; a man told me he had found a trunk in the King's Mews; there was nothing in it; I fetched the trunk the day after; the trunk belonged to the landlord where I lodged; his name is

               <p>Q. Who did the things in the trunk belong to?</p>
               <p>Hawsher. Me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed the trunk had you seen these things in it?</p>
               <p>Hawsher. The day before I had them on, and put them in on Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any of the things afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hawsher. Yes; there was a man that brought a coat, and another that stopt the waistcoat and breeches in consequence of my having advertised it.</p>
               <p>Sampson Hodgkin. I bought this suit of clothes of the prisoner on Tuesday the 9th of this month; I met the prisoner in the street; he said he was a gentleman's servant; we went into the Rose in Wimpole-street, Cavendish-square; he offered the clothes to some Jews; they could not agree for them; I asked him to let me look at them; he brought them; I asked him the price of them; he said 36 s. he had another waistcoat and breeches; I asked where the coat of that suit was; he said his master wore it with other clothes; (the clothes produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I am a Frenchman, and am not acquainted with the English law. On Tuesday morning a man came to me in Piccadilly; he had some clothes to sell; he offered them to some people; they could not agree; then he shewed the clothes to me and I bought them; then he shewed me a pair of shoe buckles and asked if I would buy them; he asked half a guinea for them; he said he lived with a gentleman that was gone abroad; I met a Jew; he asked if I would sell the clothes again; I said I would not in the street, so we went into a public house, but we could not agree; a chairman bid me 31 s. 6 d. for them; I told him I could not take it; then I went to another house and shewed them to another Jew; he bid me 15 s. for them; the man collared me and asked if I would take the 15 s. I said I would not; the gentlewoman bid me tie the clothes up, for they did not want to buy them; then the man in black knocked me down and said I had stole the clothes. I am as innocent of it as the child unborn.</p>

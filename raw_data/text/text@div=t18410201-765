                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Hornchurch, in Essex—Wright was my wagoner. I had occasion early in the morning of the 19th of January, to send him with a load of hay from Hornchurch to London—William Patten, my boy, was to accompany him—I do not know at what time they left—two or three days after, Richardson, a police<lb></lb>man, produced some hay to me—I examined it—I had hay on my pre<lb></lb>mises in stack—I had reason to believe that the hay shown to me was part of my stack—the prisoner had no right to cut hay from my stack for the purpose of his horses—he had strict orders to the contrary—he had ample provision of corn and chaff for his horses on the road—so much so, that they often bring some back—I send it in nose-bags, and they have a sack also—I know nothing of Dawson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the prosecutor. I was <hi rend="italic">mate</hi> to Wright on the morning of the 19th of January, when we went up from Hornchurch—we started about three o'clock in the morning—I met the wagoner at the farm—there is a hay-knife belonging to the farm—he took it out of the stack and cut a bit of hay out square, like a truss, nearly a truss, and put it on the top of his load—he stuck the knife in the stack again—as we were going up, before we got to East Ham he said, "Don't you say nothing about this bit of hay to nobody"—I did not say any thing—we went on till we came to the Rising Sun in East Ham—Dawson is ostler there—when we got there we stopped—the nose-bags were put on the horses—after that, Wright got up on the top of the cart, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the bundle of hay down to Dawson, and he took it into bis stable—I heard no conversation—I knew that Wright bad no right to any hay for his horses—no one was up on the premises in the morning when we started—after the horses had been fed at the Rising Sun, we went on to London—no hay was given to the horses by me or Wright—when we got to the farm two or three days after, Wright said, "There is a policeman, I don't know what he is after"—he said, "Don't you say any thing about that hay to your master."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

            . I am a Waterman. On last Monday night the prisoner was drinking along with me: After that we went down King James's Stairs, there the prisoner took a boat and pair of sculls without leave; I know not whose they were. We went on board a ship at King James's Stairs. He handed down two pieces of tow-line to me, about three fathom of them both; then we went on board capt. Simpson's ship, there he took down the tow-line of the forecastle, I believe about sixty fathom; we put it in the boat, and carried it down to

            . I am constable. About half an hour after ten o'clock last Tuesday night, Mrs. Lee sent her daughter for me to go and take a thief, who said her mother was in custody for receiving some stolen rope, and if I would go and take a man up, it might be a means of clearing her mother. I took him, but he would not make a voluntary confession. He mentioned this evidence as being concerned with him; so we went and took him, and he was admitted evidence against the prisoner. The prisoner owned the stealing the rope out of the ship, and said it weighed eight hundred three quarters, for which they were paid, and fourteen pounds they were not paid for. The rope is in custody of a headborough at Limehouse. The evidence has given information of several other facts committed.</p>

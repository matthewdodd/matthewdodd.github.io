                  </hi>. I am a window, and live in Weather-court, White-cross-street, in the parish of St. Luke, Middlesex. I have known the prisoner some years as a neighbour—on Sunday evening, the 13th of March, she came to my house, and I kept her all day—she said she had had some words with her mother, and in the evening I told her to go—she went away in the evening, and came again on Monday morning, and told me her father-in-law would let her in, provided her mother would consent—I ad<lb></lb>vised her to return to her mother, for it was her place to bend to her mother, and her mother to her—i told her to come again, and let was know whether she had made it up with her mother, but not to come on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, as I should be out at work—i went out to work on Wednesday morning, the 16th of March, about seven o'clock—I returned again between ten and eleven o'clock at night—I left my little boy in charge of the place—I locked the door when I went out at seven o'clock, and shoved the key under the door inside for him to open the door to let himself out—when I came home, I found my boxes had been opened, and missed the articles stated—i found the room door locked—my little boy had come and met me down at his aunt's in Lam's-passage, Chiswell-street—my children always meet me there when I am late—I came in, I found on the floor two caps, a handkerchief, and a piece of patchwork—that led me to examine my boxes—two boxes had been opened, and the things goes—they were not locked before I went out—all the things lost, but one cap, belonged to Sophia Sergeant—they were left in my care—on the Friday following, I founded prisoner sitting on the step of a door in Banner-street, White-cross-street—i gave information to the officer, and she was taken into custody—I asked her what she was sitting there for—she she was waiting for a young girl—when I got the officer. I asked her how she could rob me—she said she had not robbed me.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Dunn. I can swear to these shoes; I saw them safe about seven o'clock on the evening of the 12th of April, hanging just by the door post. I missed them at half-past seven; I saw them the next day, when the officer, Thompson, brought them.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they hanging outside the shop? A. No; they were by the door post, inside - they were two or three inches within the shop; the prisoner cut them down; we had a good many shoes of the same make, but had not sold any that week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He cut them down? A. Yes, and left the piece of string on the nail - they were all fastened with one string.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 12th of April, a little before eight o'clock, I was in Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner with this parcel, tied in this handkerchief; he was going to Playhouse-yard - I crossed over to him, and said Stop! he stopped; I said, "What have you got under here?" he said, "You know" - I said it was impossible I should know; he said,"They are two pair of shoes, Tom;" I said "Where did you get them?" he said he bought them of a man in the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was this from the shop? A. About a mile.</p>

I am a widow, and reside with my mother, in Bridgehouse-fplace, Southwark—she keeps a coffee-shop—the prisoner lodged at her house, but ceased to do so on the 7th of Oct.—during the latter part of that time he paid his addresses to me, and I saw him at the house from time to time since he left—I was examined at the Police-court on the 16th of Jan.—about six weeks before that he was at the house—I told him my friends did not approve of his visits, and I did not wish him to come any more—he said if he did not have me, no one else should—I have told him since that his visits were not approved of—on Sunday night, the 14th of Jan., I saw him at my mother's house, and told him he must not come again, I should not speak to him if he did—he wished me good bye, and said he should not come any more—on the Monday morning the shop was opened about six o'clock—he came in, and said he had come to see me again and bid me good bye, he should not come again, I should see his corpse before night—my mother came into the room directly after, and said if he did not leave she would charge a policeman with him—he then went away—at five that evening he came through the coffee-room into the bar, and said, "I am come to see you again"—I said, "I see you have"—he had both hands in his coat-pockets—my mother was in the room—he repeated the same words to her, "I am come to see you again"—he then began to abuse her—she told him not to make a disturbance he would disturb the gentlemen in the coffee-room—I said, "Charles, why do you act in such a manner?"—I did not notice any reply—I was stand<lb></lb>ing up, in the act of drawing some coffee, which was on the stove, by the side of the fire, and heard the snap of a pistol which he presented at my left ear—I was standing sideways to him—I heard the snap, turned my head, and saw the pistol within two or three inches of my ear—I felt a pain in my ear for two hours after, from the sound of the snap—my mother flew up to him directly, and pulled his arms back—Davey, who was in the coffee-room, came in and took the pistol out of his hand.</p>

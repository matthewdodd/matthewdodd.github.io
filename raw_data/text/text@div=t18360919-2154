Richard's—he afterwards went with an empty van to Irongate Wharf—I watched him from there, with a full van, again to the same place—he came away with twelve prickles, and again went to Good<lb></lb>man's-yard—he stopped, and gave the reins to the boy, and got down, he took the hindmost prickle as before, put it on his back, and went to the stable—I could see into the stable—I saw a man there, (whom I believe to be Tame, but I could not swear to him,) harnessing a horse—after this full prickle had been carried in, King brought out an empty one, and moved the hind one, and put that behind it—I watched the van the second time, and saw the same thing occur again—I followed the van to Mr. Richards's were-house the second time—I then tapped King on the shoulder, and side, "You have been robbing your master of bottles"—he said, "What?"—I told him he had been robbing his master—I took him into the counting-house and told Mr. Richards what I had seen—he gave him into custody—the cart arrived at Goodman's-yard at half past-four or a quarter to five o'clock—I afterwards went to Tame's house with Mr. Richards and three officers—I took Tame—he was standing at the door—that was about half-past six o'clock—the road from the Ironagte Wharf to Mr. Richards's is not through Goodman's-yard—it is not much out of the way—it was not the direct way.</p>

               <p>an officer to be stationed at Goodman's-yard—King was carman from five to seven year—on that day there was a vessel unloading at the Iron<lb></lb>gate Wharf, containing bottles, and among others beer-bottles—King was sent with our van that day to fetch loads off that wharf, not beer-bottles only—he went six or seven times before any communication was made to me—we have a clerk at the wharf to see the prickles property loaded—six dozen of beer-bottles should he in each prickle, and twelve prickles in a van—that is the proper ordinary load—about five o'clock that afternoon I received a communication from the officer Barker—in consequence of that, King was taken and brought to our counting-house—my father gave him in charge—he was told he was taken into custody for delivering bottles at Tame's stables—he said he knew nothing about it—I went to Tames's—he is a wine-cooper and bottle-marchant—his house is in Prescott-street—he has a warehouse in Goodman's-yard, and a stable there—we found him at his door—Barker asked him if his name was Tame—he said, "My name is Tame"—the officer was in plain clothes—he said, "I must take you into custody for receiving bottles stolen from Mr. Richards"—he said. "What bottles? I know nothing about any bottles?"—I then went to the stable—Them went with me in custody—I asked him, "Have you a loft?—he said, "Yes, I have"—"What is in it?"—he said, "Nothing but hay and straw"—I said, "We must search it"—Smith was found at the stable and taken, and a man named Butler was taken, but discharged the same evening—we went up stairs into the loft—I did not minutely search it that evening, but I found a large bin of bottles, and ascertained they were our property—I drew samples from various parts of the bin—I did not examine every bottle—I have brought samples from the bottles in our bulk, and, from what were found there, my belief is, that there cannot be a doubt on the mind of any one, after looking at them, that they are the same—the greater portion of them were made at one particular ma<lb></lb>nufactory, and no other bottles are permitted to be sent from there to any other person in town—they are under a heavy penalty not to do it—the samples are here—the bottles found in that bin were wine-bottles—they were different sorts, disposed in different layers, and of two different manufactories—the ship they were unloading that bin what day was from our ma<lb></lb>nufacturer—we found different qualities—we had vessels unloading the day before, and on the Wednesday—King had been employed in carting these bottles, and we found them placed in the bin in the same order that King had to remove them from the ship, from two different vessels—that bin was not covered over—we found a variety of other bottles on a subsequent search on the premises—we found some that had the bloom on them, at his house, and in the loft—they had not been used—there is no way of restoring that bloom—we send no bottles out with that bloom on them—they are all washed and cleaned—there are six bottles of one sort to the gallon, and some four—we found some we call pale claret bottles, which I be<lb></lb>lieve are of a shape and quality peculiar to our house—they are designed for Bucellas and pale brandy—this is one that we found, and this is one from our warehouse—the bloom is produced by the sulphur that comes from the coals—we remove it by vitriolic acid and water—it is a difficult thing to remove—103 dozen bottles were found on Tame's premises—I re<lb></lb>ceived information which led me to the house of James Goss, ship<lb></lb>chandler, and exporter of wine, beer, and spirits—I found twenty-four dozen bottles there of the kind that were landed on the 14th, and which King was employed to convey-that would be the quantity contained in four</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Goss. I was expecting some bottles to be sent from Mr. Tame's—I went to his premises on the morning of Wednesday, the 14th—I saw Tame, and asked him what time he was going to send the bottles in—he said in the course of the afternoon or evening—I do not recollect that he said why he had not sent them—I was at my master's on the evening of that day, and Tame brought two gross of bottles in a cart drawn by one horse—the same bottles were afterwards claimed by the prosecutor—they came in prickles—I did not notice whether they had been recently washed, but in the morning I filled them—I then found they were wet—I did not notice any thing then, but when I corked them I noticed one or two with the bloom on—I did not examine them all, but this attracted my attention—they were delivered up to Messrs. Richards.</p>

               <p>there was a receipt signed, I did not sign it—I filled them on Thurs<lb></lb>day, and they were taken away on Saturday—we have a great many bottles—we buy them generally of one person—I received them as good regular bottles—I saw nothing particular in the shape of them—If I had seen them a week afterwards any where else, I should not have known them.</p>

               <p>Tame's Defence. I am placed before this bar innocently, on a case I do not know any thing at all about. I am in the habit of buying new bottles as well as old—my trade is all over London, and I buy bottles (when I am short) of other bottles merchants in the new way; and, also I get a great many from on board ships, and there is no doubt but they come from the very same factory that Mr. Richards's does. When these bottles were received I was out very near the whole of the day; I generally am everyday. I keep at home three or four men to do my business while I am out bottling wine, and attending wine-merchants. I never bought a stolen bottle to my knowledge—I should be very sorry for my men to rob me, and I would not encourage it in any one else—I am a wine and bottle-merchant.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Snow, a surgeon of Mile-end; Robert Prendergast, cellerman; William Chillingworth, wine-merchant, of Cooper's-row, Crutched-friars; James Rowe, hearth-rug maker, Orange-street; Richard Barnes, licensed victualler, George-street, Minories; Moses Magnus, merchant; Walter Baird, merchant's clerk; William Turner; Stephen Simpson, inn-keeper; John Atkins, cow-keeper; James Key, oilman; and Solomon Jonas, gave the prisoner Tame a good character. Joseph Oxtell, a cabinet-maker; Henry Wait, boot and shoe maker; Sarah King; Mr. Arnold; Edward Giff, harness-maker, Macclesfield-street; William Lewis, coal-merchant, Artillery-lane, Bishopsgate-street; Jonathan Tailor, butcher, Devonshire-street; and James Brown, Cottage-lane, City-road, gave King a good character)</p>

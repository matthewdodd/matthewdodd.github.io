               <p>Q. On the 8th of June, did you miss any articles out of your shop - A. I did. I went out in the morning, between seven and eight o'clock; my wife and Elizabeth Stollworthy had the charge of the shop while I was away. When I returned I missed a roll of hair shag and a roll of corderoy; they were in the window when I went out. After that I went down to my stable;

             came to me at the stable, and said, come down, you have been robbed of two yards of hair shag and two yards and three quarters of worsted shag. I then went back to my shop. My wife and

             told me the prisoner had been in the shop, and had bought an article. Before I went out, I saw the yards of hair shag and the two yards and three quarters of worsted shag.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the shop when you went out in the morning - A. Upon my oath they were; and when I went out to my stable they were there then. I then went after the prisoner into the Harrow-road; I met her coming out of the washhouse of the Running Horse public-house, in the Harrow-road. I was close to her heels all the way. I brought her back to my house, and sent for a constable. Before the constable came,

            . On the 8th of June, I saw the prisoner in the washhouse of the Running Horse public-house between eight and nine in the evening. I saw her in the washhouse before the last witness. I went in directly she was taken to give her her fish. I found two pieces of shag in the washhouse, one piece of hair shag, and a piece of worsted shag; they were laying on the dresser. I took them to Mr. Green. These are the two pieces of shag.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor, and serve in the shop. On the 8th of June, the prisoner came into the shop three times in that day; the two first times she purchased nothing; the last time she purchased a pair of cotton drawers; that was eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>GEORGE KEWNEY. I live at No. 34, Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane. On the 13th of June, I was trying to get through <placeName id="t18330704-69-crimeloc346">St. Paul's church-yard</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you feel my hand in your pocket? A. I felt some hand - I did not tell the Magistrate that you threw my handkerchief down.</p>

             (City police-constable No. 86). I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had taken some work home for my master, and was going through the crowd when this gentleman took hold of me - I told him he was mistaken; and a lady said she saw a man take it, but not me - four men laid hold of me; I wanted to speak to the lady to tell her to come forward, but they would not let me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KEWNEY. A woman came and said, "What has he been doing;" I said, picking my pocket; and she went away immediately; she said nothing else - there was another person helped me to take the prisoner to the officer; and the same person came to me the next morning and wished me not to prosecute; but I believe that was the person to whom the prisoner was giving the handkerchief - I swear it was not on the ground at all; I took it from his hand.</p>

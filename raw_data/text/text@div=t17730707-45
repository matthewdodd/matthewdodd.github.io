            . About half after two I saw the prisoner go down on Mr. Hurford's wharf empty; I watched him and saw him come back with the coals; I stopped him with the bag on his shoulder; he shewed me the craft he took them out of; I did not see him go into the craft; he flung the coals on the ground and ran away; I pursued and took him; I charged him with stealing the coals; he did not deny it, but said he would carry them back to where he had them, and would have gone back if I would have let him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hurford. On the 29th of May the two witnesses informed me they had taken a man who had robbed me of some coals; I saw the prisoner afterwards and he acknowledged he took them out of my craft.</p>

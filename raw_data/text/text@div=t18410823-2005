                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Mr. Robert Brown, of No. 68, Sloane-street, Chelsea. On Friday night, the 6th of August, I went to bed at ten o'clock—my mistress was up last, and she shut the street-door—before I went to bed I saw that the staircase-window was shut and fastened—I got up on Saturday morning about six o'clock, and went down with the cook—J noticed the staircase-window wide open—I went into the parlour, and found it all upset, and every thing turned out of the boxes—a pair of plated candlesticks, which had been left on the table over-night, were wrapped up in a neck-handkerchief on a chair—I found a pair of strange shoes just inside the parlour door—they did not belong to any of the family—I called my master up, and missed the snuffer<lb></lb>tray, snuffers, and several other things—the key of the study-door was gone—it had hung at the side of the study-door overnight—I have since seen it at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Rev. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE BROWN</hi>. I am a clergyman, and live with my father in Sloane-street, in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. I was called up about half-past seven o'clock, on the morning of the 7th of August, by Isbell—I went immediately into my study, and found it in very great confusion—papers which I kept in my drawers were strewed about the floor—I had five or six desks in the study, all of which were broken open—a box of bronze medals, of the victories of the Duke of Wellington, was gone from my brother's desk, which was not locked—two gold seals were taken from my desk, which was broken open—a letter, which I had left sealed over-night, was broken open, and some money which it contained taken out—I also missed a pencil-case, a gold ring, and a pair of cloth boots which I had left at my bed-room door when I went to bed the night before—a pair of shoes were found near the parlour-door, which did not belong to any of the family—the value of the articles I lost is rather above 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the tops of the candlesticks, the snuffers and tray, were gone from the parlour—they were not silver—they belong to my father, whose name is Robert—it is his dwelling-house—I do not pay the rent, but reside with him—a hat of my brother's, Robert Charles Brown, was also gone—I examined the staircase window, and it appeared to have been opened from the out<lb></lb>side, at the bottom—it appeared to have had great force applied to it—a new brass fastening had been put to it a few days before, and that was broken short in the middle, without breaking the glass—I saw it fastened overnight, when I went to bed—I observed two clothes-props, one against the back door, and one above, as if they had been used to climb up by—I have since seen the boots and medals at Queen-square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the B division of police. I re<lb></lb>ceived information of this robbery—in consequence of something I learnt I went on Saturday morning, 14th August, at half-past sis o'clock, to a front room, first floor, at No. 9, in the Almonry, Westminster—I knocked at the door—the prisoner got out of bed and opened it—he was undressed—I told him I came there for the purpose of taking him into custody on another</p>

               <p>charge, and told him to dress himself, and accompany me—while he was dressing I searched his clothes, and found in his waistcoat pocket this box of bronze medals, and in his trowsers pocket two duplicates, one for a hat, pawned at Mr. Roberts's, in York-street, Westminster—I found this pair of cloth boots by his bed-side—he said they were his—I looked into a drawer, and found several keys, and among them this, which I showed to Isbell—I examined the prosecutor's house on the Saturday morning, and found it had been entered by the staircase-window at the back—I have not the slightest doubt of that—some blunt instrument had been used to prize it up—it had broken the bolt—the back of the house looks into the New Road, Chelsea—there is a back wall, which can be got over—I received this pair of shoes, found in the house, from Isbell, and also a hat—I found some foot-marks in the garden at the back of the house, leading to the itaircase window—I compared the shoes Isbell gave me with those marks, and they exactly corresponded—I have not the slightest doubt those shoes made those marks—I afterwards showed these shoes to the prisoner, and he wore them from the station to the office, where he claimed them as hit own—he wanted the cloth boots to put on, which I would not permit, and he claimed these at the office—they appeared to fit him precisely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

He desired me to give him the shoes before the Magistrate—he said, "You have done with those things now, they are my own; give them to me."I said, "I have not done with them."</p>

When we came near Cannon-street, Ratcliff-highway, I saw three men, but I took no notice, having no thought. When we came to Nightingale-lane, which is a coach-standing, Mrs. Alexander's niece's husband was waiting for us; she asked me, if her husband should see me home? I declined it; he was on the opposite side, and then Mrs. Alexander and myself proceeded on towards Shadwell, where I live. I seeing the men behind me not very far, I said to Mrs. Alexander, in our language, I am certain they were bad men, because they had not left us from the time I first saw them, but had not seen their faces. I said to Mrs. Alexander, in Hebrew, I would wish to see these men walk before us; with that we made a stop; they walked on before till they came where there was some girls, and they stopped; and then we walked on again before them. We see a watchman a little way off with a lanthorn on the same side of the way before us; Mrs. Alexander said, you had better walk till we come to the watch, because I am rather afraid; I said, there is no call to be afraid, we are near now on our own spot. I was within forty or fifty yards of my own house. I then said to Mrs. Alexander, I see my own watchman, which I did not, but I thought that they might then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150004"></xptr>be frightened, and walk off. With that one of the men rushed through the middle betwixt Mrs. Alexander and me, and made a full stop, and faced me, that I had a proper observation of his person; it was under a lamp, and it was light; I could have seen to have picked up a farthing from the street; I saw his face perfectly well; it was the prisoner with his hair on his shoulders, (

I said, No, fellow, what do you want? They said, they were not thieves. With that he snatched my hat, and tete and cap from my head. I cried out, Stop thief! I am robbed! Mrs. Alexander cried out, Watchman! but never a one came to our assistance. Dowdell took my hat, and threw it the other two, the cap and tete fell in the mud, Mrs. Alexander picked them up. Nobody pursued the men. I saw Dowdell go down New Gravel-lane; my fright was so great, I did not go after them; the watchmen were close to them, but did not offer to pursue or take them. The prisoners were apprehended on Friday. I had money, but they did not ask me for any; they did not even ask for my hat.</p>

               <p>Q. What goods did you let her with the room?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. The things mentioned in the indictment, with others; she having been absent from the room for nine days, I began to inquire after her, and found her in Turnmill-street; she said, she would come in the afternoon; but she did not come; then I looked into the room, and found the things mentioned in the indictment were missing; I took her up and charged her with taking them away; she confessed she had taken them, and pawned some and sold others.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her business?</p>
               <p>Masters. She used to make pens for booksellers to rule their streight lines in their books: she pledged a sheet, a pottage pot, and a curtain, to me at three different times. Produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Masters. About the middle of February last.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What time did the prisoner lodge at your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. We know she had pledged them all before the 20th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was her lodging-room door locked when she was absent?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She had locked it, and had the key with her.</p>
               <p>Magdalen Lawrence. The prisoner came one morning to me, and asked me if I would buy some things out of pawn, her property, and seemed to cry. I asked her what they were, and what they would fetch; she said, they were worth about a crown. I went with her to the Pawnbroker's; she called for the things, which came to three shillings and eight pence; I paid the money, and brought them home; she agreed to take five shillings and two pence in the whole, so I gave her eighteen-pence, and had them about ten days before the officers came and took them away. I had made the check curtain into aprons. Producing them. A pottage pot produced by the Constable.</p>
               <p>Masters. The prisoner pledged such a pot as this to me; but it has been out of my hands some time, I cannot swear to it.</p>

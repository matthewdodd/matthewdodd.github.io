            . I missed the handkerchief in Nov. and the shirt the week after Christmas, I suspected the prisoner, because we found him out in taking some little pieces of copper which were my master's property, and so I charged him with these things, and he said he had pawned the handkerchief to one Badcock, in Golden Lane, for six-pence, when I went to Mrs. Badcock she said he brought a shirt to pawn, and she would not take it in, and he carried it to one Barnes, another pawnbroker, in Golden-Lane; and pawned it for 2 s. Barnes delivered the shirt to the constable - the prisoner was an errand-boy to my master - he is about 12 or 13 years of age, as he says. I do not know any otherwise.</p>

             . I had a search warrant brought by Mr. Crawley , another constable of the same mannour; says I, it is in a very good hand; he said it was out of his liberty; he said, could not you give it to one of your head-boroughs? I sent it to one of the head-boroughs and he desired me to serve it; and I did go, and as soon as I showed Mr. Barnes the warrant he fetched the shirt down himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Marylebone. In consequence of a communication from the prosecutor on the 12th of February, I stationed myself on the cellar stairs—I had seen two pounds in silver marked by the prosecutor the day before—about a quarter past seven o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing I went to the house—while there, I saw the prisoner go in and out of the bar several times—I saw Mrs. Long in the bar—I saw Mrs. Long leave the bar about eight o'clock, and go up stairs—I them saw the prisoner in the wash-house, go into the bar, put a pail down near to the till—she went down on her knees—I saw her fix her eyes up the stairs—then look down—then look towards the staircase again—then I heard something pushed in—she left the bar, went into the wash-house, and stood within a few yards of me—there was nobody in the bar—the prosecutor came to me soon after, and said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was gone—I said, "Yes, and she has got it in her bosom"—I followed her into the bar—she was charged with it, and denied it; but at last produced a bit of rag from her pocket, with two shillings and three sixpences marked.</p>

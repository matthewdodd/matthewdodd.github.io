            : On Tuesday afternoon, the 15th of April last, between the hours of four and five, I had occasion to go to Friday-street; when I came to the corner of St. Paul's church-yard, it rained very hard, then I ran as far as Messrs. Wood's in St. Paul's church-yard for shelter; when I came there, I saw no one but Norris, the porter, and the prisoner at the bar; I said to Norris, if you will give me leave, I will wait here till the shower is over, he was then tying up the parcel for this young man; the prisoner then came out of the warehouse with the parcel under his arm; Norris then asked me if he was one of my young men, I said he was not; I immediately went out of the warehouse and called him back; when he came back, Norris said, he has just taken up two pieces of pink Bengal in your name, the prisoner was present then; I then asked the prisoner by what authority he took up these prints in my name; he then said, Thomas and Trye's young man desired him to call for them, and leave them at my house to the best of my knowledge; Thomas and Trye was the name; he then burst into tears, and said, he hoped I would forgive him, and if I would go with him, his friends would pay the money; I asked him where his friends lived, he said, in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He said some other person desired him to call for them? - A. Yes, I think it was Thomas and Trye's young man, but I am not certain of the name.</p>

Early in March some goods bad been brought from a fire in Gutter-lane, to Mr. Toplis's warehouses in Water-lane—there were some woollen and cotton cloths, and some merino—I do not know Parisian lustre by the name—some of the cloths were wound on pieces of wood—on the 25th of March, between three and four o'clock, I was on my master's premises, and from what one of the servants told me I went into the loft where some of these goods were—I found the prisoner Matham there, putting them paper parcels into a sack—I asked him if he had come from Mr. Mots—he said, "Yes"—I saw him put ten parcels into the sack—after putting them in he took up some rug*—I asked him what he was going to do with them—he said he was going to take away three pieces of carpet—I told him they were dry, and were not to go—he said he would go and fetch an order for them, or something of the some sort—he then tied up the sack in which the ten parcels were—he then took six pieces of merino which were folded on boards—he put them by the side of the sack—he also took six pieces of check, which I put down as muslins—he threw the sack, the three rugs, and the other things, all down from the loft into the warehouse below—(he did not take the rugs away)—he went down; I followed, and saw him put the things into my master's truck—before he took them I desired to have a receipt—I wrote it, and be signed it—this is it: "Received, 10 brown paper parcel", 6 pieces of muslin, 6 pieces of black merino. 25th March, 1845. <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN WILLIAMS"</hi>—I saw him assume and sign this name.</p>

On the 27th of March, Matham was brought to the station in Black-horse-court, by Hunt, and I accompanied Hunt to No. 22, Old Bailey—I went up stairs into Dolan's room—Hunt asked if he knew a person named Matham—he said he did—Hunt asked if he could inform him where his wife lived—he told him, no—Hunt said, "You have no objection to my looking round the room"—he said, "Not the least"—Hunt said, "Is this the only room you occupy?"—he said, "It is;" and his wife also said that was the only room—I went with Hunt to Mr. Toplis, and then came back to No. 22, Old Bailey—I went in at the front door, leaving Hunt to go round—I entered the house, and saw Dolan come out of his room, and go down a flight of steps into the yard—he walked across the yard with this bundle of wood in his arms—he took it to the hole of the privy, and was about shooting it down—there is a door to the privy, and he was inside the door—I saw him throw something apparently black down the hole—it was not rolled up; it was compressed in the hand—when he was about to throw the bundle of wood down, I caught hold of him and said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "It is only some wood"—I said,</p>

               <p>"It is a queer place to throw wood"—Hunt came into the yard—I left Dolan with him, and I went up to the room which we had searched before—I found some remnants of black merino burning on the fire, I took a portion of it off, and took it down to Hunt in the yard—this is it—this is all I was able to save—the other was burnt too much for me to get it off the fire—there were some remnants of black merino on the board in the room—they had not been there when we searched the room previously—after we had taken Dolan to the station, we returned and searched the privy, and found four pieces of this cloth, and two pieces of black merino—I had seen Dolan throw something black down, and this black merino was lying on the top—there was a great quantity of other stuffs there, which we could not get up—I had noticed a broom in the yard, the yard, the han<lb></lb>dle of which was covered with soil better than half way up, and that it was which drew my attention to the privy—I went with Hunt and took Chappell into custody—when Hunt went in he said, "Here she is," and he said to her, "I want you; where is the bundle you brought in with you?"—she said, "I have not brought any"—Hunt requested me to look round, and I found the bundle close to Chappell, under the cloth which was hanging over the table—she said, "That is mine;" and her sister-in-law began to upbraid her for bringing such a thing into the place—on the way to the station, Chappell said Matham gave her the bundle—next day I was standing near the female prisoner's cell, at the police-court—the cells are divided by a partition, and Matham was in a cell oil the other side of the partition—he climbed up to the top of his partition, and called out, "Chappell"—he called some Christian name which I do not recollect—Chappell looked up and said, "Oh, who shall I say gave it me?"—he said, "Hold your tongue; say nothing"—there was a female prisoner in the cell where Chappell was—she saw me looking through the grating, and immediately spoke to Chappell, saying something abomt my watching, and there was nothing more said—the turnkey desired Matham to get down.</p>

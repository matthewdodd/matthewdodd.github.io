On the 2d of August the prisoner came with another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150016"></xptr>man, about one o'clock, and remained there till ve. While I was drawing beer, I saw the prisoner reaching his arm into the bar, towards the drawer where my plate was kept. When I came up he said,</p>
               <p>"Fill us a pot of beer" - I had to go into the cellar to draw it, and saw him at the bar again. My wife went to the drawer, and in consequence of what she said I looked in the drawer, and missed all the silver spoons - he was then standing by the bar, with his elbow on the half-door. I felt round his body, and found something hard under his waistcoat. I turned round, missed him, and followed him into the street, but could not see him. I went to the yard, and there saw him standing by the water-butt. As I approached him, I heard something fall, saw a table-spoon lying at his feet, and another table-spoon in a cloth on the ground. I collared and took him into the tap-room, sent for a constable, and said, if he would give me the rest of the property I would let him go. Some whispering took place between him and another man, who sat there. The prisoner then held up his head, and said,</p>
               <p>"No, d - n me, if I split." The man then went out, and the rest of the property was brought in in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You found nothing on him - A. I saw him drop it. They were all safe at nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

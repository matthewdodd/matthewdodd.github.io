                  </hi>. I am an Excise-officer. In consequence of information on the 9th of Feb., I obtained a warrant, and on the 10th I went with it, with William and Thomas Hughes, M'Kay, Shakesby, and Frith, to No. 61, Princes-street, Lambeth, about a quarter after eleven o'clock in the morning—we knocked at the side-door twice—there was about a quarter of a minute between the two knocks—there are two doors, one in the street, and a side-door down an arch—the prisoner Brown opened the door—I asked for Mr. Jones, or Brown, or some fictitious name—he opened the door a few inches, saw me, and went to shut it again—we forced our way in—he left the door, and made his way towards the stairs—we secured him about half way up the first flight of stairs—he was taken down into the front parlour by myself and Thomas Hughes, and given into custody of a policeman—I then proceeded up stairs to the back room, first floor, and there saw a chair standing opposite the fire-place, with a board lying across it, and a fire-shovel with one end resting on the board, and the other between the bars of the grate—I saw some moulds with coin in them, and a great quantity of coins lying about—I put my hand on the moulds, and they were quite hot—there were two shil<lb></lb>lings in one mould, and one shilling in another—there was a pipkin on the fire, with white metal boiling in it, in a fluid state—I took it, and threw it on the floor—there was nobody in the room then besides me—some files and a knife were lying on the board, and two new metal spoons—some coins laid on the mantel-shelf—I saw about forty coins in the room altogether—I called Mr. Hughes into the room, and he took possession of all the articles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to William Hughes, the supervisor of Excise. I accompanied the officers to this house on the day in question—I ob<lb></lb>served Brown open the door—I asked if Mr. Smith lived there—he attempted to shut the door, but I put my foot in, and it was forced in by Mr. Rice—when I got in, Brown made his escape towards the stairs—he got half-way up—I followed him, pulled him back, and, after a deal of difficulty, two or three of us got him into the front-parlour, and kept him in custody—he was in his shirt sleeves, which were tucked up—he asked for his coat, and said, "Do I know whether I came out of the still-room?" (meaning down stairs) "or from up stairs"—I told him, "From out of the still-room, (meaning down stairs)—he said he came down stairs, and not up stairs, I am sure of that—he was making his way up stairs when I went in—I went over the house after he was in charge of the police—I did not find anything—I did not observe any sign of paper-staining or paper-manufacturing—all the rooms were empty but the still-room, the coining-room, and the back kitchen—there were seven rooms-five were totally unfurnished—the still-room it on the ground floor, under the front parlour—that was one of the furnished rooms—the front par<lb></lb>lour was furnished—that would make three rooms furnished, the front parlour, another room, and the coining-room—there was a bed and bedstead, a box or two, and a chair, in the coining-room; also, a bed in the back parlour, and one in the front parlour—there were but two beds in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a supervisor in the Excise. On the 10th of Feb. I accompanied the other witnesses to No. 61, Prince's-street—I guarded the front door, to see that no one came out, while the other parties made their entrance—I went in after them, and found Martin in custody of Rice and my son—they took him to the front parlour—I left him in custody of my son and the police, and proceeded after Rice, up stairs to the room, where I found the implements of coining—these are the articles, which I produce—this silver watch was lying in the centre, with two heaps of base coin, on the mantel-piece—the moulds were quite hot—I could not hold them in my hand at first—there were two impressions in one mould, and one in another—I produce a file, a knife, and a pipkin—when I left the room up stairs, I proceeded down stairs the under-ground kitchen or cellar, where I found Tucker, and the private still going on—I there found a quantity of spirits—I examined some ashes that were lying in the still-room, and found one of the base shillings un<lb></lb>finished, which I produce—this shilling was not kept apart from the others—they were all put together—it was rough in the edges—I also found some pieces of cuttings, or parings of metal, lying in the ashes—I did not take any notice of them—I left them there—they had a bright appearance, as if not long cut off—they had been melted—they had been pared off the shillings, I have no doubt—I asked Tucker how long he had been in the house—he said between three and four months—I asked him if the man Martin had been there the same time he had—he said they both came together—I then asked if he knew any thing about the coining going on up stairs—he said no, the business was carried on up stairs by the other man, Martin, and he did not know what he was doing there—I said it was impossible for the business to be carried on</p>

               <p>up stairs without his knowledge—he said he did not know what he was doing—I then asked him if they were not partners—he replied, they were—I asked him about the shilling I found in the ashes—he seemed rather confused at the first moment, and stated after, they might be brought down in the ashes, a Martin used to bring his ashes down into that room—I do not believe he saw me rake it out—the front parlour had a few chairs in it, and a table—I found some papers in a cupboard, such as receipts for hats, which I did not remove—I also produce a receipt from the landlord, which I found in an ornament on the mantel-piece, in the front parlour—I went over the house—I did not see any thing of paper-staining or hanging going on—not the least—there was one bed in the coining-room, and there were two or three beds on one bedstead in the room below—the distance between the still-room and the coining-room is perhaps about ten yards.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 11th of Feb., about nine o'clock, I went to this house, and staid till nine at night—Ings relieved me—I went there again at six the following morning, Sun<lb></lb>day—I relieved Ings, and remained there till I was relieved by Ings again—I went there again on Monday morning—I then understood that coining had been going on—that induced me to search—I went into the back-kitchen, and searched the fire-place—I found a quantity of metal cuttings—Taberdin came in afterwards, while I was raking among the ashes—I took a little box off the mantel-piece, put the cuttings into it, and kept it in my possession till the following Wednesday, the 15th—I took it to the superintendent's office and gave it to Sergeant Brown.</p>

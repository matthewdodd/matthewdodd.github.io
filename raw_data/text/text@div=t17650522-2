            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Glass-house-street: the prisoner pledged this sword with me the 20th of April for 4 s. he said it was given him by a gentleman that he had lived with; he brought about a yard and a quarter of velvet the 31st of December, and had half a guinea upon it; he said he bought it to make a waistcoat of.

            . I am an old cloaths-man; I took this piece of velvet out of pawn. (producing another piece.) The prisoner took me there to take it out. Another time I took three shirts out of pawn for him. The first was about a month before Christmas: I knew him before; he said he bought the three shirts in France, and wanted a little money; so I took them out for him: they were in Shoreditch: the velvet was at a pawnbroker's, in Bow-street, Covent Garden. I paid a pound or guinea for the shirts, and four shillings for the velvet; he said he got the velvet also in France, when he was there with his master.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hawkins. I am a salesman in Monmouth-street: the other witness and prisoner brought this boat to me to sell. (Produced in Court.) I bought it of Denison for 12 s. Seeing a crest upon it, I bought it in order to find out the owner, suspecting it to have been stolen: after that I took up Denison; he found the prisoner; he was taken before Justice Fielding; there he confessed he had taken the things mentioned in the indictment. He said two shirts and the sword belong to the prosecutor.</p>

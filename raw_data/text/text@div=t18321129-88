On Saturday, the 27th of October, the prisoner Christian came, and said he wished some gloves to be sent to No. 60, Aldermanbury, for a gentleman to look at who had come from Hastings; he left an order and a card - they were not to be left for sale, but only to be looked at, and an order given on the Monday morning following; I had not known Christian or Tute before - on the Monday morning Tute brought a note, and said the gentleman was then waiting at the warehouse to look at them, and they must go immediately to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290042"></xptr>him - I said my son was going that way, and he should take them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember going into the Green Man, in Bucklersbury, after this? A. Yes, I went into the parlour with the officer; he told me to look round and see if I could see the person - I saw Christian there; I did not say I did not see him.</p>

               <p>Tute's Defence. I had been acquainted with the parties only three days before; I had no part or share in it - I received the property, but I handed it to Christian and Co., in the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Christain's Defence. I called with the order on the Saturday, and on the Monday my partner gave Tute the order to go and get the goods - there was not time to return the goods, as Tute was taken the same day; I was not at home that day.</p>
               <p>JURY to GEORGE ABEL. Q. What did you mean by saying the shop was shut? A. The door was shut, but the shutters were down; I waited about the greater part of the day, and no one came till the evening - none of the goods were ever offered to me back; I saw some horse-hair strewed about the warehouse, not more than would fill a hat, and some empty boxes: Tute seemed to be sorting the horse-hair; when I returned at eleven o'clock I made what noise I could, but could not get in.</p>

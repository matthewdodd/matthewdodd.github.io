                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Milton-place, Euston<lb></lb>square. The house is let in lodgings—I rent the two parlours—the landlord does pot live on the premises—between seven and nine o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing of the 11th of November I was down in the wash-house, and a lodger informed me that the street-door was open—I went up into my apartment—I had left my room-door shut at seven o'clock—I had fastened it myself, and the street-door was shut, and the property all safe in the parlour—my door would not open of itself—when I opened the door, and looked about my room, I missed all the articles charged in the indictment—the officers discovered them the same evening—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 38.) On Monday, the 11th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, I and Sergeant Pocock had been watching the prisoner's house in Cro<lb></lb>mer-street, from eight o'clock—(he had been a policeman)—his wife came and looked continually at the street-door, and a little after nine o'clock I saw a man, who I believe to be the prisoner, go into the house with a basket—his wife was at the door, and they went in together—in a minute or two he came out, and crossed over from his lodging to the place where I and my brother officer were—seeing him coming, we ran away, and got down into a court to conceal ourselves—while I was going my brother officer said, "George, come back, there is no thoroughfare"—we then watched the prisoner—he went to his own door, and was talking to another man—he said, "Pocock and Collier are watching me, for I heard Pocock say, 'George, come back, there is no thoroughfare'"—the prisoner said, "They think I have got a swag to-night, but they shan't have it"—(a <hi rend="italic">swag</hi> means a quantity of stolen property)—he turned round, and went up Cromer-street, away from his lodgings—I and my brother officer consulted together, and went from there to Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge, we concealed ourselves behind a gate, and in ten minutes the prisoner's wife, Jemima Dorsett, passed us with a large bundle, nearly as much as she could carry, under her cloak—we watched her go into No. 22, Ashby-street, Somers-town—after washing about ten minutes, she came out without the bundle—I then stopped her—I went and searched the room, and found the bundle, containing all the articles stated—after coming from No. 22 to the corner of the street, I saw the prisoner and another man, named Lewis, (who has been tried and convicted,) in a court that leads to No. 22—I took Lewis, and the prisoner turned and ran away—I have been looking after him ever since—I took him on the 24th of April at Speenham Land, about half a mile from Newbary, in Berk<lb></lb>shire—I found on Lewis eleven skeleton keys, and one of them undoes the prosecutrix's door, and at the prisoner's lodging I found some more drop<lb></lb>latch keys and other keys.</p>

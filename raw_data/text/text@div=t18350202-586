                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Notting Barns farm, at Kensington, about a mile from the gravel-pits. In January last I had a cosw large in calf, which I placed in a field with some heifers, near the Cemetery, near the Harrow road—she had been there about two months along with the same heifers—I saw her safe on the 15th of January—I went to the field on Monday, the 20th, and she was not there—in consequence of information I went, on the 25th, to Holt, who keeps the green-yard at Paddington, and found my cow there—he delivered it up to me on Tuesday, the 28th—it is worth about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was in calf, and had about three weeks to go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover, in the employ of Mr. Bartram. I was in Smithfield market on Monday, the 19th of January—the prisoners came together to me and brought a cow—Lake said, there was a cow to sell—I asked him whose it was—he said "Westbrook's"—I have had cows before to sell from Westbrook, which Lake brought—he said it was to be sold—I tied it up, and they went away—about two o'clock that afternoon, Davis came and asked if it was sold—I said it was not—then Lake came within five minutes, and asked me if we had been bid any money for the cow—I said yes, we had been bid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he asked, "Who bid it?"—I pointed to a gentleman who had bid for it—he said, "It must be sold at whatever price It might be"—they went away, and returned again about three o'clock, which is the time the market is over—it was clearing out time—as it was not sold, I delivered it up to Lake again, to take home—it was heavy in calf—I saw it at Mr. Holt's, at the green-yard at Pad<lb></lb>dington, on the Sunday following—I am positive it was the same cow—I asked Davis where he brought the cow from—he told me Lake had employed him to help him into the market with it, and he was to give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and he had come from Notting-hill with it—Lake was not present—I never had any thing to do with Davis before—I had sold two for Lake before, which he said came from Westbrook's—I never knew his own name—he went by the name of Westbrook, and he said the other cows were his brother's—I supposed him to be Westbrook.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the green-yard at Paddington. On the 19th of January, the prisoners came to me about four o'clock in the afternoon—I was about two hundred yards from the green-yard—Lake, who gave his name William Blake, told me they had brought a cow to the green-yard; and the woman (meaning my wife) had put it into the green-yard—I after<lb></lb>wards went to the green-yard with the prisoners, and found the cow there—I asked them where they had brought it from—Lake said, they</p>

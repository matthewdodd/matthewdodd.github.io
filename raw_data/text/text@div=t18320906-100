               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. You found the horse in the same state as he took it away? A. Yes; he saw it three times before he took it away.</p>

            . I keep the Black Boy, at Tottenham. On Saturday, the 4th of August, the prisoner came to my house, about two o'clock in the afternoon; he rode into the yard, and asked if I could give him accommodation for him and his horse; I said I could - he asked what I could keep the horse for; we agreed for 12s for six days- he asked what I thought of his horse; I said I did not know, for I had scarcely seen it; he said, "Well, what do you think it is worth, is it worth 20l.?" I said, "I dare say it is, from that to 25l." he said, "Well, will you buy it?" I said I was not in want of one then - he said he wanted to sell it - I said, "What is the lowest you will take, perhaps I may meet with somebody who will buy it?" he said the lowest would be under 14l.; Mr. Dawkins' son came into the yard while he was there - I had told the prisoner Mr. Dawkins, over the way, bought horses at times, but whether he offered it to Dawkins' son I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he at your premises? A. He came on Saturday, and left on the Thursday, in custody.</p>

            . I am a constable of Tottenham. In consequence of information, I went to the Black Boy, at Tottenham, with Fowler, about three o'clock - I found the horse, with the saddle and bridle; the prisoner came there about four o'clock in the afternoon - he did not know I was a constable; I passed as a dealer; he asked if I was in want of a horse - I said not particularly, but I was in the habit of buying horses sometimes; he said he had one in the stable, which he wished to part with, as it was rather too big for him, and he wanted a smaller one; he wished me to go to the stable to look at it; I did so, and asked him the price; he said 25l.; I said the horse might suit me, but the price would not - he asked what my price was- I said I thought about 14l. or 15l.; he asked if I could not give another pound or two - I said I would consider, and talk to him about it presently; it appeared about six years old - I asked if it would go in harness; he said Yes- I asked how long he had had him; he said, "Ever since it was two years old;" I left the man, giving directions to the landlord, and left Fowler to look after him - I returned about seven o'clock, and found John James with him - they were trying to deal for it; James said if I was about buying it, he would not interfere till I had done - I heard James offer him ten guineas for it, but that would not do; I told him I was a constable, and suspected it was stolen, and requested to know where he got it - I searched him, and he only had 1s. about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you think 25l. too much? A. I thought it worth about 20l., or more - it was about fifteen hands high.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you find any duplicates on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060053"></xptr>him? A. Several; also a padlock, several keys, and two purses - one duplicate is for a pledge of wearing-apparel, at Cotterel's, in Oxford-street, on the 2nd of August, for 20s., in the name of Wyatt, another for goods pawned on the 4th, in Bishopsgate-street, for 4s.</p>

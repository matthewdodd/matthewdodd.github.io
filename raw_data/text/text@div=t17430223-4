I had then in my Pocket, nine Guineas and an Half, a Three Pound Twelve, and some Silver; says I, it is too late to take this Money out with me to Night, and gave my Wife nine Guineas, and a Three Pound Twelve Piece, to take Care of; and she did not put it into the Drawer till the 27th: That Morning, between seven and eight o'Clock, the Child said he heard the Door unlock, which made a prodigious squeaking; and told my Wife, the Boy had been in the Room: I did not miss this Money till the Monday following, when I went up for some Money, and then I missed a Guinea; said I to my Wife, How is our Money converted? Here is but four Guineas out of nine; and I have made Use but of four, with one, I have taken out now. Monday in the Evening, I called the Prisoner within Doors, and said, you have robbed me of a Guinea; when I first taxed him with it, he denied it, but afterwards confessed that he took a Guinea out, and that he opened the Lock with this Key, on Thursday Jan.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230006"></xptr> and he owned it before Col.

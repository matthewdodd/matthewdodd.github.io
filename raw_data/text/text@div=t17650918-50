On the 22nd of July last, I found my shop robb'd of all the silver out of my till. I did not know who had taken it. This was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180034"></xptr> about half an hour after eight in the evening. Two or three days after, Mackrell was taken up for robbing another shop in Leather-lane; he came to let me know he was at the robbing of mine; Mr. Clay came with him: the boy said he saw two gentlemen backwards, writing; that he opened the door, and went round the counter to the till; that the till was not locked: he first took the money out, and the two prisoners received part of the money of him at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was taken out of the till?</p>
               <p>Kirkland. I am certain there was not less than half a guinea lost in silver; I believe there was more.</p>

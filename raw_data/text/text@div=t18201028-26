I stood a short time, and heard the tiles rattle; I put my light out, went under the ride, and heard the tiles rattle again. I kept my eye on the place, and saw a man's leg three times. I went to the public-house, and beckoned Corking out; he looked up, and saw a man's leg. The landlord came out; I lifted him upon the wall so that he could get on the ride. Morris also went up. In the mean time the prisoner came out of the stable-door; I said</p>

               <p>"Some person was on the top of the ride, I hope it was not you?" he said No, he had laid down in the stable, and went to sleep, and some noise awoke him.

               <p>"You are the man" - he said No. I am not. He gave me the candle in my hand. I then went to his apartment, and he was given in in charge.

            . The watchman called me; I went down the ride, and saw a man's leg on the top of the tiles. I got upon the wall, and saw a man close by a hole, which had been made by taking the tiles off; I saw him go down there into the loft. I called to the persons in the yard, that I believed it was William, but was not certain. He was hostler there formerly. He was quite out of my sight, I could not discern whether it was him or not. I went to the hole, and there found a cursingle on the tiles close by the gutter; I got down the hole, and put my feet upon the lead in the loft; I immediately saw somebody come out of the stable-door. Nobody else was in the loft.</p>

I admit I have been on the tiles cleaning the gutter, as the wet came in upon my bed, but was not on this night. On this evening I was rather tipsey, and quarrelled with my wife; I went to sleep in the stable, and was awoke by a noise, came out, and asked what it was about. Two or three men might have come out, while I went for the light.</p>

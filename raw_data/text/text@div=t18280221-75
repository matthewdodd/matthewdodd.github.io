            . I am a Bow-street patrol. Sinclair gave me information, and described the prisoners to me; I found Sullivan at his own house, in Little Queen-street, Westminster, on the Monday morning after the robbery, between seven and eight o'clock; he said he knew nothing of it; I asked where the clothes were which he wore on Friday, having seen him myself in the dress which Sinclair had described; he said, "What odds does that make; I have got the same jacket on now;" I said, "You have got on new trousers, waistcoat, and shoes;" Woodbury and I took Holyett.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 8th of February, the night before the robbery, I saw both the prisoners coming out of Duck-lane; I knew them before, and hearing Sullivan say to Holyett, "This way, come along." There was nobody by, and I took them to a public-house and searched them; but finding nothing on them, I let them go. Sullivan had on a cap without a lining, and blue trousers; I cannot say whether the cap he was apprehended in is the same.</p>

On Saturday, the 19th of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw Holyett standing outside Mr. Taylor's area in Great Queen-street; and saw some person hand something through the rails to him; the first thing he received, he put into his hat - he received several articles, and kept them in his hand - he ran away; I then saw Sullivan come over the rails - he ran off in the same direction; suspecting there had been a robbery, I knocked at Mr. Taylor's door; and told the servant to go to Queen-square, and send for the officers; the goods have not been found.</p>
               <p>HOLYETT's Defence. The baker swore to my clothes at the office, and said he could not swear to my features; he first swore I had blue trousers and then black; I was at work at the time, and had a fustian jacket and corduroy trousers.</p>

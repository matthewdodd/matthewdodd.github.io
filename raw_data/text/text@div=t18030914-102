             Sworn. - On the 8th of August, about half past eleven in the morning, I was standing talking with a young woman in Oxford-road; she told me to look about, and see a Jew picking the countryman's pocket; I turned round, and saw the prisoner attempting to pull the countryman's watch out, he tried three times; several people were standing round, there having been a fire over night; the prisoner drew back about a quarter of a yard, put his hand in his left pocket, and pulled out a small pair of scissars; he went up to the countryman again, and cut the string that held the seals; the gold seal dropped on the ground, and the prisoner picked it up, and went off; I crossed the road, and took him by the collar; he said, if he had got any thing of the gentleman's, he would give it him, but he had nothing; I saw the seal up his sleeve, but he held his hand down, and dropped it in the mud; he was then taken into custody.(

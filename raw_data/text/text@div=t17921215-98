I cries out, you villain, you scoundrel, you have robbed me, with that he rushed to the street door, a person saw the prisoner at the bar come out of the house, and drop the bundle; he went behind a water spout, against a stable; I saw him again in two minutes; I went out with the candle in my hand; I never lost sight of him from the first moment I saw him, till after he was taken to the watch-house; the young woman is in Court that picked up the bundle.</p>

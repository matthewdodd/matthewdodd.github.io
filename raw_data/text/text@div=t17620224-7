             came to me, and express'd her dissatisfaction, and desired that she might be discharg'd; which I complied with, and paid them their wages; upon my taking an inventory of the linen, it appeared extremely thin, and in very bad order.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean there was not found that quantity of linen you expected?</p>
               <p>Black. It was merely according to the inventory they gave me, saying, here is the inventory we had; but, seeing no date to it, I was in some doubt whether it might be right; however, they pretended it was the inventory given to them; but when, they could not tell; the linen which they then delivered was in great confusion, and hardly sorted.</p>
               <p>Q. When they delivered up the linen, did you check the inventory according to the several articles?</p>
               <p>Black. Yes, and found it nearly agreed, but not exactly; this was late at night, at least ten o'clock. The next day, as I began to examine this inventory, great doubts arose, how such a family could be so extremely destitute of linen. About two or three days after they went away, a very considerable bill was presented by the linen-draper, and I was surprised that all those goods should be charged to my Lord, and so few or scarcely any of them to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the amount of the bill be?</p>
               <p>Black. I believe, including a former bill, above a hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of this?</p>
               <p>Black. I inquired if any-body knew the hand of that inventory, but I could not get any satisfactory account; whereupon my suspicions increased, and accordingly, my lord, I determined to go to Sir

I told them I had a constable accompanied me, and they must submit to it. They opened several boxes, and I saw only a few things, viz. some sheets, which appeared too fine to have been their property: turning round I saw a box, and desired to know the contents of it. Upon opening it there were thirty or forty pounds weight of candles. This increased my suspicion, and

I desired to know whether that room belonged to them. They said it did not. I asked who it did belong to. They said to a carpenter, who would not be at home till seven o'clock. I said I could not wait so long, he must be sent for. Upon this one of the prisoners went down, and soon after came up again, and said he would be at home between one and two o'clock. However, my suspicion rather increased, and I went down and asked the landlord's daughter whose room it was. Sir, said she, the room belongs to them, and they pay rent for it.

               <p>Black. Yes, and found five keys that will open eleven locks; four locks to rooms, and seven other doors. One of them the linen press, a library table, and other places wherein things of value are deposited.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you examined the linen by the inventory, and they very nearly but not exactly agreed - Was either of the prisoners housekeeper at my lord's?</p>
               <p>Black. No; but they were severally intrusted with keys, and things of value.

Mr. Black soon discovered a box, which he desired to be opened, and it contained a quantity of candles, which Mr. Black supposed might belong to my Lord. Soon after Mr. Black asked who that belonged to, pointing to a door that was locked? One of them said it belonged to a carpenter. He desired to see it opened. She said they had no key that would open it. Upon Mr. Black's order I unscrewed the lock, and we went in, where there were several things, which Mr. Black said belonged to my Lord.</p>

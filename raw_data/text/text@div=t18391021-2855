                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 19th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was on duty in St. Giles's, and saw the two prisoners in Buck<lb></lb>bridge-street, walking together, as two persons who were well acquainted—on seeing me they went into the middle of the road, and walked twelve or fifteen paces—there was a constable on the left-hand side—they crossed to the right, and I took Mills—he had this lead pipe in a bag, and threw it down—the other officer took Taylor—Mills got from me—I took Taylor to the station-house—I found on him this knife covered with wet clay, and the lead, and his clothes were covered with clay—on the 3rd of October I took Mills—he said he had met Taylor in Portman-street, and they went to the corner of Orchard-street, where a man gave him the lead to carry, and he was to have 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it.</p>

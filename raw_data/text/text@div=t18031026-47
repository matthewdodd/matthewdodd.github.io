             sworn. - I am a constable belonging to the Public Office, Shadwell: On Saturday the 22d of this month, I was at the Crooked Billet, Ratcliff-highway, three doors from Mr. Wright's, when the two prisoners and another woman came in; I knew Tubby, and she knew me; I observed her change countenance, and suspected she had been shop-lifting; I took hold of her by her gown to turn her round, and Clavering immediately attempted to pick up this bundle (producing it); it was behind Tubby, close under her petticoats; I am sure it was not there when they came in; I secured them all three, and took care of the bundle; Clavering said, she believed Tubby got it a few doors off; I then went to Mr. Wright's, and he missed the property.</p>

               <p>Tubby's defence. I met with this woman and another near Wellclose-square; I went with them to the Crooked Billet to have a pint of beer; I could not pay for it without changing half a guinea; I missed the half guinea out of my-pocket; I stooped down to look for it; Mr. Brown came up, and took a bundle out of this other woman's hand; he asked me if I knew any thing about it; I told him I did not; he took the other girl up stairs, and made her intoxicated, and told her, if she did not say what he bid her, she would be hanged.</p>
               <p>Clavering's defence. I went with this young woman to have a pint of beer; she missed a half guinea; I saw this bundle on a porter's knot in the corner; I went to lay hold of it, and Brown took it from me; he took me up into a garret, and gave me beer and gin, and made me intoxicated; he said, if I did not speak the truth, I should be hanged; he bid me say this woman had it; she is as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Brown. There was a porter's knot in the window, but no bundle.</p>

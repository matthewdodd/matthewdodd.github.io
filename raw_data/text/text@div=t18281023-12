               <p>MR. BASIL FRANCIS. I am living with a friend, in Featherstone-buildings - I am not in business. On the 16th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going towards the City, and was stopped by Carlisle, at the bottom of Skinner-street; he asked me if I had lost a handkerchief - I felt and missed it - I am sure I had it safe when I left home: my wife and nephew were walking with me; Carlisle desired me to return with him, and he would recover my handkerchief - I went, and found the prisoners in custody, at Mr. Raven's, the grocer, at the bottom of Holborn-hill; my handkerchief was produced at the Compter, by the officer - it was the same I had had in my pocket before; I had perceived nobody near me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old. On the 2nd of Dec, about ten o'clock at night, I was in Broad-street, going to my aunt's—Paul Francis was with me—I saw the prisoners coming down Broad-street—Johnson took my cap, and put it under her shawl, and ran away without saying any thing—I followed her to get it—Smith was with her—I never saw them before—I followed them up George-street, to a house in Church-lane—they went in—I and Francis stopped at the door for a second or two, and then went in, through a passage through a yard, and then turned to the left into a front room on the ground floor, with a candle and a fire in it—I saw Johnson standing there with my cap, and Smith sitting in a chair—Johnson threw my cap down—Smith jumped up—Johnson ran to the door, and said she would murder me if I did not give her my money—Smith jumped up, and laid hold of my hand, and Johnson struck me by the side of my head—I said, "You had better leave me alone"—she asked if I had got much money—I said that was my business—she put her band into my pocket, and took out 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Smith holding her hand over my mouth—Smith then struck me, and said, "Have you got any more?"—I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184212120027"></xptr>
               <p>"No"—she then felt in my pockets, called me a b—, and said there was a shilling, and if I did not give it her she would kill me, and Johnson struck me—I was obliged to give her the shilling out of my pocket, because the made me—she then said I might go, and opened the door—we both went out—Francis was in the room with me all the time—they did not try to rob him—he had no money—we went out of the passage into the street—they followed us and bade us good night—I thought I would watch which way they went, but did not see a policeman that night—I afterwards gave a person in charge on sus<lb></lb>picion, who looked like Johnson, and when I was at the station, Smith brought a breakfast to that person, and I gave her in charge—I am sure of her—I next saw Johnson at the station at Bagnigge-wells—I am sure she is the person—I made the mistake, because the other person looked like her in the face, but I was not sure, because she did not have scratches on her face.</p>

I have compared this lead with what remains; it has been cut and hacked about, but I think it is the same; it is the same thickness - between nine and ten o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoners with each a basket on his back; I ran and took Berry with some of the lead in his basket - I then ran after White, he threw down his basket and ran away; I took it up - I had seen him before, and am quite sure of him.</p>

On Friday, the 4th of May, they had a dark brown cart-mare—I saw it safe at half-past eight o'clock at night, locked in the stable—I went again the next morning, at a quarter to five o'clock, and she was gone—the door was burst open—the lock was broken—I have since seen the mare in Murray's possession.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 5th of May, I was in my farm-yard, about half past six o'clock, and saw the prisoner leading this mare—the mare was cool, but she was very white indeed, as if she had been ridden hard during the night—I asked him where he was going with it—he said to Burfield—I asked him who to—he said some name, which I do not know—I said there was no such name there—he said he was not going there, but going by there, and through different places to Marlborough—I did not feel satisfied, and sent two of my men after him, on foot—I then saw him get up on the mare, and ride—I then got my nag out, and went after him, and he was brought back, with the mare—I had him locked up, and advertised the mare in the "Hue and Cry," and delivered it to Murray—I have seen it since—it is the same mare as the prisoner had.</p>

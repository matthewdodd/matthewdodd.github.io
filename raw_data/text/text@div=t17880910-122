               <p>Is not it a house of ill-fame? - I do not believe it is; I was in liquor, before I went there; I had two ten pound notes, and one of twenty; I changed one ten pound note, and had nine guineas and an half and sixpence in halfpence; and I went up stairs with that lady, the prisoner, and then I was robbed of nine guineas and some silver really did fall asleep for two minutes; I on a bed, but did not lay down; when I awoke, I found my money gone, and then I got as sober as ever I was in my life; the prisoner was there, and she offered me five guineas back again, and I would not take it; I told her she had robbed me, she said she had not, but would give me five guineas, which she took from between a card-table that was in the room; I am sure she is the person who robbed me, and I asked her; and I said, how long have you been in this low line of life? if you will promise to be a good girl, I will hire you for a servant to my wife, and you shall wait on my daughter.</p>
               <p>Was that before you fell asleep? - Yes; but after she offered me the five guineas, I called the watch.</p>
               <p>Where was your money? - In a black waistcoat; I had a 20 l. and a 10 l. pinned up, and nine guineas and an half in my breeches pocket; I felt the money after I went into this house; I called for a pint of wine, and changed half a guinea.</p>

               <p>I changed a 10 l. note for the gentleman, at my house.</p>
               <p>What is your house? - I keep a tavern, the Rodney, in Ratcliff-highway; he had two pints of wine between six and seven; I did not mind whether he was in liquor.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of July, the prosecutor was going by our door, No. 103; it is just such another house as the other lady's; a lodging-house, private or public, the Sunderland and Shields hotel; I was standing at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100125"></xptr>the door when the prisoner picked the gentleman up, and came in with him, and called for a pint of wine; there was another lady at the door, and he ordered her to call in that lady to have a glass of wine; she came in and drank a couple of glasses, and retired; she said, she thought one lady was sufficient for one gentleman; he called for another pint of wine, and he and the prisoner went up stairs, and staid till about ten, when she rang the bell for supper; they had pickled salmon, and bread, butter, cheese, and porter for supper; she sent down the money, and sent for me, to know if I would come up and eat a bit of supper; I had been long ill, and begged to be excused; then she sent for this lady, and I sent word she was engaged, and I did not chuse she should come up; she sent again, and I went up, and this gentleman was sitting on the bed-side, putting his shoes on, and in a very ill temper; I said, is there any thing the matter? he said, yes, my dear, here is plenty of matter, I am robbed; I said, who robbed you? he said, that woman, of nine guineas and an half; she denied it; I rummaged the bed; he had not missed his watch then; but after he put on his shoes, he swore he had lost his watch; she pretended to search his breeches, and she conveyed the watch into his breeches in such a manner, as I never saw a woman do with so much indecency; she tore his breeches down, and crammed her arm down as far as her elbow; (if I am to speak the truth, I must) the knees of the man's breeches were open; he had not the watch, but she produced the watch from somewhere, and put it into his breeches; I found five guineas between a card-table; I knew it was not hers, because I knew she had not the value of this hit of rue; she was searched in the course of the night; nothing more was found, but half a guinea and some halfpence; she said, if she was to go to the watch-house, she would be damned but she would take the money with her, to help to support her; he was rather in liquor when he came in, but he had been to bed and to sleep, which sobered him a little.</p>

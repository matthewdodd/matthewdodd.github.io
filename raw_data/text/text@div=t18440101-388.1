               <p>a bundle—he gave me a shilling, and went away with the bundle—I bit the shilling directly he was gone, and found it was bad—I put it into my pocket, in a bit of paper—I had no other money in that pocket—next morn<lb></lb>ing the prisoner came again and asked me the price of holly—I told him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bundle—he offered me a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I had it in my hand, and said, "Old man, you are not going to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> me the same as you <hi rend="italic">done</hi> me yesterday morning"—he said, "Did you see me yesterday morning?"—I said, "Yes, and I will swear to you; you gave me a bad shilling yesterday morning, and now this is a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece"—he said, "If you don't like my money give it me again; I will change it, and come and pay you for your holly"—he took the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece out of my hand, and went away—a person who stood by went and told the beadle, who directly went after him down to the lower part of the market, called me, and I went with him—I had lost sight of him, round the pillars, for a minute or two—it was not above five minutes before he was taken—I had marked the crown-piece with my teeth, before he had it back, enough to know it again—I gave the shilling to Richard Moore.</p>

It is very strange the crown should pass through the Magistrate's hands at Bow-street, and he not see the marks, and that he should ask the witness why he did not mark the piece before he gave me into custody, and that when I came up on the Wednesday following it should be cut, and marked as you now see it; he says I was not more than five minutes out of his sight; whereas he owns it was about half-past nine or ten o'clock that I tendered the crown to him; and he cannot say whether it was not as late as twelve when we got to the station. If any other person was standing at this bar, he would as soon swear to him as me.</p>

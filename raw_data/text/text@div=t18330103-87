I laid hold of the prisoner, who was with another lad and a prostitute, conversing together; I took his hat off, and found the gloves - I said, "Are they yours?" he said, "Yes, my cousin lent them to me;" the prosecutor described them exactly before he saw them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

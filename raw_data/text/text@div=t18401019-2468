                  </hi>. I keep the Crown public-house in Henry-street, Portland-town—the prisoner was my pot-man. On Friday morning, the 18th of September, I came down stairs a little before six o'clock—I placed two bags on the bar parlour table—one contained five or six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., another for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some gold; and the other contained silver—I then opened my house—I saw the prisoner about ten minutes after I had done so—he did not sleep in the house—he came and opened the tap-room door, then went and opened the back yard door—he then went into the kitchen, I believe, for the knives—there is an entrance out of the kitchen into the bar-parlour, the door of which was open, and he could see the bags from the position in which he was—he then came and ordered some gin for the men who were at work in the sewer—I put some gin into a bottle—he then ordered half a pint of rum—I washed a bottle to put the rum into, and while doing that, the prisoner went towards the kitchen again—he was gone about a minute—I could not see whether he went into the kitchen or not that time, I had seen him go in before, when he went for the knives—I saw him in the kitchen—I was in the bar-parlour at the time, and the bags were then on the bar-parlour table—he could see the bags from the kitchen—when he went towards the kitchen the second time, I had not sent him there—I was at the counter at that time, washing the bottles, and was not in a position to see whether he went into the kitchen—he had time between that and his return, to go into the bar-parlour—when he came back he told me to put another half-pint of rum into the bottle, and make it up to a pint—I did so, and placed the bottles on the counter at the bar—he then said, "I want half a quartern of brandy for myself, for I have been ill all night, and I am all of a shake now"—he appeared to be so, but when I saw him first in the morning, I did not perceive any thing the matter with him—he appeared to be as usual—while serving him with the brandy, I heard footsteps, and saw a man go out of the street door leading to the bar—the prisoner was at that time in front of the bar, drinking the brandy—I said, "Who is that man? I saw no one come in"—he said, "I don't know who it is, I saw nobody come in"—he then went out with the bottles</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190057"></xptr>
               <p>and liquor—I shortly afterwards returned into the bar-parlour, and found the bags and money gone—I informed some policemen—I did not make any charge against the prisoner that day—he came back in about half an hour, to the best of my belief—I said, the man who had gone out had robbed me of my money, and asked him if he knew any thing about it—he said "No"—I asked him nothing more about it till next day—he said he knew no<lb></lb>thing of it—I then gave him in charge, and said, "William, I give you in charge on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery"—he said very well, he was willing to go—the policeman was there at the time—on Tuesday evening, the 23rd of September, John Burnham came to me, in conse<lb></lb>quence of which, I sent for sergeant Taylor—Burnham then produced a bag containing 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns—the bag was dirty, and bad earth on it—it was not one in which my money had been—the money was counted over by Taylor, returned into the bag again, and given to Burnham—Taylor followed Burnham out, and in two or three minutes I also followed them to the parlour of the New Inn—I there saw the pri<lb></lb>soner, Burnham, Taylor, and Newton, the landlord, and the same bag of gold was on the table—when I went in, the prisoner made an attempt to escape out of the door—I stood at the door, and prevented him, and said, "Let us have none of your nonsense, or I will <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> you"—there was up<lb></lb>wards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns in one of the bags I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I have known the prisoner about twenty years. On the morning of the 22nd of September I saw him, about half-past eight o'clock, going up Henry-street, Portland-town—he was alone—I told him there was a man taken up on suspicion of Mr. Scotch<lb></lb>man's robbery, and I and my brother were going down to the office to see if we knew him—he said he would go with us—he went with us with his entire own will, and we looked at the man—he saw the man in custody, and he said that was not the man, he was not big enough—he went away immedi<lb></lb>ately—I and my brother stopped at the office, and heard the man's examina<lb></lb>tion, and then returned home—after dinner I was going up Henry-street to<lb></lb>wards Mr. Scotchman's again, and met a man—in consequence of what he said to me I went to the Swiss tavern, and saw Bates—I told him I had come there, as he had sent for me by that man—he asked me, what news—I told him, "Very bad"—I then asked him to come outside, and I said, <hi rend="italic">"Billy,</hi> what made you go away so soon from the office without telling us?"—he said, because he could not stop, for that young man that he had seen at the office was one out of the two—he said that young man was standing at the bar having a pint of beer, while there was another taking the bag with 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of silver in it—I asked him what had become of the other—he said, "That is my business"—I said, "Billy, this will all be found out, for you are con<lb></lb>cerned in it"—he said, "I know I am, but it can't be found out, for I had none of the silver, and nobody saw me take the other; there is nobody can <hi rend="italic">come</hi> it on me; and what I have got I have put away, so as I can get a little at a time, as I want it"—I asked him what had become of the notes and cheques—he said he had burnt them—we than went inside, and he gave me a sovereign to pay for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of brandy and a pot of half-and-half—it came to 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I returned him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we then went across the fields to Hampstead, and in coming home he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get some steak, and told me to get them cooked—I did so—there was a mistake made in the house, too, and he did not come to the house that I got them cooked at—I went outside, but could not see him—I saw his brother, and by his direction I went to another public-house, the New Inn, where he was sit<lb></lb>ting up in a room by himself—I told him I thought it was very foolish of him sitting there spending his money, and being in a house that he was not in the habit of using—his brother said he thought it was very foolish of him too—I and the prisoner then came away, and went into the fields—I asked him where he was going—he said he did not know where to go—we went across the fields to Chalk-farm, and there we had a small glass of brandy each, and he had a loaf or biscuit and cheese—we then came out again—I said, "Billy, this will all be found out, and you will get tran<lb></lb>sported"—I then asked him how much of the money he had got—he said he had got about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I thought the best thing would</p>

               <p>be to tell me where it was, or give it to me, that I might take it to Mr. Scotchman, for I thought he would rather have that than transport him—he burst into tears, and said, "Oh, my dear children!"—we then went across the fields home, and into his garden—he stooped down, and took a bag out of the earth with his hands—I could not see whether it was covered, at it was dark—we then went into the brick-field—I told him to count it to me, so that he might not say he gave me more than I gave Mr. Scotchman—he counted it over to me, to the amount of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns, end half-sovereigns—I told him if Mr. Scotchman would not consent to take it I would return back to him with it—he then proposed where we should meet after I had been to Mr. Scotchman—I said, "At the New Inn"—that was where I went to him when he was alone—I went to Mr. Scotchman with the money, and saw him—I told him something—he fetched Taylor, the policeman, and I produced the bag in their presence—Taylor counted it, and it was put into the bag again—I took possession of it by Taylor's in<lb></lb>struction, and went to Bates at the parlour of the New Inn—I went in alone—Taylor had followed me, and was standing just outside—when I went in I gave Bates the bag again, and told him Mr. Scotchman said he would not have any thing to do with it—I called for a pint of beer, and, in the meantime, in came Taylor—Bates dropped the bag on the floor—Taylor; picked it up, and took Bates into custody—I was examined next morning at Marylebone office, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

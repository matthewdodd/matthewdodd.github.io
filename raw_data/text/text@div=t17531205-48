On the 25th of October I was waiting on some company above stairs at dinner; after dinner I brought the things down, amongst which was this pint silver mug. Some time after the prisoner went out; and when she returned, she had all new cloaths on. I missed the mug, and she said it was above; after looking and not finding it, I took her up on suspicion, and asked her where she was that time she went out; she said at a place where she had lodged; I went there, and the people said she had not been there. We advertised the mug, and one Slayter, a pawnbroker, brought it to our house on the 30th of October. The mug produced in court and deposed to be the property of

               <p>What they have said is all false. I was cook in that house; the silver never came into the kitchen, except to be cleaned; it happened to be pawned in my name; the gentleman said the woman that pawned it had on a check gown, but I never had one in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. to Slayter. Are you certain as to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>T. Slayter. I am, my lord; I lent her a great price, upon condition that she gave me a bill of sale, to which she set her mark. I never knew her before, but described her to Mrs. Price before seeing her there.</p>

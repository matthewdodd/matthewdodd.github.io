                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live at 22, Wellington-place, Hackney-road. On the night of the 8th Nov., about twelve o'clock, I was in Blackman-street, coming from New-cross, and close to Union-street—there were about twelve or fifteen men on the pavement—I was walking at a pretty brisk pace, but eased my pace as I came close to them—they opened a pas<lb></lb>sage to let me through—I got a shove on my right side, and before I bad time to look round, my hands were pinioned behind me by four or lire peo<lb></lb>ple, and I was held by my shoulders—I was surrounded by the whole of them—I directly found myself fast and could not move, and felt the money going out of my pocket—I had a purse taken out of my left-hand breeches' pocket with twenty shillings in it, all in shillings, a white handkerchief, which was on top of the purse, was taken at the same time, and out of my right-hand pocket, from seventeen to nineteen shillings, in half-crowns, shillings, and I believe sixpences—I called out for the police as loudly as I could, and directly received a blow on my head from some hard instrument or other—it was not a fist; it cut me—I still called out—my hat was knocked off, and I got another cut over my lip from the same instrument—it was something harder than a man's fist—I was then let go, and saw a man picking up a hat—I do not know if it was my hat—I ran towards that man as far as Union-street—I felt blood running down my face—I lost sight of him there—running up Union-street I heard a rattle—I did not run further, but waited till the policeman came to me—I had a pocket-book in my coat-tail pocket—the coat tail was torn, but they did not get the book—my trowsers were torn below the pocket in getting the money out—the prisoner Smith is the man that was engaged at this side pocket or else holding me at the time, the other I believe to be the man who I got the two blows from—I am sure he was close to me—I am sure they were both of the party, and close about me—Smith was on my left side and Pearson on my right—Pearson gave me two blows—the prisoners were left and right of me at the time I was robbed—the blood ran down into my eye and blinded me—I could not distinguish anybody after that to speak to them—I was taken to St. Thomas's hospital-one of the prisoners was brought to me, but I could not recognize him at that time, as my head was so bad from the effect of the blows—the doctor thought my skull was fractured—when I saw Pearson at the Police-court I had no doubt he was the man who was on my right hand, and struck me—I remained in the hospital about half an hour—my lip was cut right open—it required being sewn up—I went about two days after to have the threads taken out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> Where was the first place you saw me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Police-court,</p>

               <p>after the act was committed—I do not know whether you had a hat or a cap on at the time of the offence, but I think a cap—some had hats and some caps—they all ran different ways—I was left standing—I ran after the man who had the hat, supposing it to be mine—I could not identify Pearson that night, as my head was dizzy after it was dressed—the policeman asked if I could recognize him—I said I could not swear at the time whether it was the man or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Pearson.</hi> He said he could not tell who it was, he was surrounded by so many. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not say that—the prisoners were so close to me, and I was held so steadily with my hands behind me, that I had a good opportunity of seeing them—I swear to you by your countenance—you had a blue jacket on, the same as you have now—I do not know whether you had a cap or a hat, I believe you had a hat, and I believe a jacket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Pearson.</hi> The clerk and the Magistrate put their heads together, and us prisoners were placed between twenty-four or twenty-five others, and before he pointed me out he was asked if the man with the bluejacket was one; why not place us among the people in the court, and let him recognize us? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I pointed him out among others, and said that is the man, in the blue jacket—I am perfectly clear he is the man—I am certain of him.</p>

On Sunday night, the 8th of Nov., I heard a rattle and cry of "Police!" in King-street—I went towards High-street, and saw Pearson running, in company with two others, one of them I believe to be Smith—I stopped Pearson—he slackened his pace when he saw me, and pointing to one not in custody, he said, "That is him, stop him"—I stopped Pearson and took him into custody—I took him back to the spot, and ascertained that somebody had been assaulted, and taken to the hospital—the prosecutor said he had seen him before, but could not make any charge against him—he appeared stupified from the effects of the blows, and was bleeding—he had a good deal of blood over his face—the surgeon had just finished dressing his lip, which was cut quite through—it was sewn up—the blow on his head had been dressed—when Pearson pointed out another man as the person I ought to take, I asked what he had done—he said there had been a row in the Borough, but he himself knew nothing about it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith's Defence.</hi> There were four or five drinking in the public-house; a young fellow I was apprenticed with came and asked me to have something to drink; I know no more about the hat than I do about what I am charged with; the policeman says he took me going towards Union-street, and where the person ran with the hat was on a different side of the way; the policeman says I ran down King-street; the prosecutor says the man with a hat ran down Union-street; they have made it all up between them—I was intoxi<lb></lb>cated when I was fetched out of the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lewisham, with my father, who is a carpet-manufacturer, of Watling-street—I am fifteen years old. On the evening of 15th Jan. I was at the house of Mr. Wire, at Lewisham, and left there about ten minutes before seven o'clock—I had to pass the Hope public-house to go home; I was going to the Congregational School—I had to turn back to go there, and as I turned I saw the prisoner come out of the Hope—I am quite sure he is the person; I knew him before—I turned up Silver-street, which is at the side of the Hope, and the prisoner followed me—I turned, and asked him the way to the Congregational School, as I did not know it—he made an indistinct answer—I was then within a few yards of him—I walked</p>

               <p>on, and he walked after me, rather closer than before—when we got to the end of the houses, I asked him why he was following me—he gave me an indistinct answer—we had then passed the houses, and he put his arm round my neck, and one of his legs between mine, and tripped me up—I fell on my back—he tore open my coat, which was buttoned, and took some shillings from my right-hand trowsers pocket—he took my watch, and the guard-chain attached to it, from my waistcoat pocket, and then ran away, leaving me only 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I ran after him, and followed him to the top of Vicker's Hill—he there jumped through the hedge—I followed, and then lost sight of him—I then went back to the Hope, and told the landlady—I went to the station next morning, and there saw the prisoner, with others—I recognized him at once—I have no doubt about him—I had often seen him before—he was always about the village of Lewisham—my watch was worth about nine guineas, and the chain 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

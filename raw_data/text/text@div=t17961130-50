No, I did not; at that moment a boy told me he saw the man that took the watch, the boy kept his eye upon the man while I called a constable, and he was taken in about five minutes after I missed my watch; when the prisoner was in custody, I saw my watch in the hand of a man of the name of Arnold.</p>

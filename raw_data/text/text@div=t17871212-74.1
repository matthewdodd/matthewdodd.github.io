               <p>Did they say they were their own property, because they were brought in by another person? - I apprehend I am not at liberty to give my opinion on that subject; but they asked me three guineas for those things which Brown had brought in; that was more than I could afford to give; I gave two pounds seven shillings and sixpence for them; while I paid for them, Brown came into the shop; then they went away.</p>
               <p>Who took the money? - I think it was Todd; but I will not venture to swear that; there was a division of the money in my shop; they all went away at one time; I have sold the gowns, and I think all the other things; but I am sure of some to one Saunders, a Jew; and I believe one of the gowns he has to produce; he had one of them by him, and I sold these seven yards of cotton to Mrs. Barlow.</p>
               <p>Was that piece of cotton a part of the property you bought of the prisoner? - It is impossible for me to swear to this; it is a common pattern, but I sold Mrs. Barlow seven yards of the same pattern and sort of cotton.</p>

               <p>Fleming. I sold him a gown of this pattern, and I think it had the stain in the back, which is in it now.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mason. I swear this to be my gown, I described the mark in it at Sir Sampson's, before it was open, which is a mark of blood in the body of it, and there it is.</p>

That woman that you mention might be a principal, and we might be accessaries after the fact: Did I ever sell you any thing particularly, or ever call at your shop, any otherwise than to pledge my things? - Todd and Watson came into the shop, and Higgins and Brown went into the parlour; then they came into the shop, and after the money was paid, they all went away together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watson. Did I ever sell you any thing? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Brown. You heard the next morning that this house was robbed; your house was searched for it; was it not? - It was searched in the presence of Saunders, and the property was not found there on the Monday morning.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of it; I was drinking at the house with a young fellow till about half after ten, and the young fellow went home with me, which is one hundred and fifty yards below there; I went there every day; I was there from six o'clock; I always went there whenever I had seven farthings to spend; and if not, Mr. Mason would always trust me with a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner Watson, I was in company with him that night; he and me and another young lad and a man's wife were at supper together at the prosecutor's house; we staid there till; tea; we both went home to bed directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120087"></xptr>Do you live together? - No; I parted with him just at his own door in Duck-lane; I live opposite this public house; it is not far off.</p>
               <p>Then you was present when the Watchman came in and broke open the door? - Yes, I was eating my supper at the same time, and he was with me.</p>
               <p>Did you go up stairs with them, or did you see any thing that was going forward there? - No Sir, I eat my supper quietly; I did not interfere at all in it; I left him at his own door.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Mason. This boy, John Jones, who was last examined, says, he, together with Watson, and a woman and man, was at supper at the time the watchman came in, and went up stairs? - Not to my knowledge; it is common for people to bring their victuals and sit in the tap room to supper; when I called in the watchman at ten o'clock, I instantly ordered every body to be turned out; I do not remember this boy Jones to be there the whole evening.</p>
               <p>Do you know that boy? - Very well; he lives just opposite; I will not swear he was not there, but I do not remember him.</p>
               <p>Jury to Fleming. Was the woman Sophy Brown ever in custody? - Yes; she was taken; she denied bringing the property to my house, and then Sir Sampson discharged her; I do not know for what reason she denied it, but she did deny it.</p>
               <p>Jury to Fleming. Was there no body in your shop but yourself? - No Sir, Mr. Vanderberg was in the parlour; I do not think he heard any thing that was said.</p>
               <p>Court. This depends almost entirely on the testimony of Fleming.</p>

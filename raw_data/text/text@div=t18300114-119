               <p>THOMAS BROWN. I am a carman. I stood at the corner of College-hill, between six and seven o'clock that evening: I did not see the waggon, but heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned round out of our stable-door, and saw two men running - I stopped one of them, which was the prisoner; he had nothing then - Passey came up with the box in a minute or two, and charged him with stealing it; the prisoner wished to be let go, saying he had flogged him enough for it with the whip.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I was not the man at the Mansion-house. Witness. I said no such thing: I said I thought he had a different dress on then, but was certain he was the man; I was not certain he was the man I stopped.</p>

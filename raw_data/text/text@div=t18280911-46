            . I am in the service of the Honourable East India Company. On the 22d of July the prisoner was also in their employ, on the second floor of the warehouse in <placeName id="t18280911-46-crimeloc231">Jewry-street, Aldgate</placeName>

            , I am an assistant elder. I received information from Phipps, and took the prisoner into the counting-house; I said if he had anything he had better acknowledge it - he said he had tea about him, and began taking it out of his left-hand pocket - he took out about 10 1/2 ozs; it was in a breeches pocket, about eighteen inches long - we took him to the Compter, and he cut the pocket off while he was there; I have no doubt of the tea being the same as that in the chest - there was a small quantity of green first, and then black; a chest of green on the floor he worked, on seemed as if a hand had been dipped into it - he has been fourteen months in the service, and had 21s. 6d. a week, working from seven till three o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Peckham. On Saturday, the 27th of August, I was going along High-street, Whitechapel, Henessey; <hi rend="italic">bounced</hi> out of a court, and snatched a white paper parcel from my hand—it was a roll containing the articles stated in the indictment—I am sure he is the man—I ran up the court after him—then I felt a great rush at my back—I was knocked down—a little boy'came and assisted me, and told me something—I afterwards missed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my pocket I did not see more than one man, who took my parcel—a man, who I be<lb></lb>lieve to be Howard, came and told me I had better come to his house, and he would tell me best what to do about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Lewis Samuel, in Church-lane, Whitechapel. I was in Wentworth-street on this day, and saw Henessey running with a white paper parcel rolled up—the prosecutrix was follow<lb></lb>ing him, hallooing "Stop thief"—I saw Howard put down his foot, and knock her down—she got up—I gave information, and went and fetched the street-keeper—Howard said she had better go to his house, he would tell her what to do about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw Henessey running towards you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. Angel-alley is narrow, it is not dark—the houses are pretty high—as he passed me he brushed by me—the prosecutrix was about six yards from Henessey at the time he was running—she and Howard were half<lb></lb>way up Angel-alley, which runs into Wentworth-street—I saw Henessey just as I got into the alley—he went out into Weatworth-street—I did</p>

               <p>not stop to call "Stop thief"—there were a dozen people round the pro<lb></lb>secutrix—Howard did not lift her up—I will swear that—she got up her<lb></lb>self, quite without assistance—I have never told anybody that a young man picked her up—she caught hold of some persons—this is my hand-writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—I met Taylor coming up Brick-lane just as you turn round out of Went worth-street—I told Taylor where I saw the man running with the parcel—I first came up to the prosecntrix before I went for Taylor—the prosecutrix had several other parcels under her arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am street-keeper of Whitechapel High-street. I know both the prisoners—I have frequently seen them together for the last five or six weeks—they both use one public-house in Whitechapel, about thirty yards from Angel-alley—neither of them live in the alley—I had seen them together that morning, five minutes before I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I went up the court and saw the prosecutrix in the middle of a crowd of persons, and Howard had hold of her left arm—just as I came up I heard him say, "Come along with me, and I will try what I can do towards getting the parcel back"—I put him on one side to ask her what was the matter—she seemed almost fainting, and when I tamed round Howard was gone.</p>

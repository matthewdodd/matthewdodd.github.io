                  </hi>. In the summer of last year I lived as cook with Mr. Pickersgill, in Soho-square. One morning when I came down at half-past five o'clock, I found the house had been entered in the night—I was the first who came down in the morning, and found the street-door unlocked, un<lb></lb>chained, and unbolted—there was an appearance in the kitchen of somebody having been into the house—I communicated this to the man-servant, and Mr. Pickersgill was called down—I had not fastened the door the night be<lb></lb>fore myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. Pickersgill, in July last, as footman—I am not so now. On Tuesday morning, the 19th of July, I was alarmed by the cook, who told me what had happened—I had fastened the street-door the night before, at eleven—we all went up stairs nearly together—I bolted both bolts, locked it, and put the chain up—I fastened the dining-room shutters, and locked the study—when the cook called me in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I found the dining-room door open, the study, and all the doors open which I had locked the night before—they were opened by turning the keys—the street-door key was found in the area—I had left it in the door the night before—Mr. Pickersgill was called—I afterwards looked over the kitchen door, and found two rails taken down and laid inside the kitchen, by the dresser—the kitchen door opens on to the stairs which lead to the dining-room—by removing those rails, a person could put a hand through to undo the bolt inside, and so get into the house.</p>

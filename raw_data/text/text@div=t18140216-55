I took it about nine o'clock on Sunday morning, or five minutes earlier. I took it out of the safe, and took it to the coach. It is called the Union coach, or Buckingham coach; it inns at the King's Arms, Snow-hill. I took it myself to the coach; I delivered it personally to the coachman. I saw the coachman deposit it in the locker of the seat, and lock it. The coachman's name is Parker.</p>

It was the same parcel; it was placed in the safe for the purpose of being taken out in the morning. Parker was the coachman I delivered it to. There is a small locker underneath where the coachman sits; I saw the coachman put the parcel in, and lock it, and then he strapped the cushion on the lid.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you come to London safe with all the property - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As you supposed - A. I did. I did not unlock the box until I returned to London. I came to the Green Man and Still. I had occasion to take out a parcel there. I unlocked the locker there, and took out a parcel for Ransom and Morley; the parcel was safe then; I had it in my hand; the Aylesbury parcel was safe then; I only pushed it on one side to take Ransom and Morley's. I locked the locker, and left it safe in. Then I came to the King's Arms inn.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the King's Arms inn, did you find any thing had been done to your locker - A. Not immediately I did not. About ten minutes after I went to the locker to get the parcel; the staple of the locker was wrenched off, and the parcel was gone.</p>

There were only two or three persons in the shop. I asked the prisoner whether he had given value for it; he said he had, to a person in Smithfield, to either a salesman or a grazier. I took the prisoner into the inner accompting-house, and related the circumstance to Mr. Scott, a partner in the house. The note had been stopped in the morning at nine o'clock.

I left the house to go there. The prisoner said he would go to the person from whom he had received the note, and take the person with him to Mr. Praed's. I went with him towards Smithfield. He first stepped into two public-houses in Long-lane; he went in, but did not make any stay. He turned round into Smithfield, and went into a public-house in Smithfield, the sign of the Lock and Key, or the Key. It is the second public-house on the left hand in Smithfield from Long-lane. He sat down there, and called for a glass of rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he name any person that he was in search of - A. Yes; that was before. I asked him if he knew of whom he received the note; he said he did, his name was Jenkins, a salesman. I asked him if he knew what bankers he used, that he might readily find him. He said he did not. After we went into the public-house he called for a glass of rum and water; he told them to make it good. He pulled out a shilling before the rum and water came. He laid this umbrella on the table. When the rum and water came he paid for it; he drank, and handed it to me; he pulled off his hat, and wiped his face. The next thing, he said I will just step over to Sharp's, the banker, and see if he is there; he is not here; he will be here before the market is over, if he is not there. When he had spoken these words he left his umbrella on the table, and went out. He had not been gone long before I suspected all was not right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again that day - A. No. I waited till between five and six, then I went over to Sharp's with the umbrella in my hand. I did not see him there. I went back to see, that I might not miss him if he did come back. He never did come back that day. This was on the 10th I was sent on the 13th with the officers to a small street in the City-road, to his house I believe. I knew him directly I saw him. I went to apprehend him. The officer was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say anything to you when you came to his house - A. I told him what had past at Smithfield; he said he knew nothing of it. I told him that he had left the umbrella and the rum and water, and had not come back. He denied ever being with me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Fell. Have you got the note - A. Yes. This is the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, to Steers. Had you the note - A. Yes. I had it of Mr. Esdaile or of Mr. Scott. I delivered the note at Praed's. I was directed by Mr. Scott not to deliver it up. I took it to Praed's, and brought it back to Esdaile's. At Praed's they sent me for the prisoner's writing. Mr. Nelson was the gentleman in Mr. Praed's office. I put my initials on the note before I parted with it to Mr. Nelson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, to Mr. Scott. Did you deliver the note which you stopped from the prisoner, to the porter - A. I am not confident whether I did or not; either I or Mr. Esdaile did. It was delivered in my presence.</p>

            , he is a stable-keeper in the City-road. On Sunday the 9th of January, the prisoner, Leroyd, came to our house about one o'clock, in the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from his - A. About three quarters of a mile. He came about one o'clock, we were just going to dinner. We had a goose that was sent me from Birmingham. I asked him if he would dine off that goose; he said, no, he was going home to dinner; he was very poorly. I asked him how his wife did; he said she was very poorly; she was just put to bed, would I come and see her. I said I would. He went home by himself, and between three and four I went to his house. The nurse let me into his house; she asked me to walk up stairs. He was up stairs with his wife; she on one side of the fire and he on the other. I stopped to tea; as they asked me. We had tea about five o'clock. I stopped there until he went to bed; he went to bed between seven and eight o'clock; he said he could sit up no longer. He appeared to have a cold, and was very hoarse. I am sure from four o'clock until eight he was in the house.</p>

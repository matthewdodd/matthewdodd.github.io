                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Richard Conningham, carman, of Church-lane, Limehouse. On the 4th of November I went to Ennis and Co., in Moorgate-street, from the West India Docks, with the horse and cart—I went up stairs with a jar, came down in two minutes, and the horse and cart were gone—I ran down Prince's-street, and saw the prisoner standing up in the cart, with the reins in his hand—he jumped out of the cart, caught his legs in the rails, and fell down—I laid hold of him, but had a jar in my hand—he twisted my hand, and got away—I went after him, leaving a witness to mind the cart—I caught him up King's Arms-yard, without losing sight of him—there was a box and jar in the cart.</p>

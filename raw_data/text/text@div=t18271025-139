On the 26th of September, about six o'clock, five handkerchiefs were on a stool, outside my wash-house, in the garden, which is inclosed- I had washed them, and put them there, and in about an hour, I was hanging some things up at the first floor, and saw some boys in the field, at the bottom of the garden wall - it is an inclosed field - they had no business there - I missed them, and thought they had gone out another way - I went to the field again, and saw one boy on the wall - he jumped down into the garden - I opened the window, and asked what he wanted; he said his hat - I said there was no hat there; he said there was- he came up to the wash-house, caught at the handkerchiefs, and took four of them - he threw them over the wall - I believe Stephens is that boy - it was not dark - I ran down, and gave an alarm.</p>

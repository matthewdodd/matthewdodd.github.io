                  </hi>. My husband is a labouring man—on the 23rd of November, I lived at the priosner's house, in Mill-lane, Deptford—he is a dealer in marine stores and lets out carts and horses—four weeks ago last Monday night, at about eleven o'clock, I saw a cart stop at his door—I was up stairs looking out of my bed-room window—It was a clear night—my window is on the first floor—they had a lighted candle out of doors—I went to the window—looked out and saw a cart stop at the door—I saw a man named Parish go in, and bring out Mr. Jackson—there was a young man with the cart besides Parish—Mr. Jackson came out and held the candle in his hand—Parish went to the cart and said to the boy in it, "Come out of the cart David"—parish went and stripped down some hay for the images—Jackson was present—the images were covered with hay—he turned to Jackson, and said, "Jackson how long is it since you saw your grandfather?"—I thought it was a joke about the images—they laughed about it down stairs, and I laughed up stairs at the window, and they said to me "Take in your head from that window, and don't be grinning there"—I said, "I think you will grin somewhere by-and-by"—I stopped at the window till they brought both the images in—they first brought in the male figure, and then the female figure—the first was what they called the grandfather—I could not see what it represented—the man had a curled head, and the other was a woman with her head leaning on her shoulder—they left the horse and cart, and took the images in, and closed the gate—there is a pair of</p>

I have a mind to turn round upon him"—I said nothing to Jackson then—On Friday night Mrs. Parish came down to me, and wanted to borrow 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I had not one, but I would borrow one of Jackson, and I met Jackson against the <hi rend="italic">cage</hi>, with two men he used to sell his metal, to—he said, "Well, there is <hi rend="italic">no down</hi> on Parish yet"—I said, "No, there</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was in the room when your wife called you to come to the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A man and his wife, and a skin-man—I do not know the name of the man and his wife—they were in the next bed to us—Mrs. Gollocker was one of the lodgers in the house—I do not know the name of the man and his wife—they names—I am sure there was a man and woman in the next bed to us—the bed was quite close to the window; as close as you could put it—you could not put any thing between it—out bed was close to the other—there were four beds in to he room—It is a small room—the four beds were quite done together, and there was only room for them—I did not notice whether there was a child in bed—a child usually slept in the room—Mrs. Pollock had one, but I cannot say whether it was in bed—It was very near ten o'clock at night—the child could not run alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who were you working for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Any body I could get it from—I do not think I owe the prisoner any thing of any account—my wife always paid the rent—I never paid him any money—I cannot tell how much rent I owe for I never paid the rent—my wife paid it—she knows what was owing—I did not owe him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my wife knows better than me—I have not talked over with my wife what I had to say—I went with her to Mrs. Oakley, on the Saturday after this happened—I cannot read—I do not know where I went on the Monday—I did not go before the Justice, because I was not wanted; if I was, I should be sent for—I did not go with her—I was at home—I was first asked about what I knew, when I came here last week, by the constable and Mr. Oakley—I did not see Mr. Oakley, when I went with my wife—I did not go in—my wife did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in bed on this Monday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To be sure I was, and heard the cart come to the door—my wife said it was Parish coming, and she did not think he had a great load for the cart ran so light—she got up</p>

               <p>first and raised the window—the man and his wife in the next bed did not talk to us about it—nobody spoke to me at all, not to my wife—I cannot say whether they were asleep—there was no laughing—I have never re<lb></lb>ceived any thing for giving evidence—my wife has not given me any money, nor ever told me a word about it—she has not given me a farthing during the last week—I saw Mrs. Sims before to-day—we were standing at the gate—I have not seen her since I left Jackson's house—I saw her standing at his gate to-day—It was when we were coming out at the door—my wife was inside, coming out—I cannot tell when I last saw Mrs. Gollocker—I did not see her to-day, not can I tell when I saw her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You went to bed again, did you shut the window before you went to bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I let down the window—my wife went to bed with me at the same time; and Mrs. Jackson came up on the stairs, and called Mrs. O'Neil to come down, and see the <hi rend="italic">dolls</hi> that the <hi rend="italic">dolls</hi> were come at last; and at the same time I made answer that she had seen enough of them, and she should not go down—my wife got up and said she should go down and see them—It was no Friday that Jackson said he had a mind to turn round on pa<lb></lb>rish—I left the house on Thursday, but I was at Jackson's cart—my wife words about any bed—I always slept on the same bedstead—I heard no words about any bedstead—Mrs. Jackson called out so loud that every one in the place could hear her—I cannot tell whether it awoke the man and his wife who were in bed—I had no talk at all about it—I never saw either of them stir—my wife came to bed again in ten or twenty minutes—I was awake—she went down about five or ten minutes after the things came into the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say your wife used to settle the rent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she know what was due for rent when we went away, whether it was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I cannot tell—the prisoner and I had no dealings at all to<lb></lb>gether—I used to sell him rags, but owed him no money for rent, unless my wife owed him—I never told him that debt must be forgiven, or I would come here as a witness—I do not know that anything was owing to him—I saw the images in the cart, and saw them taken in—I did not notice what they looked like—I saw nothing of them afterwards—Mrs. Sims stop<lb></lb>ped at Jackson's—I now live a few doors off—I never took any particular notice of her—I saw her this morning at Jackson's gate—my wife went be<lb></lb>fore the Justice, on the Saturday—she went to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. In November last I was a constable of Deptford. Mrs. O'Neal made a communication to me—there was a bill in Mrs. Hosre's window, which I gave her—I do not recollect whether I explained it to her—she asked me to get the bill out of the window—I got it and gave it to her—this was about three week ago—I thing it was on a Friday</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">MASLIN</hi>. I live in Mill-lane. I had a bill in my window like this—It was put there on the 25th of November—I saw nothing of Mrs. O'Neil till a day or two after it was taken out of the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier. In November I lived in the prisoner's house, and live there still—I remember Monday night, the 23rd of No<lb></lb>vember, perfectly well—there were four beds in the room, I slept in that night—O'Neil and his wife occupied one bed—I went to bed at nine o'clock of a few minutes before—there was a girl asleep in bed with Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil—to the best of my remembrance she was between fourteen and fifteen years old—I slept in the first bed, on the left hand side, at the entrance from the stair-case—Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil in the first bed on the right hand side—two strangers in another, and Gollocker and his wife in the bed along side Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil—I was not well that night, and was awake in great pain till midnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now could any one have got out of Mr. O'Neil's bed, thrown up the window, and locked at people out of the window at eleven o'clock, or about the time, without your seeing or hearing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am confident they could not—no one did so—Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil were both very much in<lb></lb>toxicated that night—the man more so than the woman—I got up in the morning at half-past seven o'clock—my illness obliged me to go down stairs twice that night—I consider the first time was about half-past nine o'clock, and second about a quarter past ten o'clock—the prisoner was very ill indeed that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella maker. On the 23rd of No<lb></lb>vember I lodged at Mr. Jackson's, and have lodged there about six weeks—I have a wife and child—I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock, on Monday, the 23rd of November—my room was on the first floor—there were four beds in the room—Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil slept in the same room, and Jones and two strangers slept in the same room that night—my child was very bad, cutting her teeth—that kept me awake a good deal—I went to sleep about twelve o'clock—I am certain I heard twelve strike before I went to sleep—Mrs. O'Neil did not leave her bed between my going to bad and twelve o'clock—she went to bed at half-past eight—If she had got out of bed, opened the window, and talked to anybody, I must have heard</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183512140142"></xptr>
               <p>it—she must have come past the foot of my bed, which is close to the window—I could put my hand on the window-still when I am in bed—I must have heard or seen her if she had gone down stairs—I got up next morning at half-past seven—I was down stairs, I think, before Jones—I did not hear her say anything that night, or see any cart, or hear her laugh with anybody, after I got to bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Jones lodged there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came there that Monday night, I cannot say at what time he came—he is in the habit of bringing hare-skins—he came in the afternoon—It was late—not at mid-day—I never saw him there before—he lodges there still, backwards and forwards—I was not in Court when Jones was examined—he has lodged there, off and on, to my knowledge—the first re<lb></lb>mark I made of my child's catting its teeth was on that Monday night—Jones was very bad on Monday—he said he had a kind of a belly-ache, and some sort of a tooth-ache—he asked me for a piece of tobacco—I cannot say at what time he went to bed—he went down stairs twice—he was up stairs before me—I was in bed when he began to complain—I went to bed at half-past nine, and I think, in about an hour he began to com<lb></lb>plain, and went down, and came up in about a quarter of an hour—and went down again in about half an hour—that was nearly eleven o'clock—I saw the O'Neils come up, I saw the old woman stagger against the drawers—she was intoxicated—I did not see the prisoner next morning—he kept a servant, I cannot tell his name—he is in the prisoner's service now—he is not here.</p>

I found the timber there cut into planks; two pieces had been cut into planks; they were adjoining the saw-pit; some of them had the marks, and some were cut off. I found the prisoner Newton there; I asked him who the timber belonged to; Evans was with me; he asked him for the master of the premises; he said it was him he supposed we wanted, he was the master sawyer, his name was Newton, and the planks he said came there a day or two back. Evans gave him to understand that they were stolen. Newton said he had them of a man of the name of Flowers; he had been in business and he had failed.</p>

I found three pieces disfigured a-long side of Hoade's saw-pit.

               <p>Q. Did the tide serve so that after they had cut the raft, they might have flooded it down there - A. Yes, they must have cut it between twelve and one o'clock on the 23d of July.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 24th of July, did Hoade employ you to draw any timber up from the river - A. Yes, five pieces; the clock just struck six as I drawed the last piece. I drawed them close to the saw-pit. About twelve o'clock he employed me to take twelve planks to London.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe twelve planks are two pieces cut up - A. Yes. I delivered them in a yard in Hatton-garden.

I never saw the man in my life before Newton called him Flowers.</p>

            . Q. What day was it you went to Hatton-garden - A. On Saturday, the 24th, in company with Mr. Brockelbank, about eleven o'clock in the day. When I went into the yard, I asked for the master of the yard; the prisoner said he was up stairs, pointing to a little loft; he was called by some person, and as he was coming down the prisoner said, perhaps it is me you want.</p>

               <p>COURT. Had he heard you say before upon what business you came - A. No; he said, perhaps it is me you want; I am the master sawyer. I then pointed to this timber, laying on the saw-pit; it was cut into twelve planks. I asked him to whom that belonged; he said to him. I asked him who he got it of; he said he did not know the person. I then told him that the timber had been stolen, that I was a police officer, and he must consider himself in my custody. He then said he had it of a man of the name of Flowers, who was a sawyer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say what time - A. I don't recollect that he did; and asked him to sell some timber for him; Flowers said the timber belonged to a man in distressed circumstances, a little timber merchant in the Deptford-road. On the twelve pieces of timber I found on the premises in the saw-pit, they had the mark there a T upon it, and a P. I think it has an entire mark, which I cut off on purpose of producing on the former trial.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 22d of July, I was at work at Mr. Greathead's yard, Leather-lane. I went into the White Hart to have a pint of porter; and, as soon as I got into the tap-room, I saw Peter, George, and

            , drinking together. Flowers asked me how I did, and asked me to drink, which I did; he said, you are in the habit of working for a great many cabinet makers and carpenters, do you know any body that wants to buy any fine timber; I said I did not. He told me that he had a friend that had a large quantity of it in the Deptford road; he could not get a customer for it, therefore he must go to the King's Bench in a short time. I asked him if any of it was fit for Venetian blinds; he said some was, and some was not. I then told him I was in the habit of working for a person that used a great deal, if he would call on him he lived in Gray's inn lane, perhaps he would buy some of it. He asked me to buy it. I asked him the price; he said he could not tell then, he should see a friend of the owner of the timber, and he would call and let me know. He called the next day and said, his friend said the timber cost twelve pound a load; he told his friend I kept a yard. His friend said, if I could make it convenent he would satisfy me for the room, and for the selling of it. He then told me, that his friend would come along with it, and set a price to the timber himself, if I would consent to it; I consented. The next day, as I was coming from Greathead's yard, I met this Flowers at the corner of Baldwin's-gardens; he told me the timber was at the bottom of Holborn-hill. I told him we should be at the yard by the time the timber got there. As soon as the carman brought the timber to my house, Flowers said, here is my master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160082"></xptr> with it. The carman, Hoads and I, unloaded the timber and got it in the yard. I then asked him how many feet there were of this timber: he said, eighty-three; I set it down on a piece of paper. He said he had made a mistake, there was eighty-four feet; then I altered the figure. The lowest, he said, was ten pound a load, and sixpence a foot superficial. He then told me he would send the remainder to make it up three load the next day: and, if I could sell it, he should be glad: he wanted money very bad, and he expected to be arrested as soon as he went back. The carman, and he, and I, and Flowers, went and drank two pots of porter, and they went away. The next day, about three o'clock, the carman, Mr. Brockelbank, and the officer, came; I was sharpening my saw before they got to the saw-pit; there were four of them. The carman asked me if Mr. Norden was in the shop. I called Norden to come down; he answered me. I asked the officer whether he wanted Newton or Norden. I told him I was the master sawyer. He said, he hoped Mr. Newton and Mr. Norden would behave like gentlemen; I said by all means. He then asked me whether I had not some timber come in yesterday; I pointed to the timber, and shewed him where it was. He said that timber is stolen; I told him I did not know it. He asked me where I got it, or whether it was mine; I told him I did not know the proprietor of the timber; I knew the man who solicited me for yard room for the timber, his name was

He then asked who this man was that I called the proprietor of the timber; I told him a jolly faced man, with sandy whiskers. Mr. Brockelbank made answer, we have got him.

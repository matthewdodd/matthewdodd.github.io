            . I am porter to Mr. Nichol. I saw the waggon come to the wharf; it had a hogshead and some small goods in it, which were put on the wharf, not in the warehouse; both the prisoners came with the waggon; I saw them lifting the bag of hops into the waggon, and asked them if it had fallen out of the waggon - they said Yes, it had; they were both in the waggon - I then told our foreman I thought it had not; he went to look at the direction - if there had been a bag of hops in the waggon when it came in I must have seen it; there was none - Westbrook threw it out; Poulden had run away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Which of them said it had fallen out? A. I cannot say which - some goods were still in the waggon; the hogshead was being taken out at the time - any body who went to the waggon must see them.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I took charge of Westbrook on the wharf - Patterson said he and another had put the hops into the waggon, and asked Westbrook why he did so; he said he did not know who they belonged to - that some person asked him to put them up, and he supposed they wanted him to give them a cast some distance; I asked who the person was, or where he was to take them - he said he did not know: I asked where he was going next - he said to another wharf; I did not then take him, but watched him, and in a quarter of an hour took him in charge; I saw Poulden join him at the corner of Brick-hill-lane - I went up, and took him to the watch-house, then went with Westbrook to deliver a cask at another wharf, and then took him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is common for one man to ask another for "a lift?" A. Yes - I have known him two years driving for Mr. Dale, a town-carman, who employs eight or ten men - he was about three quarters of an hour delivering goods; he might have escaped, after I took Poulden, if he chose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any body but Poulden speak to him? A. No.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

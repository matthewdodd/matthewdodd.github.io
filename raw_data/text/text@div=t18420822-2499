                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live in Cow-cross-street, Smithfield. On Monday evening, the 25th of April, I was at the corner of Southampton-street, Strand, about five or six minutes to nine o'clock I had on a <hi rend="italic">blouse</hi>, and was dressed much the same as I am now—I was looking at some prints in a window—I saw the prisoner there—he was a stranger to me—there were several persons round the window—I was looking at a print, and the prisoner observed to me that that was a well done thing—I did not make him any answer at first, but, after a second or two, to the best of my recollection, I said, J thought it was—I then moved a little further to another part of the window, and the prisoner came again by the side of me—he said, "You appear to understand these things, Sir"—I was still looking at the prints—I replied, "Not much"—he then, after a second or two, said, "I beg your pardon, Sir, I have been out of employ some time; I have a few relics at home which I wish to dispose of, I do not think they are of much value; I should be glad to dispose of them if I could find a purchaser"—I said, "I am no buyer, as I do not under<lb></lb>stand such things, but what do they consist of?"—he mentioned the names of a few prints and books, but I cannot recollect them—I then asked where he lived—he said, "Oh, not above a minute or two's walk," mentioning a street in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane, which I do not remember—I said, "As I am going that way, I have no objection to look at them, although I may not become a purchaser"—I then went with him—we crossed the road, and, to the best of my recollection, the clock struck nine as we crossed Southampton-street—we went straight down to Stanhope-street, near Clare-market and Drury-lane—the prisoner crossed the road to a chandler's-shop at the corner of Stanhope-street, and there purchased a candle—I did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> in with him—he came out of the shop with a candle in his hand—it was not alight—he was about turning into, as I thought, a side-door of the chandler's-shop, but it afterwards appears it was the next door, and I said to the prisoner, had he not better get a light—he said, "Oh no, Sir, never mind a light; if you will allow me to lay hold of your hand, I will lead you to the foot of the banisters, and I will soon get a light"—I went into the passage—the street-door was open—he did not get a light—he led me to the banisters—he went on first—I felt my way up by the banisters till we arrived at the third story—I then found that the prisoner had got a light—he had got up a little before me, and had got a light by the time I had got up—I was on the landing—there was a box of Lucifer's on a table before the door—be</p>

               <p>was in the back-room, and I stepped in after him—I noticed a print hang<lb></lb>ing on the left hand side against the wall in the room—I asked the prisoner whether that was one of the prints that he wished to dispose of—he made reply—my back was towards him—I was about to repeat the question, when he said, "B—your eyes, I have neither prints or books either; what do you mean <hi rend="italic">to</hi> give me?"—"Give you!" I replied, "I have nothing <hi rend="italic">to</hi> give you: what do you mean? and for what purpose have you brought me here?"—upon that he seized hold of me by my trousers, outside, under the flap, and said, "I will shoot your b—head through your shoulders if you don't give me all the money you have got about you"—I said I had none—he said I was a b—liar—he still held me in the same manner—for fear he should rob me I said I had only got a shilling and a few halfpence—be said, "Give me that"—I had 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in one trousers' pocket, and some halfpence in the other—I took out some silver from my right hand breeches pocket, and in doing so, I pulled out 18(2.—upon that he said, "You have got more; give me that, give me the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I gave him the shilling—I gave it him for fear he should rob me—I was then about to leave, when he said, Give me the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "No, I will not; that is all I have got"—he then relinquished his hold of me, and I at<lb></lb>tempted to get out of the room—he then seized hold of me again, and said, "Now you b—I will nail you; I will tear your b—linen; I will tear your shirt, and then I will give you in charge if you don't give me the whole pf the money you have got"—I endeavoured to extricate myself from him, but did not succeed in getting out of the room—the prisoner rent the flap of my trowsers down, and pulled out my shirt—I was strug<lb></lb>gling with him as well as I could—to the best of my recollection, I had lost all command of myself—he first rent on. corner of my shirt—he could not tear it with his nails, and he picked up something off the floor, either a piece of china or a piece of slate, or some hard substance, and tore a hole in it—he did not tear a piece off—I then adjusted my things as well is I could, got <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the door of the room, and made the best of my way down stairs—he followed me—I do not know How I got down stairs—I got out of the house—I do not think we had been out of the house a minute and a half before I saw a policeman—the prisoner reached the policeman first, and was about saying something to him when I stepped across the way, and gave him in charge—he was taken to Bow-street—I was examined he fore the Magistrate, and he was committed for trial—ten or twelve days afterwards I was taken ill, and was taken to St. Bartholomew's hospi<lb></lb>tal, where I was confined till after the next Sessions were over.</p>

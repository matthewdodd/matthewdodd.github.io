                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, and live in Union-road, Clapham—the prisoner lodged in the same house—he slept with me on the night of the 18th Dec.—I had two half-crowns, two shillings, and a fourpenny-piece in a purse—I went to bed a little after eleven o'clock—I put my watch and guard and key into a little pocket at the head of the bed, and my purse was in my trowsers pocket on the floor at the foot of the bed—the prisoner went to bed at the time I did—I awoke about half-past three o'clock, and I observed him get out of bed about twenty minutes before four—he was moving something about at the foot of the bed—he then drew the curtain, and took my watch out of the pocket, and as I laid on the bed the watch-key drew across my face—he went out of the room—I drew the curtain and saw him go down to the back kitchen—he returned in a short time, threw himself on the bed, and got gradually into bed—I saw him extend his arms, as if in the act of throwing something, and heard the noise of silver on the floor—I then called to my land<lb></lb>lord's boy, who was in the same room, to fetch his father—the boy struck a light, and fetched his father—I then left the prisoner in charge of the landlord, fetched a policeman, and gave the prisoner into his custody—I then went to the station, and returned with the policeman—I saw my watch found in the prisoner's pail amongst his tools, in the back kitchen—I had accused him of stealing it while he was in bed, and he said, "<hi rend="italic">La</hi>', I have not seen it"—I had previously lost a thermometer out of my pocket, and that was why I laid still in bed when he took these things—this is my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a patrol: I heard the alarm of fire: I went round towards Long-lane; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260052"></xptr>came round to the fire several people were trying to break open the door; at the end of the place I saw the prisoner with these things under his arm; I saw him come out of the side door, under the gate-way; he began putting the things in his pocket out of the bundles, and two women came and disturbed him; at last he went towards Barbican; I stopt him with the property; he would not give me any answer; but began to strike at me several times; I took him to the watch-house; I took several parcels from under his arm, and delivered them to one Mr. Durant, a pawnbroker, that was with me at the time; he brought them to the watch-house, and delivered them to me; the prisoner tried to trip me up: he shuffled a pair of white cotton stockings out of his pocket, and one Mr. Wright took them up, and brought them to the watch-house; and Mr. Wright took three parcels more out of the prisoner's pocket; there were eleven parcels in the whole carried to the watch-house; the prisoner behaved very ill, and almost killed one man; he tripped him up, and jumped upon him, and cut another in the cheek: he behaved terribly at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sadler. I was at home when the fire broke out, which was at the back part of a building, about half after twelve; we endeavoured to get out all the things we could; I did not see the prisoner there; I know nothing of him; I was present, and in the shop when the man tied them up; he took them from the counter; he is not here; I do not know the value of the whole articles together; here are four yards of linen cloth, value four shillings, a white muslin gown, value six shillings, a Manchester cotton gown, value six shillings, a black petticoat, value three shillings, a linen shirt, value four shillings and six-pence, a silk handkerchief, value three shillings, a pair of shoes, value two shillings and sixpence, a pair of silk stockings, value sixpence, a pair of cotton stockings, value four-pence, a linen bed tick, value two shillings, a man's cloth coat, value nine shillings.</p>
               <p>(Mary Green deposed to the silk cloak.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I saw the fire I asked one of the watchmen where it was; he told me; I went to see whether my brother was in danger: I saw many people there; and a woman came in and plunged these things upon me, and said, for the Lord's sake take these things, our house is in flames; some of them fell down; I picked them up; I went to the pawnbroker's in Barbican, whose name is Burrows, and nobody came when I knocked; my wife went the next day to find out Mr. Berry's people; she enquired of two lads whether there were any women that assisted at the fire; and Mr. Berry said they wished to avoid prosecution: that is the truth, as I hope for salvation at the last day: I was going back to see whether there was anybody to take them in; I work hard for my bread, but they have completed the business.</p>
               <p>Court to Conway. Have you had any quarrel with this man before? - No, never; I never spoke to the man.</p>
               <p>Is there a pawnbroker of the name of Burrows? - There is.</p>
               <p>Did he stop there, or attempt to get in there? - He did not; he went up the court, but did not knock at the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have some friends here to speak to the principles of my character.</p>

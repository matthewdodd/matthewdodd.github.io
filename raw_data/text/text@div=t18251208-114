            . I am an officer. On Saturday last I saw the prisoner about half-past two o'clock - I followed him down to the end of Little Newport-street; he had a bundle in a handkerchief; I asked him what he had got- he said a coat which he had bought at Davis's, a Jew's, in Mary-le-bone-lane. I took the bundle, and said, "I suppose there is nothing but a coat" - he said, "No, nothing but the coat, and handkerchief." I looked into the pocket of the coat, and found this silk handkerchief, a pair of gloves, and two letters, directed to Nathaniel Gooding Clarke, Esq.; he then said he found the coat where they were breaking stones, at Westminster-abbey.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-house at Westminster. Mr. Clarke calls at my house, and I know this to be his coat, from this small piece of muslin being in it, which he ties round his neck; it was in a chair near the window, which was thrown open, and the coat taken.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going towards Millbank, to get work, as a plasterer, and picked this coat up.</p>

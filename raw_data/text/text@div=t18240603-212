            . I am a newsman - I was returning from town on the 12th of April, a little before eight o'clock, in a cart, to my residence at Knightsbridge - I saw the prisoner - he crossed the road and followed the cart three or four yards, and then took out the three boxes - the moon was quite bright - I saw him plainly - I told Mr. and Mrs. Blake, who were in the cart, of their loss - he put the box under his arm, and walked away with them - I pursued him as far as the Duke of Gloucester, public-house, which is about 200 yards - when I came up with him I said,</p>
               <p>"These boxes don't belong to you" - he said they did. I said,</p>
               <p>"Will you step into the public-house" - he said Yes; but he dropped them at the door and ran away; I did not pursue him, but he was brought back to me about five minutes afterwards; and I swear that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you loose sight of him at all - A. Yes; I lost sight of him while he ran about two hundred yards - there were three persons in the cart, but none of them observed him - I took him to the public-house - he remained in the back parlour alone while the officer was gone for - I had seen him when he crossed me to go to the cart - it was dusk, but the moon was full - he was out of my sight for a short time; but I am certain he is the man.</p>

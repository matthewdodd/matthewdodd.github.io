               <p>Leaving off work on Wednesday, the 3d of May, between seven and eight, I went with a parcel in the Strand, I called in at the Castle public house, and the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190126"></xptr> and the prisoner were near the box where I sat, and he shewed me a small piece of paper, making motions as well as he could, and I could not make it out, he seemed very uneasy; some time after they left the house, the prosecutor and the prisoner together; I saw them do nothing, only they were together; in about a quarter of an hour after, as I was going home, a little below Temple-bar, between that and Shoe-lane, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor, and another man together, the other man and the prisoner had hold of the prosecutor by the arm, and the prosecutor had this portmanteau upon his shoulder, and the other, not this man, seemed to be hauling the prosecutor along, and before they came to Shoe-lane the prisoner took the portmanteau from his shoulder; the other two that was with him seemed to force the prosecutor along, till they came quite to the end of Shoe-lane, and there the prisoner, with the portmanteau, run up Shoe-lane, I ran after him, and overtook him, and took him by the collar, and asked him where he was going; he said what was that to me; I asked him whether it was his property; and he said it was, and I had no business with it; I brought him to Mr. Sharp, and he took him into his house; the portmanteau was delivered into the watch-house, to the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Where was it you first saw the prosecutor? - At the Castle in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Who was in company with him at the time? - Another man and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did the other man seem to be acquainted with the prosecutor? - He seemed to talk his language.</p>
               <p>The prisoner could not talk his language? - Not that I know of, I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>What state were they all in? - I be- believe the young fellow, the prosecutor, seemed rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>What weight was the portmanteau do you think? - I do not know, about twenty pound; for what I know, they all appeared to go out in company together.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner, when you came up with him, appear to be a little in liquor? - I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>At that time he had the portmanteau upon his back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you by when this portmanteau was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not the portmanteau taken from the prosecutor's back apparently by his consent at the time? - I do not believe it was.</p>
               <p>How far did the prosecutor walk with these two men before the man turned down Shoe-lane? - No time at all, it might be a quarter of a minute when he got the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>How far did this man go down Shoe-lane? - He went to the first turning, and turned that way was which is Crown-court.</p>

               <p>What time of the evening was this? - Between nine and ten; I said nothing till I caught him by the collar; nobody was there but myself.</p>

               <p>The first I saw was at a public house in the Strand; I was with the last witness, and saw the prisoner, the prosecutor and another man drinking in a box together; I could not tell the conversation; I was in another box along with Grimes, the prosecutor came up to us with a direction, and asked us if we could tell him; it was somewhere by St. Martin's-lane, but we could not make it out, so the young man was laying on the table, the other man came and took him in his arms into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190127"></xptr> box where they were sitting; in a few minutes after the prosecutor took the portmanteau into the tap-room, and sat upon it, and put his hand over his head as if sleepy; and in a few minutes after they went out of the public house; and in about a quarter of an hour after, me and Grimes saw the prosecutor with the portmanteau in the street; we could not hear the conversation; the other man had hold of the prosecutor by the a rms; the prisoner was on the other side; and just before they came to Shoe-lane, the prisoner got the portmanteau; whether he took it from him, or whether he gave it him, I cannot say, I saw no force used; and at the end of Shoe-lane the prisoner hung back, and run as hard as ever he could go up the lane; my partner says this young man is done out of his property; he run after him and brought him back; I came up to him and said, is this your property? yes, says he; I took the property to the owner.</p>

               <p>What did your portmanteau contain? - The things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where was it that the prisoner first had your portmanteau? - In the large street.</p>
               <p>How far in the large street before you first lost sight of the prisoner after he had taken the portmanteau? - As soon as he took the portmanteau from my shoulder, I lost him at once, I saw no more of him; coming back again I saw a parcel of people in the street; I ran up the street, and there I saw another man holding the portmanteau, and he run up and said, that is the man.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in company with the prisoner and his companion? - We were a very short time together; we were in that public house three quarters of an hour.</p>

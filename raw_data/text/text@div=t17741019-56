            . On the 26th of October 1770, I was coming to town out of Berkshire; at Hounslow, I met with the prisoner and another man; we fell into company, and came together to Piccadilly; there we put up our horses; I came to town to receive some money of one Mr. Raymond; I went that same evening to Mr. Raymond's, where I received fifteen guineas. I wanted to go to the Borough; a man that was with the prisoner offered to shew me the way; we returned from the Borough to <placeName id="t17741019-56-crimeloc253">Eyre-street, Piccadilly</placeName>

I was to have paid this money to Mr. Ravenshaw. I saw the prisoner two months afterwards in Fleet-street, and took him up. He took me first to one house in Fleet-street, and then to another; but some people came about and said they would knock my brains out if I would not let him alone; then they called a coach, and drove him away to the Borough; I got up behind and followed him there: they went into the Two Brewers, and there they made me take two notes of hand of the prisoner for the money. On his cross-examination,</p>
               <p>"he said he was asked to gamble on the night of the robbery, but he refused it; that afterwards when he had got the notes, he brought an action upon the notes, that he sued out a writ from the Marshalsea Court and put it in the hands of an officer, but the prisoner he was not apprehended; that if he could have got his money again, he should not have troubled himself about the robbery; being a poor man, his only view and aim was to get the money again; that the morning after he was robbed, he went to Sir

In consequence of some suspicions, I told the prisoner her box must be searched, she answered she was very willing for her box to be searched, she had nothing in it but her own; the prisoner opened the box in the presence of the constable and myself; the box was at the top of the house in the nursery. In her box was found all the articles in the indictment.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, This key they found in my possession; I accidently lost the key of my box, my mistress gave me two keys off a bunch of keys, to see if they would fit the lock of my box; one of them opened the box, and the other I threw in my box; these napkins were for the use of the child, I frequently put them in the box. The half boots his eldest child brought me up in her hands. I believe she is about two years old. The women's shoes I know nothing of, they were not there when the constable opened the box. I was taken to the counter. On the next morning I heard they had found some women's shoes; I said I know nothing of shoes, nor were they found at the time when they opened my box.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Is that so. - A. The constable found the shoes when he searched her box; they were wrapped up in a flannel petticoat.</p>

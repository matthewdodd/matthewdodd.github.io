                  </hi>. I live at the house of Mr. Thomas Hamblin, No. 3, Crayford-road, Camberwell. On Sunday, the 14th of Dec, a few minutes before eight in the evening, there was a knock at the door—I opened it and found the prisoner Smith there, with a letter in his hand, which he asked me to deliver to the lady of the house—I asked him where he brought it from—he said, "It is all right, take it to the lady of the house"—I asked him again where it came from—he still said it was all right, did I choose to deliver it to the lady of the house, if not he would shoot me—he put his hand into his pocket and drew out something which I took for a pistol—it was rather in the dark, but something shone—I then took the letter from him—Catherine Hamblin was at that time at home—I went and delivered the letter to her in the kitchen—the prisoner was in the hall—she went into the drawing-room with it—the man stood in the hall and I stood in the passage, which is the same thing—he was about three yards from the stairs, or not quite so long—I observed that he had a pistol in one hand, and the white handle of a dirk or dagger in the other—Mr. Phillips came out of the drawing-room, and Mrs. Hamblin after him—Mr. Phillips asked the prisoner by what right he demanded money there—I could not hear what the prisoner said—I then heard Mrs. Hamblin say something to Mr. Phillips, but I do not think the prisoner was near enough to hear what passed—she was on the stairs and he was in the hall where he was at first—Mrs. Hamblin then went up stairs—I did not see her go up—I heard the prisoner say he would give two minutes before he called his men in to plunder—Mr. Phillips then went up stairs after Mrs. Hamblin—he came down again and went to the prisoner in the hall—I did not hear distinctly what he said to him—I did not see him give the prisoner anything, but he spoke to him and then he went away—Mr. Phillips followed him to the door—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>No. 3, Crayford-row, Camberwell. I was at home a few minutes before eight o'clock on Sunday evening, the 14th of Dec.—I heard a knock at the door about that time—I was in the kitchen—Mrs. Gallavan, who lives in my house, opened the door—I heard an altercation at the door—Mrs. Gallavan came to me in the kitchen, and gave me this letter,</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"For the lady of the house. My Lady, I write these few lines to inform you that I have been sent here by a gentleman for your money, and I must proceed in getting it; and if you refuse me, the men outside, twelve in number will come in and plunder the house; and if you make any noise your lives will be in danger.")</p>
               <p>The kitchen is on the same floor as the hall—I went from the kitchen into the hall—it is a square hall; and as I passed I saw the man standing—the prisoner Smith is the man, to the best of my knowledge—I went through the hall into the drawing-room—Mr. Phillips was there—I read the letter to him, and I think delivered it to him—I was very much agitated, indeed, on reading it, very much alarmed and terrified, I thought my life was in danger, and I made my way out of the house by the back door—I saw the servant next door, and told her to run immediately for the police—I then came back to the hall—I found Mr. Phillips there—he made some communication to me—I do not know whether the man heard it—he was still in the hall—I think it was in the hall that Mr. Phillips told me this, but, in my agitation, I do not recollect sufficiently—in consequence of what he said, I attempted to go out at the back door, to get money for the man, seeing he would not go out without—I did not hear him say so—on my attempting to go out at the back door, the man interfered to prevent me, with a pistol in his hand—he said, "You don't pass here," and closed the door—finding I could not pass that way, I went again into the drawing-room, and attempted to open the window to get out that way; but the man came out at the back door, and round the garden, and faced me at the window, as I was in the act of pushing it up—the drawing-room is on the ground-floor, and looks to the back of the house—there is a flower-bed under the window—I was in the act of pushing the sash up, and he came and lifted up the pistol, with his face close to the window—I saw the pistol dis<lb></lb>tinctly—he was just in the act of raising it, and was close to the window—upon that I quitted the window, and went into the hall, and the man had come back and was in the hall—he did not speak to me, or do anything then—I went up stairs—I could not find any money anywhere, and I went to see if I had got any up stairs—whilst I was up stairs I heard the man in the hall say, "Is that lady coming down?—two minutes more"—during the whole of this time I was in a state of very great alarm indeed—Mr. Phillips came up stairs after me—he pulled out a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and, after telling me what he intended to do, he went down stairs with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Except from the terror and alarm in which you were placed from what you have described, would you have parted either with Mr. Phillips's 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note or any money of your own? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was to get rid of the man, from the terror of being shot—I was willing to part with any money of my own, or any that I could get, to relieve myself from the danger and fright I was in.</p>

I was paying a visit to her on Sunday night, the 14th of Dec, and about eight, or shortly after, she came to me in the drawing-room, where her sick husband was lying—(I did not hear the knock)—she was in a state of the greatest agitation and alarm—she produced this letter and read it to me; on hearing which, I went into the hall and saw the prisoner Smith—I went up to him, and said, "Pray, what is your business here, sir?"—his answer was," I am come for</p>

               <p>the money there is in the house; and if I don't obtain it in a very short time, I shall immediately call in the men that are outside, and the house will be plundered"—I saw a dirk in his right hand, which he evidently wished I should see; and whilst he was speaking with me, probably with a view to alarm me, he drew from his left hand pocket a horse pistol—he did not say anything, but went to the street door, opened it, gave a whistle, and in came a second man, armed as he was, with a dirk in one hand, and in his other hand what I believe to be a horse pistol—they spoke together—I did not hear what they said—there was not light enough in that part of the hall for me to distinguish the features of the second man—he stood just by the entrance of the door—there was a lamp on the left hand, and the light shone obliquely—I at first hesitated for a moment whether I should not make a grand dash at Smith and upset him, which I thought I had strength enough to do; but when I saw the other man close to his elbow, I thought it would be a very imprudent thing—I then went through the passage towards the garden, and he went too—I saw Mrs. Hamblin very shortly after—she had been out, as she has described, and came in from the garden—Smith said, "If I can obtain 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will go away immediately, and take my men with me"—Mrs. Hamblin then went up stairs—she had not been up stairs half a minute before the prisoner called out, "Is that lady coming down stairs?" in a kind of authoritative tone, and he said, "If she is not down in two minutes with the money, the men shall cer<lb></lb>tainly come in and plunder the house"—there was no other person in the house but my sick brother-in-law, my sister, and Mrs. Gallavan—I followed my sister up stairs; and recollecting that I had received a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note two or three days previously from Williams, Deacon, and Co., I thought I would let him have that, because it might be a means of his detection—my sister and I came down stairs together—I went up to Smith with the note in my hand, and said, "Here is a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; if I give you this, will you immediately be off, and take your men with you?"—he said he would, and I gave him the note—I gave it him to get rid of him—I cannot say but I was somewhat alarmed; I think if you had been there you would have been alarmed too—there was cer<lb></lb>tainly a terror produced in my mind from what I read and saw—it was from that I was induced to give him the note—my sister continued in a state of great alarm and terror—the prisoner took the note, and went towards the hall door—I followed him—he turned round, and presented a pistol at my breast, and vowed, if I followed him, or even looked after him, he would shoot me—he then went out—I turned immediately from him, and he shut the door after him—within about five minutes after he was gone I went down to the police station—Inspector Campbell was not there at that time—he came shortly afterwards—he examined the garden and the drawing-room window, and the whole of the place—I think I saw him examine the flower-bed by the drawing-room window—I had received the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note from Williams, Deacon, and Co., for this check, which I have, dated 10th Dec—I received the note on that same day, in exchange for this check of Mr. Pitman's—the prisoner Smith is the man to whom I gave the note.</p>

In May last I had charge of the house, No. 3—Mrs. Jones came with a young woman to take a room at No. 3—I asked if she bad a family—she said no, she only wanted it for her and her husband—I afterwards saw the person she represented as her husband—it was the prisoner Smith—he assisted in moving the goods in—they lived there together as man and wife, and continued to do so up to the time Inspector Campbell came and took them into custody—I quitted the house in July, and lived in No. 1—I knew them to live together as man and wife, and had no reason to believe they were otherwise.</p>

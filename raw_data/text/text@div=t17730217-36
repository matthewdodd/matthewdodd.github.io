Last Thursday three weeks, about a quarter before eight, I heard the window break; I went immediately out and heard the cry of stop thief; somebody said the thief was gone down the court, which is at the corner of my house; a man at an eating house in the court pursued him, and took him in Beaufort-buildings; we brought him into my shop, and we observed both his hands were bloody; he said he was not the person that broke the window; a gentleman that was going by at the time, said he saw him break the window; I know the handkerchiefs were in the window; I did not miss them till I came back; he gave several different accounts about cutting his hands.</p>

            . I was passing along and saw two lads walking by Mr. Collier's window, looking at it; I took particular notice of them, and know the prisoner was one; I went two doors beyond the shop and crossed the way; I came back and kept my eye towards the shop; I saw that lad and three more then at the cornet of the court in company together; immediately as I came opposite the court the prisoner broke the window, and took something out of a dark colour; I crossed the way, and asked the mistress of the shop if she had lost any thing; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170030"></xptr> said she did not know: the prisoner was brought back; I know he is the person; he had his hands bloody as described.</p>

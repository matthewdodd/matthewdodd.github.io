             sworn. These are the four pictures she gave me. On the 20th of this month I received information, I went to the last witnesses' house and I enquired for the prisoners; she denied for a long time, at last I found there was a box sent down to St. Alban's to be left at the Peacock; there I found the box, they had not come down, I left word with a friend when they came, to apprehend them; in consequence of that, they were apprehended; I received a letter from the magistrate of St Alban's. I went down and took them coming up, the woman confessed where she had pledged them; I found them at two pawnbroker's, the man said they never should have done it if it was not for Mrs. Lea; we found no tickets upon them, nor should we have found them out if the woman had not confessed.</p>

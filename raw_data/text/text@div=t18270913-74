            . I live at Hornsey. I know nothing of the prisoner. I have a small box, which I know to be mine; it had been kept in the side-board drawer in my dining-room - it contained the articles stated; I cannot say when I had seen them safe; I was in the habit of seeing the box every day, but had not opened it to see the contents; the drawer was locked every night. On the 13th of August, when I came home, I heard of the robbery; I opened the drawer, and missed the articles. I cannot say for a certainty when I had seen them, but I had opened the box almost every day.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Saint John on the 13th of August; I know this box. I went into the parlour about half-past twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner there, with his hand in the side-board, where the box was kept; he was a stranger; he ran across the room, and jumped out of the window; I jumped out, and followed him down the lane - he was caught, without my losing sight of him - I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say to me, "There goes the man," and ask me to run after him? A. No, I did not.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at Hornsey. I heard Foden and a man cry Stop thief! I ran out, and stopped the prisoner - we took him back to the house; the constable found some property on him, but not the property in question. I then went and searched the place where the prisoner was stopped, and found twenty-five pieces of silver coin English and foreign, and those other articles; this was an hourand a half or two hours after he was taken; he struggled very much when I took him, and said, "Don't meddle with me - it is only a bit of a lark." I went to take him, and he threw up his arms, and said, "D - n your eyes" - and then, I think, he threw the property into the ditch, where I afterwards found it. I gave it to the constable.</p>

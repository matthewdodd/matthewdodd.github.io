            . I am a fishmonger, and live in Peter's-lane. I met the prisoner at Islington on Tuesday, the 23d, by the turnpike; he stopped me, and said, "Thank God I have got my business settled;" he had told me, about a fortnight before, that his cousins were going to get him some money which had been left him; he said he had got it, and gave me something to drink - he said, "Will you take care of this for me?" and gave me forty sovereigns; this was about half-past two o'clock - I met him the next morning, and he said, "If you will go and buy me some things, instead of going to work, I will give you 5s. for your trouble;" we had something to drink - I found myself rather giddy, and went to the Artichoke public-house, and sat down - I was there beat and cut about, and lost all his money, and all my own - I went and told him of it; he said it was a bad job - it would be his ruin - I wanted him to go for an officer about it - he said it was of no use, as I could not swear to them.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of the city of London. - A. Yes. On the 7th of July, I apprehended the prisoner, between eight and nine o'clock at night, in Cutler's-street, Houndsditch; he was sitting on a carpet; I asked him what he had there, he said it was nothing to me, it was his own property; I told him he must go along with me to the Counter; he said he would go along with me any where, and he would not tell where he had it from; I had two officers with me; I took him in charge, and gave the carpet to one of the officers. I had hold of him; we walked five hundred yards from the place where we first stopped him, he made a sudden spring and got away from me, I held his jacket, the jacket tore all the way up; I then catched hold of him by the collar and the jacket gave way again; he ran away from me into Cammomile-street into a mews, where there was no thoroughfare; there I got hold of him I never lost sight of him; I asked him why he run away from his property: when I went up to him he hit me down when; I got up he hit me down again. I had got a stick, I was obliged to make the best of it I could till I secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that carpet you found upon him that night the same carpet you shewed to Mr. Broom the next day. - A. It was; I saw him coming along with the carpet before he sat upon it I was watching for him two hours before. I knew at eleven o'clock that he was to bring it there.</p>

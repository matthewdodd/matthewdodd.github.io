I desired a person that was going there to see if there was such an one as mine. He went and when returned, said there was. I went to Guildhall on the Monday, and saw the handkerchief; it proved to be mine. Produced in court, and deposed to.</p>

There was a person perceived an handkerchief hang out of the knee of his breeches; I unbuttoned his breeches, and found two bound round his thigh, and another, which was a ragg, upon him. He was committed to the Poultry Compter. I delivered the handkerchief into Sir Joseph's custody, and he re-delivered it at Guildhall on Monday morning.</p>

               <p>I was coming along out of Whitechapel, having just been paid, and going to look for my sister, who was singing in the street. Doing my occasions by the Monument, there I saw a bundle lie. I picked it up and opened it, and counted four handkerchiefs in it. I had not pockets to put them in, so I put them about my neck, and tied some about my leg.  <rs id="t17520914-72-verdict361" type="verdictDescription">

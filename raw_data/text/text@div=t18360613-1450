                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman K</hi> 279.) On the 17th of May, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Benthal-green-road, with a bundle under his arm—I asked what he had got—he said, "A great coat"—I asked him where he had brought it from—he said, "From Romford"—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, to pawn it, as the weather was so hot now he did not want it—I asked what kind of coat it was—he said, "I will show it you" and began to untie the bundle—I said, "No, describe it"—I laid hold of it and said, "Now what is in the pocket?"—he hesitated and said, "There may be a knife in the pocket"—I found no knife, but a pair of gloves—I said, "I shall take you to the station-house"—he said, "You know me, I hope you won't hurt me, don't take me"—I said, "I must do my duty"—I found the prosecutor had lost a coat from his cart, about 200 yards from where I stopped the prisoner.</p>

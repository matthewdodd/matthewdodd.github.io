                  </hi>. I am master of the <hi rend="italic">Velocity</hi> schooner, in St. Katha<lb></lb>rine's Dock. On the 11th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was in White Lion-street, Whitechapel, on my way home from the City—I was standing by a coffee-shop, where I had been having some coffee—a man snatched my watch from me, and afterwards either shoved or knocked me down—I did not feel any blow, but felt the same person on me—he searched my pockets, and took from me a purse, containing a sovereign and a half—I was not at all the worse for liquor—I was able to take care of myself—I immediately gave myself in charge of the policeman, to take care of me, and told him what I had lost—it was a silver watch, I have not found it.</p>

On Sunday the 11th of May, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was in White Lion-street, and saw the prosecutor standing against the wall—I crossed over to the other side, and saw the prisoner come up and snatch the watch from his pocket—he threw it behind, and two men, who were behind him, took it up, and ran up White Lion-street—the prisoner instantly turned round, and knocked down the prosecutor—he leant over him—the prisoner put his hand to his pocket—I could not see whether the prisoner took anything from it—the prosecutor put his hands up and struggled with him—he called, "Police!"—the prisoner replied, "You may call, * police,"' and instantly ran up Mill-yard.</p>

On the 14th of November, Dixon my foreman, went up to fill a bed, and found a table-cover in a corner—on the 16th the prisoner was taken into custody, by my direction, and there were four table-covers, and a piece of canvas found on his person—they were mine—I think two were about his body—he had a band round his stomach on purpose to hold them—I have lost a great many table-covers, and other things.</p>

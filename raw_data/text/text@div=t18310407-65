            . I am a porter, and live in Great Trinity-lane. About ten minutes to nine o'clock I was under the gateway of the Saracen's Head, and saw the prisoner walk past me very quick, with a box on his left shoulder - I heard a person call Stop thief! turned round, looked towards where he was running, and saw him fling the box off his shoulder; I took it up, took it to the yard, and afterwards to the watch-house, where I saw the prisoner, and was quite sure he was the man who threw it down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. No; he went rather fast - I could see his face; he had a coloured neckcloth, and oval gilt buttons on his coat - I am quite sure of that; I cannot say the colour of his coat; it was similar to the one he has on, I am certain - he might be a minute under my observation; there was a gas-light in the yard, about twenty yards from where he passed me- I will swear to the colour of his coat; there was also a lamp in the street.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in Watling-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I stood there for a moment, and the prisoner came running round the corner - nobody was running before him; the patrol were pursuing him - several persons stopped him, and took him to the watch-house; Price gave charge of him for taking the trunk out of Smith's chaise - it was brought to the watch-house by Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the prisoner turning round, as if to go to the persons who were crying Stop thief? A. No - he had a dark handkerchief on, a green one, not black, and he had a green coat.</p>

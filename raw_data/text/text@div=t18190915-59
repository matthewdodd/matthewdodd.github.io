            . I am servant to Mr. Chandler, who is a salesman, in Newgate-market. Johnson bought two lambs, took one away, and left the other in my care; the prisoner came soon after, and took it off the hook. I asked him where he was going with it? He said, down to the cart. I said,</p>
               <p>"What cart?" He said,</p>
               <p>"That man's cart, that has just taken the sheep away." Two people immediately stopped him with it. He threw it on the ground.</p>
               <p>ROBERT EVANS. I am a porter. I was sitting on the board where the lambs hung; the prisoner was walking backwards and forwards - he took the lamb of the hook. I asked him what he was going to do with it? He said,</p>

               <p>"That man told him to follow him with it." I told him to hang it where he took it from, instead of which, he threw it on the stones. We secured him.</p>

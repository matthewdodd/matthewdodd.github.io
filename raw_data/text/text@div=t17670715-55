               <p>Amey Oakley. I am servant to Mr. Stamford; on the 5th of February my master and the prisoner went out; the prisoner returned and said, my master sent him back to write two hours; he went into the office where he used to write, the bureau was in the same office; I went out of an errand, and when I came back he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been in that room besides the prisoner that day?</p>
               <p>A. Oakley. No, nobody; my mistress was ill up stair, she never came down; there was a carpenter came in in the evening to need a table; he was not there two minutes and I was there all the time the carpenter was there.</p>

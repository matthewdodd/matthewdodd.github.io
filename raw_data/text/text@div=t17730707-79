             and Daniel; the two prisoners lived with him at that time; the first day I came there I was employed in scouring copper plates; I came there about a quarter of a year ago; the next business I did was to pull at the fly.</p>
               <p>Q. A fly of what?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I never heard any name to it; it was cutting copper pieces; we called them buttons; they were to be half-pence; the fly was made use of in striking them; I have seen them out in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What part did the other men do?</p>
               <p>Phillips. We were not particular in our branches when we came to be used to it; one knew as well others; we were employed about seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you make in a day?</p>
               <p>Phillips. We counted for a couple of plates to be a piece, which cut 24 s. worth, that was a guinea's worth; we made eleven pieces to the amount of eleven guineas worth a day.</p>
               <p>Q. For how long time was it you thus continued employed?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Two months; sometimes we composed our day's work by four or five o'clock; it was eleven pieces. Palmer used to take out some himself; I believe I carried some out to a place I discovered to Mr. Gates; I do not know the name of it. The tools were removed from London to a house at <placeName id="t17730707-79-crimeloc390">Kensington Gravel Pits</placeName>

               <p>Q. Whose house was that to which they were removed?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I know the house but do not know whose house it is: I had half a guinea a week, meat, drink and lodging; all the striking part was done at Kensington.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compleat them entirely the time you struck them?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Davis to?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. They are good looking halfpence; they are very little inferior to good money; there is one where the die has missed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You were all of you but a sort of journeymen?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, to one Palmer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Palmer used to tell you that he was a button-maker? what trade did Palmer profess himself to be?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. They were made under the notion as buttons?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he pay you your half guinea in?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Always in gold?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen these men work at that fly?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Davis employed in any thing more than carrying out parcels?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, the same as we all; we were employed equally.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Davy. You know a halfpenny from a button when you see it?</p>

            ; I saw Phillips, and Tonner the prisoner; they were removing a grindstone in the cellar; I observed on the floor of the cellar a plank of wood fixed in the ground where something had been fixed of a machine for stamping; I then went up into the garret; I asked them what they were doing; they said they were only porters hired by a gentleman in Fleet-street that day; they said they did not know him; I asked where they lay; they said in a hay field; I searched them, and found near 3 l. a piece upon each of them, gold and other money; I asked them where they were going to remove to; they said a cart and horses was waiting in Black Friars to receive them; that they had been with other thing with a knot to Black Friars, and there found the cart and horse; I went there with them, and waited for the cart and horse; nobody came to it; then I sent it to the Green yard, and took the two men to the Compter. I went up stairs before, and found two forms that were in the garret with a quantity of nine sand for casting metals. I said they should go to different prisons, and then Phillips confessed there was an information made, and in consequence of it I went to Kensington; Palmer was removed there; it was on the 16th at night, near ten o'clock; we went to Kensington and took Phillips with us; we rang a great while at the door and nobody came; I then put my hand through the gate, lifted up the latch and got into the yard; they assisted me and we broke the door open; I went and searched all over the house and there was nobody in it; we found a wheel (producing it) for the purpose of polishing brass: after they are punched out by one instrument the roughness is taken of and they are brightened by that wheel. I found a quantity of blanks for half-pence not stamped (producing some of them); I found the wheel in the fore cellar; it was lined with leather; they put emery and oil in it, and turn it round, and their own weight on the leather brightens them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the back door open?</p>
               <p>Gates. I believe they went out at the back door as we went in at the fore door. This scoter ( producing it) I found in the out house; it marks the width of the halfpence, and then they cut it with shears. We found this (producing a large engine with a fly to it) that cuts the halfpence out of the slips of copper; we found it in the stable. We found a back door into another stable, that we broke open; there we found a stamping machine; we also found a quantity of blank dyes, 50 I suppose; there is no impression on them. We stayed in the house four or five hours at least before we got the things into a cart to get them away to the Mansion House. When I came away I left Burton, Wilson and Evans in the house. There is always three persons employed to work the machine with the fly; one stands at each end of the fly, and one puts the copper under; it cannot be worked without three persons.</p>
               <p>Q. You found all these things by the direction of Phillips?</p>
               <p>Gates. Yes; Phillips gave an account of them before we went; every thing tallied very minutely with the account he gave. There is a quantity of new halfpence I found under the stamping instrument.</p>

               <p>Q. All these things you are talking of were found in the house of Mr. Palmer?</p>

               <p>Q. What answer did you make to him when he said what had he done?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I said nothing at all. When he sat in the chair he made directly at the tongs; I laid hold of him then, and secured him that he should not do any mischief; with that he threw

I was one of the persons left behind by Mr. Gates: I was up one pair of stairs and saw Davis come to the gate, and put his hand through to try to open the gate; I suspected him to belong to them; I called out to Wilson to run as fast as he could to the gate, and we secured him; this was about five o'clock in the morning.</p>

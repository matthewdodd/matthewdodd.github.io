On Tuesday, the 2nd of June, about six o'clock, I went into Edwards'-mews to assist Serjeant Ching—we separated two men who were fighting there, and the crowd were dis<lb></lb>persing—Pickley came up to Ching, and said, "I will mark you"—Ching called to me to assist in taking Pickley into custody—the prisoner came up to, Chjng, he said he should not take him, and struck Cbing a blow on the breast-Ching at that time had got hold of Pickley on one side, and I on the other—the prisoner ran a short distance away—Ching followed him, but seeing that I was almost overpowered with Pickley, I believe he came back to me—the prisoner came back a second time, and tried to take hold of him again—he made a blow at Ching, and said, "You b——take that"—he struck him, and turned round and struck me in the eye—he made a blow at Ching, and knocked his hat off—he then went a short distance out of the crowd, and picked up this brick (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), came towards Ching, about five or six yards from him, threw the brick at Ching, and hit him on the right temple—Ching's hat was off at the time—the prisoner looked at Ching, and seemed taking an at him—the crowd seemed to make way for him—he was clear of the other people—he was caught by some one in the crowd—I picked up the brick immediately, and have had it ever since—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—I was as near to him as I am to his Lordship.</p>

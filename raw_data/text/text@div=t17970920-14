             sworn. - Last Saturday, about three o'clock, the prisoner was in my parlour, drinking a glass of liquor; I keep a public house; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them); he was looking at the newspaper for about an hour and a half; about half after four o'clock, he went out; he had an apron on, like a tallow-chandler or a grocer; my wife went into the parlour directly, and missed the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sitting there alone? - A. There were some children there; he told the eldest that they might go out and have their gammocks, and he would rock the cradle the while; my wife went after him, she followed him into Mr. Ham's, a public-house; and there he made an excuse to go backwards; we followed him into the necessary, and there we found some frocks and a gown down the necessary, and some things in the crown of his hat; they were all in the parlour ten minutes before he went away.</p>

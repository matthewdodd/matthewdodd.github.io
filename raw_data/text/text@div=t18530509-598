                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On this Saturday I was very bad in bed—I heard a quarrel and screaming between the prisoner and his wife, and came down stairs twice about it—I saw my husband break the broomstick—the prisoner was not there then—I saw my husband have hold of the prisoner by the hair of his head, and hit him two or three times—the prisoner's wife was in the yard; be had been attacking her before my husband interfered—I got hold of my husband, and separated them—after that the prisoner went out into the street—he was away about a quarter of an hour—while he was out, my husband and I were sitting down in the house, and I heard a voice cry, "Mind the knife!"—that induced me to go to the door, and I saw the prisoner coming from the yard—I returned back, put my hands on my husband's arm, and told him to go back—before I bad said the words, almost, the prisoner struck over my shoulder and hit my husband in the chest—he then went away, and my husband returned to the house; I examined his breast, and saw a wound, and blood on his shirt.</p>

I examined the prosecutor—he had an incised wound on the front part of the chest, just by the left breast; the edges were clean cut, showing that it was done by a sharp instrument, as a pointed knife—it penetrated the chest, and wounded the left lung—his life was in danger for three or four days—it has healed now—I did not notice any wound on his lip.</p>

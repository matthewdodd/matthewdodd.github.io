            . The two prisoners came into my shop last Saturday, being the 6th of this month; they asked to see some silk handkerchiefs, I shewed them several sorts, and they fix'd upon one particular sort, and asked the price of them, I said 5 s, 6 d. they bid me 3 s. 6 d. and on looking over my handkerchiefs I missed a parcel of a particular pattern, which I knew I had taken down to shew them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the prisoners when you missed them ?</p>
               <p>Dillingham. They were then in the shop: I stepped round the counter, and took Ellice by the collar, who began to swear when I asked for them, and said he had non. I opened his coat, but saw them not. Then Simpson pull'd them from under his cloaths; I could not see from where, but it was from about him, and flung them on the compter; on which I sent for a constable, and they were secured and taken before justice Fielding; there Ellice behaved very saucily; the other said little.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body else in the shop besides them?</p>
               <p>Dillingham. No, there was not, they flung down 3 s. 6 d. several times, and would fain have had one of the handkerchiefs, and gone off.</p>
               <p>The five handkerchiefs produced in court, and deposed to.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said in their defence, they went in with a design to buy only.</p>

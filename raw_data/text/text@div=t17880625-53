I said, the clothes on the line; I looked round immediately, and saw the lines both cut at one corner, and the clothes wrapt up in the yard, laying on the ground; I have a piece of the line in my pocket; I tied up the line myself; I sent for a constable and gave charge of the prisoner; my wife took up the things; he was taken to the watch-house; I cannot say I saw these things hanging on the line, they were not wrapt up in any thing, but a part of the line was wrapt up in them; I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

(The things produced and deposed to;) this gown, (taking hold of one) is the property of a person I wash for; this shirt belongs to a lodger in the house; I had pinned it on the line.</p>

Never to my knowlege; I took him to the Town-hall, as some gentlemen said it was the nearest place - I know he was in company with the other - they were walking together - he said he had found the handkerchief - I did not see him take it; I saw him and the other close behind me - they passed me - the prisoner attempted to run away when I collared him - there was nobody between him and me.</p>

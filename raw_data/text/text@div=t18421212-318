                  </hi>. I live with my aunt, Margaret Waugh, in White<lb></lb>chapel-road. These stockings hung inside the door on the 26th of Nov.—about a quarter of an hour after I had seen them safe they were brought by the constable—these are them—the ticket is on them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 51.) Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, on the 26th of Nov., I saw the prisoner and another lad, and a woman—knowing them, I watched them—they went to the prosecutor's door, and the prisoner made a snatch at something inside the shop, but did not get anything—he and the other lad then went to the woman again—they went to the same place near the door—the prisoner then made a snatch, and I saw he had got something, which he handed to the other boy—they then ran to a court—I followed, and came up with the prisoner—the other made his escape—I asked the prisoner where the things were that he took from the shop—he said he had got nothing—I said, "I saw you take something, either you or the other have got it"—I turned, and found these stockings oil the ground.</p>

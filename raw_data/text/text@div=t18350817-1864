                  </hi>. I am a policeconstable. I accompained Gilpin to the Guardsman public-house, and took the prisoner into custody—he said Mr. Smith, of No.14, Lincoln's-inn-fields, gave him the cheque—we went there, but could find no such person—he then said Smith gave it to him, near Temple-bar, as part of some money he had got on some estates of his; he being his attorney—I searched him at the station-house, and found on him part of a sheet of a paper corresponding with the paper the cheque was written on, in every particular—the water-mark agrees in the creases.</p>

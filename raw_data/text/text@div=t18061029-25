               <p>Q. Where was your waggon - A It was in Aldersgate-street, going out of London to Manchester, here is the man that saw it done; I was at the Bear the corner of Barbican, paying the fourpenny toll.</p>
               <p>- COLES sworn. I am guard to the Manchester waggon, I was in Aldersgate street when I last saw these things.</p>
               <p>Q. A little before nine in the evening. - A. Yes, I was of the side of the waggon, I saw a man behind the waggon, I went behind the waggon, and I saw the prisoner in the waggon; I asked the man that was following the waggon what he wanted, he said nothing, I told him I supposed he did, or else he would not be so close to the tail of the waggon; then he drawed away, I took my opportunity and got up the ladder, and caught this man in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the prisoner in the waggon. - A. Yes, I ta'en a man in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the man is it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he done in the waggon. - A. He cut the hamper string that hung the hamper hooks to the waggon, I put my foot on the ladder as it hung up behind, and laid hold of his collar; then he got down out of the waggon, and the hamper fell out before him. The hamper was tied inside of the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him in custody, you are sure he is the same man. - A. I am sure it is the same man, and that is the hamper that was inside the waggon.</p>
               <p>- ROBINSON sworn. I am an officer of Aldersgate ward. On the 27th of this month, about a quarter before nine, the prisoner was committed to my charge, I took him to the Poultry counter; I produce the hamper.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have but a few words to say; I left home about six o'clock, I went to the King's Arms public house, Aldersgate street, I stopped there till about half after eight o'clock; when I came to the corner of Barbican I crossed over the way, I saw a waggon, I asked a man that stood at the Red Lion inn gateway, he had a smock frock on, if I might get up and ride, he said I might; I had not been in the waggon two minutes before I was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this hamper to tumble out before you. - A. He said the hamper ropes were cut, I had not a knife about me.</p>

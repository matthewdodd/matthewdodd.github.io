On Sunday, the 21st of March, I lost one pair of ribbed stockings, value 3 s. one piece of printed linen, value about half a crown, and six muslin caps, value about ten shillings; I had lost the other things in the indictment previous to that, but cannot say the day. On the 21st of March I had a few friends to dine with me; and we went up to Islington after dinner: the prisoner Mason was our <rs id="t17900424-18-deflabel112" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Where were those goods when you went out in the morning? - In the shop window; they were goods for sale; we had her boxes brought down into my parlour; and there were a variety of articles, the greatest part of them had my shop marks; they consist of linen handkerchiefs, aprons, cotton stockings, &amp;c. the things are all in Court; I was present when her boxes were searched; and I can say with certainty that every article we have here is mine: the prisoner was taken to New Prison: I suspected the prisoner Perry, and I got a search warrant, and went to his master; the prisoner Perry was in the yard; he went up stairs before I did; we desired to see his box; he brought it immediately nearer to the door than it had been, and he opened the box; I do not believe the box was then locked, though the key was in it; in opening the box there were several articles that I laid my hands on; and he said these articles were given him by the prisoner Mason; these things had been lost prior to the 21st of March.</p>
               <p>What was the value of each of those articles? - They were some pocket handkerchiefs, and half a neck handkerchief; the neck handkerchief was worth one shilling, and the pocket handkerchiefs worth one shilling a piece; the boy was examined, and very frankly told us, that all these articles were given him by the prisoner Mason: having further information against Mason, I went to Islington, to

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Chancellor, as an omnibus driver from Kensington to Whitechapel. I became acquainted with the pri<lb></lb>soner about eighteen months ago—he was in the habit of riding up and down, and sitting by me on the box—I said to him, I should like to buy an omnibus—I had a little money in the Bank—he came to me on the 28th of October—he rode down to Kensington—he gave me half a dozen cards to distribute, and said he had taken a public-house at last, called the White Bear, at Ratcliff-cross—he had been looking for a business for some time—he came to me two days after, and said he wanted to speak to me—he said, "You have got a little money in the Bank; I have got 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I want you to let me have your 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the Bank; I will deposit the lease of my house in your bands as secu<lb></lb>rity for it—he said he wanted it to purchase the lease of his house, that his brother and sister were in the house, and he had possession, and was going on Saturday to get the lease; he would procure the lease on Satur<lb></lb>day, and deposit it with me—I said, if he would deposit the lease in my hands as a security I would let him have it—I met him, and went to my broker, and sold out 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock, and got 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, six sovereigns, and six shillings—I walked down towards Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner, and gave him nine 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, six sovereigns, and fifteen shillings, in the presence of Mr. Collier—he was" outside the bar—I was induced to part with my money because he said be would bring me the lease up in the evening—I should not have parted with my money if be had not told me he had 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was in possession of the house—I saw him again on the fallowing Wednesday—Mr. Thompson was with me—we went into a pub<lb></lb>lic-house—we saw the prisoner there—I said, "You have got no public-house, where is my money?"—he said, "Do your best, and do your worst," and away he went—I could get no policeman to take him—my friend went and spoke to him—he said, "He may do his best, and do his worst, he shant have a d—d shilling"—I looked for him afterwards every day, and my answer was, he was gone into the country—I found him on the 22nd of last month—I saw him on the Sunday morning after I gave him the money—he said, "Sankey, I have not taken that house; come over the way to-morrow morning, to my uncle Tupcott's house, and I will give you the money"—I went, and saw his wife—she said he was gone into the country—I never could see any more of him.</p>

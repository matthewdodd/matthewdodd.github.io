               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you yourself miss any thing? - A. I did not miss this wood till I saw it at the office.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ASTOR, junior, sworn. - On Sunday evening, the 5th of December, I saw the prisoner in New-court, Crown-street, with some wood under his arm, going towards his lodging, I think it was between six and nine in the evening, the moon shone very bright; I called to him, and asked him what he had got there; he at first said, he was going for a light; I insisted upon knowing what he had got; he said he had got some wood; I followed him up stairs, and before I could overtake him, he had placed the wood in the room above his lodging; I took the wood, there were eight pieces, and followed him down stairs. I asked him how he could rob his master, and he said, he had been persuaded to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to give an account of it? - A.No. He seemed so very much frightened, that I could get hardly any thing out of him; I took him to the watch-house, and delivered the wood to the constable; I knew it to be the wood of Astor and Company from the quality and size of it. I am in the habit of frequenting the factory; I have the management of the business of that factory; it is called aire wood, it is used for veneering.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss that wood? - A. On the Monday, I looked over the bundle, and found eight leaves missing.</p>

             sworn. - On Sunday night, the 5th of December, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner knocked at my door, No. 5, New-court, Crown-street; he asked for a light, and seemed to be in a hurry; he put some boards down in my room, and left them; I heard somebody on the stairs say, you villan, what have you done with the boards; and I said, here are the boards, and gave them to the gentleman.</p>

               <p>Thomas Ashton, an officer, produced the boards.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is New-court from the factory? - A. An hundred yards, or rather better.</p>
               <p>Mr. Banks. On the Monday morning, I examined, and missed eight boards out of the bundle; I have since compared them with the bundle, and they correspond in the quality and numbers. All the veneers are numbered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long had the prisoner been your servant? - A. He was servant before I was in the partnership. I have been in the partnership nearly two years.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Astor, jun.) You have sworn these are eight boards, would they be called in the trade eight boards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

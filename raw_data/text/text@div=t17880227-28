I said yes, the first floor, at a guinea and a half a week; I shewed him the lodgings.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a dark green coat, a great deal better than he is now.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - Yes, he asked if I had any apartments besides; I said yes; he asked to see my mistress, I said she was not at home; he asked me for a pen and ink to leave his address; I left him in the parlour with a young woman who happened to be there to see me, while I went for the pen and ink; when I came down, I recollected I had not paper below; when I came down the young woman said, take care of this man, for he has got a spoon; he said he had no such thing; he then took the spoon out of his right-hand pocket, and gave it me; there is a kind of crest upon it, but I don't understand it, and I cannot describe it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Has your mistress any other spoons marked so? - No, that was the only spoon that was left out, all the others were locked up; that spoon my mistress used in common, it was left on the sideboard.</p>

             delivered that message to us, and said he was going to Broad-street to pay it, (Looks at the 100 l. a 20 l. and a 5 l. note) these were among the notes delivered to him. He went away, and in twenty minutes returned crying, and said he had been knocked down in Austin Friars, by three people and robbed of the money, that he had taken it out of his pocket, with the notice to see where he was to go to; that as they met him, one of them struck him in the eye, mouth, and stomach, and knocked him down, and took the money from him; that they lifted him up, and put him on a step of a door, and left him. I sent for Mr. Richardson, and kept him there till he came, he gave the same account again. Austin Friars is not in the direct way to Broad-street; he should have gone down London Wall, Winchester-street, it could not make a minutes difference.</p>

Richard was not there; I did not see him that day - I saw him on Thursday morning at his lodgings. I whistled as I went by, and was let in by Jane's sister. I went up and saw the prisoner and Jane in the bed. Richard asked if I would have any thing to drink; he sent Harriet for gin and peppermint, and after it was drank Richard gave the bolster to Harriet, and asked her to give me the notes out of it. She was a long time getting them out. She emptied all the feathers out, and at last found them. He looked at them, and said</p>

Richard gave Mason some sovereigns. I told him to walk on one side of the way, and we two would walk on the other, to avoid suspicion.

On the Saturday morning I went up stairs - he gave me what he said was 500 l., and twenty sovereigns, to take care of for him, I said I would. It was in two bank notes, one was a 200 l. I saw him again on Sunday; and he told me that his brother went to borrow some money for his master to take up a bill; and when he had got the money he gave it to him, and said he had been knocked down and robbed of it. When Richard gave me the money, he said,</p>

He put some rag over the notes, and then wrapped the sovereigns up in it.</p>

On the 5th of March I was sent for - I and Mr. Richardson, the prisoner George, and Mr. Sterry went to Austin Friars, where he said he was robbed; he pointed out the spot where he was robbed; we could find nobody there that knew any thing of it. He said it happened about four o'clock. Next day I went after Richard, and found him at last, at Ingram's, the Sun, in Bedfordbury. I had very hard work to get him away. I was surrounded immediately I seized him, and unless I I had produced my fire arms, I should not have secured him. He made very great resistance. I was forced out of the skittle-ground into the tap-room. I found 24 s. 6 d. on him.</p>

            'S, Defence. I have nothing to state only the manner I was robbed of the money. When the bill was presented to Mr. Richardson, I was not aware I was going to take it up. The direction was left, and about eleven or twelve o'clock, I took it to Mr. Sterry's, and told him the bill was due. He called afterwards, and said,</p>
               <p>"Send somebody between three and four o'clock for the money." I was not aware I was going to take it up, till I was sent. Mr. Richardson sometimes took them up himself. I left Mr. Richardson's at half-past three in the afternoon; previous to that, about ten minutes before, I had to go to Thomas-street. I had met my brother in the morning, and went with him to have something to drink, at the Cock. He had a young woman with him, and said he was going to the Cock. The last time I saw him, was twenty minutes after three, and then I did not know I was going to take up the bill. When I returned, I was ordered to go to Mr. Sterry's I stopped there ten minutes before I received the money, which was given me from a parcel of notes. I went out of Mr. Sterry's front door, and along London Wall, up Winchester-street, to Austin Friars, and in the notes I had the direction of the bill. Not being sure of the number, I unfortunately pulled the notes out of my pocket, and looked at the direction; at the moment three very genteel persons passed me, and the moment I put the money in my pocket. I received a blow on the back of my neck; at the same moment one in my mouth, and one on the chest which knocked me down, and completely deprived me of speech; two of the persons lifted me up by the arms, and placed me on the step, and run towards Broad-street; the contrary way to that they were going when they met me. I was not able to call after them through the blow, but run as well as I was able, the way they went; but never saw them after they crossed the corner of Austin Friars. I run as fast as I could up Threadneedle-street, but could not see them; I returned the same way as I came to Mr. Sterry's, and several people asked me what was the matter. I said I had been robbed. I make no doubt but they would have gone with me if I had asked them. I then thought it most advisable to make the best of my way back to Mr. Sterry's, and endeavour, if possible, to stop the number of the notes. I stated to them the manner in which I had lost it, they asked me if I should know the persons again, if I saw them. I said I was certain I should know two of them; Mr. Sterry said I must come to the Mansion House. I went before the Lord Mayor, and stated the manner I had lost the money. Mr. Richardson and Mr. Sterry were sometime together with the Lord Mayor. We then went back to Mr. Sterry's, and staid there till near eleven o'clock; they then said they did not believe what I had said. Mr. Richardson, I believe, objected to my being taken into custody that night, and I was taken to his house, where I remained all night, and next morning proceeded to business as usual, and opened the shop, swept the door, and brushed the windows, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170039"></xptr>about nine o'clock Mr. Richardson went out, and did not return till about eleven. He had told me previous to going out that I must go before the Lord Mayor, and undergo an examination. I said I was willing, and about eleven o'clock I went. I was not in custody, I had abundant opportunity to escape, if I had been guilty, but I knew I was innocent.</p>

            'S Defence. I recollect being in company with my brother on the day in question, as I was in the habit of seeing him three or four times a week; the first time I met him was about half-past twelve o'clock, on Ludgate-hill, I was in company with a young woman, he said he was going to Holborn; I said, I was going to have something to drink at the Cock, and would wait there for him; he came there and went home; I waited there after he had left me, till about a quarter past three, and just as I was coming away he came there a second time. I asked him to sit down, and if he could stop; he said he was going to Thames-street and could not wait. We all came out together from the Cock, and stood a few minutes talking at the door; I went towards Temple-bar with the woman. I wish to make a few observations as to Hayes. He acknowledges I did not know where he lived; I leave it to you to consider whether it is likely that I should leave so much money in care of a person to whom I was a stranger. If I had counsel it would be plainer to your Lordship. On the first examination he swore it was a 300 l. and 200 l. - On the second, he said it was a 200 l. note, and the other might be a song for what he knew. He mentions likewise in his statement a third person named Harriet, who, if she was brought forward, could perhaps greatly corroborate his testimony. These witnesses, I submit, are kept away, because if they were questioned as to Hayes's character (for I know for many years it has been no good) he has been an utterer of forged notes. As to Hopper, the first I knew of him was his being procured as an hired bail for me at Lambeth-street, for which he received 10 s.; he went to my father and offered not to come against me for 20 l., and he sent into the gaol to say if I sent him out 2 l. he would not appear.</p>

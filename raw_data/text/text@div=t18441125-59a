                  </hi>. I am a glass-cutter. On the 28th of Oct. I was in Fleet-street, and, from some circumstance, I thought it necessary to take the prisoner into custody about half-past three o'clock.</p>

I found the prisoner in custody of the last witness, and I took him—before I spoke the prisoner said, "I have no pin about me, I have lost my own pin"—I took him to the station, and found inside his coat these three pins; and in his out-side pocket, before I got to the station I found this other pin, which is partly broken—I found this silver card-case in his trowsers pocket.</p>

I was in the Poultry—I had a breast-pin, and missed it about two o'clock—this is it—it is one of the three found inside the prisoner's coat—I had passed through Fleet-street, but I had the pin then—when I missed it, I immediately gave information to some of the detective force who were there.</p>

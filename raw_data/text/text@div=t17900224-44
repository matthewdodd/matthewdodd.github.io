               <p>I live at Paddington. On Thursday, the 18th of February, I was in my master's business; and see this man about three o'clock, about Mr. Far's house; the prisoner was on the outside of the garden, near the fence; I saw him walking backwards and forwards some time; I saw him pull down a board to make a hole in the fence; he ran in, and I saw him draw something from the inside of the garden, and he stuck it under his arm, and ran out, and ran across the fields; he was too far ahead to catch him, so I went to meet him, which I did at Tyburn-turnpike; he saw me, and ran across the road, over Hyde-park wall, and made the best of his way for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240048"></xptr>Park-gate; and I, going down Park-lane, met him at the gates; I laid hold of him, and asked him, what he had got there? he said, nothing; I said to him, what is that you pulled out of that garden? he pulled it out, and says, here is what I got; it was a cotton gown; he said, he took it out of the garden: I took him to my master's counting-house; where I took it of him, and him to the watch-house; the gown has been in my possession ever since. He told me that day he came out of Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>(The gown produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>What is it worth? - Five shillings.</p>

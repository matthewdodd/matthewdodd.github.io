                  </hi>. I am the father of Richard and Alfred Knight, who carry on business as stationers in Budge-row, Watling-street—I resigned the business to them a few years ago—I occasionally go to assist them—I was there on the 23rd of May, and saw the prisoner there—he handed to me this order—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Sir, I am very much disappointed at your</p>

               <p>not sending me my order, and hoping that you will by bearer the small hand, two reams of double crown to weigh 2lbs. each, and when you send me the boards send in the bill, and I will pay for them, and I have sent a little account by the bearer. Please send in the boards as soon as possible, as I am in want of them for work that must go in directly, as it is a country order. I am, sir, for H. Catmur, No. 8, Hollybush-row, Bethnal-green-road")—when I read it I asked him who Mr. Catmur was—he said, Mr. Catmur was a very respectable man—I said, "Why does he apply to us? Who has he been accustomed to have his paper of? or, where does he have his paper?"—he mentioned Messrs. Morgan and others—I said, "Who does he work for?"—he mentioned Mr. Tegg, the extensive bookseller, in Cheapside, and some other persons—he repre<lb></lb>sented Mr. Catmur as a bookbinder—I asked why he did not continue to buy the paper where they had been accustomed, particularly Messrs. Mor<lb></lb>gan, who, I thought, would supply them with verything they wanted—he said, Mr. Catmur had been so much disappointed that he was losing his customers for want of getting his goods in proper time—I asked how long he had been in the service of Mr. Catmur—he said not a great while, not many months—upon this I gave orders for him to have the paper—I saw it delivered to him, and a boy who was with him at the time assisting him—eight reams were delivered to him, worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never got the money for it—I made inquiries afterwards, and he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi> I am the prisoner's father. I live at No. 164, Beth<lb></lb>nal-green-road, and have done so fifty years—I never lived in Hollybush-row—this request is not in my handwriting, neither the name nor the body of it—I never authorized anybody to write it for me—I do not know whose handwriting it is—I have an opinion that it is like the writing of my unfortunate son—I cannot deny it—I have seen him write frequently—I think it is his handwriting—I never authorized him to write it—I did not get the paper, and never heard anything about it till after this trans<lb></lb>action—I am a bookbinder—I work for Mr. Tegg—I have bought paper of Messrs. Morgan—they very seldom disappointed me, nothing worthy of remark—I have not changed in consequence—the prisoner has fre<lb></lb>quently been in my employment, but only occasionally, up to last Jan,—he was not in my employment in May last—he had left me—I knew he was gone to Holly bush-gardens or row—I knew he was carrying on busi<lb></lb>ness there, but I have never been to the house.</p>

Morgan—I afterwards learnt from Mr. Tegg that Mr. Catmur had an<lb></lb>other workshop away from his place of residence—that did not influence us with respect to this order—it did afterwards—we did not apply to Mr. Tegg on the first occasion.</p>

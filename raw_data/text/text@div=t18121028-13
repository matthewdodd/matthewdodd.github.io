            . I am an officer. I searched Pullen's house on the 12th of July, and Cotton's house likewise. I took Pullen and Cotton in custody, at a public-house near St. Martin's Church. I told Pullen what I wanted him for, he endeavonred to make his escape. I searched him, and took him to the watch-house. I then searched Cotton. In Cotton's pocket I found a key, he said it was the key of his own cellar. I then went to Cotton's house, and took that key with me, and with that key, I opened his cellar door; his house is No. 5, Angel-court, Windmill-street; and in Cotton's cellar I found several pieces of stone bottles, and two or three pieces of bottles had</p>
               <p>="ris=" the last letters of Morris upon them, and</p>
               <p>="merchant.=" That is all the letters I could make out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing at Pullen's house in Portpool-lane - A. I found this tin can. At that time, it smelled very strong of liquor. It is made to hold two or three gallons, and is handy to carry under the coat.</p>

            . Q. You were in the service of Mr. Morris at the time that Pullen was - A. Yes, I know of Pullen selling liquor to Cotton for about nine months; brandy he sold to Cotton at 14 shillings per gallon; rum, 10 shillings, and port wine at 2 shillings a bottle. Pullen was cellarman; the warehouse of which he had the key, was in Northumberland street; he had the key of the vault and the stable adjoining to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What used to be done by you and Pullen - A, Pullen took it out of the cellar, and took it in the stable; that was at the time that Cotton came, and Cotton used to fetch it away at 10 o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. In what used you to deliver it in - A. In stone bottles. Cotton used to fetch it in jars of his own. I was taken up and then I accused Pullen. Cotton sometimes paid me for the liquor, and sometimes Pullen.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he leave his service - A. On the 11th of July in the evening, he had cut his hand. Mr. Morris took compassion of him, he was to return with his lame hand. I assisted in the search of Cotton's premises, and Pullen's premises. We found two bottles in Cotton's cellar; this stone bottle contains brandy, two gallons and a half, the other bottle is at the office; it is larger.

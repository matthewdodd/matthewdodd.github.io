             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Edwards, a pawnbroker, in Clare-street, Clare-market. On the 17th of August in the forenoon, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he came to our shop and offered six desert-spoons to pledge; he asked 18 s. on them; I was positive he had stole them, and looked at them some time; the prisoner said, if you do not like them, give me them back and take my watch; I told him that I should not do that, I suspected that he had come dishonestly by them: he hesitated for some time, and then he told me they were his master's, and that he was going to lay the money out for the use of his master: I told him I knew his master had not authorised him to do any such thing: at last he told me Mr. Taunton was his master: I sent to his master. I produce the spoons; they are worth two guineas as old silver. (The spoons identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

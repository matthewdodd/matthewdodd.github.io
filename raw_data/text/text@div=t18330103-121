            . I am an officer. I was in Thrawl-street; I saw the prisoner and another person - the prisoner was carrying this lard; I said, "What have you got there?" he said, "Only a few potatoes;" I put my hand and found this lard; he then said he had picked it up - I said it was not muddy; I took it and him to the station.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was coming down Brick-lane, walking sharp, and fell over this, which was wrapped up in brown paper - I met a young man, who asked what I had got; I said I did not know; we looked at it, and he said his sister kept a chandler's-shop, and might have brought it of me - we were going there, and met the officer.</p>

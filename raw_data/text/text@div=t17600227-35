My servant knowing I had such a glass as that which the prisoner brought, looked round, and missed such a one. Then he ran after him, and brought him back with the glass, which appeared to be mine. I took him before alderman Stevenson, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose it?</p>
               <p>Cumming. It was lost from out of my shop, but I did not miss it till my lad did at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Cumming. He used to come to my house, and had been very troublesome to me about a warrant; I am one of the constables of our parish: My servant was obliged to go some way upstairs to call me, and he used to sit at the door the while.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did he give before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Cumming. He there said his sister bought it and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him what business he had to take my hat and wig, and strip me to the skin.</p>
               <p>Cumming. I never saw either hat or wig he had at the time we stop'd him.</p>

            . The prisoner brought this glass to our door. ( Producing one.) I told him we would not buy it, but I would call my master, which I did, and he did not come directly. I look'd on the glass, and told the prisoner it was our's, after looking about and missing it. Then he went away. I went and told my master, it was our glass. We followed him into an alehouse, where he took up a candlestick, and went to cut me down. I know it to be my master's glass.</p>

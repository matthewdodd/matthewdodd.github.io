               <p>JAMES POSFORD (Police-constable S 50). I was on duty in Somers'-town, and saw the two prisoners lurking about in Charlton-street; I crossed over to them - they separated: I followed Kennett, and took this cap out of his hand, and these two scarfs from his bosom, this scarf from his pocket, and this roll of ribbon from another pocket - I asked how he came by them; he said Resteau gave them to him to pawn - he told me where he lived, and I went to his house, but he was not at home; I took Kennett to the watch-house, and Resteau was afterwards brought to the prosecutors' and I knew him to be the boy; I found nothing on him: in going to the watch-house he said he was with the other boy when he took the things, but he had none of them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

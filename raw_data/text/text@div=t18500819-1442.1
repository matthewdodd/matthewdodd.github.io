On the night of 11th Aug., about eleven o'clock, I was in plain clothes at Old Shades Pier—I saw the prisoners get into a steam-boat—I followed them—they got out at Hungerford-market, where they attempted to pick the pockets of several females getting out of the boat—they then got on board another boat, and went to Old Shades Pier again—just before the boat came alongside again, Samuel put his hand into a lady's pocket, kept it there a short time, and took it out—he then went into the fore-cabin, came back, and passed something to Jane, who had stood about a yard off him when he did it—I spoke to the lady, seized Jane, and took from her hand five shillings, two sixpences, and one penny—Samuel escaped—I took him next morning near the station where Jane was—I told him the charge—he said he had not been on board any steam-boat, but had been at his mother's all day.</p>

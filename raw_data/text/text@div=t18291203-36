            . I live in Somersetshire, but I was staying at a house in Park-street. On the 11th of November, I had dined with a Mr. Saunders, and left his house about half-past eleven o'clock at night; I called a coach in St. Giles - I had eleven sovereigns, and two or three shillings in my pocket; I had a pair of silver spectacles in my waistcoat pocket - I told the driver, to drive to St. James'-street; I had drank pretty freely, and told the coachman I was intoxicated - he took me to <placeName id="t18291203-36-crimeloc195">Leicester-square</placeName>

               <p>COURT. Q.Can you say whether the prisoner was in the coach? A. I could not say whether any one was with me in the coach - I am certain my money was secure when I got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect being in Soho-square? A. I certainly was not; I had no female with me - I gave nobody money for particular purposes; I was not holding my hat in my hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. One of the females said, "You have not given me any money;" you felt your pocket, dropped your spectacles, and said, to me "You seem a respectable man, I wish you would see me home, and call a coach;" and I did. Witness; I deny it all - I called the coach myself; I had a watch, but I was not in Soho-square - I told the coachman to drive to where I stated; I do not know that it was in the way to go through Leicester-square - I did not propose to stop the coach, and say I would take you to an oyster-shop, and treat you; you were a stranger to me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did I not in Leicester-square offer to pay the coach, and then found I had no silver; the coachman said we were both strangers, and he wished us to have another coach - I said I would go to Mr. Percy's, and get change; the coachman was not satisfied with that, and I gave my watch, as security, and you asked me to go and have an oyster with you. Witness. I asked the coachman the fare, and he said 1s. - I put my hand into my pocket, missed my money, and took you by the collar; you could not have escaped while the officer was called - I have to regret I was asleep, or I should have put you or any man out of the window, who had come into the coach without my consent.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SAUNDERS. I am a portrait painter, and live in Edward-street, Portman-square; the prosecutor dined with me on the day in question - he left my house a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, and was drunk.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GREEN. I am a hackney coachman. On the morning of the 11th of November I was near St. Giles', at the end of Oxford-street, and took the prosecutor into my coach - he was very drunk; the prisoner was with him - the prosecutor told me to drive to St. James'-street; he said, "I am very drunk;" I said, "It is a dull heart that never rejoices;" I asked the prisoner if he knew the gentleman - he said Yes, and that he was going with him - he ordered me to go to Leicester-square; when I got to Leicester-place, the prisoner told me to turn to the left - I did so, and he told me to stop on the stand, and said, "D-n you, can't you hear?" I said, "I am on the stand;" I got down, went to the door, and to the best of my belief, by the voice, the prosecutor said, "Draw to the pavement;" I did so - the prisoner got out first, and the prosecutor next; I am sure the prisoner got in, and got out - the prosecutor asked the fare; I said 1s. - he put his hand to his waistcoat pockets, then in his trousers pockets, and said he had no money; the prisoner said, "Never mind, I will pay the coachman - you stop there;" he then took the prosecutor's arm, and said, "We will go and eat some oysters;" I said, "A shilling, is a shilling to me, and I don't know you;" the prisoner again said, "You stop there," and he gave me his watch to hold - they walked forward; I followed them for thirty or forty yards - the prosecutor then said he had been robbed by the prisoner or me - he laid hold of the prisoner; I said I will call the Police, which I did, and Slark came - I told him the number of my chariot; he said he was going to St. James' watch-house, and I followed them to the Quadrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your chariot when you were called? A. I was coming home down Oxford-street, near St. Giles' - I was coming to Eagle-street, where I live; the prosecutor and prisoner were standing together.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police, and am stationed in St. Martin's-street. I was called, and took the prisoner in Leicester-square; the prosecutor charged him with taking eleven sovereigns from him, but mentioned nothing else at that time: I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found on him nine sovereigns and these silver spectacles - I saw the prosecutor the next day, and he mentioned about his spectacles to the other officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I object to go with you? A. Yes; you wanted to go to a public-house - the prosecutor was very tipsy; I took hold of the prisoner's arm - he could not have thrown away the spectacles without my seeing him; I do not know whether he had time to have thrown them away before I came - I held him part of the way, when I saw he wanted to shuffle away; Bond and I searched him together - three sovereigns and the spectacles were found in his coat pocket behind.</p>

               <p>GEORGE GREEN. The coach was called about ten minutes after twelve.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

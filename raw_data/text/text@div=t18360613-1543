                  </hi>. I live with William Henry Langes, in Mount-street, he is a clerk. On the 19th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, a young man came and gave me a note to take to mistress, while I was cleaning the steps—I asked him if there was any name, because we have got lodgers—he said, "No, no name, it is only for Mrs., No. 11"—I took it up-stairs to a lady, leaving him on the steps, and when I came back he was gone—about ten minutes afterwards, I missed a clock which had hung in the passage—I had seen it there half an hour before—nobody else had been to the house—I saw the prisoner at the office a few days afterwards, and am sure he is the young man.</p>

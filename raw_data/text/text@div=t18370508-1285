On the 12th of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, my son was getting up, and opening the shop—the prisoner asked if I would buy two plated glasses and four cushions—I was putting on my stockings, and I called out, "Yes, I will; where are they?"—my son brought the glasses, and I said, "Where are the cushions?"—the prisoner said, "I have not brought them"—I said, "Bring them; if I buy one I will buy all"—he said he wanted 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I said, "Fetch the cushions"—he said, "You had better pay me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the glasses"—I said, "No; I shall keep them; fetch the cushions"—he went away—I made haste, and went to the policeman, and told him I had got some glasses, and the prisoner was gone to fetch the cushions—I saw the prisoner coming down High-street with the cushions—he saw me going to speak to the policeman, and went away—in ten minutes the policeman brought the cushions to me, and said, "Are these them?"—I said, "I suspect so"—the prisoner afterwards came to me for the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the glasses—I said he must go with me to the station—he made some objection, but at last he said that he had been sent by a person—I went with him to that person, who denied it altogether—I took him to the cock.</p>

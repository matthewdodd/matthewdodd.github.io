                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Baker Hockley; I am on a visit at No. 5, St. George's-square, Pimlico. On 18th Nov., about twenty minutes to nine o'clock in the morning, I was looking out of the window, and saw six men walking backwards and forwards in front of Mr. Moscrop's house, which is a private house, opposite; they appeared to be in deep con<lb></lb>sultation, and then two separated from the rest, and rung the bell at Mr. Moscrop's area gate; they stood a little while; there were no persons in the house, they had gone to the Duke of Wellington's funeral, I believe; nobody answered the bell, and the shortest of the men, I believe, unlocked the gate; they both entered and went into the area; they very soon returned, and locked the gate after them—they then went to the front door, which they forcibly opened; they appeared to use some instrument, and wrench it open, and then went in and closed the door—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards I saw one man, in dark clothes, on the roof of the house; he came and looked over—there were hundreds of persons at that time in pursuit of the thieves, but they could not get in at the door—to the best of my belief the prisoners are the men; I could not distinguish their features, but I believe them to be them by their figures.</p>

On 18th Nov., about half-past 8 o'clock, I was passing Mr. Moscrop's house, and saw two men talking together, and one a distance off—I went part of the way to Vauxhall-bridge, returned about a quarter to nine o'clock, and in consequence of something Mrs. Hockley said I went to No. 22, and found the front door had been broken open; a piece was broken off where the lock should go in, but it was bolted at the top—I called a watchman to assist me, and found the door and window fast—I tried the back door and window, and found them fast—I went to the yard for a ladder, and was gone perhaps two minutes; as I was coming back I saw Britton on the top of the house—I climbed up by way of the empty houses, went to No. 22, and found Britton standing on the roof in the gutter—I saw a gold watch, two keys, and other things in the gutter—I took Britton—as I went along with him I saw Mr. Cox in the road with the prisoner Baker.</p>

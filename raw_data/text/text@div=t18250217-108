            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 31st of January, at a quarter past six o'clock, I was in company with Avery, the conductor of the patrol in <placeName id="t18250217-108-crimeloc628">Holborn</placeName>

I saw some gentlemen coming out of Lincoln's-Inn-fields; the two prisoners followed them; they then went into Hand-court and into Fetter-lane. I saw Phillips take this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket. I crossed over to him, he put it under his coat. I said, "Give me the handkerchief." He took his hand away and it fell down. Dixie was then between two and three yards from him. While I was taking the handcaffs, and securing the prisoners, the gentleman got away. I ran after him down to Fleet-street, but could not find him.</p>

            . I was in company with Thompson, what he has stated is correct, respecting the boys, being in custody. I did not see Phillips take the handkerchief, but I saw Thompson cross a little before me. I had staid a little back, and Dixie looked me full in the face. I then crossed over after him, and took him. Thompson took Phillips.</p>

               <p>DIXIE'S Defence. I know nothing about it: I was a good way off at the time. I had spoken to the other prisoner in Hand-court.</p>

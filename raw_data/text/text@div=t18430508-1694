                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Monday morning, the 10th of April, about nine o'clock, I was going on duty on Southwark-bridge-road—I saw all the prisoners and one not in custody in company—the two females had something in both their aprons—I asked them what they had—they said, "Some work"—I asked where they got it from—Fuller said her sister was in the habit of taking out work from a slop-shop, and they were going to take it home to their sister—I asked what they had to do to them, or if they were finished—they could not tell me—I asked them to let me look at them, which I did, and asked where their sister lived—they said a little way along the street, that is Norfolk-street—I said I would go with them—the men went on, and when they found I detained the women they all three ran away—I took the women to the station—in a few minutes after the prosecutrix came to give information of her shop being broken open and property stolen—she claimed the property—I had seen the three men frequently before—I am sure White and Allison are two of them.</p>

We went and had three or four pots of beer together; they asked me to give them a breakfast, which I did, at eight o'clock. I then said, "I must go to my work." I had got a little way along Southwark-bridge-road, and saw them coming after me. I afterwards looked behind, and saw them with the policemen I met two strange men in the street; this was not one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones's Defence.</hi> On Sunday night a young woman who I knew asked me to mind the shirts for her; she must pawn them on Monday morning; she said she was taking them to her sister's; the policeman has told a great story.</p>

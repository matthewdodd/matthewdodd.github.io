When he came again I stopped him, and insisted on his telling me where he got it; he said he had it of one Jones, a pendant-maker, at the upper end of Wood's Close. He said he was a maker in the wholesale way, and sometimes he could not complete an order on a Saturday night, and then he sent a pendant to make a little money till his order was compleat. I was determined to go and know whether there was such a person, but at last he confessed he had a brother at Mr. Upjohn's, and that he had them of him. I had taken some of him before, which made me suspect, him. I had taken four gold and two silver pendants, and fifty-four watch dial plates of him at different times, between the 2d of October and the 7th of November, which he pledged in the name of

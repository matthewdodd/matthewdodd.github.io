                  </hi> I am a waiter at Randall's Commercial Lodgimhg-house, in King-street, Cheapside. On Sunday evening, the 15th of Aug., about a quarter to nine o'clock, I was at the back of Charing-cross barracks and</p>

               <p>met the prisoner—I had never seen him before—he spoke to me first, and said, "Halloa, how are you? how is George?"—I have a brother named George—he said, "Will you treat me to a glass of drink?"—I said I would—I went into a public-house and called for two glasses of rum—I paid for it, he drank one glass and I the other—I do not remember where that public-house was—it was near the park—I had walked for about three minutes with him—I was quite sober—we then went and bought two cigars at a cigars shop leading into Regent-street—we went to a public-house in Regent-street, in a turning leading out of Regent-street, and had a glass of rum and water which I paid for—we staid there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—we sat down there—we came out together we went to another public-house leading into the Haymarket, and had two more glasses of rum—I paid for them—I then told him I must go, and we walked to Charing-cross Hospital, to get an omnibus—he said, "Will you pay for me to go into the City, I am going there too"—I said, "I do not mind paying for you"—we got into a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. omnibus—I paid for both—we stopped opposite Bow church, and both got out there—I bid him good night at the corner—he followed me down there—I turned into watering-place—he followed me, laid hold of my shirt, and said, "I demand your scarf, and your pocket-handkerchief, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or transportation for life"—I told him I had not 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—I gave him three penny pieces which was all I had—he partly took my scarf off my neck, and I partly gave it to him—he could not untie it—he laid his hand on it while it was on my neck—it was tied in a knot, and he could not undo it—he said to me, "I cannot undo it, undo it"—I did undo it, and he took it off my neck—he took my pocket-hand kerchief out of my pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to let him do all this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the threat of trans<lb></lb>portatiion for life—I saw him next on the 8th of this month, I only had two words with him in the morning—I was in conversation with him in the even<lb></lb>ing when the policeman came up—I told him I should give him in charge, that he should have no more money out of me, and I was determined to come to an end with it—I gave him in charge to the policeman—he said, "For God's sake do not give me in charge, I will never trouble you again, shake hands and I will go"—when the policeman came up he said I owned him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had come for it.</p>

               <p>down there since to try and discover the public-house—it is on the left hand side of Regent-street going towards Piccadilly—from the Haymarket towards Regent's-park I call going up—the public-house was on the left hand side as we were, coming from Piccadilly up Regent-street—the cigar shop was at the corner of Marylebone-street I think, I am not certain of the name of the street, it is near Piccadilly—we were coming from the Quadrant towards Oxford-street, and the public-house was on the left hand side as we were going up Regent-street from the cigar shop—I do not recollect on which side of the street we were—the turning is about a quarter of a yard up Regent-street—we staid about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in the next public-house—we sat there—the prisoner was smoking his cigar—we had one glass of rum and water there—there were four gentlemen in the parlour there—a man brought the rum and water in—I do not know him—I had never seen him before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your conversation about all this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Our conversa<lb></lb>tion was more about Jenny Lind than anything else—I have been to hear Jenny Lind I think once—I paid 3 <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the gallery—I do not know whether the prisoner had been to hear her, I believe not—I did not ask him to go—I believe all our conversation was about Jenny Lind from the time of our meeting by the barracks till we got into the second public-house—I do not recollect anything else—after we left that public-house, we walked to Charing-cross Hospital—we went and had another glass of rum first in the Haymarket—I do not know what part of the Haymarket it was in, it was the lower part, on the Haymarket theatre side—I do not know whether there is more than one public-house on that side; I never counted them—we did not go up stairs there, we stood at the bar and had plain rum—we only had spirits three times—we had no ale or porter—I had not taken anything before I met the pri<lb></lb>soner that I am aware of—I had left my employer's house about six o'clock—I had been to church at the church against Trafalgar-square, St. Martin's, I believe it is called—I no not know who preached, nor what the text was, or the gospel for the day—there is evening service there I know, for I have been to it—I believe it commences about half-past seven—I had been there before—I do not know the person who preached there—the service is ge<lb></lb>nerally over by a quarter-past eight I believe, but I do not know exactly—I went to hear the sermon, and did hear what there was of it I suppose—I cannot tell what it was about—I did not notice what kind of clergyman it was who preached—I was very low down—there was no charity sermon—I had no money to give away—I do give money in charity—I got home about ten minutes past ten—I saw all my fellow-servants there, and a great num<lb></lb>ber of persons—I did not mention what had occurred.</p>

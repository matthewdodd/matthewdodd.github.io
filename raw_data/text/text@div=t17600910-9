               <p>John Shaw. The things mentioned in the indictment were lost from my house about the 20th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I found them again that day at 2 pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q What did you find, and where?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I found the black bonnet, my wife's apron, the table cloth, and a shirt of mine at Henry Day's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the other things?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I found them at Mr. Barnaby's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know where they were?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I found the prisoner at Pancras, and charg'd her with taking them; and she told me she had pawn'd them at them two places.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she come by them?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100008"></xptr>Shaw. She said she took them out of my house, and she designed to get a little money on them, and to get them again as soon as she could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner use to come to your house?</p>
               <p>Shaw. Yes, she did; and used to scower my pots sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I keep a public house; she was a sort of a chair-woman.</p>

On the 20th of October, late at night, I was locked out of my lodgings; I went into a public-house; I staid there until near two or three o'clock. I cannot say exactly.

            . I am a watchman of St. Paul's, Covent Garden. At three o'clock I heard the watchman call watch; I went to his assistance: he had hold of the prisoner by the tail of his coat; he said the prisoner had robbed him of his watch. I took him to the watchhouse; at the watchhouse he was searched, and the prosecutor's handkerchief was found in his pocket. In taking him to the watch-house, he threw something away. The prosecutor said it was his watch. After I had taken him to the watchhouse, I returned the way I came, and looked into all the areas; I could not find the watch. The prisoner and the prosecutor were both in the dark.</p>

            . I am the beadle; I was at the watchhouse; I searched the prisoner; I found this pocket-handkerchief on the prisoner; as soon as the prosecutor saw it, he said it was his. After we had locked the prisoner up, we went with a candle and lantern to look for the property, and returned with the watchmen to the place where the prosecutor was stopped. We found this pocket-book with four one-pound notes in it. We found no watch. We found these keys; they belong to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This handkerchief is mine, and they keys are mine, the pocket-book is mine; I had four one-pound notes; they are in it now.</p>

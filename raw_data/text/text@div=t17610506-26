I looked about me, and saw the prisoner at the bar within two or three yards of me, seemingly passing by me; I was the more suspicious of him, as his hand seemed to me to have something in it in his pocket. I went to him, and put my hand down by his right-hand, and drawed out my own handkerchief from the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Downes. I am, it was mine, it was marked D, Num. 6, I have half a dozen of the same kind. I got a constable, and gave him charge of the prisoner, and took him to justice Welch's. His worship was not in the way, but there was another magistrate, who committed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>Downes. He begged he might serve his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Thomas Freeman. I was along with Mr. Downes, going up Holbourn, near Staple's inn, Mr. Downes had hold on my shoulder, coming through the bar, there was a sort of a jostle, the prisoner went over the way with another man, leaning on his shoulder. Mr. Downes put his hand into his pocket, and said, he had lost his handkerchief; he stepped up to the prisoner, and I stepped close after him, he went to the prisoner's side, and pulled his handkerchief out of the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Freeman. The prisoner said, he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Was I before Mr. Downes or behind him, when you first saw me?</p>
               <p>Freeman. Before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner past by Mr. Downes?</p>
               <p>Freeman. He had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am very innocent of it, I never intended to rob the gentleman, no more than the farthest person in the world. I am a plaisterer by trade, and I was going to a gentleman that I worked for to get a job, I saw the handkerchief lie on the ground, there were two or three people just by it. I said, does this belong to you, they said no. I walked along with it in my hand, looking at it, then I put it into my pocket, I have a person here that saw me pick it up.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mary Sampson. Last Thursday se'ennight, I was going up Holbourn, I saw the prisoner at the bar pick up a handkerchief, to the best of my knowledge it was a red one; he offered it to a man and a woman, and asked them if it was theirs, they said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did he pick it up?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. It was beyond Holbourn-bars, towards St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. This was between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I deal in old cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I live in Rosemary-lane, and was going up that way about my business; I was desired to go and buy some goods in Long-acre, and I was told that he was committed to New-prison. He desired I would give him my name, and where I lived, I said I would, and would appear.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you saw him pick up a handkerchief was it, that you saw him again?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I saw him in custody about half an hour after I saw him pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him in custody?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. In Long-acre, I came out about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Holbourn was you coming from?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I was going streight up Holbourn hill beyond the bars on the right-hand side the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call any where before you saw the prisoner in Long-acre?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I called at two or three places, and made no other stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to, between your seeing him the second time?</p>
               <p>M. Sampsom. I was in Tyburn road, and in St. Giles's after that; I cannot be particular in every place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in custody, before he was at Mr. Welch's?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176105060057"></xptr>M. Sampson. No, it was after he came out at Mr. Welch's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near him when he pickt the handkerchief up?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I was close to him, I looked in his face when he pickt it up, and took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Have you the handkerchief here?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have, here it is, (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Sampson. Was it like this?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. It was much such a one as this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it before he took it up?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I did not see it, till I saw him stoop; after that I went about my business, and thought no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to buy it?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I did not, neither did the young man offer to sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. This was last Thursday was se'ennight.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go first when you went out of Holbourn?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I made the best of my way to Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go from Long-acre?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. From thence, after I spoke to him there, and said, I would appear on his trial, I went into Tyburn-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, go into Tyburn-road, before you went into Long-acre?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. I went immediately into Long-acre, only asked at several houses.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did these stops take up, did you go into any houses?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. No, It might be a minute at a place, I only asked if they had any thing in my way, nobody said yes; if they said no, I went immediately about by business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner going towards St. Giles's?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. He was going along I think towards St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What house in Long-acre did you go into?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. As I went along Long-acre, I saw a croud about the justice's door.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. He had a thickish coat, and a brown waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body along with him when he pickt up the handkerchief?</p>
               <p>M. Sampson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you remember seeing this woman by at that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do not remember seeing her near me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you missed your handkerchief, before you found it again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I no sooner missed it, but I took it out of the prisoner's pocket, in about half a minute's time.</p>
               <p>William Higgins. I have known the prisoner about 11 years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been intimate with him all the time?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I have been pretty intimate with him all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I never heard any harm by him, all the time I knew him, only following the trade of a plaisterer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any harm in that?</p>
               <p>Higgins. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him within this last year or two?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I have seen him a rope-making, when plaistering has been slack.</p>
               <p>John Shepherd. I have known the prisoner three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. What three or four years last past?</p>

               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Shepherd. I never heard no otherwise, but that he bore the character of a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did he follow?</p>
               <p>Shepherd. I knew he worked at rope-making, I have drank with him and seen him at work.</p>

               <p>Wood. He lived in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Hannah Stevens. I live in Lime-house, I have an estate, and the prisoner had done business upon it for me eight years almost.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he behaved?</p>
               <p>H. Stevens. I always found him very just and faithful, I have trusted him with money, and money's worth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176105060058"></xptr>Q. to Prosecutor. What time did you lose your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost it about 12 o'clock, and believe I had it again after I lost it in half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you made use of it last, before you missed it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No. I do not recollect I used it, from the time I set out from Holbourn bridge. It was one of the last things I did, to put a clean handkerchief in my pocket, before I set out, and I went directly up Holbourn-hill. I don't recollect that I stopped any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not stop?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not. I was rather in a hurry, and I missed my handkerchief after I was through the bars, and I took it from the prisoner at the end of Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you walked before you had your handkerchief again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I dont't imagine I had walked ten yards before I had it again. I had a suspicion from the hustle. Then the prisoner was passing by me. He seemed in a confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you through the bars when the hustle was?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was, and very near the end of Gray's-inn lane.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time of the hustle to the time you got your handkerchief again, how long might it be?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I think it could not be a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say he had offered it to any body?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he did not. If he had I certainly should have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Freeman. How near was the prisoner to you when you saw him first?</p>
               <p>Freeman. He was about three yards before us, when I first saw him going up Holbourn hill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I carried the handkerchief five or six yards in my hand, before I put it into my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How long was you going to Mr. Welch's.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had the prisoner by the collar. I had him to a constable's house at the Green gate, he was not at home; then I had him down Gray's-inn-lane, by the collar, to another constable. It might be about half an hour before I got to justice Welch's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did the constable live down the lane?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was rather below Gray's-inn-gate.</p>

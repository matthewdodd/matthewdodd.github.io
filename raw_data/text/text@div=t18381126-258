                  </hi>. I reside at No. 265, Kent-street, Surrey, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. I had a gelding safe on the 29th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, in Mr. Harris's stables opposite my house—I saw it safe between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon—the prisoner was my servant at the time, and had been so about three weeks—I did not give him authority to sell my horses—I had to go to Hackney, and he went with me to St. George's Church—I told him to go back and clean some bedsteads—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am the rector of St. Mary-le-Strand, and reside in chambers, at 1, New Inn, St. Clement Danes. On Tuesday evening, 5th Sept., before going to bed, I placed my gold watch on a watch-stand, on a little bracket, in my study—I had in a cupboard a deed-box, containing a cash-box, and an empty bill-case—I must have left my keys on my table, for I found them there next morning—in a money-box, on the cheffoneer I left three sovereigns, 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about sixteen sixpences, and about 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—the box was locked—I came down next morning, between five and six o'clock, and my watch was gone, and the gold and silver from the box; nothing but the pence remained—the box was locked, apparently as it had been the previous evening—the cash-box was gone—I found the outer-door unbolted inside—the prisoners were in the habit of coming to my chambers to see my housekeeper, who is their aunt, and has been with me twelve years—they have had an opportunity of seeing where I kept my money; they have seen me take money out to give to one of them.</p>

I have had charge of the prosecutor's chambers for twelve years—there was no other servant—the prisoners are my nephews, and have been in the habit of visiting me at Mr. Denham's—they have seen Mr. Denham take money out in my presence—on the 5th, Charles came to see me, about eight or half-past eight, and remained till ten o'clock—after he had been there a short time he asked me for the key of the water-closet—I heard a noise, as he was going out—it was dark, and I thought he could not</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 19, George-street, Blackfriars-road; my husband was Dr. Wood; he died at Christmas, 1850. I knew the pri<lb></lb>soner previously, and after my husband's death he called on me, commise<lb></lb>rated my situation, being without friends, and offered his services to befriend me in any way he possibly could, which I gladly accepted—I was entitled to 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a policy of insurance, which my husband had effected at Glas<lb></lb>gow—the prisoner received that for me; I authorized him to do so—my father was a member of a merchant's house at Glasgow, and I tried for an annuity of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the merchants' fund—I never exactly knew whether I was on the funds of that house, the prisoner told me at one time that I wife on, and at another time that I was off; but he enclosed me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the last quarter's money, and until then I never knew positively that I was on the house—I cannot say whether he has paid over the whole of that sum to me, for I never could get a reckoning with him—he has given me money in small sums from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot swear altogether what he has given me, but from 3rd Jan., 1852, down to 5th Oct., when he sent roe 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from the merchant's house, I have received of him 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the last money I received of him—I was also entitled to some pro<lb></lb>perty in Bishop-street, Glasgow; it was coming to me from my grandfather and father; I was unwilling to sell it, as I did not know whether my brother was dead, not having heard from him for three years—the prisoner seeing that I was in such poor circumstances said that if I would sell the property and purchase an annuity with it, it would add considerably to my small income—I told him I would not do so, as long as I did not know that my brother was dead; and some two or three months afterwards he sent me a little scrap of paper, in consequence of which I afterwards saw him, and he said I could now sell the property to purchase an annuity—that was the sense of what he said; I cannot exactly repeat the words—he said he saw a person in the Strand, who told him he saw my brother die in New York—I think he said that by word of mouth—I arranged with him to sell the property; he said the likeliest person to buy it would be the person who held two-thirds of it already, and he sent a note for me to go to his chambers one day to sign the deed of sale—I went to his chambers, signed some documents, and 214<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid over to me by the person who went away with the papers—after he went away I rolled up the money, and was putting it in my reticule to take it home, until he could look for an office for me to get the annuity—he said, "Oh, don't do that; it is very unsafe, you may either lose it, or the house may be on fire, or anybody might know you had so much money"—I said, "What shall I do with it?"—he said, "Put it into the bank;" he recommended the Commercial Bank; I went there with him, 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lodged there in the joint names of Wallace Harvey, and Cathe<lb></lb>rine Wood; and 1 kept 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my immediate use—he said it must be secure,</p>

               <p>because he could not take it out without my signature, and I could not take it out without his, and it would be my whole subsistence to depend on—when we came to the Temple gate we bid each other good bye, and he asked me for the loan of one sovereign, which I lent him—I gave the prisoner no authority to sign my name to any checks; I knew nothing of his withdraw<lb></lb>ing the money till I went to the Bank—the signature "Catherine Wood" to this check is not my writing; I never authorized the prisoner to sign my name to that check—this ft a good imitation of my writing—(<hi rend="italic">the check being read—dated "31st July</hi>, 1851—<hi rend="italic">Drawn on the Commercial Bank of London, in favour of ourselves or bearer for</hi> 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Signed, W.

My dear Mrs. Wood, I received your letter on Tuesday afternoon last, and would have left on Wednesday, had it not been that I thought by staying a day or two I should be able to settle your affairs. I have been sadly put about for the last two days, by Andrew Tennent having told me on Wednesday that he would be obliged to charge a professional account, for the business he and his brother has done for you and Dr. Wood. I told him that both from what he himself had told me previously, and from what Dr. Wood and you bad always under-Stood, nothing was to be charged for any business of the sort, and that it would be a cruel thing to deprive the widow of the slender means which were now left to her. I have consulted one of the chief writers here to day, and I have taken certain steps which will prevent Andrew Tennent from getting payment from the Insurance Company, of any money which he might charge in the way proposed. There is one thing which I advise should be done at once; with an authority from you I could get the Insurance Company or Dr. Mackenzie to make an advance of as much money as would enable you to pay the debts which are standing, owing to Mr. Self, Dr. Beattie, Mr. Griffiths, &amp;c., and if you would send me this authority by return of post <hi rend="italic">without fail</hi>, I would bring the money to London on Monday night. If you do not do this, I fear that Mr. Andrew Tennent, when I go away, will try some scheme or other to defraud you of some portion of the money; but if the Company first makes an advance to you of a portion of the money, then Tennent can do nothing. You had better ask a third of the reversion, namely, 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; for you will require something considerable to pay off the various sums you owe and have something remaining, and it is better to get as much as possible from the hands of the Company at once. As to myself, I will never charge you anything for any trouble I hare been at in doing anything for you; and I can assure you that everything which I have at any time done for your husband or yourself has been done out of the purest feelings for your welfare. I shall try and bring the title-deeds of the property in Anderston also with me. I can tell you you have no one here who would do anything for you but myself. I have got your name put on the Merchants' House list of applications for a pension, and I have got some of the first merchants here to speak for you, and you are certain of getting on, at the first meeting, on the 5th of March, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. I found it unnecessary to send you any papers with reference to it. I shall go to-morrow to Oswald-street to look after the old lady you mentioned. You must sign the enclosed, and forward it to me by return of post, <hi rend="italic">without fail</hi>, else I shall be obliged to leave this, without any money for you, and you will not get it yourself by writing.

                  </hi>. In 1846 I became housekeeper to Mr. Harvey—I had previously lived as cook and housekeeper in various families; in noble<lb></lb>men's families—I remember about 1849 Mr. Harvey becoming acquainted with Dr. and Mrs. Wood—I knew the habits of Dr. and Mrs. Wood as regards temperance—I knew Dr. Wood personally—I have frequently seen him—I have known Mrs. Wood from that time—I have seen them very frequently come in an intoxicated state to Mr. Harvey's, and likewise in Essex-street, Strand—I have repeatedly seen Mr. Harvey supply Dr. Wood with money and food in 1849; that was very frequent—the girl was employed to take it, but I frequently made the parcel up—I have only taken it myself on one occasion—I remember about a sum of money of about 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming to Mrs. Wood; I always understood it was 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Wood has spoken to me of Mr. Harvey's kindness to her—she told me that but for Mr. Harvey they would have been starved, and she particularly requested me to give her Mr. Harvey's mother's address, that she might write and say what a good son she had to keep them from starving, but I did not do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever had conversation with Mrs. Wood about some money that she had lent or advanced to Mr. Harvey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have; it was in the Temple—it was about three weeks after I went to Chiswick, which was on 9th May, 1851; it was about the commencement, or sometime in June; I cannot speak exactly to the date—she told me she had lent Mr. Harvey her money; that she had placed it in his hands to act as he thought proper with, and he was going to allow her 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as an annuity, and when he failed to do that he was to return her the 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nothing more passed at that time—she was always speaking of his kindness towards her, and so forth—the property she was entitled to was at Glasgow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember at any time being called by Mr. Harvey to witness any signature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do; that was in Weston-street—I know it was in March, and it was after Dr. Wood's funeral; and Mr. Harvey then went to Scotland—I perfectly recollect that it was in March, 1851—the young girl, my niece, and myself were called into the little back parlour—Mrs. Wood and Mr. Harvey were there—Mr. Harvey said, "I wish you, Mrs. Heffer<lb></lb>man, to be a witness to a transaction between Mrs. Wood and myself;" he then produced a letter, and wrote her name in it—he then wiped the pen, gave it into her hand, and said, "Now, Mrs. Wood, trace your name over what I have written"—she did so, observing to me at the time, "Mrs. Hefferman, the troubles I have had has made my hand shake so, and so nervous, that I cannot write;" and she said, "From this time I give all my affairs into Mr. Harvey's hands, as I consider it safer in his hands than in any one elses"—he then said, "Charlotte, you and your aunt are both wit<lb></lb>nesses to this."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time did you know whether Mrs. Wood had disposed of her property or no? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at the time that this paper came there—Mr. Harvey told me it came from a merchant's house in Glasgow—to the best of my knowledge the property was disposed of in July.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned just now, that in a conversation you had with Mrs. Wood in June about her property, that it was sold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I am not aware of, only she told me at one time she was going to sell it, and then she told me that she had disposed of her property, and that Mr. Harvey was paying her 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as an annuity—it was in June, 1851, that she first told me she was going to dispose of her property: and the property was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185212130036"></xptr>
               <p>disposed of in July, I know that—I heard of its being disposed of in July, and saw the money—I cannot recollect the exact date when she told me the property was sold, but I think it was about the second week in July—we remained at Chiswick nine months—we went in 1851, and left finally on 11th last July—I remember Mrs. Wood coming to Chiswick between May, 1851, and July, 1852, it was on a Sunday—the girl opened the gate—she said, "Charlotte, your long-expected visitor is come at last"—I was in the garden—I came and spoke to her; and she said to me, "Do you think, Mrs. Hefferman, that Mr. Harvey has plenty of money to day, for I want him to advance me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for a particular occasion I require it for, out of my annuity?"—those were the words as well as I can recollect—I lived in Weston-street at one time—that was before I went to Chiswick—Mrs. Wood has, to my knowledge, frequently come to Mr. Harvey to write letters for her; and she has frequently left letters and small packets, and said, "Ask Mr. Harvey to open these, and write letters for me in my name, as he has done before, and make them as much like a female hand as possible—I was not a witness on the occasion of her asking Mr. Harvey to sign a check upon Glynn's—the girl told me she was a witness—I have frequently seen Mr. Harvey give money before the death of Dr. Wood—he has left money with me to give him at his chambers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember a Captain White, from Leith, at any time calling at Mr. Harvey's, at Chiswick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do; he called and asked if Mr. Harvey was at home—Mr. Harvey was in town, but I expected him home early—he remained about an hour and a half, and, on leaving, he told me to say to Mr. Harvey that Captain White had called, that he had made all the inquiry he possibly could in the business that he wished, and the only information he could obtain was, that David Baine had left England, and gone to America, and that he was believed to be dead—I gave that message to Mr. Harvey; and he said, "Mr. David Baine was Mrs. Wood's brother"—this was about the middle of July, 1851, it was during the Exhibition—it was in July, I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you at any time seen this book; just look at it? (<hi rend="italic">Holding up the one shown to Mrs. Wood.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have; I know it from this distance well, it is a little book in which Mr. Harvey used to put down the amounts he gave to Mrs. Wood—I cannot tell when I first saw that book, for I have seen it so frequently in his hands; and when he used to send the girl with money, he used to be putting down the sums—I could not swear that I ever saw it before Dr. Wood's death, but I think I did—I frequently saw it after his death—I have seen it from time to time in the prisoner's hands—I have seen him and Mrs. Wood in the room, and this book on the table, when they have been speaking—I have seen that on several occasions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you happen to know where this man has been living since last July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not; I only know that he has had lodgings, but I never was at his lodgings—I was his housekeeper and servant during all the time—some part of the time between July and his being taken into custody he was in the Temple—I went to see him in the Temple—the last time I went to see him in the Temple was last July—that was the last time I know of his being in the Temple, and just the first week in August—he was living in town during August and September, except one week that he was in the country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he was in town, do you know where he was lodging? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, Sir, the fact is, I never was at his lodging—he told me he was lodging near Bond-street at first, and afterwards that he had taken a lodging in Catherine-street, Strand, but I never was there.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185212130037"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he living with you in Apollo-court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; he was never living at my house there—he was not in the habit of coming there every day—he was not lodging in such a place as that—he did not come there every day, but he would come almost every day, or every second day—I had not seen him for three days before he was taken into custody until that morning—he used to come to give me money to get food with—he used to come every day, or every second day, up to the time he was taken iuto custody, except the time he was out of town—he came up to the time he was taken into custody—Apollo-court is a very short distance from Middle Temple-lane, just opposite—my niece was in the constant habit of going from Apollo-court to the Temple, every day, for letters—sometimes she brought them to him there; and sometimes he would say, "Charlotte, go and get my letters, and meet me with them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many times has Mrs. Wood applied to you for the prisoner's address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For his address, Sir? I can only say she never asked me for his address, she always knew where to find him; it was for his mother's address she asked me; she never asked me for his address, that I can swear—I refused to give her his mother's address; I never refused to give her his address—I refused the mother's address without the sanction of Mr. Harvey—I told him of it afterwards, and he said I did right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said you are his housekeeper and servant; when did you last receive any wages from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, that was a matter I always trusted to Mr. Harvey—he has given me money as I have required it, to purchase clothing, but I always believed in Mr. Harvey's honesty of intention towards me, that when he got on in his profession he would pay me for all—I was constantly in the habit of receiving money from him for clothing and food, up to the very morning he was taken—I have never had any regular wages from him—I have received some pounds from him; I always left it in his hands—it was an understood thing; I was not pressed for money exactly—I received some money from him on the very day before he was taken into custody; that was for food and clothing—I have received pounds and pounds from him, in the course of six years—I have not been in the habit of lending him money lately; not within the last six or nine months—I have not had it in my power, if I had, if it was thousands, I would have lent it to him or given it to him—I have not lent him money within the last twelve months—I have applied to him for money within that time, when I required it—I repeat the answer, that if I had thousands I would lend it to him, or give it to him, if I had it at this moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, have you not accused him of ruining you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, never!—ruining me! never.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Answer, yes or no—Have you never accused him of ruining you by his drunkenness and extravagance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh! words which might have been spoken when there was words between me and the girl, and he took her part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The question is, Did you ever say so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might possibly—I am of a warm disposition, and I might have said it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You might have said that he had ruined you by his drunkenness and extravagance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have said such a thing; I do not always stand upon what I say when I am warm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you charge him with breaking your bonnet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, that is nothing; perhaps I might have made a claim upon him for breaking my bonnet and knocking me down—it was my fault; the young girl was impudent to me, and Mr. Harvey came in at the time; I obstructed his passing out,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185212130038"></xptr>
               <p>and he pushed me; I deserved it, I know—I swear positively that was the occasion of it—the policeman asked me some questions, and if he is in Court he can tell you the same; there he is, I know him—I told him that I obstructed Mr. Harvey's going out—I had no black eye; it was merely a push he gave me; I told the policeman I had had a push—when he asked me who gave me the black eye I told him that I had obstructed Mr. Harvey in going out at the door, and he pushed me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say anything about your refusal to sign papers for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To sign papers for him?—well, let me recollect, do not be in such a hurry; you ask me so many questions—yes, yes; I know perfectly—I will answer you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell the policeman that it was because you refused to sign a paper for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was just that—I offended him, because he made out a lot of scribbling papers and said, "Sign this" and I said, "No, I will sign no such stuff, put it in the fire"—it is possible I might tell the police<lb></lb>man that—I did not tell him that was the reason I was struck, and my bonnet broken—I certainly did not tell the policeman that the reason why I had been assaulted and my eye blackened, and my bonnet broken, was because I had refused to sign some papers which the prisoner wished me to sign—I could not say such a thing—the night before this occurred he pushed me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean, then, by saying just now that there was a parcel of papers which you would not sign? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I say a few—nothing but papers of our own; it was wages and his own affairs, and he was writing all this stuff down, and I accused him of cruelty—I was certainly angry, because he pushed me—I refused to sign a paper about my wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let me understand—Were you asked by him to sign a paper about your wages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was, and I refused to sign it—it was not then that he struck me; that occurred the night before; he did not strike me, he pushed me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

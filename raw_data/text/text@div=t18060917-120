               <p>Q. Are you a married man. - A. My wife is dead two years back, I was not at home when my child was taken away and stripped; I left the child (she is three years old) in the care of another girl of mine about twelve years old, it is about eight or nine weeks back, on a Monday, I cannot recollect what day of the month it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home you was informed the child was stripped. - A. Yes, the next day when the prisoner was in custody, I was sent for to swear to my property.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home at night did you perceive that any of your child's clothes were gone. - A. Yes, I missed the frock and petticoat; she left her under petticoat on her shift and shoes, and that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170073"></xptr>was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the gown and petticoat when the woman was under examination. - A. I did.</p>

             sworn. I live in Rosemary lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Timothy Lane's child. - A. Yes, she is a little girl of three years of age; the prisoner passed me at the corner of my court, where I sit selling my fruit; she had the child, she asked me who owned the child, I said Timothy Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, and tell me whether you are certain she is the woman. - A. I think she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Go up close to her, is that the woman. - A. I partly guess it is, I cannot rightly say, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no suspicion of her at that time. - A. No. In about an hour after I saw people coming and looking for the child, I described the woman, and told them I saw the child with her; the child was found again the same afternoon. I saw the child again, it had only a little smock and linsey petticoat on then, it was about two hours after I saw the child with the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this woman again when she was before the justice. - A. I do not know whether it is the same woman, she is altered very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman who was taken before the justice for stripping the child. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her to be the woman that laid hold of the child in the morning. - A. That it was, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. But you say the person at the bar, if she is the person, is very much altered. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the woman you saw before the justice upon that charge, was the same woman that took the child. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I do, I am positive of her. On Monday the 21st of July, about six o'clock in the afternoon, she pawned a child's frock and petticoat for eighteen pence, she asked half a crown, she went out of the shop and returned again in about ten minutes, I saw her twice, I have not the least doubt she is the woman. I produce the property, I have had them ever since I saw her in Lambeth street office on the 22d.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Lambeth street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend this woman. - A. She is so altered, I cannot hardly speak to the woman, I hardly recollect her; when I apprehended her, it was about six or seven o'clock in the evening, she was so deplorable in dress she was nothing but rags, she was as black as a sweep; I believe her to be the woman that I took up, she was pointed out to me, she was laying drunk in a room in a court in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Carrol) What sort of a woman was it you saw with a child. - A. She way very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day was it. - A.Between four and five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be sober at the time she laid hold of the child. - A. Quite sober and sensible as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Burton) What was the appearance of the woman when she came to your shop. - A. She was quite dirty and black when she pawned these things, and at the time she pawned these things she was quite sober; she went and got drunk with the money that she got for these things. I am certain that she is the person.</p>
               <p>Griffiths. I have not the least doubt of her now I look at her face particularly.</p>

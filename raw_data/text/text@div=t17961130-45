            That was not the lace she was bargaining for? - A. No; they were both on the counter at the time she was there, she had been looking at them; seeing her run to the door, and open it with her right-hand, I had suspicions; I ran from behind the counter and caught hold of her shoulders before she got out of the shop, I pushed her to the farther end of the shop; then I perceived her, with her left-hand, throw something away which was white; I returned to the door, and on the threshold, I picked up the remnant of lace, and on the step of the door, the cap.</p>
               <p>Q. When she threw away something with her left-hand was that in the direction to the door? - A. Yes; she threw it out as if she meant to throw it on the threshold; I talked to her, and was very much vexed; I detained her and had her committed; I took up the lace and the cap, I have kept it ever since; the lace is worth fifteen shillings, I gave that for it; the articles are both as good as when I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time her hand was leaning on the place, did you perceive her taking any thing? - A. I saw it by her hand, I thought she was pregnant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive, by the motion of her hand, that she was taking any thing? - A. She was only leaning on her arm, there was nobody but her and me in the shop, it was between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, she gave no account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing about it by which you know it? - A. Yes, the quantity of it; I had cut some off that morning, I know it by the figure and the flower that leads from one to the other; I know the cap to be my property by the work, the spot, and the size, I bought it about three weeks ago, and pinned it up in the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Edward Clifton Carne, as merchants at Falmouth; we are agents to the Brazilian Com<lb></lb>pany. On the 18th of March last year, the <hi rend="italic">Sea Gull</hi> packet arrived at Falmouth from the Brazils—two boxes of gold dust were consigned to us by that packet—I never saw the contents—I saw the boxes, they were marked B. C. 18, B. C. 19—they were seventeen or eighteen inches square, and made of wood, fastened together with nails—there was no cord round them—they were sealed with red wax—I observed that they were nailed, which is not a usual thing with the Brazil boxes—they were al<lb></lb>ways screwed previous to that—those two boxes were shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> steamer, for London, by my directions—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the paper marked</hi> No. 1)—this is the bill of lading, referring to them—they were consigned to the Brazilian Company, at the Bank of England—Messrs. Hartley and Co. are the agents for the steam packet company that the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> belongs to—we transmitted in the usual course of business a copy of the ship's manifest of the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> to Messrs. Hartley and Co.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at</hi> No. 2)—I forwarded it by post on the 23rd of March—it would arrive in London on Monday morning, the 25th—the postage from Falmouth was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time—it is addressed to James Hartley and Co., John-street, Crutchedfrairs, and bears the London post-mark of 25th March—(<hi rend="italic">The following extract was read from the manifest.—"Consignees, Brazilian Company—where for—Bank of England, B.

                  </hi>. I am captain of the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi>—I was on board when she came from Falmouth on the 22nd of March—I remember receiving on board from Messrs.

Hartley and Co.'s office, on the wharf, as near as I can calculate about ten o'clock—the wharf is close to the Tower—between the Tower and St. Katherine's dock—I then went to the counting-house of Hartley and Co, in John-street, and saw the prisoner attending there as Mr. Hartley's clerk—I told him I had landed the boxes of specie at the wharf—he said he would go down and attend to it himself—the boxes were in the same state when I took them there as when I received them—they were marked "B C 18 and 19."</p>

Hartley's clerks—I was on a friendly footing with most of them—the other clerks were in the habit of frequently coming on board when the ship arrived—he did not make any inquiry as to what I had on board—to the best of my knowledge I did not tell him—I might have said I had specie on board, but I think not—he came into the cabin to me—the boxes were in the room under the cabin—I never mentioned any thing to him about the specie, to the best of my knowledge—I might have said I had specie on board, but I cannot charge my memory—he might have remained down in the cabin twenty minutes—I was taking refreshment—he came down, and might have stopped twenty minutes, bid me good day, and went away—I did not see him alter he went on deck—he was the only per<lb></lb>son connected with Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe you told him you were going to take the specie on shore in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I really believe, to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge, I never mentioned to him, in any way, about specie being on board—I believe I did not mention any thing about the boxes—I cannot swear it—the first time I saw the prisoner on the subject, was on Monday morning at the office in Crutched-friars—I have not seen Allen lately—I believe the last time I saw him was the latter part of April—it was the second voyage after the robbery—I saw him in the office at John-street, and have never seen him since—I have heard that he left Mr. Hartley's employment very suddenly.</p>

C. Carne" is not mine, nor "boxes shipped by us marked B. C. 18 and 19"—"Mr. Bristow, please deliver above, Messrs.

Messrs. Carne have advised me about them.—L. <hi rend="smallCaps">CASPAR</hi>," was written by the prisoner while I was in the room—this is the letter, part of which I had previously written at his request—he then gave me the letter to go to the wharf—he wrote the direction of the wharf I think on another part of the letter—here it is on the back, "Inquire for Mr. Bris<lb></lb>tow, Dublin Steam Wharf, Irongate"—he told me to go to the wharf, and get these things, and he should be there as soon as me—he told me I should have to give an acknowledgment on the letter, and told me not to write my own name, and told me some name that I was to write, but which I forgot in the interval while I had been about my own business—it was in Bread-street that I was to deliver my master's goods—I went there, and from there to the wharf—I got into another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to go there—I discharged the first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> somewhere by the Globe Insurance Office—I can<lb></lb>not precisely recollect where I took the other, but it was close on the same spot—I went to the wharf, and inquired for Mr. Hartley—I think one of the porters came to me, or somebody about the office—I afterwards saw Mr. Bristow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you inquire for Mr. Hartley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought probably he might be at that place, though not at the other, as the clerk who first came out at John-street, said, "Mr. Hartley is not here, but the agent is"—I was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when Mr. Bristow came out to me—I gave him the order the prisoner had given me—MR.

Bristow said, "These are the boxes, will you take them with you?"—the porter placed them in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I came by, by Mr. Bristow's desire, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then wrote this receipt on the letter, and left the letter with Mr. Bristow—I put one of the boxes into the blue bag, which Ellis Caspar had given me—it was not large enough to hold both—I was desired to meet Ellis Caspar in Wood-street—I went there in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> but he was not there when I got there—I went to the Cross Keys public-house, Wood-street—the boxes were taken out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> by one of the porters there, without being directed to do so, and put on the counter, supposing I was going by one of the coaches—not finding Ellis Caspar there, I wanted to get a cord to tie the boxes together to carry them, but could not get one—I got another <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> put them in, and drove to my own home near the London Hospital with them—I drove to the London Hospital, Mile End-road, near the corner of Turner-street—the man by mistake drove me past the turning at which I intended to get out, which was the corner of Turner-street, and took me to the next street, which is at the corner of the hospital—I then took out one of the boxes, and went home with it to No. 12, New-street, and left the other one in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I put it in my bed-room—I came out with intent to fetch the other, and met Ellis Caspar in the street—I told what I had done with one box, and where the other was—in consequence of what he said to me, I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, and was driven to the Commercial-road, merely to delay the time—that was in a direction from my house—it was to avoid my own house—the box was still in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> then—I ultimately took the second box to my house—I had at that time a servant named Jane Bradley—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the end of Commercial-road, discharged the man, and returned by the omnibus—I got home about eight or half-past eight o'clock—I had tea, and went to the Earl St. Vincent public-house, which is in the neighbourhood—Jane Bradley fetched me from there—on going home I found Ellis Caspar waiting in the front parlour for me—I had a conversation with Ellis Caspar about the boxes, and he then told me what they contained—the servant did not sleep at the house—she went home after some time—it was very late before Ellis Caspar went—I sent the girl home some hours before he went away, rather before the usual time, by Ellis Caspar's desire—I desired my wife to send her away—there was a fire in my back parlour—I went up into my bed-room with Ellis Caspar, and showed him the boxes—they were taken down stairs to the back par<lb></lb>lour—there were seals on all four sides of each of the boxes—Ellis Caspar put the lid of one box on the fire—I lent him a chisel to get the cover off, that was the wooden cover, they were secured by nails merely as a packing<lb></lb>case—after that box was opened there was a tin box enclosed—there was a quantity of hay between the wood and the tin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the box broken for at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was by desire of Ellis Caspar to divide the contents into smaller portions—the tin box was consider<lb></lb>ably smaller than the wooden one—upon finding that, the contents were not divided—there seemed then to be no necessity for it—the other box was opened in the same way—the outside cases of both were burnt, every mor<lb></lb>sel,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020103"></xptr>
               <p>and the hay Ellis Caspar took away in his handkerchief—he went away before the boxes were quite burnt, and after he was gone 1 took the tin boxes up into my bed-room again—as near as I can recollect, they were about as large as three of those octavo books, (<hi rend="italic">pointing to them</hi>) and about six' or eight inches long—I opened one of the tin boxes—it contained lumps of apparently ore of various colours—they had no appearance of gold—I had never seen gold in that state before—the sizes varied very much, some were larger than others—the largest was not larger than a child's fist, or a moderate sized orange—I placed the boxes in my bed-room that night, put them in brown paper, and tied them round with packthread, to make them appear as parcels—next morning I put them into separate trunks, one into a black leather trunk of my own, and the other into a wooden trunk of my daughter's which had no lock on it—I corded it—the following morning I seat my wife to hire apartments—that was in consequence of what passed between me and Ellis Caspar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, where were the tin boxes with the ere in them afterwards taken to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To Mansel-street, by my directions, and from thence by my sister—they were afterwards taken, I believe, to Petticoat-lane, and from thence the ore was brought to me at Oxendon-street, where I was then concealed—I had not the boxes at Oxendon-street—the ore was taken out of the boxes before it was brought to me—the last time I saw the tin boxes was at my place in Mansel-street—it was to Davis's house in Oxendon-street that I went.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What became of you after this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to Brentford for two days, and afterwards to Peckham, to Fishwick's—I never saw the prisoner after that—I remained at Fishwick's a fortnight, and then surrendered to the officer—I supplied myself with the lodging at Fishwick's—I saw no<lb></lb>thing of the prisoner at Davis's house—I did not take the ore to Davis's—it was brought to me out of the boxes—I desired Davis to go for it to my sister's, in Petticoat-lane—I told him they were there, and he said he should fetch them—I delivered up some money to the officers when I surrendered—I received that money from Davis—it was notes—I. think it was 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many different statements have you made as to the part you took in this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never made but one myself—the statement made before was made for me, and not by me—the first statement, which was false, was suggested to me by Davis and Mrs. Abrahams, when they visited me at Peckham—that statement was taken down in writing—I wrote part of it myself, and gave it to Davis—I had some conversation with Davis while I was writing it—Davis dictated to me what I should write—Lewin Caspar's name must have been mentioned in the course of that conversation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you have been very much surprised to find you committed a felony by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a surprise at first—I have not got over it now, I shall never get over it, my feelings are too much hurt by it—I wore the same coat I Have on now when I went to the office—I was dressed very similar to what I am now—my whiskers were in just the same state—I never saw the prisoner after that day that I saw him at the office, except in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know Allen, a clerk at! Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a messenger at Mr. Hartley's office is John-street. On the 25th of March I saw the witness John Vince with the <hi rend="italic">city of Limerick's</hi> ship's box, containing the papers—I saw him lay it on the wash-band-stand—I saw the prisoner that morning about eight o'clock—he just walked through the warehouse into his own office as I supposed, and went out again, saying he would be in in a short time—I received the ship's box while he was out—he came back and opened the box as it stood there, and took papers out—he generally came to the office about nine o'clock, but this morning he came about eight—it might be a few minutes sooner or later—I went for the letters that morning to a receiving house in the Minorie s, and got the letters, which I brought to the office and delivered to the clerk, William Blundell, who took an account of them, about twenty minutes or a quarter to ten o'clock—he remained in the office, and took an account of the letters—the prisoner was standing at his desk at the same time, and took part of the letters out of Blundell's hands—I then went to breakfast—both the prisoner and Blundell stretched out their hands at the same time to receive the letters, but I gave then to Blundell, and he opened them—they were tied in a string—he was commencing to take the account, and while he was doing so, the prisoner took part of them—I went to breakfast, leaving Blundell taking the account—I returned at near ten o'clock, and met the prisoner coming down stairs—he sent me down to the wharf with a letter to give to Mr. Bristow, the wharfinger, and told me to tell Mr. Bristow, or any of the clerks there, not to let any of the specie off the wharf till he himself came down—I went to the wharf but did not see Mr. Bristow—I saw Feltham and the foreman of the wharf, and deli<lb></lb>vered the message—I then returned to the prisoner—I was sent down to the wharf again—I then saw Mr. Bristow at the wharf, and delivered the former message to him—I then returned to the prisoner, and found Moss—(<hi rend="italic">looking at him</hi>)—with him in the prisoner's office, which was the back room—they did not remain many minutes after I came in—they both walked out of the back office through the warehouse, and went out—Moss got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner remained behind, shut the door, and went to his room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it not a common thing to send you down to the</p>

               <p>wharf with a message? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, every day—I am there for the purpose—I am not aware that he ever sent me with such a message before, not to let things go till he came—his orders were generally in writing, sometimes verbal—he has not sent me with such messages before to my knowledge—I will not swear he has not—he was there about eight o'clock that morning, a few minutes before or after—it was before I had any thing but the office open and the floor sprinkled to be swept—seven o'clock is the hour it opens—I will swear he was there before nine o'clock that morning—there is a time-piece in the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the earliest hour you have known him at the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen him between seven and eight o'clock when a vessel has been sailing at six o'clock, but that was very seldom—I believe he has sometimes slept on board a vessel on such occasions, as I have taken notes to his mother's house on those occasions—I cannot say he slept on board—I have heard so—he had his breakfast at the office those mornings—he might have had his breakfast at the office on other mornings besides those on which vessels sailed; but put it altogether I do not suppose I have brought him half a dozen breakfasts since I have been there—I cannot say whether they were all shipping mornings—I have been nearly eight years in the employ—I should say the prisoner has been in the office between two and three years, but at the time he joined the concern I belonged to the west-end office—I should say we have both been in the same office about two years—I am not aware that—he has breakfasted there with Mr. Hartley—he might—MR. Hartley did sleep there sometimes—I have not teen the pri<lb></lb>soner breakfast with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who else was at the office that morning at eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The next clerk that came was Allen—he came about half-past eight, as near as I can say—and another came, I should say, at nine o'clock—I believe that was Mr. Blundell, but I had gone for the letters about a quarter before nine, as there was a clerk in the place—it was a grocer's shop where I went to for the letters—the people generally meet there to get their letters—Moss is the person who came to the office that morning—I persist in swearing that—I gave a description of the person on the last trial—I dare say I stated-then that the man had sandy whiskers—I did—I said large bushy whiskers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you call Moss a person with large bushy sandy whiskers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly not at present—his whiskers are not in the same state as they were when he came to the office—I believe I described his whiskers as meeting close to the chin—to the best of my opinion they were false—they were never the natural growth of his face—they were sandy at that time, to the best of my opinion—I am not aware that I gave that description to Roe and Lea—when brought to Lambeth-street I described them as I have now—I do not call them sandy now—I am not aware that I gave a description of the man to Roe and Lea—I will not swear that I did—I did not, to my knowledge, swear on the last trial that I had given a description to one of the officers—to the best of my opinion, I did not—I am not aware that I gave that description to one of the officers, but I will not swear to any thing I am not conscious of—I did not, to my knowledge, give any such description either to Roe or Lea—I cannot answer in any other way—I cannot say what age the man who came to the office appeared to be—he seemed to me to be a middle-aged man, a man that had a halt in his walk—as he walked out of the warehouse he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020109"></xptr>
               <p>appeared lame—he walked in that way—I might have said, he appeared to be a man about sixty years of age—I do not think I said sixty on the last trial—it is so long ago I might be wrong if I swore I did not—to the best of my opinion, I did not—I never, to my knowledge, described the man as appearing about sixty years of age—I only swear to the best of my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he appear about sixty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He walked with his bead down—it is hard to describe what age he might be—I took him to be in the middle age of life—I should say fifty was nearer the mark—when a man is sixty he is going down hill—I did not take notice whether Allen was in the office or not at the time the man came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after the robbery did Allen leave Mr. Hartley's office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my opinion, he left on Whit-Monday, seven weeks after the robbery—I might have said on the last trial that he left a fortnight or three weeks after the robbery, but I have found out since if I did say so I have said wrong—I remember seeing Moss in custody at Lambeth-street—I do not know when Moss was first taken, but I know Allen was in Mr. Hartley's employ, and left about Whit-Monday—I should say Moss had been examined before that—Allen did live in Commercial-road, but I ra<lb></lb>ther think, about the time of the robbery he lived in a street opposite the wharf, Burr-street or something—I cannot say when he moved there—I do not know what has become of him—I have not heard whether he is living or dead—I should say he left the office very suddenly—he was at business the Saturday before, and did not make his appearance on Monday—I have stated that he eloped—those were the words I made use of—I did not notice whether the man who came to the office had a velvet collar to his coat or not, at the time I saw Moss first he was leaning both his arms on the desk—I had only a side-glance at him—I have not described him as having a velvet collar, to my knowledge—the prisoner superintended the business when Mr. Hartley was out of town—as far as I have seen, he appeared very zealous and industrious—I de<lb></lb>scribed the man as between five feet eight and nine—I never described him as six feet high.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are not sure whether Allen was in the office when Most came; can you say whether you are sure that Most was with Allen or with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I swear the prisoner and Moss were both together, and Moss took the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and the prisoner waved, his hand to him—I am positive Moss is the man.</p>

On the 25th of March I was a clerk in Mr. Hartley's office—I was in the counting-house that morning, when the General Post letters were delivered—the prisoner was there—I received the letters a little before ten o'clock from Mitchell—I keep a book, in which I enter the account of postage—I have it with me now—I made an entry that morning in the book, and altered it after I made it—the first entry was one Falmouth, two Plymouth, and four Dublin letters, which, according to my reckoning, came to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner took part of the letters from me, opened them, and returned them to me, and when he returned them to me there were two Falmouth letters—the postage of a</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you received the letters back from Caspar, and saw two Fal<lb></lb>mouth letters instead of one, did you mention it to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. difference in the postage—I did not make any observation about the difference in the letters—I did not tell him there was one Fal<lb></lb>mouth letter more than I had given to him—I did not think it was requi<lb></lb>site—I immediately made the alteration—he did not say any thing parti<lb></lb>cular when I told him there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. difference in the letters—he had nothing to do with the payment of the pottage, any more than to see that it was correct—I went to the office at nine o'clock that morning—several of the clerks were there when I got there—I believe Francis Allen was there—Mitchell had gone for the letters—I paid the postman, at the end of the week, 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that morning.</p>

Carne correcting errors made in previous communications—that has sometimes happened—I do not know that it has not frequently happened—I have not been in the habit of reading the letters—I have heard of such things in the office—I think Allen was in the office when I got there that morning—I cannot say positively—he remained in the office six or seven weeks I think afterwards—I do not exactly remember the time Moss was taken into custody—I do not know that Allen went off very suddenly—I know it was talked of that be ran away, that be went away—I think Moss was taken about four or five weeks afterwards—I do not remember whether it was about the same time that Allen left—I believe it was—I do not know that Allen has run away to America—I do not know whether he it living or dead—I have not heard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But could not any other clerk in the office, if so disposed, read any of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because they were always looked up, I believe—I dare say I could have read them if they were lying about—I cannot say where the keys were kept, unless Caspar kept them—I am not aware that they hung up in the office—I never knew of their being kept in the office—Allen was collecting clerk—he was occasionally in the habit of going on board steam-vessels, and to the wharf—there are two cupboards in the office, in which boxes of letters were kept—letters received in the morning from correspondents would be put in the cupboard—it was not locked'—I believe any clerk in the office could have gone and looked at them—I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not matter of public talk and notoriety that Allen had run away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—it was talked of in the office that he had gone away, and had not been seen since, but not that he had run away—I am not aware that any inquiries have been made about him—I have never seen him since.</p>

Came correcting communications of the delivery of goods—Cas<lb></lb>par would know that, and would know how the absence of goods might be accounted for—I did not get to the office till nine o'clock—whether Caspar was there before that, or what he had been doing between eight and nine o'clock, I do not know—at the time I spoke to Caspar about the postage, I had no idea that one of those letters was a forgery, nor that the post-mark had been forged, or that any fraud had been committed or contemplated—I supposed it was a mistake of my own, and altered it—Allen went away about six or seven weeks after this transaction—I do not know when Moss was taken.</p>

Bristow told me to put those boxes into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> which I did—they were marked "B.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the prisoner, in the absence of Mr. Hartley, generally very much engaged in business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not consider that he had any time to throw away—I did not consider it extraordinary that he should go away after waiting half-an-hour—he had the whole business to attend to in Mr. Hartley's absence—I first heard there had been a robbery about two o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner was not the first person to tell me—Kingston did—I saw the prisoner about three o'clock in the afternoon, he then told me of it—I was examined at Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From first to last did not the prisoner evince every anxiety to exert himself to the utmost to discover the perpetrators of the robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He certainly appeared very much excited about it—he expressed himself anxious that the perpetrators should be brought to justice—he never ab<lb></lb>sented himself from the office to my knowledge—I have known him about four years—I never heard any thing but the highest character of him—he was always considered clever in business—I do not know that mistakes were occasionally made at the office—my duty is at the wharf—I have known some packages over, which were not in the manifest, and some packages in the manifest, not in the vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In different matters were there not mistakes occurring almost every day of some sort or other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might be slight errors—I never heard of any serious ones—I was shown this letter (No. 4) by the prisoner, in Lea's presence, on the afternoon the robbery was committed—I be<lb></lb>lieved the signature of Messrs. Came to it, to be genuine—I have seen Messrs. Carne's signature occasionally, and believed it to be genuine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known the prisoner very often at the wharf early of a morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not very early—I have seen him there at eight o'clock when he had occasion to go on board a vessel that was going to sail, but not on other occasions—I never recollect it—I will undertake to say I never did see him unless a vessel was sailing—I have seen him at the office as early as eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the sort of direction the prisoner would write as an order to deliver goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when he had occasion to do so—I should have delivered a package without the order under it, but not such valuable property—if I saw the letter, believing it to be' signed by Messrs. Carne, I should have delivered it—believing it to be genuine, I should have delivered the goods—I knew Allen—I did not see him at the wharf that day, I am certain—he might be at the wharf once or twice a week—I remem<lb></lb>ber his leaving suddenly—I do not know why he left, nor whether he is living or dead—I have never seen him since—I have never had any doubt about Moss being the person who came to the wharf—I did not hear Mitchell describe him—I remember bills being put up advertising the rob<lb></lb>bery—communications from Falmouth of consignments would be by post advising of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did such advice generally arrive the day before the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depended on the passage the vessel had—this vessel left, I think, in time to be up on Sunday, but the letters could not be delivered until Monday—nobody in Mr. Hartley's establishment could know that the gold was com<lb></lb>ing—the writing of this letter, (No. 4,) is different to any writing I ever saw from Messrs. Carne's office, except the signature—it is very different to the prisoner's hand-writing—I should not consider any part of it like his, except the order and endorsement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant to the Brazilian Company. I went to the office of the Company on the 25th of March, about ten o'clock—no boxes of gold dust marked B C 18 and 19 arrived at the office—we ex<lb></lb>pected such boxes—William March is our secretary—he came to the office about eleven o'clock—in consequence of a communication from him, I sent Carthew to the Dublin Steam-packet wharf—I was at the Bullion-office in the Bank about one o'clock, when the prisoner came there—I went to in<lb></lb>quire if the boxes had arrived, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him what had become of oar two boxes of gold dust, marked B C 18 and 19—he said, "They have been delivered at your house"—I said, "How is that, when they are consigned by the bill of lading to the Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land?"—he said, "We have this morning received a letter from Messrs. Carne, stating, that in consequence of an error in the manifest, they were not to be delivered at the Bank of England, but to the agent of the Bra<lb></lb>zilian Company"—I asked him the name of the agent—he said he could not recollect, but if I would go with him to the office, in Crutched-friars, he would tell me the name—I asked him if the name was March—he said, "That, I think, is the name"—I then left the Bank, and left him—I went to our office, and ascertained that the boxes were not delivered there—I then went to the office in Crutched-friars, and saw the prisoner in the outer office—I said, "These boxes have not been delivered at our office, where are they?"—he said, "If you will walk into the inner office, I will tell you what has become of them"—he produced two letters to me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Nos.</hi> 3 and 4)—these are then—No. 4 was exactly in the same state then as it is now, with the address torn off—I asked him, "What has become of the outside of this letter, the address?"—he said, "I don't know whether it was torn off when it was first delivered into my hands, or whether it was torn off since"—he did not tell me whether he knew who it had been addressed to—he asked me if I thought the signatures of Messrs. Carne were genuine—I told him I thought not—he said, "Are they not like Messrs. Carnes' writing?"—I said, "Certainly, I think they are like it, but I think they are not genuine; I think they are forged"—I asked him if the body of the letter was written in a similar hand to any body in Messrs. Carnes' house that he was in the habit of seeing—if it was similar to any writing he had seen coming from Messrs. Carnes' house—he said, cer<lb></lb>tainly it was, he had seen such writing often—he did not tell me whose writing it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you ask him if the boxes had been delivered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told roe they had been delivered that morning to a gentlemanly looking man, either representing himself as coming from William March, or William March himself, he could not tell which—he said he thought the letters genuine, and he had seen similar writing from Carnes' house—I am ac<lb></lb>quainted with Messrs. Carnes' writing—it is in some degree similar—I mean the signature, but, in my opinion, easily detected to be a forgery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person received it in the hurry of business, do not you think he might be deceived by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 3)—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020116"></xptr>
               <p>there is nothing particularly extraordinary in this letter—I should say, on looking at it, it is not what I consider exactly a mercantile letter—in the first place, it is addressed at foot "W. Marsh, Esq., agent to the Brazil<lb></lb>ian Mining Company, or order;" now Mr. March's name is spelt wrong, and he is not agent, but secretary to the company—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 4)—this is decidedly much more unmercantile than the other, because it is ad<lb></lb>dressed "Messrs. W. Marsh, Esqr."—the signature is somewhat similar to Messrs. Carnes'—it is a signature I would not act on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But a person reading it over once may very likely not be able to distinguish it from a genuine signature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible, I cannot say it is probable I confess—I am not at all acquainted with the hand-writing of the prisoner—I should say the note at the bottom of No. 8, is a differ<lb></lb>ent hand-writing from the body, and the date also, "23rd of March, 1839" I should say was different—all the rest appears to be one hand-writing, except the note at the bottom, and the signature—I do not think the date is a similar hand-writing to the body, generally—I think it is a different hand-writing—I think the date of No. 4, and "Messrs. W. Marsh, Esq., Secretary to the Brazilian Mining Company, or order," is different to the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, could such an error as that be made by a person competent to conduct Mr. Hartley's business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—nor any person in the habit of corresponding—"Messrs." is in the same line with the name, and appears in the same hand-writing as the rest of the address, and it appears to be squeezed into a place not large enough.</p>

Mr. George Haythorn is one of the proprietors of that company—there are other proprietors besides him—on the 20th of March we had advice of the arrival of some gold dust from the Brazils, by a letter from Messrs. Carne, of Falmouth—it was advice of two boxes of gold dust, "18 and 19," weigh<lb></lb>ing 102 lbs. 10oz. 11 dwts., by the <hi rend="italic">Sea Gull,</hi> they were forwarded by the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> steam-packet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When would it be known in London among persons conversant with shipping, that the <hi rend="italic">Sea Gull</hi> had arrived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 20th, the day we received the advice—on the 25th of March I received further advice of their being shipped, by the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> steamer—a bill of lading was enclosed with the advice, which I thought I had here, but I find I have made a mistake, and brought the wrong one—I never authorised Moss, or any other person to go to Iron-gate-wharf, to receive those boxes—I had no idea of such a proceeding being taken.</p>
               <p>"No. 1," being <hi rend="italic">read,</hi> was the bill of lading of the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick,</hi> in which was "Two boxes of gold dust, marked B. C. 18 and 19," containing together 1021bs. 10oz. 11 dwts. troy, consigned to the Brazilian Company at the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>No. 2. was the extract from the manifest of the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick,</hi> (as in page 686.)</p>

Peat had sent me—I should think it was rather after eleven o'clock than before—I think I might be certain it was before twelve o'clock—I asked if two boxes bad arrived marked "B. C," and I think the numbers were "18 and 19"—I mentioned that to him—he said they had arrived—I then asked him if he could inform me what time they would arrive as the Bank of England—he said, "They are about arriving there at this time"—I believe there was a second person there—the porter, who waited in the office when the clerks were not there—it was not Kingston—I have seen him here to-day—I think it was Mitchell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inland messenger of the General Post-office. There is a circular stamp kept at the General Post-office, with which all un<lb></lb>paid letters are stamped—the bags, on the 25th of March, were divided into eight divisions—each division was stamped with a particular letter—there were four stamps for each of the seven divisions, and one for the eighth, which is an auxiliary division—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the post-mark on letter No.</hi> 3)—this stamp I do not consider the office-stamp—it is not the genuine stamp of the office—it is the London mark "E. M. R. 25,—39")—from the appear<lb></lb>ance of that stamp, that letter could not have come through the General Post-office—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 4)—this is not the genuine London stamp—that could not have come through the General Post-office—it would not get such a stamp by coming through the post—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 2)—this is the genuine London post-stamp—the form of the letters and the figures on the stamps on Nos. 3 and 4 have been imitated—I have the genuine stamp with me, but there has been an alteration as regards the date, from "39" to "40"—we change them yearly—the circle of the letter "E" is the same—the genuine stamp of the day and year was produced on the last trial, but since that the "39" has been altered to "40"—the letter "E" is a fixture, and the figures "18" in the circle—the same type is used for M. R. this year as in 39—here is an impression, taken in a book on that day be<lb></lb>fore the duty commences—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—all, the genuine impressions would exactly correspond with this.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 25th of March, last year, I lived with the wit<lb></lb>ness Moss as his servant, and had done to about two years—he lived in New-street, just by the London Hospital, all the time I was with him—he went out in a working-dress when he went to work in a morning—that was generally the case, except on Sundays—on Monday, the 25th of March, he went out about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, as near as I can recollect—he was dressed in his best clothes—he returned be<lb></lb>tween one and two o'clock, as dear as I can recollect—I heard a knock at the door—it was one knock—he usually gave a double knock—mistress opened the door to him—I heard him say when he was let in, "Where is the girl?"—he usually dined between one and two o'clock—he did not stop to dinner that day—he did not remain long before he went out again, I think, about half-an-hour, as near as I can recollect, but I cannot recollect—he came back again directly, and asked for his handkerchief—mistress brought him down two handkerchiefs, and I gave them to him—one was a kind of red one, I forget the colour of the other—he came back in the evening, I think, about eight o'clock, as near as I can guess, and had his tea—he then washed himself, put on his common coat, the coat he went to work in, and went out—I cannot say at what time he went out—while he was out, Ellis Caspar called at my master's house, and I went to the Earl St. Vincent public-house to fetch my master—I knew I should find</p>

               <p>him there—he came back with me—Ellis Caspar was still there—I did not sleep in the house—I think I left about eleven o'clock that night—Ellis Caspar was there still in the house with master—I returned next morning, I think, about half-past six o'clock—it was my duty to light the fire—the fire-place looked very dirty, and was all over white ashes—it seemed to be the ashes of wood—there were some nails mixed with them, and the hob had red sealing-wax on it—my master was in bed when I got there—my mistress went out directly after I got there—my master came down soon after, about half-an-hour after mistress went out, between seven and eight o'clock, I believe—he went out after dinner—he dined about one o'clock—I do not recollect that he went out from seven o'clock in the morning till one o'clock—he went out about half-an-hour or an hour after dinner—I found lodgings were taken in Mansel-street, which is about a mile from New-street—I packed up, to take the things away—there was a box, secured with a rope—it was Mr. Moss's daughter's box—it appeared very heavy—I saw it taken away in a truck—we went to the new lodging in Mansel-street on the Tuesday night.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you taken up on this matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was kept under Lea's care, at the Flying Horse public-house—I do not live with Moss now—I have learnt a business—I was at home on Sunday, the 24th of March, at Moss's house, all day—I had my meals there—they dined about one o'clock on Sundays—that was the usual hour, sometimes later—it might be a little after one o'clock, because he came home from work—he used to work on Sunday—he went out to work that Sunday, about nine o'clock, and came home about one o'clock, or a little after—he came home by himself—I did not see any body with him—nobody came to dinner that day—Ellis Caspar came while they were having dinner—he was in the front parlour—I did not see any more persons come that day—I did not see him come with my master—I think he came while he was at dinner, and went into the parlour—then Moss went and spoke to him, and then he went home, and Moss went to his work—I do not recollect whether I opened the door to him—I saw him there—I think he remained about half-an-hour—I was in the back parlour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell whether any body except your master and Ellis Caspar was in the parlour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot, but there was somebody else there at night—I do not recollect any body else being there between one and two o'clock—I did not see them, but I was about my work—I did not let any body else in—I did not see Ellis Caspar go away, but I heard the door shut—somebody was there on Sunday night, but I did not see them—I left the house that night, I dare say, between nine and ten o'clock—my master came home about eight o'clock on the Monday evening, washed, and went out—he had gone, it might be about half-an-hour, when Ellis Caspar came—the Earl St. Vincent public-house is not a great way from the house—it would take me five or ten minutes to walk there—my master came with me, and found Ellis Caspar at his house when we got there.</p>

               <p>it was as much as that, but I cannot exactly say—I think it was about nine o'clock—the Earl St. Vincent public-house is not within three or four doors of the house—it is not in the same street; you turn down a street, and then down another street—it is at the back of the hospital.</p>

On Monday, the 25th of March last, I saw him go into his house, about three o'clock, or between three and four o'clock—I observed he had something very weighty with him—he used to have a plate with his name on the door, and next morning I observed that the plate was taken off—I saw the goods being moved away that day—a box; was shown to me at the last trial—I saw a box like that moved out.</p>

                  </hi>. In March last, and before that, I kept a coffee-shop in Great Tower-street. I have known the prisoner a long time—I was not acquainted with Moss at that time—I remember the prisoner coming to my coffee-shop—it must have been before March—I think in January, at the end of January—there was a gentleman with him, but I cannot recollect him—they had coffee there—after they were gone I found a pocket handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the one produced by Roe</hi>)—I believe this is the handkerchief—I had known the prisoner a very long time—he had never been to my coffee-shop before, to my knowledge—I am certain of his having been there on that occasion—I believe this to be the hand<lb></lb>kerchief, but I gave it directly to my wife, and did not examine it so accurate<lb></lb>ly—I had it back from her afterwards, and delivered it up at the police-office, to Lea or Roe—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Roe</hi>)—that is the gentleman—I gave him the same handkerchief as I picked up that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen the prisoner at your shop before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—I have known him from a child—I did not know Moss at all—I cannot swear to his person—he might have been at my coffee-shop—there may be a hundred people in my house at a time—I swear I do not recollect Moss—I have never seen him at my coffee-house since to my knowledge, and I do not swear it was him with the prisoner—I found the handkerchief, and gave it to my wile instantly—I do not believe any one was in the room when I found it, because it was about six o'clock, when they went away, and I went up stairs to see if any body had left any thing, and found the handkerchief—I took it down to my wife instantly—it was about half-past six or seven o'clock in the evening when I found it, to the best of my recollection—I had a waiter at that time who was my wife's brother—I solemnly declare he was not present when I found it—I knew where the prisoner's father lived at that time—I found the handkerchief in the place where the prisoner and the other had sat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take any pains to inform the prisoner you had found it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him afterwards, but I left it, saying, should Mr. Caspar call, for the handkerchief to be returned—I did not send to him, because I did not know who had lost it, the prisoner or his companion—I believed one of them had, but many other people came to the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not send to the prisoner to say you had it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know whether the prisoner would not come back to ask for it—I should not have kept it if it had not been inquired for—it is in possession of the officer—I kept it five, six, or seven weeks—I did not know where the prisoner lived, and if I had, I expected he might have called again, and that might have been another 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—I have never had any communication with Moss since that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you receive the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know Davi's at all, but Mrs. Abrahams came to me, and said, "Do you know Caspar?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "How long is it since you have seen him?"—I said, "About two months ago."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On what account did you receive the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I must tell you what for—he did not owe me any money—I did not know him—he gave me the money—he made me a present of it—I had seen Davis before, but not known him—I never had any previous transaction with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, why did he give it you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mrs. Abrahams called on me with him, and I knew Mrs. Abrahams very well—she said, "Mr. Fiestell, do you know the name of Caspar?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Do you know the gentleman who was with him? can you recollect him?"—I said, "No"—she said, "Don't you know Mr. Moss?"—I said I did not—she said, "Suppose I tell you how he looks, so and so"—I said, "Tell me what you like, I can't recollect him"—she said, "I shall describe him to you"—I said, "If I take descriptions of people who come to my house I must have a very good memory, but, perhaps, if you show him to me I may recollect him"—at that time there was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward against Moss, and it appeared to me they would not let me see him—David made me a present of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to induce me to say I knew him, but I would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, why should not I? but when I came to the office he was pointed out to me, and I said, "No, I can't swear to him," and I would not swear to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was given to you to swear Moss had been at your coffee-house with Caspar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He made me a present of it—the handkerchief was shown by my wife, but not in my presence—I believe I did not see it—I might have seen it, or I might not—I believe I did not, because it was shown to them before—they had called twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not mentioned in that conversation that you should swear that handkerchief was left when the prisoner was at your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not asked, "Cannot you prove this handkerchief was left at the time Caspar was at your house?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was the case—it was left—that was the point, that I should identify Moss, which I would not do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did either of them state to you that they were in a condi<lb></lb>tion to prove the handkerchief left with you belonged to Moss? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Mrs. Abrahams said so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you show them the handkerchief and say, "I cannot swear to the man until I have seen him, but I have a handkerchief that one of them I believe left?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—they had been several times, but the; first time they came I was out, and I understood my wife had shown it to them—she looked at it and at last found a mark—Mrs. Abrahams said, "Oh, I believe he has lost a handkerchief"—Davis then gave me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to swear positively to Moss that I knew him, but I said, "I will go to the police-office;" but when I got there I did not know him, and would not swear to him—they asked me to swear that I saw him.</p>

               <p>the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the only sum I have received from any person—if they had offered me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be the same as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was quite satisfied, I would not swear to any thing I did not know—I did not ask them for any more—they did not promise me any more—they promised me if I wished to do so that they would give me a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note if I would identify Caspar, I mean Moss, but I would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you if they did not offer you a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to swear Caspar was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told you they, in the plural, they both were there—they did not ask me particularly to swear that the prisoner was there, but that both he and Moss were there—that was after Moss was taken up—I have never seen Davis since—I did not see him at Lambeth-street office—the only time I saw him was at my house, twice he called—I knew him from seeing him, but had not any particular knowledge of him—I will not swear I had not spoken to him before, but I never had any business with him, nor did I know what he was—I did not know he lived in Coventry-court till after<lb></lb>wards—I never went there—I kept the coffee-shop ten or eleven months—I was also an agent for foreign wines—my counting-house is 84, Lower Tower-street—I am still an agent for foreign wines—I do commissions—I am a general agent—before I went to Tower-street I kept a fancy toy-shop in Lowther Arcade—I was there eighteen months—I was always the same trade, a foreign agent in the wine trade, and so I am now.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 25th of March I remember the prisoner coming to the office and seeing Mr. Hardwicke, the Magistrate, about half-past two o'clock—he produced these two letters—(Nos. 3 and 4)—he said a serious robbery had taken place that morning, at Irongate Wharf, and that a person had come in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from Mr. March—he gave me a description of the mode in which it had been effected, that he had given it to a person who came in the name of Mr. March—I afterwards went to Irongate Wharf—he staid some few minutes with me at the wharf—he then left me, and said he could be of no further use to me—I staid some time, and then went to the office in John-street, and saw the prisoner—he opened a drawer, and produced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020129"></xptr>
               <p>three or four letters of Messrs.

Carne's signature—I said that appeared to correspond with the others very much—he said it was principally on the faith of the signature he had given the order to the person for the boxes—I asked him at that time the description of the person who had been to receive the order—he said he was a man shorter than himself, grey whiskers, it appeared as if he had been a traveller, that he had a weather-beaten countenance—if I recollect right, he said he appeared to be about sixty years of age, and had grey hair—he laid he did not know him—he said he supposed, from what he stated, that he had come from Mr. March, and he did not know whether it was Mr. March or not—about eight o'clock that night I was at the Swan-with-two-Necks, making in<lb></lb>quiry about the Falmouth coach, and while there, the prisoner and his father came in—he inquired about the Falmouth mail, and said he was going by the Falmouth mail—I made inquiry, and found the mail had been gone about a quarter of an hour before they came in—I told the prisoner I thought if he had a wish to go, be might overtake the mail at the South<lb></lb>ampton rail-road—I went with them in a coach, but the mail had been gone about ten minutes I think—the mail goes by the rail-road—I do not think he had stated to me before, any intention of going to Falmouth—I have no recollection of it—he called at two or three coach-offices coming back, and said he should go next morning—as we returned, Ellis Caspar left the coach—I am not quite positive where he left it—I thought it was at Charing-cross, but it was between Charing-cross and St. Paul's—the prisoner said there would be hand-bills out next day, and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward offered—he said Mr. Allen, and Mr. De Mole were to have them printed—I expressed a wish to see Mr. De Mole before they were printed, and the prisoner requested his father to go immediately to prevent their being printed—I had been to the St. Paul's Coffee-house in the morning, and found three persons were putting up there from the Falmouth mail that day, and I went to see them—I called there again in the evening with the prisoner, after his father left—I gave a description of the person as the prisoner had given me, grey hair, and whiskers, a person, shorter than him, and about sixty years of age—he never contradicted me, or said that was not the person—there was a description given then, that such a per<lb></lb>son had been there—one of the three who had come by the mail—I think the waiter gave me that description, and the prisoner said that appeared the sort of description of the person—that person was described as about sixty years of age, with grey hair and whiskers—the prisoner also said he thought I could not do better than to pursue the inquiry there, and stick to the person at that house—he also told me the same thing, two days afterwards.</p>

Came,—Dear Sirs, A most diabolical robbery has been committed here through the means of forging your signatures to two letters. On the other side I send a copy of them, and I beg that you will use your utmost exer<lb></lb>tions towards discovering the perpetrator. The impression is that it must have been done by persons who have had access to your office or knew of all the particulars as early as yourselves. The letters were posted at Fal<lb></lb>mouth on the 23rd, and arrived with this morning's manifest. Shortly after a gentleman called, requesting the delivery of two boxes marked "B C 18 and 19;" he showed me a letter which purported to be Mr. March's, or from him, I had not the slightest suspicion, and referred him to the wharf, writing an order for their delivery; unfortunately they were handed to him, and it only remains to use every exertion to obtain a clue. Let me beg and entreat of you to show your usual zeal in this matter. Believe me, dear Sirs, I am almost heart-broken. Yours very truly, L. <hi rend="smallCaps">CASPER</hi>. The man who called at my office appeared about fifty or sixty years of age, grey whiskers, middling stature, very dark complexion, swarthy, or very sunburnt, as an old traveller would appear, has a country dialect, as if from your parts.

I was at Lambeth-street office on the 14th of June I think—I do not exactly recollect the date—the prisoner, Ellis Caspar, Mrs. Abrahams, and Moses were all four in confine<lb></lb>ment in one cell in the office—I heard the prisoner conversing with Moses—they were talking loud—I was not in a situation to see as well as hear—I heard the prisoner say to Moses, "Do you intend to let me have any money, I want 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to prepare for my defence"—Moses answered, "No, I want four or five fifties to pay or prepare for my own"—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "Had I have had the 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as you promised me, things might have been different"—Moses said "You are a b——rogue, you did not give him even what you had"—he did not mention who he meant by <hi rend="italic">him</hi>—there was something said then which I did not hear, and I heard Moses say, "Did you ever give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"</p>

I remember Sunday, the 24th of March, last year—my brother was at home that day—we all lived together at my father's house—he was in the habit of lying in bed rather late on Sunday mornings—he got up that Sunday morning from half-past ten to twelve o'clock—I think about eleven o'clock—he break-fasted after he got up—he dined at home that day—I think we dined about three or four o'clock—we usually dined about that hour on Sunday—generally on Sunday we dined later—I remember Mr. Wilson, a clock-case maker, calling to see my brother, about half-past twelve o'clock, and he staid till about three o'clock, or it might be later—my brother went out about four o'clock or half-past, between four and five—I would undertake to say he was in my father's house between one and two o'clock that day—I am quite certain of it—I am quite certain he did not go out from the time he got up till between four and fire o'clock—I was standing by his side nearly the whole of that time, looking over Mr. Wilson, who was teaching him drawing—he is a designer and draughtsman—my brother was in the habit of visiting Mrs. Manley, a friend—I cannot tell exactly what time he returned that evening—I do not know—he did not return very late—I always slept with him—we did not go to bed together that night, I went before him—I can<lb></lb>not tell what time he came to bed—I awoke between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and found him there—I got up tome time between seven and eight o'clock that morning, and left him in bed—I had to go up seve<lb></lb>ral times to call him that morning before he got up—I remember Mr. Rid<lb></lb>dington's man coming that morning, about a pair of boots—he came about ten minutes to nine o'clock—I did not go up and call my brother at that time—he came down to speak to the man within a few minutes to nine o'clock—he came down entirely in <hi rend="italic">deshabille,</hi> in his slippers, and his coat across his arm—I cannot tell whether he had his breakfast after seeing Riddington's man, for I went out shortly after nine, o'clock—I left my brother at home then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where do you live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At No, 29, Finsbury-place—that is about twenty minutes, or half-an-hour's walk from Mr. Hartley's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the habit occasionally of taking a sand<lb></lb>wich to your brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every day I took it, from eleven to one o'clock, about one o'clock—I remember taking a sandwich to him at the office that Monday morning, I think, about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock, perhaps later, I did not notice the time—I saw him there—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the door, and thinking it might be my brother, I went up to it, and found it was a stranger—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man grazed my leg against the step of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on his jumping down from the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you look into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> to be able to see the person in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I looked particularly close, to see if it was my brother—I know Moss per<lb></lb>fectly well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he the person in that <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am quite certain he was not—it was a yellow-bodied <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> with a black top, I believe, but I would not say that positively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man, getting down, grazed your leg; did you com<lb></lb>plain of the injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I went into the office crying—I saw my brother, and then Mr. Hickey—I told them what was the matter—Mr. Hickey</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020138"></xptr>
               <p>asked me, and I told him the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man kicked me—I do not know whether Mr. Hickey is here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were you when your brother was tried before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was about here the first day—the rest of the time I was at home—I was not in the best of health on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of last June—I was not confined to my bed—there was nothing the matter with my leg then—I knew Moss before this transaction, from taking him jobs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you the little boy who was in here yesterday and the day before, communicating with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in a short time, and Mr. Robinson told me to go out—I only spoke to my brother once or twice at the utmost—I do not think I talked to him four or five times—I should not like to swear it—I have known Moss a very long time—he was not in the habit of coming to my father's house—he has not been often at my father's house—I might have seen him there once or twice, but merely as a workman in the shop—I do not know that he was ever in my father's employ at all—my father gave him jobs, which, I believe, he did in his leisure hours—I do not recollect seeing him for a long time before this Sunday, not for about two years, at our house—I am fifteen years old next month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was your father on this Sunday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was at home also—I knew my father was being tried in June last for sharing this offence—and I knew he was at home all day that Sunday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although you knew he was charged with being at Moss's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not come forward as a witness—I may have seen Moss occasionally at his house in New-street, Whitechapel—I do not know the number—I know the house, by being sent there by my father—I cannot tell whether his name was on the door, I did not notice—yes, I think it was—I cannot tell whether it was on a brass plate, it might or might not—I do not know whether it was or not—I might not have noticed his name at all, or I might have noticed it—I did not notice it—I do not know whether it was on the door or not—I had been there several times—the last time was, I dare say, about eighteen months or two years ago, I think eighteen months—I cannot tell how long I had known Moss living in New-street—I remember him for a long time—I do not remember ever going to any other house to him—I have known him at that house three or four years, or it may be longer—I have two brothers and six sisters—the prisoner is my eldest brother—two of my sisters are here, but not any brother—my younger brother is nine years of age—my sisters are older than me—my mother is living—she is not here—she dined at home with my father and brother that Sunday—she is at home, and she is distracted, poor creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now describe the dress of the man in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell his dress—he was not at all like Moss—I did not notice his dress—I think he had a great-coat on—I do not think he had a Macintosh over it—he had a hat—I cannot tell whether it was a light great-coat he had—I noticed his countenance more—I should not like to swear he had any great-coat—I did not notice his dress, but his countenance—I did not see him get out—I think it was about half-past eleven or half-past twelve o'clock—I ge<lb></lb>nerally went to my brother from eleven to one o'clock, before we dined—I will swear it was before one o'clock—I will not swear it was before twelve o'clock—it might have been half-past twelve o'clock—I am certain it was not one o'clock, because we generally dined about one o'clock, and I got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020139"></xptr>
               <p>home some time before we had dinner—my leg was not injured, but hurt, by being kicked against—the man in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was a far older man than Moss—he seemed about sixty, I should think—I cannot tell what hair he had—he had grey whiskers—I did not notice that he stooped particularly—I did not hear his voice—I did not hear any thing he said—I did not see any body come out to him—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove off as I went into the office—I did not go before the Magistrate—I was at home with my mother when my brother and father were charged before the Magistrate—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove to the Minories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came the man to get off the box when he was driving off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was at the office door, and as I walked into the office it drove away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But the man would step on, instead of off; to drive away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The man was on the step of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> talking to the per<lb></lb>son in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he jumped down from the step of the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> not off the box—I could not look inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from the street, but I had a good view of the man—there was only one man, I am certain—I could see all inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the step was at the door of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it was a low four-wheeled <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not notice any boxes in it—I am quite sure there were no boxes in it—I cannot say whether the gentleman had a letter—my brother did not come out with him—he was in the office when I went in—the man was sitting in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I think I should know the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man if I saw him—I was not before the Magistrates at all—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man was a great big fellow, with red in his face—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the witness Moss</hi>)—that is the man I know as Moss—he is well known to our family, and has been for some years—I should not take him for sixty years of age—I should say he is about thirty—my father was out on Monday night—I do not know what time he came home—I go to bed about eight o'clock, or between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know a man named Davis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Davis? no—I know several gentlemen of the name of Davis—I do not know Davis who lived in Co<lb></lb>ventry-court, and Oxendon-street—I do not know Mrs. Abrahams—I saw her when I went into Newgate to see my poor father—I went into Newgate to see my father the day he was committed—I knew the day he was tried—I did not come forward as a witness—I do not know why.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who brought you here to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I came myself—I have not had a subpoena—MR. Robinson told me to come—MR. Robinson did not exa<lb></lb>mine me before I came here—nobody examined me before I came here—I told Mr. Robinson as nearly as possible what I had to say, a few days since—I think Monday week—that was the first time Mr. Robinson knew it—I did not tell him—I had told my brother previously, and it was written down—I do not know who wrote it down—I believe it was enclosed in the brief—MR. Robinson read it to me, and asked me if I knew every part of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When, for the first time, did you tell this to Mr. Robinson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mentioned about the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> directly I got home—I believe it is in the brief—I think I first told Mr. Robinson on Monday week—that was the first time I saw Mr. Robinson about it—I cannot say it was Monday week—it was one day in the last week—that was the first time I saw Mr. Robinson—MR. Yates was my father's attorney at the last trial—he knew it—I did not tell him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know he knew it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The circumstance of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I ed when I got home, every body knew it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know Mr. Yates knew the circumstances you have come to tell today? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have told him—I have been to Mr. Yates's—I did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020140"></xptr>
               <p>not tell him formally all I bad to say, but I told him about the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I told him it was not Moss who came in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—that was before my father was tried—I did not see him take it down in writing—I went to Mr. Yates with my mother and sisters—my mother went to consult him and take him money for counsel—I was not brought here when my father was tried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, consider. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was here—I was in the yard the first day—I think I was not here the second day—I am afraid of swearing it—swear<lb></lb>ing is an awful thing for a boy like me—I might have been here on the second day—I think I was, on an errand to Mr. Yates—I was here on mes<lb></lb>sages to Mr. Yates often—I do not think I was here the third day—I was not here every day of the trial—I was away two or three days—the third, fourth, and fifth days, I think, but when I was here I only came on an errand to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath, were you not here waiting to be called as a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was not—I never gave my evidence ready to be exa<lb></lb>mined as a witness—I was not desired to be here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you stated to Mr. Yates what you had said to your brother about his being at home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I merely stated the circum<lb></lb>stance, and have said how cruel it was to say so and so about my brother, when I knew the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you willing to come forward as a witness on the last trial, to state this if asked to do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A place like this I was almost afraid of coming to, but on it being represented it was useful to my brother, I could not refuse to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath, is what you have said about your brother being at home, true or false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly it is true—I would not swear a falsity—my poor mother is not in a state to come forward—MR. Robinson has very recently been engaged as attorney for my brother, instead of Mr. Yates—we have a servant named Sarah Cox—she and my sisters were all at home on the Sunday and Monday, at the time I have men<lb></lb>tioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you happen to know whether it was left to counsel on the last trial, whether they thought right to call witnesses or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was left to counsel entirely—my brother wished me to be called on the last trial, and now he has insisted on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister. I remember Sunday the 24th of March last—my brother was in the habit of getting up late on Sunday mornings, sometimes at ten, and sometimes ten or eleven o'clock—on Sunday, the 24th of March, he got up between eleven and twelve o'clock—I remember his coming down stairs that morning about that time—he breakfasted after he came down—I remember a man named Wilson, a clock-case maker, calling that day to see my brother—I think he called before twelve o'clock—it was after my brother came down—he had some conversation with my brother—I do not recollect upon what subject—he left about three o'clock—the dinner cloth was being laid while he staid there—dinner was brought up while he was there, I think—he did not dine with us—he went away before dinner—the servant I remember, in laying the cloth, had to ask him to move, in talking to my brother, to enable her to lay the cloth—my brother dined with the rest of the family that day—he went out in the evening, about five o'clock—I can undertake to say he did not leave the house earlier than between four and five o'clock, and that he was there from one to two or three o'clock—he was not out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020141"></xptr>
               <p>till between four and five o'clock in the evening—my brother Edward and he slept together—the prisoner had supper at home that Sunday night—we usually supped between eleven and twelve o'clock, about eleven—he came home early—I remarked his coming home particularly early that evening, but I do not know the hour—we went to bed at the usual hour that night—next morning, Monday, the 25th, he came down stairs a few minutes before nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember whether there was any thing particular to require his coining down stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, his boot-maker called that morning, and was waiting for him to have an answer about his boots, which he had brought home on Saturday night—when he came down he spoke to the boot-maker—he said he had not time to wait a moment—he came down with his coat over his arm, and his slippers on—he breakfasted at home that morning—he went out just about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he only came down a few minutes before nine o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came down just before nine o'clock, but very often he used to take a cup of coffee and run away—he did so that morning—he went away in a great hurry—it might be a few minutes before nine o'clock when he left, but it was on the stroke of nine—my brother Edward was in the habit of taking him a lunch every morning—he generally took it about ten or eleven o'clock, but sometimes it was not so exact—I remember my father coming home on Monday evening perfectly well—he came home from eleven to half-past eleven o'clock, but not later—I am quite sure of that—he went to bed with the rest of the family—I was ready on the last trial to state what I have now—I had stated it to Mr. Yates, my brother's attorney.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you here in attendance during the trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not on any of the days—I was at home—my father was at home with my brother on the Sunday, talking to the said Mr. Wilson—I did not know that my father was said to be in another place on that Sunday—I knew he was described to be at Moss's house on Sunday—I knew he was at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was it you did not come here to state it in the last case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the counsellors did not think it necessary witnesses should be called, I understood—MR. Riddington is the master boot-maker's name—I do not know where my brother Edward was when the man called from Mr. Riddington—the man waited in the parlour—my sister showed him in—I was there—I called my brother for him—I went and told my brother that Riddington's man was waiting for him—he came down on that, and went into the parlour to the man—that is the room he used to take his breakfast in—he did not talk to the man while he was having his break-fast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he take any breakfast? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He took a cup of coffee, as well as I can recollect, but he was very late that morning—he merely swallowed a cup of coffee and went out almost as soon as he got in the parlour—he told the man he could not wait to try them on that morning, and then left the house I think while the man was there—I did not see my brother Edward go out with the lunch that morning—I did not give him the lunch—we sometimes breakfasted before my brother—sometimes we breakfasted earlier than he rose—on that morning we were breakfasting when he came down—the family were sitting at breakfast when he came down—myself, my mother, and Edward—we were having breakfast together—being late that morning, breakfast</p>

               <p>was nearly done when Riddington's man came—Edward and all the family were sitting at breakfast when I went up stairs to call my brother—I left them at the breakfast-table, but I must name to you, that we did not break-fast in the parlour where Riddington's man came in, but in another parlour.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is his shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A clock and watch manufactory—my brother sometimes has a sandwich for his lunch, or sometimes bread and cheese, any thing there was—he did not take it with him—Edward used to take it to him—he very seldom took it himself—he used to say he would do without any, but we nearly always used to send him lunch, and we used to send it as early as we could to him—John-street is about twenty minutes or a quarter-of-an-hour's walk—we sent every day—he never took it himself—it was sent wrapped up in paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I remember Sun<lb></lb>day, the 24th of March—my brother got up about eleven o'clock, or a little after—he and Edward slept together—he breakfasted when he came down that morning—while he was there Mr. Wilson called to see him—he is a draughtsman, and a clock-case maker—it was between twelve and one o'clock, about half-past twelve o'clock I think, when Mr. Wilson called—he remained till the dinner cloth was laid, which was between three and four o'clock—he went away before we dined—from eleven till three o'clock, when Mr. Wilson left, my brother did not leave the house—he was not dressed to leave home till after—he dined with us that day, and waited till five o'clock—he agreed to wait for Mr. Wilson till five o'clock, and if he did not call about five o'clock, he was to go out without him—it must have have been after five o'clock when he went out—I can<lb></lb>not recollect his coming home that evening—I do not remember having supper that night—I went to bed before supper—my brother might have returned before I went to bed—he generally supped with us—my father got up the same time as usual on Sunday morning—he breakfasted with us—we breakfasted at eight o'clock that morning—my father did not go out before dinner that day—he was also engaged with Mr. Wilson—I will undertake to say positively my father was at home between one and two o'clock that day—I do not remember any body calling to see my bro<lb></lb>ther on Monday morning, but the shoemaker, who lives opposite—the man's name is Allen—the master is Mr. Riddington—Allen called about nine o'clock, a few minutes before or after nine o'clock—my brother came down to see him—he had his slippers on when he came down, and his coat thrown over his arm—he spoke to the man, and tried the boots on—I cannot say whether they fitted him, because I went out of the room—I came into the room a few minutes after—I saw him with the boots, whe<lb></lb>ther</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020143"></xptr>
               <p>he did try them on I cannot say—he spoke to the man about them—the man did not remain long—my brother breakfasted after he had done with the man—he went out as near as I can recollect, at a quarter after nine o'clock, a few minutes more or less—it was past nine o'clock I am positive—his usual time for breakfast was a quarter before nine o'clock—he used to tell the trades people not to call after nine o'clock—he was rather later than usual that morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the Sunday, do you remember whether your father was at home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was at home—he did not go out at all on Sunday—he was at home on the Monday, except going to his work-shop, which is a few doors off—he was only absent a few minutes—he did not go out for any length of time in the day time—he was at home as late as twelve or one o'clock—he had not gone out before that on Monday—Sarah Cox was our servant at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the same servant now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she is here—I was ready to be called as a witness for my father when he was tried—I have known Moss by sight a long while—I cannot say how long—six or seven years, as long as I can recollect—I do not know where he used to live—I might have been at his house—I am not sure—I might have taken a job there for my father—I have not been often—I have not been six or seven times, nor four or five—I think I have been once or twice—it was in New-street, Whitechapel—it is somewhere about two years ago that I went there—my father was at home all Sunday—he did not go out at all on Sunday—not in the even<lb></lb>ing—I knew that when he was being tried, and I knew he was charged with being at Moss's house on Sunday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never came forward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We expected we should have to come, but were not called—it was about nine o'clock when my brother got up on Monday—that was later than usual—we breakfasted at the usual time that morning, eight o'clock—we breakfasted down stairs in the kitchen that morning, not in the back or front-room—we breakfasted between eight and nine o'clock—Riddington's man came about nine o'clock, after we had breakfasted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After the breakfast things were all done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they might have been—it was after we had done breakfast—the things were gone—he was shown into the parlour even with the shop—he did not wait many minutes—I told my sister, and she called my brother—I told her as soon as Allen came, and she went and called him—he came with a very few minutes—our breakfast was over at the time I sent my sister to call him, but he did not breakfast with us—when he came down he went to Allen—I staid in the back-room a little time, while he was talking with the man about the boots—I cannot say where my brother had his breakfast—if he had it it must have been after Allen was gone—he breakfasted I know—he usu<lb></lb>ally had toast and coffee—he might have had that that morning—I believe he did breakfast that morning—it was there for him, and he sat down to breakfast—I do not know how long he was at breakfast—I suppose about a quarter of an hour, he might have been—he was in his slippers when he came down stairs—he went out in boots—he put on his boots in the parlour—I cannot say whether that was before or after breakfast—I saw him try on his new boots—he was talking to the man about them about ten minutes—he went and had his breakfast after that in the kitchen—he was called down to Riddington's man—if he had been down at his usual</p>

               <p>time we should not have had to call him—my father breakfasted with us that morning in the kitchen—MR. Wilson merely came in casually, and while there he drew some patterns of clock-cases—he agreed to come to my brother at five o'clock—I do not know what for.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mrs. Caspar, and have done so fifteen months—I was there in March last year—the prisoner was in the habit of getting up very late on Sunday mornings, between eleven and twelve o'clock in general—I remember Sunday, the 24th of March, he got up about eleven o'clock that morning—he had his breakfast at home—he breakfasted when he came down stairs by himself—Edward slept with him—I remember Mr. Wilson, a clock-case maker, calling to teach him drawing in the clock-cases—he called about half-past twelve o'clock—he remained till between three and four o'clock, the time I was going to lay the dinner-cloth—I am quite certain the prisoner had not left the house that morning up to that time—I cannot recollect whether his father had—he was there while Mr. Wilson was there—I do not know whether he went out Before Mr. Wilson left—I was in all parts of the house—the kitchen was my place—they were in the parlour—MR. Caspar was at home when Mr. Wilson called, and when he went away—he dined at home that day—the prisoner went out at five o'clock—I remember his coming home—I do not exactly know the time—he supped at home, and went to bed at the usual time—I do not remember any one calling to see him next morning—he came down at nine o'clock, or a few minutes to nine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he speak to any body when he came down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He spoke to the bootmaker—the bootmaker called to see him—I thought you meant a gentleman—the bootmaker's journeyman called about nine or ten minutes to nine o'clock,—the prisoner came down, with his coat hang<lb></lb>ing over his arm, and his slippers on—he spoke to the boot maker in the parlour for a few minutes, and the boot maker went away—the prisoner led the house after breakfast—after the bootmaker was gone he had breakfast, and left the house—I should say it was half-past nine o'clock when he left—I am sure it was after nine o'clock'—he generally used to go a little after nine o'clock—he went about the usual time that morning—on Tuesday and Friday mornings he used to go out early—when vessels were going off he went about seven o'clock—I remember seeing Mr. Caspar, my master, that morning—I do not remember whether he went out at all that morning—I saw him there at breakfast, between eight and nine o'clock, and I saw him there after breakfast—he dined at home—he was at home from breakfast to dinner-time—they dined about two o'clock—I am sure he did not go out from breakfast to dinner-time—he went out in the evening, I cannot say the exact time, it was getting candle-light—he came home between eleven and twelve o'clock in the evening—he had supper at home that night, and went to bed—it was some time be<lb></lb>tween eleven and twelve o'clock when he came home—we were all up stairs and in bed at twelve o'clock—the clock struck twelve as I was going up stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clock-case maker, and live at No. 19, King, street, Clerkenwell—I am not a housekeeper, but a lodger—I have lived there two years and better. I knew the elder and younger Mr. Caspar—I remember calling at Mr. Caspar's house on the 24th of March last—I was there about ten minutes after twelve o'clock—I saw the elder Caspar and the younger one, and the young son and the daughters—I had some conversation with them—I was there till after three o'clock, till their table was laid for dinner, and then I left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you doing from twelve till three o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was drawing clock-cases, little patterns in a book, for the elder Mr. Caspar to use as a pattern-book, and for the instruction of young Edward Caspar—when I first went the elder Mr. Caspar was in the shop, doing something to a watch—I went into the back parlour behind the shop, told him my watch was bad, and I had called, agreeable to promise, to give his son a lesson in drawing—I staid there I dare say three quarters of an hour, and while I was waiting there the prisoner came down, and made some remarks on my drawings, and pointed out something I should correct in them——I had not seen the prisoner till then—he was not dressed, he had his coat off—it must have been past half-past twelve when I first saw him that morning—I left about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in company with him from the time you first saw him till you went away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in company with him when he came down first, then he went up stairs again, and came down and staid with us nearly an hour before I came away—I can swear he was in the house from one to two o'clock that day—I cannot say whether he had any breakfast after he came down—the elder Mr. Caspar was with me all the time I was there, and was repairing my watch—I can swear that he was in the house from one to two o'clock—the prisoner very much pressed me to come at five o'clock, and he would wait at home for me, and I was to finish a drawing, and take it with me—he has often purchased clock-cases of me, and paid me for them—I cannot say whether he learned the watch trade or not—I had called at the house on other Sundays—I have seen the prisoner very much about the same time on several Sundays when I have been there, and I have seen him up very early on Sunday also.</p>

               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">RIDDINGTON</hi>. I am a bootmaker, and live at No. 15, Fins<lb></lb>bury-place North, very nearly opposite Mr. Caspar. I made the prisoner two pairs of boots—I remember Saturday, the 23rd of March last, I have it down in my book—I sent him some boots that day—I sent Allen to the prisoner about them on Monday morning, from half-past eight to nine o'clock—he returned to me with a message between half-past eight and nine o'clock—I am positive as to the time.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">ALLEN</hi>. In March last I was in the employ of Mr. Riddington. I remember taking a pair of boots home to the prisoner on Saturday, the 23rd of March—I went to him on Monday morning—it was within a few minutes of nine o'clock—I saw his two sisters, and afterwards saw the prisoner come down stairs—he had on a pair of dark trowsers, and was in his shirt sleeves, and a pair of morning slippers—I had a little conver<lb></lb>sation with him about the boots, for to the best of my recollection the boots did not fit him—to the best of my recollection I took them away, and returned to my master's shop—I suppose I remained in the house about five or six minutes—I was shown into the parlour at the back of the shop.</p>

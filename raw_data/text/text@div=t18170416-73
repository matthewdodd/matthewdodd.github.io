I came down to the street - door, and saw Collins come from the shop with something bulky, which he had not got before; he crossed into George-street. I had ordered some meat to be marked the night before. I went after him, and collared him in George-street, and said, "I think you have been carrying on this business long enough." I took him back, and took the meat out of his apron. I told him he was very ungreatful, as I had often assisted him, and that he must have a great many people, who bought the meat of him. He said, he should not convict any but himself, and we could not hang him for what he had done. He had thirty-eight pounds of meat in his apron, all marked.</p>

            , jun, I am the son of the last witness. I marked the meat, and placed myself on the kitchen stairs to watch. I heard Jordan come in about six o'clock; I saw him take a shoulder of mutton, and give it to a man, whose face I could not see - He put it under his coat, and went away. I went down stairs to get my shoes, and when I came up a fore-quarter of mutton, and some beef, which I had marked, were tied up in a basket, and covered with an apron. The prisoners were in the shop - They talked together, and Jordan went out of the door, and Collins put up the bundle and went out. I ran from my hiding-place, and found Collins in custody-Jordan was taken soon after. He said we could not hurt him, for Collins took it while he was out of the shop. Jordan did not give any account of receiving money that morning.</p>

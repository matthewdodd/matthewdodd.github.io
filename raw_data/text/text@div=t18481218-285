                  </hi>. I am master of the brig <hi rend="italic">Lemuel</hi>, and was so in July and August last. In July I was on the high seas, off the Gold Coast of Africa—from "26th July to 8th August, I received nine boxes of gold-dust, to bring to England as freight—one of them was from Mr. Andrew Swanzi—during the month of August, and during the time I received those boxes I was confined to my room at Elmina, through sickness—I placed the boxes in the corner of my room, where I was confined to my bed, and afterwards gave them to the second mate, Price—I gave him eight boxes on the 9th, and one on 10th Aug.—I gave him directions to take them en board, with the keys of my <hi rend="italic">state-room</hi>, and to unlock the larboard lockers in the cabin, and put them in there—I had the key of the state-room with me, and the keys of the cabin-lockers were in the state-room—Price brought back the key I had given him—according to the bills of lading there were 1, 755 ounces of gold-dust, to the value of about 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 11th Aug., about half-past nine o'clock a.m. the morning, I received a note from Price—the ship was then in Elmina Roadstead—I went to the Governor of Elmina Castle, and afterwards went on board the ship—the larboard lockers were then broken open, and the whole nine boxes abstracted—I missed a box containing two gold watches from the same locker; two chronometers, worth about 103 guineas, from the library; the cabin dial, north about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and four cutlasses—two guns were taken out of the cabin, and were found on the upper deck—two boxes of cigars, belonging to me were gone, and my boat also, which was worth thirty-two guineas, and was the only serviceable one belonging to the brig—I had not seen any of the prisoners at Cormantine—Powell was first mate officer of the <hi rend="italic">Lemuel</hi>; the other two were seamen—the next day I went to Cape Coast Castle, and saw the prisoners in custody, and found the two chronometers, the gold-dust, and the cigars there.</p>

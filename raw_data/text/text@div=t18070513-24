             is not here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Parkinson has known my family for twenty years. In the year 1804, I became acquainted with her daughter, at which time I was a <rs id="t18070513-24-deflabel157" type="occupation">mathematical instrument maker</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18070513-24-defend253 t18070513-24-deflabel157"></join>. I have not been capable of following it, owing to a complaint in my head. After she had put her husband in a private mad house, where he remained thirteen months, she permitted her daughter to sleep with me; in one of my mad fits I slept with her daughter; she was to give me seven hundred pounds to buy a commission in the horse-guards; she promised me two hundred pounds; thirty-three pounds I returned her back; nine pound I paid for a gin score.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you assert that ever you have been deranged in your mind. - A. Yes, from a nervous complaint in my head. At this time twelvemonth I had a letter from Mrs. Parkinson; she there speaks highly of my character; and adds, that she would protect me for the honour I had done to her daughter in marrying her.</p>

               <p>Court. I called on you for your defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Parkinson by a drunken habit swore her life against me.</p>
               <p>Court. It is unbecoming you to throw any implication on Mrs. Parkinson's character. I want you to say something in your own defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The infamy of the mother has forced me to do what I have done; she has been infamous enough to take the duplicate of a watch from me; she swore her life against her daughter, and detained her in Tothill-fields. As for the two hundred pounds she said I had, every farthing was laid out in the repair of her mother's house, except forty pounds.</p>

            . I am the porter. On Thursday morning, the 10th of April, I was sent to sweep out the counting-house - I found the door unlocked, and the desks wide open. I immediately locked the door, and took the keys down to Beetham, who went back and found it as he has described-the lock had been picked.</p>

               <p>WALTER STONE. I am an officer. On the 10th of April I was on duty in Tower-street. The prisoner, in company with two other men, passed me about a quarter after six o'clock in the morning. I followed them into Fenchurch-street; the prisoner crossed over to Biliter-lane-the other two went to the right. I went up to the prisoner, and asked him what he had got; he said it was a pretty thing to ask him. I told him he must satisfy me before he went further. He said, if I stopped him it would be the worse for me. I told him he must satisfy me. I secured him, and took him back to Tower-street. He had a handkerchief in his hand, and a cash-box; a quantity of stamps, 4s. 11d. in copper, and 19s. 6d. in silver. I found seventeen skeleton keys in his pocket, a dark lanthorn, and two candles. He had a custom-house freeman's ticket in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

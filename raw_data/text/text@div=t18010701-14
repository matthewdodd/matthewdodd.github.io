               <p>WILLIAM SEVIER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner, Ronaldson? - A. About ten or eleven months; he came to my house, and we went from there to a public-house; he said he had but 16s. a week, besides some oil of turpentine that was perquisites allowed him from his master, and he wished me to dispose of it for him; I told him I did not like to have any hand in it; he said he was doing right, and swore to it; I told him I did not like to have any thing to do with it; we drank up the beer, and went away; two nights afterwards he came again, and I agreed to look out for a person to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner King? - A.Between three and four months ago, Ronaldson came to my house, and wanted me to go to Mr. King.</p>
               <p>Q. What is King? - A. There is written over the door, Thomas King, oil and colourman, about half a dozen doors from the Police-office, Shadwell; I went into the shop, and saw Mr. and Mrs. King; I had on a brown velvet jacket, leather breeches, and an apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any trowsers on? - A. Not then; I had when I took it; I asked King if he would like to take it; I told him it was not my own, but belonged to another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any enquiry who that other person was? - A. No, he did not, nor I did not tell him; he asked me if it was good, and if it was safe; I said, it was safe enough, he need not to be afraid; he asked me what it was a gallon; I told him it could not be dear at 4s. 6d.; he said, that was rather too much; I told him it was very good, would he like to see it first; he said, yes; I then went to Ronaldson, and told him what had passed, and he gave me some in a small phial, which I took to Mr. King; he smelled it, and said it had not the smell that his had; then he said he liked it very well, and would give me 4s. 6d. a gallon; either the next day, or the day following, I took some to Mr. King in two bottles, one at a time; the same day King was not in the way, and I called again the second time, and saw Mr. King; he weighed them out, and Mrs. King put down the weight; I don't remember what the weight was, but they took seven pounds and a half to the gallon; then he paid for them at the rate of 4s. 6d. a gallon; then he asked me if there was any more; I told him there would be in a few days; he desired me to bring it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how much he paid you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received the money, how were you dressed? - A. In trowsers.</p>

               <p>Q.Will you swear that then you thought it was a fair and honest transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.After having dealt in this way for eight months? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Three or four months ago, what was the price of oil turpentine? - A.The lowest price in April was about seven or seven shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q.From thence back as far Christmas, would it be lower than that? - A. Not lower than that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is the man who sells it by retail likely to know as well as the wholesale dealer? - A. I believe every man that deals in oil of turpentine knows the price.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Haynes). Q. What sort of a shop is this, a small or a large shop? - A. A small shop, like a chandler's shop; I saw some maps, some brooms, sand, and things of that sort, like a chandler's-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been in business? - A. About two years; I never saw any thing bad of him; I have lived close by him all that time.PRonaldson's defence. I have been led away by Sevier; three parts out of four that he has said is false.</p>

I knew the deceased, Hannah Brown, for five years last February—shortly before Christmas I heard she was going to be married—about a day before Christmas, I was, called down from my workshop into the sitting room, and saw Mrs. Brown there, and the male prisoner—he was introduced to me by Mrs. Brown as her beau, as her intend<lb></lb>ed husband—she was about forty-seven years of age—I think they staid there together about three quarters of an hour at that time—she did not introduce him by any name at that time—the prisoner and I went to the Hand and Shears public-house together, and drank—no conversation passed that evening about his intentions—he had a deal to say about America, and said he bad a large farm there of 1000 acres of land, at Hudson's Bay—he said he had been away from there about four months, and that he was going back three weeks after Christmas—after this we went back to my house, and had supper together, and they left about ten o'clock—on Thurs<lb></lb>day, the 22nd of December, Greenacre came again to my house, I believe it was between six and seven, o'clock, with Mrs. Brown—they took something at my house, and after that, I and the prisoner went to the Queen's Head and French Horn—he was in conversation about America, the grand place it was, and the rail-loads there, and his farm, which bo described as a beautiful place—after having a pint of ale, he said he was in a hurry to go home to my house, we went back there together, and supped together at nine o'clock—after supper he sat at the right of Mrs. Brown, and Mrs. Brown on his left, on the sofa—I sat opposite to him, and my wife opposite to her—he said, "Well, we may as well tell you our intentions, (as we are not children,) before you, and we intend to get married on Sunday morning at St. Giles's church, and it is agreed that you shall be the man to give her away, and your eldest daughter to be the brides<lb></lb>maid, and you being kind enough to offer us dinner on that occasion, we shall accept of it"—I had offered to do so—we then began to talk about meeting on Sunday morning, and it was agreed that we. should meet at the Angel public-house, near the church, at ten o'clock—they went away toast a quarter past ten o'clock, and I walked about a hundred yards with them—from that time I never saw Hannah Brown again alive—on good Friday I saw a head at the Paddington Workhouse-the forehead, I observed, was flat, and the eyebrows straight, not so much in a circle as persons generally are—the eye was grey, and the two upper teeth were precisely like Mrs. Brown's—I did not observe any thing peculiar about the ear, for I had never seen her ear when alive.</p>

I knew the deceased, Hannah Brown, quite well, for about seventeen or eighteen years—I should think she could not have had any children—I made observation of such facts which made me think so—she was a tall woman, with a very delicate skin, and very high chested, much more titan most women—and she had a large hand, and long fingers—the ear-ring had been torn out of her left ear by her fellow-servant many years ago, and that had left a slit in her ear—the part next the face hung a little lower than the hind part—the fond was closed up, but still that part hung long—there was a hole bored above its second time—I was not present at any conversation that my husband had with the prisoner in the presence of his mistress—I remember hearing the reports about the body and head being found—my husband made inquiry, and he came and told me, and I went myself to the Pad<lb></lb>dington workhouse, on the 24th of March—I saw the head, which was preserved there, and I thought by the time I saw it, which was a very small time, that I could draw the visage of her down the nose, and the features about there—from the very short time I had to look at her, it ap<lb></lb>peared at though I could draw it was the from each side of the nose—she had a very flat nose—her hair was light, and intermixed with grey, like the hair of the head I saw—I noticed the left ear, and it was as my sister-in-law's was.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have been married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eighteen years—I first saw Mrs. Brown at Wyndham, in Norfolk—she lived about two miles distant, with her mother and father—I have been in London two years this month—my husband was at variance with his sister—I think for about three weeks or a month—they had rather differed—she had been that time with me before we had words—that was about two years ago—after she came to town—she came to live with me the week after, in Goodge-street, where I live now—she lived with me a very short time—the variance took place while she lived with us—that was the reason we parted—I met her several times afterwards in the street, but she never spoke to me—I had a very imperfect view of the head at the time I saw it, and will not be positive it was the head of Mrs.</p>

               <p>Brown—I should be sorry to swear to it—I should think I might do it, from the view I took of her—it was greatly changed, but it appeared at if I could draw the resemblance—her nose was very much flattened, and it was then still more flattened—one of the eyes, I believe, was knocked out—the lower jaw was very much fractured indeed—she had a very nice set of teeth when alive, and it appeared to me as if she had but very few in fat of her mouth—but with all those differences of appearances, I still thought I could draw a likeness—she certainly had teeth out then, and I do not suppose she had a tooth out when I saw her last time—the teeth were very much like hers—she was a tall woman, much taller than I am, and her skin was delicate—I should not say she was a very weak woman—she earned her bread by very hard labour—a mangle requires power—she con<lb></lb>tinued her daily occupation up to the last time I heard any thing of her, to my knowledge—she was a woman of much more power than I am—a somewhat unusually strong woman, much more than I am; but I should reckon there were many women as strong as her—I cannot tell what strength she had, by her look—her work was very hard—it requires more strength than I have to turn a mangle.</p>

PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said she was very high-chested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes, and her hands were very large—I never put her hand against any other—it was a much larger hand than many women have—she was a strong<lb></lb>handed woman, I should suppose—I should think the strength lies in the bone, and not in the flesh—I never saw her naked—she was flat I call a stout woman, not a small woman—she was larger than I am great deal—there are stouter women than she a great deal in the world—her sister is larger than her—she was high-chested—I know she would like to have shown her delicate neck, hut she could not, being higher than many women are—I should not think that bad any thing to do with strength—I never visited her in Union-street—I was not present when the prisoner called on Mrs. Blanshard—my husband came home and told me of the interview between him and Greenacre at his mistress's—I cannot bring the particulars to my recollection—he certainly said Greenacre had been, and said his sister had run him into debt in the Strand—but nothing else par<lb></lb>ticular that I can bring much to mind—he did not make any observation on Greenacre or his mistress, that I recollect—he merely said he heard Mr. Greenacre complain to his mistress that she bad run him into debt in the Strand, and he said he thought if she had done it before marriage she would do it afterwards—I recollect those words—I have no particular reason for recollecting them, they made no impression on me—it was no more than what I thought would be, from what I had learnt and hard of him from my husband's mistress—I thought the man's intentions were not so kind as they ought to be to her—I do not recollect my husband making any observation to me about him—he did not express any thing of the appearance of the parties during the conversation—I am sure at that think I recollect his saying he thought Mr. Greenacre seemed in a very agitated mind and state, after his mistress stated that ray husband was the brother of Mrs. Brown—it seemed to him that it gave the man a great change of his countenance—I am not able to say the time my husband mentioned this to me, but to the best of my knowledge it was the same</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not that communication about Greenacre's agitation make an impression on you when it was mentioned to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not the least in the world—I did not remember it just now—it was quite immaterial in estimation at that time—my husband did not make any other observation that I can recollect—he did not tell me why he suffered Greenacre and his mistress to talk to long together, without interfering himself in the conversation—I did not ask him that—my husband generally leaves work at nine or half-past nine o'clock—I have stated all the conversation that passed that I recollect—I do not know Mrs. Glass, of Windmill-street—Saturday the first of my having any acquaintance with her—her door is not a minutes walk from mine, but I never heard of her before last Saturday.</p>

I know both the prisoners—I knew the female prisoner by the name of Greenacre—no other name—Greenacre is my husband's landlord—he lived in the house, No. 6—the same house we now live in, the the prisoner Galo lived there—we were not then living in the same house with then, but about twenty-four yards off on the opposite side—I think Greenacre came to live at No. 6 some<lb></lb>time in August twelvemonth—I did not see the female prisoner till about the latter end of October twelve month—she came backwards and for wards—whether she lived there, I do not know—I remember Christmas<lb></lb>day last—it was on a Sunday—I saw the female prisoner on the evening of boxing-day, the day after Christmas, in Greenacre's gaurd, about seven o'clock—I cannot say to a minute—she came from Greenacre's door, and the child was crying violently after her—I had seen heir every day nearly, but I saw her that night in particular—I did not see her come out of the door—I saw her approach from the door, in a direction from the house, and the child was following her, she was in the front garden—it it only a narrow path—it is no street—the child was following her, crying—the gardens are in front of the houses, and a passage runs through, separating the garden of the houses on each side—the houses on each side have gardens in front—this was about seven o'clock on boxing night, Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I have prepared copies of plans of the premises in questions; for the purpose of doing so I went to Carpenter-place Windmill-lane, Camberwell—I believe this is a faithful copy of the plan I hold in my hand—I believe these plan faithfully represent the situation of the houses on that side Carpenter's-place on which No. 6 is situated—they are fronted on each aide of the way by strips of gardens—the upper line here denotes she opposite side, Nos. 11 to 17—the red mark denotes the house No. 6—the front door of No. 6 opens from the garden into the room—there is no passage—the distance from the door of the front room to the garden gate is thirty six feet three; the front room is ten feet eight by ten feet nine—I would beg leave to explain, there is a recess underneath the cupboard by the fire on the side, which I have not taken into the measure, that would make it twelve feet four—it is a glass cupboard, but it does not decend to the floor—there is an opening underneath—the cupboard descends to about three feet from, the floor—the depth of the recces is one foot six—the distance from the fire-place to the back of the room opposite the window is exactly four feet; that is the distance from the fire-place to the division of the back room—there is a passage between the houses, on the side, and on the other at the end of the gardens—it varies in size and width—I think the average is about three feet seven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a table to be opposite the fire-place, and a chair on one side of the table where the front door is, and another at the side of the door leading to the back room, would it be possible from the size of the room to overturn a person in a chair on the floor of the room, or would they necessarily come against the wall of the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the obliquity of the situation in which they sit.</p>

               <p>opening from the front room into the back room—it descends a step into the back room, and lower than the front—the back room is seven feet eight by eight feet a person sitting on the right-head side of the fire-place would have their back towards that room door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A person sitting on the right of the fire-place in a chair facing the front window, if by accident a fall should occur and the back door should be open, would they fall headlong down that step? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on how they fall—it is possible—I cannot say that it is probable a person on the right-hand of the fire-placewould have their back towards the door of the back room if they sat in an oblique diretion—if she sat facing the fire-place, as a person generally does, she would have her chair at sight angles—the fire-place is three feet seven from the partition. which divides the two rooms.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you do not understand the question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can give you the exact measurement, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a memorandum,</hi>) though the plan may not be in proportion; the length is three feet seven—the back room of No. 6 encroaches a little on the next house, No. 7—a considerable proportion of that room is within the area of what should be No. 7—I think the partition of the front room dividing No. 6 front No. 7 is four and a half inches thick—the back room from the door to the corner is five feet three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It appears to me quite impossible that that part of the partition of the back room which divides it from the front room could be any thing like three feet—the larger proportion you will perceive is in the adjoining house, No. 7? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 0ne foot four only is in the other house—I believe it is not more from the measure I have—the plan may be wrong from the suddenness in which it was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is one foot four? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That portion of the room which you may call an encroachment on No. 7—the length of the remainder of the partition between the back and front roomis, I believe, three feet seven—the breadth of the door way is two feet four—the length from the left-hand side of the opening of the back door to the staircase it the front room is two feet six—the width of the opening to the staircase is two feet three—that is narrower by an inch than the opening in the back room—a person sitting on the right hand of the fire-place would have their back towards the back room door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it would be more probable than otheiwise that a chair falling back would throw the sitter with her head backwards through the door, and down a step? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that—towards the opening they would, but I cannot say they would come through the door-it is possible a person falling there might fall down that opening—I should apprehend the door was very old, and it was thin—it has a very imperfect bad latch to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, whether the door was shut or open, was it not such a door, if so fastened, as that any body, say a stout woman, falling backwards in a chair against it would burst it open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—the door open into the front room, and it shuts against the frame, hence there would be greater difficulty—I believe it opens into the front room—if it was open, if is possible a person might fall through it—any great noise in that house, I should think, must be heard in either or both the next house—a conversation such as we are now holding might be heard.</p>

               <p>from one room through the door into the other, must have been heard by the next door neighbours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it would—I should think the force of the fall would have carried away the door casing, against which the door shut, in order to fall into the back room, as the door opens in wards—that must have carried the door casing away, and I should think that could not be done without being heard next door—if the body fell against the door, I should think it must carry the casing away for a person to fall into the back room.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We understand you to make the width of the back room seven feet eight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on one side—the distance from the left-hand side to the partition of the front room to be one foot four, and from that to where the hinges of the door are, three feet seven, and the doorway itself two feet four—that makes seven feet three—then there is the side of the door not taken in, and that would be about three inches on each side—it is a very old house, and there is a difference in the size of almost every portion of the room—there is a copper in the corner of the back kitechen—the privy is in the front of the house at present—it was formerly it the back—it was in the front when I looked at it, in the shed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> It was in January I took the house, No. 6—I know the door leading from the back room to the front—it opens inwards, towards the fire-place of the front room—when the door is opens, you cannot place a chair in the situation it ought to stand—if I was going to sit by the side of the fire-place, I could not, if the door was open, place it in a proper situation—a table stands in front of the fire, and the door opens within about a foot of meeting the table—I am not very stout, but I must move the table or chair to pass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the door was shut, in order to fall from the front room down the step into the back room, must you not carry away the casing of the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I sit in a chair to sit down and rock my child, without falling, I can save myself by the wainscot—when I sit by the fire, and the door is shut, I can rock my child to sleep, with the back of the chair striking against the partition between the two rooms—I fall with my head against it—the back room door has no appearance of being broken at all, nor the casing of the door—I never observed it—the floor of the back room is wood—the step is a very little one, about seven inches deep.</p>

I know the prisoner Gale—I know both the prisoners—Mrs. Gale came to lodge it my house on the 22nd of December—she took the buck parlour, unfurnished—my wife was there when she came in—she slept at out house that night—I first saw the prisoner Greenacre at our house the text morning, about nine o'clock—that was the 23rd—he brought a bundle with him—I was at work at the time—I saw him there on Saturday the 24th, in the morning—on the evening of Saturday Gale was out—the came home about half-past nine or ten o'clock—I cannot tell what time she went out—she slept there that night—the next day, Christmas day, Greenacre came to our house, between one and two o'clock in the day, it was Sunday—Gale was then at home—they dined together—they went out in the evening, but whether they went out both together I cannot say—it was towards the evening that they went out—I cannot say the time—Greenacre was at my house during the Christmas week—he slept at my place two nights, the 31st of December and the 1st of January, and moved on the next morning—the 1st of January was Sunday—on the 1st of January I was in my own room, up stairs, reading the newspaper—he was in Mrs. Gale's apartment—I was reading the newspaper that morning to my wife, and a friend of mine, and my sister—I read of the trunk of a body being found in the Edgeware-road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you read loud enough for the prisoners to hear you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They must have heard me read it—they had the door of their room ajar, and must have heard me—they staid there all day, and slept there all night—they did not say a word about this trunk that was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the T division of police. On Saturday 25th of March I received a warrant for the apprehension of Green<lb></lb>acre, and proceeded with it to the neighbourhood of Kennington—I went to Carpenter's-place to make inquiry, and on the Sunday I went with the war<lb></lb>rant to No. 1, St. Alban<lb></lb>street—I got there about half past ten or a quarter to eleven o'clock at night—the door was opened by the landlord of the house—in consequence of what he told me, I went to the parlour door, which just inside the street door—I knocked at the door, and called "Greenacre"—a voice from within said, "Yes, what do you want?"—it turned out to be Greenacre—I said, "I want to speak with you, open the door"—he said, "Wait a bit while I get the tinder-box and get a light"—I did not wait—I heard him moving in the room, as if he had just got out of bed—I lifted the latch of the door, and, it not being fastened, I went in—the root was dark—I found him standing in the room—the door fell back to<lb></lb>wards his elbows—he was standing in his shirt in the room—I laid hold of him by the arm, and he said, "What do you want?"—I said, "I have a warrant to take you into custody for the wilful murder of Hannah Brown"—by this time a light was brought from down stairs by the laid-lord—when the light was brought, I read the warrant to him, or partly so—I then said, "Do you know a person of the name of Brown?"—I said, "Do you know Hannah Brown"—he said, "No, I know no Hannah Brown"—I said, "Were you never asked in church to a person of that name?"—he said, "Yes, I was"—he was then putting on his stockings—I said, "Where is she now?"—he said, "I don't know, and you have no right to ask me those questions"—I said, "I don't mean to ask you any more questions, and I caution you what you say to me, for, whatever you do say to me I shall be obliged to repeat elsewhere"—I then searched his trowsers, which laid on a box by the side of the bed—I had not noticed Gale at that moment—just about the time I took the trowsers off the box, I saw the woman Gale in bed in the room, while I was in the act of taking out of his pockets whatever might be in them—I said, "What woman if thay? "—he said, "Why, that is a woman that comes to sleep with me"—I said, "She must get up alto, and dress and go with me"—as I was speaking thus, I saw, or rather heard, the rattling of something in her hand like a watch and I said, "What is that you have in your hand? let me see it," and she handed me this watch—I put my hand towards the bed, and she handed me the watch—in so doing, I saw that she had two rings on her finger, and I took them off at the same time—she then got out of bed and dressed herself—I then turned my attention to Greenacre's trowsers pocket, from which I took this pinchbeck watch in a leather bag—he had this purse with one sovereign in it and a cornelian stone, and there was a half-crown loose in his pocket—the cornelian stone bears a crest and the initials J. G., as it appears to me—I also found this bunch of keys, eight in number, a spectacle-case, and a pencil-case—Gale got up and dressed herself—she had put on her pocket, and I said, "Stop, what have you got in your pocket. I took from her pocket these two duplicates, these two ear-drops, which are cornelian set in gold, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and these keys—one duplicate is dated 17th January, 1837, for two veils, a handkerchief, and a pair of shoes, pawned at Mr. Knowles's, 19, Boling broke-row, Walworth</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Davis, who have been examined. I knew Mrs. Hannah Brown—I was to have been bridesmaid at her intended marriage—she had such a shawl as this—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at it</hi>)—I think she had it on the last time she was at our home, on Thursday evening, the 22nd of December—she had such a boa as this—I do not remember whether she had one on that night—she used to wear it in general when she came to our house—I saw her in it a short time be fore Christmas—she had such a collar as this—of this pattern—I know the pattern of the work—I remember that—I do not remember whether she had that on on the 22nd—I have seen her wear it often, and generally when she came to our house—she had such a white gown as this—it is made of jaco<lb></lb>net muslin—this is the way it was made—she wore it when she used to go with us to Gravesend—I have seen her several times in it—she had a white veil, but I cannot swear to this—this black veil is like hers—she had a black lace veil like this—it was dotted exactly like this, and there was a tear in it, which is here—it has been mended—that enables me to recollect it distinctly.</p>

I was in the cell with Greenacre, at the police-office at High street, on Saturday morning, the 1st of April—he began talking first about people coming in to look at him—he said, "This affair has caused a great deal of excitement; more, I be<lb></lb>lieve, than any that has transpired in London or the country for some time"—he said, "Many people run away with the idea that this was moved in a cart"—I said, "What, you mean the body?"—he said, "Yes; but it was not; it was moved in a cab"—I said, "Was it on the same night that the affair happened that it was removed?"—</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the public office, Marylebone. I attended the examination concerning the two prisoners—I have a statement here which was made by the prisoner Greenacre—nothing was said by the Magistrate, or any person, by way of promise or threat, to induce him to make that statement—it was his own voluntary statement—I took it down—I did not read it over to him at that time—I did afterwards at a subsequent examination—he then acknowledged it, and signed it—the female prisoner also made a statement in her behalf—I read it over to her, and she signed it—she very well understood what it was—these are the statements—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)</p>
               <p>"The prisoner Greenacre says: There have been many direct falsehoods given—the key I have had twenty years—I did not tell her brother that we had had words—I told him distinctly that we had no words on the subject—I questioned her about the property, and I found that she was a loose woman—she had put up two silk gowns to me at a tally-shop—there had been duplicity on both sides—there are many coinciding circumstances that may perhaps cost me ray life—one of the witnesses has stated that I helped her to move her boxes on Saturday; that is true—I had this female lodging in a room, and she washed and cooked for me—I gave her notice to leave previous to Mrs. Brown's coming home, and she left—Mrs. Brown came down to my house on Saturday night—she was rather <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>, from drinking in the morning—in treating the coachman she had made herself <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—then at night, being Christmas eve, she insisted on having some rum, and had a great deal to her tea—I thought that a favourable opportu<lb></lb>nity to press her for a statement of her circumstances, and she seemed</p>

               <p>reluctant to give me any answer; and I told her that she had often dropped insinuations in my hearing about hating property to go into business, and she had said that she could command 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at any time—I told her I had made some inquiry relative to her character, and I had ascer<lb></lb>tained that she had been to Mr. Smith's in Long Acre, a tally-shop, to en<lb></lb>deavour to procure silk gowns in my name—when I put those questions to her, she pat on a feigned laugh, and retaliated, by saying she thought I was deceiving her by misrepresenting the extent of my own property—during this conversation she was reeling backwards and forwards in her chair, which was on the swing; and, as I am determined to adhere strictly to the truth, I must say that I pot my foot to the chair—it was just after we had concluded tea, and she went back with great violence against a chump of wood that I had been using of, and that alarmed me very much—I went round the table, and took her by the hand, and kept shaking her, and she appeared entirely gone—as it regarded my own feelings, it is impossible for me to give any thing like a description, from the agitation I was in at the time—during this state of excitement I deliberated, and came to the determination of concealing her death is the manner it has been already laid before the world—I thought I might be more safe that way, than if I gave an alarm of what had occurred, because if I had, I thought I might be considered her mur<lb></lb>derer—no other individual had the least knowledge of what I have now stated—this female, who is here, I perfectly exonerate—she was away from the house—this took place in Carpenter's-buildings, Camberwell—some days afterwards, when I had put away the body, I called on this woman, and solicited her to return to her apartment Again—as regards her things and her trunks, I told this woman that, as she had left them there, we would pledge them—the whole of them fetched about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not knew any thing more that I have got to say—she had eleven sovereigns and two or three shillings—that is a true statement of the facts—It was Christmas eve it happened—we had tea about seven or eight o'clock, and it was that evening I called on Mrs. Davis to stop their going to church—there was no quarrel at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Gale, says, "I have nothing to say—I know nothing about it—I was not at Camberwell at that time—those two rings that was taken from me, one of them I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for in the City, twelve months ago, and the other, my little boy, who was digging in the garden, found, with a half sovereign, two half-crowns, and a five-shilling piece, and six<lb></lb>pennyworth of halfpence—the ear-drops have been my own for this seven or eight yean—in regard to the shoes, Mrs. Andrews gave me the ticket, and the other ticket I found in the street near our own house—Mr. Greenacre told me I must leave hit house a fortnight before Christmas, but I could not suit myself with lodgings till the Wednesday or Thurs<lb></lb>day following—I returned back on Monday-week following the Thursday—he said the correspondence was broken off between him and Mrs. Brown, and he wished me to come back again—That is all I have to say."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the eye totally displaced, or did it remain void of its humours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It remained void of its humours—there were several lacerations on the face—one a sort of crescent-like laceration on the cheek, and a contort wound on the lower jaw—the crescent-like wound, I conceive, was pro duced by incision—the one on the lower jaw, by being jammed—both the lower jaws were fractured—my opinion is, all the wounds I have de<lb></lb>scribed, except on the eye, were inflicted after death—on the top of the head there was a bruise also, which had occurred after death—I did not observe any other wound on the head at the time I am speaking of which was at our workhouse, on the 7th of January—I examined the neck at the dead-house, and found the body of the fifth <hi rend="italic">cervical vertebra</hi> had been sawn through and disarticulated at the transverse processes—that is it had been disjointed about five of the bones of the neck down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would such a saw as the one produced, effect the severance of the head in the manner you have described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it would—I have seen this saw since applied to the two bones, and it fits exactly—I kept the head in our dead-house until night, and had the key of it my self—I then went over with the policeman, and it was removed to my house, which is opposite the workhouse—I then packed it in a small hamper myself, tied it up, and put my own seal upon it, and gave it to two policemen, a sergeant of the K division and a common policeman—it was taken from my house that night to Paddington workhouse—I saw it again there about half-past ten o'clock next morning—the hamper was then as I had left it, with my seal untouched—I then examined the bead more carefully, in company with Mr. Gird wood—I was present when be ex amined it, and appearances were then made obvious which were not appa rent before—the right ear had a notch in it—I think it was the right ear—the head is here—we examined the wounds which I have described, and, came to the conclusion that the wounds I have said were inflicted after death were so, and that the other, the eye, was inflicted before death—we then proceeded to open the head—there was a wound on the back part of the head—I could perceive that, on opening it—there was no bruise on the outside—it was an effusion of blood—there was no bruise on the outside but an internal wound, which I could only discover by opening the head—it was between the integuments and the skull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you able to judge whether that wound had been inflicted before or after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, from its appearance, it had been inflicted before death—I cannot say whether it had any necessary union or concurrence with the blow in the eye; but I should think if a blow was struck in the eye, and the back part of the head came in contact with any thing, it would produce it—I applied the head to the body that was at the workhouse, and the one fitted the other exactly—it appeared tome that he throat had been cut—the head was perfectly bloodless—all the blood</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030055"></xptr>
               <p>was perfectly exhausted—I had nothing to do with the body, but the bead was entirely free from blood—the were entirely free from blood—I do nut think that effect likely to have been produced if the throat had been cut after the subject was dead.</p>

I am a surgeon of the parish of Paddington—I am not a member of the College of Surgeons—I passed my examination at Edinburgh—I have been practising as a surgeon twelve years—I examined the head of a female at Paddington workhouse, on Sunday the 8th of January—Mr. Birtwistle was present at the time, alio Mr. Lucas, and some other medical men—there are three published doc* ments, which I drew up at the time—they are copies of my original notes—I have not the original notes with me—they have all been published—the first was made at the inquest—that was before I examined the bed—it had reference to the trunk only—I published an account of the appearances of the head on the very day it was examined, on Monday, the 9th of January; a note of it was given to the churchwardens and to the newspapers—i saw it afterwards in the newspapers—I saw the head on Sunday, the 8th of January, at Mile-end workhouse, and examined it very cursorily—on the 9th, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I went into a more detailed examination—the bead was brought to the work-house during the night—upon examining it on the 9th, the head had the appearance of being that of a female—the nose was slightly flattened about the centre, and it had a slight twist of the tip to the right side—there were several wounds and bruises—there was a large wound on the left cheek, in the shape of a crescent, commencing a short way under the left eye, and terminating on the same level as the mouth, and about a inch or an inch and a half from it—it was an incised wound—it was merely superficial—it entered into the <hi rend="italic">cellular membrane</hi> and the fat underneath-in my judgment that wound was inflicted after death—there was under that wound, a large contused wound over the lower jaw—the jaw was there fractured—that injury, in my judgment, was inflicted after death-on the other side of the face there was another contused wound, at the right angle of the lower jaw; there, too, the bone on that side was broken—on that side, too, there was a wound, partly contused and partly in-incised, and which opened right through into the mouth—(those two lit ter injuries were sustained after death)—it opened right through into the mouth, and by that means made the mouth larger, continuing the moots along the cheek; several of the teeth of the upper jaw were forced out and the tongue was crushed between them—that appeared to me all part of the same injury—the right eye had received a blow—there was a wound in the eye itself, above the pupil, which had entered into the eye, and occasioned the escape of the humours of the eye around the eye, above-below, and there was a mark, a round <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi>, surrounding the eye; presenting the appearance not of an ordinary, but of an extraordinary black eye; as to its severity—it was of the same species—I might call it what would follow a black eye, but to a considerable extent—within the area of this bruised appearance there were three small superficial wounds; was external to the orbit of the eye, one was superior to the orbit of the eye, and the other was situated on the side of the nose, and exposed the bone of the nose.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, was the injury you have described to the eye, in<lb></lb>flicted during the life of the party, or after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe the wound in the eye, and the bruise around it, to have been inflicted during life, and I believe also the three small wounds I have alluded to, to have been inflicted after death—the circumstance of the eye being ruptured would imply great force—it might be the result of a blow with the fist of a person—I think it could not be referable to a blow with a dull weapon—there was no mark on the surface of abrasion—abrasion is more likely to follow a blow by a bludgeon than a blow by a hand—I mean abrasion of the skin—it is almost impossible to say whether it was inflicted with a fiat or instrument—I could not form any definite opinion—a blow struck with the violence I judge this to have been inflicted with, would certainly deprive the party so struck of sense for the moment, and at the moment, for a time—the length of time it would do so depends entirely on the individual—one person would bear a blow very differently to another—it depends on the effect produced on the nervous system, on the vital energies of life—this being a female subject, it is very possible the blow would deprive her of senses, so as to enable further injury to be given to her during that period of insensibility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing, on the blow being struck in front, the back of the head was to be driven in contact with any thing, would that tend to increase the period for which insensibility would follow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it very likely—there were two appearances behind, which I have not yet described, on the crows of the head—it was a large contused wound—that is all—it was two wounds together—there were two bruised surfaces coming into one another continuous—they had been done'after death—it was a semilunar wound, having two tail, as I may say—on turning back the scalp, which we cat through from ear to ear, by cutting a little and exposing the upper part of the skull, on the pos—I tenor surface on the left side in the <hi rend="italic">cellular</hi> membrane, underneath the skin, and in those muscular fibres called the <hi rend="italic">occipilo-frontalis</hi> muscle, existed an <hi rend="italic">ecchymose</hi> appearance—I opened the head, and found an internal in<lb></lb>jury corresponding with the outside—on the outer covering of the brain, called the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, there existed a slight redness, an unnatural redness, not visible any where else—that was opposite to the place where the <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi> appeared—that was so far a serious injury that serous effusion on the dura mater indicated a disturbance within.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, was there, in your judgment, any connexion between the injury in the eye and that at the back of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not but think that the one was the result of the other—that the appearances behind were the result of the injury in front—that is on the supposition that the head, when struck in front, came in contact with some resisting body—there was this relation between the two injuries, that it was on the opposite side of a round body, and a round body struck on one side, if opposed by striking against something, will show that something has struck there—the external appearance of the skull would not be caused by the blow in front, sup posing it did not strike against any thing at all—the internal derangement which was presented, might have been the result of a blow in front, sup<lb></lb>posing the back of the head did not come in contact with any thing—by the derangement, I mean the slight redness on the dura mater, as well as the disturbance which that intimated—the appearance in the eye could not possibly be caused by a blow struck at the back of the head—whether that injury was by a "blow, a fall, or any other means, it could not have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030058"></xptr>
               <p>caused the appearances in front—I afterwards proceeded to examine the throat—the head had been separated from the trunk at the fifth bone of the neck, which was sawn through—not entirely, but partly—I have fitted the saw produced, to the bone, and it appeared to me to correspond—the greater part of the anterior portion of the bone was sawn through, and the other part of it appeared to have been broken off—the posterior part—it was sawn nearly through from the front, and then broken off—there was no appearance of discolouration of the neck—the fleshy part of the neck appeared to have been cut with a sharp instrument—such an instrument as this (<hi rend="italic">looking at the knife</hi>) would be adapted to the purpose—it is something in the form of a surgical knife—it has a spring at the back which makes the blade firm—the muscles where they were divided were very much retracted—the muscles do retract for some time after death—as long as warmth continues, or until the rigidity of death begins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to meet a violent death suddenly, being in good health at the time, how long would that state of the muscles which would cause them to retract, continue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak from experience, but I should say it would continue some time of course—in all states after death, this retraction of the muscles will continue some time—certainly some hours—but the retracting power, which is often very strong at the moment of death, gets less and less every hour, and at last ceases—it would be less, too, if much blood was lost at the moment of death—the retracting power would continue for a shorter time, inasmuch as the body would sooner get cold and rigid—I found all the large blood-vessels of the head empty, and the same as to the trunk—there were other wounds about the neck, independent of that which severed it from the body, but they were all part of the same attempt in cutting the neck—the superficial cut was very ragged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We have not yet got to that—independent of the cutting of the neck, did you find some superficial cutting about the neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the to<lb></lb>mination of the wounds which were carried round and round the neck—the neck was evidently cut in front at first—the first incision commencing on the left side, in the fold which exists where the bead joins the neck, high up, exactly here (<hi rend="italic">putting his finger uider hit ear</hi>)—it passes along the fold in front of the neck, behind this ear, and terminates on the right side—that cut was not continuous round the neck—the continuation of the cut appears to have been jagged on the right side—the division of the muscles becoming now deeper and deeper, and at the same time lower down the neck, so that the incision which has cut through the windpipe, is full two inches under the first superficial incision which I have already described—this cut through the windpipe has cut also through the carotid arteries, and it is on a level with the division of the vertebra—there is a superficial cut high up in front, not penetrating the windpipe; and two inches below that, there is the main cut, which sepa<lb></lb>rated the head from the body—there is thus left a flap of skin in front adhering to the trunk—that would have supplied the space between the two cuts, and then the posterior cut of the skin coming round on the right side leaves a flap, about two inches long, adhering to the neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do these circumstances denote that there was an attempt to cut the throat, and inflict a slight injury, in addition to the main cut which divided the head from the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot form any opinion positively on that point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it the appearance suggested to you? was it that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030059"></xptr>
               <p>an unskilful man had attempted to separate the head after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The suggestion I formed, having seen a wound in the eye which might or might not prove mortal, was, that the cut in the throat certainly must have proved mortal—the cut above was certainly the first cut; and the cut must have been inflicted during life, or very shortly after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have described to us now all the wounds you perceived, both externally and internally, on the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I can recollect—I do not recollect having omitted any thing—I examined the brain, but I have not been asked to give any account of its appearance—there were two large bruised wounds on the outside of the head, which I have mentioned, and one partly bruised and partly incised; and there was the large double wound I have mentioned on the top of the head—bruise and contusion are synony<lb></lb>mous terms—it depends entirely on the force with which a bruise or contusion has been given, whether they will show <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi>—bruise and contusion being synonymous terms, if either one or the I other is inflicted with sufficient force, they will produce <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi>—a contusion after death will not produce the appearance called <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi>—a contusion or bruise might effect a lodgment of blood within the head, or it might not—it would not under the bone—a blow on the back of the head may cause a lodgment of blood within the head—it may do so under the bone, but not a great lodgment of blood know no means how it could escape, except by absorption—blood, when dislodged, is not obedient to the law of gravitation in a living body, not to any extent—it is subject to the law of gravitation as far as the law of gravitation can be allowed to have its effect in a living body—a liv<lb></lb>ing body has the means of disposing of a lodgment of blood, which the dead body is without—in any part—you are not alluding to the cranium—I beg leave to say, a lodgment of blood in the cranium could not take place to any great extent—an internal effusion of blood, caused by a blow on the back of the head, would be likely to find a lodgment either in the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> or in various parts of the brain—it entirely depends on the peculiarity of the individual, wherever the vessel happened to give way which effused the blood—I never knew a blow on the skull inflict a wound exactly on the opposite side of the skull—a blow on the back part of the head might produce injury exactly opposite, within the skull, a <hi rend="italic">contre coup</hi>, but not the eye, which is without the skull—the venous portion of the eye would not be the natural position for blood lodged in the cavity of the brain to escape—a blow received behind, will inflict injury in front—the cause of that injury in front would be, as to its effect, in a mechanical manner—if you strike one part of a circle, then the whole of that circle will be dis turbed, and it will occasionally produce fracture of the skull in the oppo site part; but in most cases the fracture is received behind, as blows generally are given in front.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long will the head of a human being, after death, generally speaking, be capable of <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said, you cannot produce the phenomena of ecchymosis on a dead body—it is impossible to do so, although warm—a blow given half an hour after death, would communicate avidity on the surface—I am speaking from experiment, from my own knowledge of the fact—you will have a discolouration of the surface—I did not describe the black eye as discolouration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the difference between lividity and a black eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> in a black eye, you have a phenomena of <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi> which you do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030060"></xptr>
               <p>have in the dead body—the <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi> of a bruise or contusion consists in having blood effused in all the tissues which have been interested in the blow—there is also the existence of blood throughout those membranes, in the minutest blood vessel (by membrane, I mean tissue) which in health do not contain this red blood—there is also the existence of swelling—there are some other phenomena, but these three are the important ones—there is at times a yellow colour round the external edge of the <hi rend="italic">ecchmosis</hi> what we call a black eye will sometimes not be apparent at first—then in a black eye which will not assume that appearance, until a considerable time after the blow—I never saw a black eye that did not immeadiately afterwards assume that appearance I mean the puffiness—the outer skin va ries a little in different persons—a blow on the chest of a person who has considerable flesh between the muscles and the cuticle, might not be ecchy<lb></lb>mosed—if the skin be thin, <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi> may be almost instantaneous, but you are supposing cases which I have not seen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to the neck, I think you have elsewhere described, that the section which removed the head proceeded across the neck ante<lb></lb>riorly through the skin, immediately under the fold formed by the junction of the chin with the neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not immediately, but under it—I am the author of the report of the examination of the head of the female, in the medi<lb></lb>cal Gazette—I do not wish to correct that statement—there is no correction necssary—what I have said here is but a different mode of expressing the same thing—the posterior cut of the neck was exactly on a line with the section of the vertebral column.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long in your opinion will blood generally flow after immediate death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There have been experiments to show that blood will flow for many hours after death—I think blood will flow for several hours from a vessel divided after death—there is an experiment to prove what you wish—I think it is sixteen hours—I am not quite sure; I talk only from memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then during that time, the blood vessels of the head might be emp tied by severing the head from the trunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The large vessels—it might or might not—but that would depend on the death of the party, the ok time the blood coagulates, and a variety of circumstances—I have no experiment to prove in how long the head might be emptied by severance after death; I cannot speak from experience—I cannot say whether the wound which occasioned the division of the head from the trunk, was done in great haste—I really cannot judge of haste.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it done as a surgeon would do it in any experiment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are quite of opinion that the fifth vertebra was sawn through? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am quite sure of that—I have them to show that fact—I divided the portion of the <hi rend="italic">cervical</hi> column, which was left on the head, the bones called the vertebral column, that is, the <hi rend="italic">cervical</hi> vertebra which is attached to the head, the four and three quarters which is attached to the head—the fifth was sawn through—I did not myself divide it—it was done by my orders, in my presence, and I think I assisted—we took it off at the atlas—I am not certain that that now forms one end of the portion of the column I have here—it may or may not—it may have been removed, but at the time it was severed, 1 think it did—I think the <hi rend="italic">dentatus processus is</hi> still attached to the column—I think that portion of the column was left perfect, but I have not examined it since—I have never taken the trouble to divide the column longitudinally nor transversely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you can give us no account of the state of the spinal marrow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030061"></xptr>
               <p>not in that part of the column—we looked into the spinal marrow—I have the means of knowing if the spine was injured—I saw the marrow at the end of the column where it was sawn across—but I have not traced it through its course—it is now lodged in the column of the body—I do not know whether any thing has been done with it, and the bones that were removed—the <hi rend="italic">cervical</hi> spine has been sawn through—I have examined the bones externally, and had there been any injury inflicted by any external cause, it would have produced some injury in the bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it possible for the spinal marrow to be injured without leaving appearances on the bone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When you talk of possibility, it is possi<lb></lb>ble, for instance, a needle might be introduced to the spinal marrow—there was no injury that I am aware of to the spinal marrow—it could not re<lb></lb>ceive any injury that I am aware of to occasion death—there was not the slightest injury in the parts—an accident creating pressure on the spinal chord would occasion death certainly—T should ascertain that fact by ex<lb></lb>mining the marrow, but I might not ascertain it by doing so—by ex<lb></lb>amining, I may perceive an injury, and I may not perceive it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A person might die from injury to the spinal marrow, and leave no trace behind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a locked jaw there is no appearance whatever—there would be an appearance of fixedness—there are no appearances, that I know of, in persons dying of hydrophobia—there might be this injury to the spinal marrow, or nervous system—I mean injury to one of the nerves of the thumb, which sometimes will occasion a locked jaw—a locked jaw is an injury to the nervous system—there might be pressure on the spinal chord, and death not ensue; but it might so happen that death may ensue from it—an injury of the spinal marrow might produce death, or it might not—an injury to the spinal marrow in one part might product instant death; but I do not think it could be produced without producing tome effusion round it, which would be of a bloody character, or of a serous character—I mean around the spinal marrow externally—if the spinal marrow was injured at its juncture with the brain, a small injury might occasion instant death; but if you examine that body after death, I think you will find perhaps a very small blood-vessel, or effusion of blood, or you might have the spinal marrow itself shortened or slackened—I exa mined the neck on Monday the 9th of January—I had seen it before, but I examined it anatomically on the 9th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said that the external appearance would be slight—is it possible that the immersion of the head, and its remaining in the water for eight or ten days, would have rendered the detection of that injury more difficult or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it would make any difference—you are alluding to the injury of the spinal marrow, taking place where I have named—I should think it would be necessary to examine the marrow itself, to be able to say positively that a person died of injury to the spinal marrow—a blow on the back of the neck might be capable of killing, but it depends entirely on what the blow is—any blow may be capable of killing which at all shakes the vital spark; not that shakes the spinal marrow—a blow on the stomach might cause instant death—I have said almost all blows of any great severity may be mortal—it all depends on whe ther they affect a vital part—I think it very possible that a blow disordering he spinal marrow, would occasion death, but I cannot imagine a blow being given in such a case without having external appearances—I cannot imagine a blow to have occasioned such an injury to the spinal marrow as to occasion death, which would not show it after death—I certainly have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030062"></xptr>
               <p>no right to infer things are not possible, because I have not met with them—I am talking generally from what I have observed and experienced—I cannot conceive violent muscular action of the neck, capable of causing death—I do not see where the injury could be effected by the muscular action of the neck—violent muscular action of the neck will not disorder the os <hi rend="italic">coccygis</hi>—I never knew the thigh broken by the action of the nuclei.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will suppose a case of a man balancing on a chair, and losing his equilibrium, might not the muscular operation of the neck in endeavouring to recover itself, inflict an injury on the neck of the person so as to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot imagine such a case—I am not at all aware of any thing likely to produce such a circumstance—I cannot conceive a case of the sort—I know no case at all like what you describe—it might injure a fibre or ligament—the muscle confining the <hi rend="italic">dentatus processes</hi> is a very strong one—if that ligament was ruptured, it might occasion death—if it permitted the spinal marrow to be injured, in all probability it would occasion death—the <hi rend="italic">dentatus processus</hi> is not the next vessel to the spat, it is the axis on which the head turns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing what the learned gentleman has supposed to take place, would it leave any external appearance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the spinal marrow it would, but not on the surface of the skin—that injury had not happened—if it had, I should have detected it in examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you do not think such an injury could occur, so as to affect or injure the spinal marrow, without leaving an appearance on the external part of the bone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the termination of the spinal marrow was examined, where it joins the brain, and there was no appearance—I am now speaking of the <hi rend="italic">dentatus processus</hi>—I have been confining myself during the whole examination to that exact part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there not other parts of the spinal marrow from the atlas don to the seventh vertebra, the injury of which might occasion death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said an injury to the spinal marrow may or may not produce instant death—it is not very likely it would produce instant death, if it was not at the place I have described—many cases are on record where injuries haw been inflicted in that place, where paralysis of the lower parts hare taken place, and where instant death has not followed, where in fact they ban recovered—I have already said I believe all sorts of accidents may be fatal—it depends on the state of the nervous system.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by all sorts of accidents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Affecting vital parts—injury lower down than the part alluded to, may produce death, as it may so strike the nervous system as that death may immedi-ately follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Even though it should be with reference to that part which, with this particular spine, was still left on the trunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said there was no injury to that—injury might happen to that portion of spine left on the trunk, it by no means follows that death would ensue; but it might take place by its effect on the general nervous system—pulsa<lb></lb>tion ceases instantaneously after death—it is one of the three great links that connect life together—death cannot be instantaneously detected—to consti<lb></lb>tute death there must be no pulsation; but that does not imply that you have discovered that death exists—if I was Called to a dead body, I should not like to decide on that person being dead until I had examined other things than simply pulsation.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a Physician, residing in Euston-square—I also lecture on chemistry and forensic medicine. The stomach of the deceased was brought to me by Mr. Guy, a student of the school—he is in attendance—I proceeded to examine and analyze the contents—on opening the stomach I found it to contain a quantity of mat, which I supposed to be either pork or beef—it was preserved pork or beef, potatoes and pastry, also a quantity of fluid; the whole mixture having a spirituous smell—the stomach in its appearance was healthy; at one part there being a slight redness, which generally accompanies the process of healthy digestion—with regard to the attempt to distinguish what description of spirit it was, we could only come to the general conclusion of negative evidence, that it was not whiskey, and it was not rum—my reason for coming to that conclusion is this, that on exposing whiskey or rum to the atmosphere, they still have their odour for some time; but with regard to gin, that is not applicable I put this circumstance to the test, whether by exposing those liquors to the at-mosphere they would leave any portion of smell behind—both whiskey and rum did, while gin did not—it was but a small portion of spirit, in conse quence of the small amount of fluid contained in the stomach—I should say it was certainly not sufficient to cause intoxication—I should conceive that the digestion was about half completed only—I made no other observ</p>

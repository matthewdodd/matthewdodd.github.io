               <p>Charles Capper. On the 2d of May, about 8 in the evening, I was sitting in a little room joining to my shop, I heard the window break, I went into the shop, and saw the handkerchiefs move in the window; I unchained the door: there is a turning at the corner of my shop, that is call'd the New Rents; I went up that court after them; when I came almost to the upper end, I saw them push forward; I called out, stop thief; Child turned hastily to me, and said, where is he? where is he? which is he? I took hold on his collar, and said, I think you are one, I'll take you at a Venture.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you see?</p>
               <p>Capper. I saw but two ; I took Child into my shop, and sent for a constable, and left him in his care, and went up to the Place where I took him, and there I found these handkerchiefs, and brought them into the shop. (Produced in court and deposed to)</p>
               <p>Q. How far from your window did you find the handkerchiefs ?</p>
               <p>Capper. About 100 yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did these handkerchiefs lie in your shop?</p>
               <p>Capper. They had lain all that day in the window close to the glass for show. The prisoner at first, said, he was going home, and went there to ease himself, (it is thorough-fair) but when I found the handkerchiefs and shew'd them to him, he confess's, that he, the other prisoner, and one Low, had been together all day, that they had been to a person that owed Hall some money, and they could not get it, and Hall said, he would have money, or money's worth, before he went home. That he himself was not the man that broke the window, but he stood by and took the handkerchiefs after Hall had taken them out, and ran away with them. We took up Hall about 3 days after, and had him examin'd before the Justice; there I heard him confess, that he was a party concern'd in taking the handkerchiefs, saying he deliver'd them to Child.</p>

            . I live over-against the prosecutor; I happened to be looking out at my window above stairs; about eight o'clock that night I saw three men by the prosecutor's window, two of them stood very close together, I heard the glass break, after they had broke the glass one of them put his arm one way and the other to break it on each side: two of them ran up the New-Rents, and the other was pulling at the window for a considerable time, I thought he was pulling at the iron bar that goes cross the window; there were a candle or two in the shop, and a lamp at the next shop, but I cannot take upon me to say, the prisoner's were two of them. I saw Mr. Capper come out of his little room into the shop, then the two were gone; then I went down stairs, and Child was taken by Mr. Capper and brought into his shop. He went on and confirmed the account given by the other two.</p>

               <p>Monday is generally a loose day, I went to see a cozen of mine, and coming down St. Martin's-le-grand, I believe it might be about seven or eight o'clock; I went up this turning to ease myself, I saw two men push by me, before I had-buttoned my breeches up, they cried stop achieves, I said? which is he, which is he? the prosecutor said, I'll take care of you; to be sure I was in liquor, but as for owning any thing, I did not.</p>

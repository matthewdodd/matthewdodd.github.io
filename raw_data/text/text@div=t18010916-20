             sworn - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner; I searched him at the watch-house, at Covent Garden; I found a great number of duplicates, among which, was one of a watch; I took it to Mr. Rochfort's, and the young man produced that watch; when I found the duplicate, the prisoner said it was his master's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing, before that, to induce him to confess? - A. No, I did not. (The watch was deposed to by Mr. Hinde).</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written paper, stating his contrition for the offence he had committed, that he was upon board wages, which he had not received for eight or nine weeks, having applied to his master for it in vain, till being almost in a state of starvation, he was tempted to pledge them till he could get the payment of his wages.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hinde. I constantly paid him his wages before-hand, upon his application, before they were due; I had lost a great number of things at different times; he has been dabling in the lottery.</p>

            . I am one of the City-police, No. 45 - I was in Cheapside on the 17th of February, in the afternoon, between four and five - I saw the two prisoners within a few doors of <placeName id="t18340220-156-crimeloc906">Milk-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18340220-156-crimeloc906" type="placeName" value="Milk-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where was the handkerchief found? A. The handkerchief and the prisoner Turner were given into my hand at the same time by a young man, who stopped him - I did not know the prisoners before, but I never lost sight of them - I saw Turner stopped - I was about fifteen yards off - I raised a cry - I was first in the pursuit - two or three who joined in the pursuit, were between me and Turner, before he was stopped - I saw the handkerchief during the whole time in Turner's hand - the street was not crowded - it was rather clear - I have not known them before - I had not been watching them.</p>
               <p>Turner. He did not find it on me - he says it was between four and five o'clock, and it was about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>P. H. PARISH. I do not exactly know whether it was in the afternoon or no - I have had several cases of the sort, and not putting the time down in my book, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Will you swear it was not later than four in the afternoon? A. I will not swear to the time - I have been seven years in the police - I think I have only had one such case as this - there is a hole in this handkerchief - I called after the gentleman, but he might not have heard me - I was hoarse at the time - my voice was more like a woman's - I swear I saw the handkerchief in Turner's hand, but not that I saw him drop it.</p>

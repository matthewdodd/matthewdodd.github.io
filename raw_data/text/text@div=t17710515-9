The next day I went into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150014"></xptr> kitchen, I saw the outside window shutter had been forced, the bolt was broke off, the sash could then be lifted up; the kitchen was bolted on the outside: there was a window that had a glass casement that was broke, so that I supposed somebody got through that hole into a back place, where I keep coals; then they got into the house, and unbolted the kitchen door, which was bolted on the outside.

             and myself, and Bailiss, were drinking at the Shepherd and Goat, at Fleet Ditch, between twelve and one o'clock; we went from there to the Coach and Horses, outside Temple Bar, there we sat and drank four or five half pints of rum; we went from there about half after two, towards Leicester Fields; then we went down a street, at the bottom of it Ibbert bid me stop, opposite the watchman's box, accordingly I sat down just opposite the watchman's box, and went to sleep; Ibbert ran to me, and asked me what I was about; I asked him where Bailiss was; Bailiss, said he, why you are in a trance; mind what you are about, says he, and if the watchman comes, whistle: he went away, and I sat down and went to sleep again: in about half an hour the watchman came up, I seeing him ran home directly, and went to bed; I waked about eight in the morning, and found the goods upon a chest, I had left the door open. I put them into the chest, and locked it. I spoke to Murphy, and told him I should be obliged to him to find any body to buy the goods; he asked me, if they were stolen; I did not tell him whether they were or not; I said he need not be afraid, nothing should hurt him; he said he knew one or two which could buy them of me. I appointed to meet him at the Swan in Salisbury Court; accordingly he brought a Jew and another man there, and went up with Bailiss to look at the things, Bailiss came along with the Jew; they went to my lodgings, at a court in Fleet-street, the Hole in the Wall Court; I was drinking at the Swan door at the same time. Mr. Phillips and some other constables came in. Ibbert said, we had better go off; I am afraid there is something the matter.</p>

               <p>Q. What are your reasons for thinking so?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Because we were all out together.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose?</p>
               <p>Jameson. With an intent to break open a house.</p>

               <p>Q. What time the next morning did you see Murphey?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see either Ibbert or Bailiss before you saw him?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Yes; about half an hour after nine I saw Ibbert.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Ibbert's business?</p>
               <p>Jameson. To see and get the goods off; he asked me if I could tell who would buy them; I said I would speak to Murphey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first time you had been concerned?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No, once before.</p>

               <p>Jameson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Murphey?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Next day, at a slop-shop in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask Ibbert how they got at them?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I asked what they had got: they said a quantity of linen; I told him I did not untie them, but put them in the chest just as they were brought; he asked me to get somebody to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where or how he got them?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I had not time then; Ibbert fell a swearing at me for running away and leaving them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to have the money they were to be sold for?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Ibbert and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you two to divide all the money?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nobody else to have any share in it?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not Bailiss?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No; he said Bailiss had nothing to do with the robbery; and if it lay in his power he would not allow him a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Bailiss.</p>
               <p>Jameson. About twelve o'clock at the Swan.</p>
               <p>Q. Not see him; you mean till he, Murphy, and the Jew came there.</p>
               <p>Jameson. I saw him at the Swan before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and Bailiss then?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Nothing about the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him you had seen Murphey?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No; he had a person with him; he gave me the wink to say nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you all met at the Swan you say the Jew and Murphy went to see the linen?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Bailiss to go?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I desired him to see me done justice to. They were taken up and carried to Sir

I cannot swear to Bailiss.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150016"></xptr> I can to Ibbert and Murphy. Some of them asked me if I would help them to carry the bundles. I went directly to Mr. Wood, and told him I had met these fellows with three large bundles upon their head. It was at Breams-buildings, Chancery-lane, that I met them. I told Wood of it, and told him I believed it was Bailiss. I bid him go to his house; he said he did know where he lived. I met Ibbert again in the afternoon. I said, Charles, how do you do? have you sold the goods? he said, Will you buy them? I said, How much will it come to? do you think twenty pounds? he said he did not know, he would speak to the rest of the company. I mentioned Jameson and Murphy.</p>

I asked them to shew me the way: Murphy and Bailiss went with me, I bid a porter watch to see what house I went into, and then send to Phillips, Wood, and the rest, to take them.

I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out some money, and then a bank note, and put it in my pocket again; I said I could go and get more money, if one or two hundred pounds, I could get it.

            . I saw Bailiss in the morning at the picture shop in Fleet-street. I did not offer to meddle with him, we spoke to each other. I was much surprized to see him in the room, as I never heard any thing amiss of him; he and Murphy both stood up against the side of the chimney. I asked what cloth they had there. Upon the bed I found this pistol (producing it) in a handkerchief, and a gold laced hat with it. I was informed the lodgings belonged to Murphy and Ibberts.</p>
               <p>Bailiss's Defence.</p>
               <p>Upon Monday the twenty second of April I think, I went to Westminster-hall, in order to attend a trial for my master Mr. How, to oppose the discharge of one Web a prisoner in Newgate, who was about to receive the benefit of the insolvent act; my lord Mayor was brought up that day in order to be admitted to bail, which occasioned me to stay there till about four in the afternoon, after that I came away with the plantiff in the action to Salisbury Court. I said to him I wish you would call upon Mr. How, and tell him I was obliged to stay so long. I went to the Swan to dinner, there I met Murphy, whom I knew when in his clerkship; he asked me to go to his lodgings to see the delivery of some goods, which he said were run goods. I went up into the room, the Jew was standing there, he said where are these goods, Murphy said here they are. I thought it proper to bring a friend with me to see the delivery<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150018"></xptr> of them; they began to talk about the price, they asked me my opinion, I said these goods are worth a great deal more if they are honestly come by. I had not been there long before up came the constables. Mr. Wood said to me how came you here. I told him the story. I never was there before. I have had the best of education. I have been bred up to the law. I have been in London about five years. I have always been in place, and kept the best of company, and avoided bad, as far as lay in my power. I have several gentlemen in court to prove it. I hope the court will consider it where my life is at stake. I am as innocent of the fact as any person can be.</p>

            . I am a weaver, I was plantiff against one Webb. I was on the twenty second of February last with Bailiss, who is clerk to Mr. How upon that business. I went with him about nine in the morning, from Mr. How's, his masters house; we finished the business about three o'clock. I left Mr. Bailiss about four. I parted with him in Fleet street.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WATSON. I am an apprentice to Mr. Sirdefield. I was engaged at the time these women came in cutting a man off a handkerchief; directly I was disengaged I came to the women; I shewed them a quantity of prints but none of them seemed to take their fancy; they asked me to go to the window to see if there was not something pretty to take their fancy, which I did several times; the prints that I brought from the window did not seem to please them, and they being rather difficult I thought I would not shew them any more; I turned the same goods over again, thinking that might persuade them to take some of the goods I had shewn them before; there was one pattern in particular which I had shewn them, and which I was looking for, which they seemed to like better than any of the rest; I looked for it and could not find it; I observed

               <p>Joseph's Defence. I went into Mr. Sirdefields, I asked for a bit of cotton for an apron; he shewed me the print; I bid him the money; he said he could not take it; I was going out, the gentleman jumped over the counter and said she was going to steal a print; as to this woman I never saw her before in my life.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of October, I apprehended the prisoner; I believe it was at his lodgings; I searched him, and found two guineas and a half in his pocket, and some new cloth, a new pair of shoes, some stockings, and handkerchiefs in the room; when I spoke to him, he said, he had robbed his master of five guineas; I said nothing to him; the prosecutor's wife was in the lodgings; she asked her husband not to hang him; and desired he would tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this in the hearing of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor say, he would, or would not hang him, if he would tell? - I did not hear him say any thing about it; he said, I have not had six guineas, it was only five; he did not say, particularly, how he got them; he said, he had thrown the trunk, but he had not opened it, into an area, in Jermyn-street; the lad began crying, and the old gentleman said, he did not so much care about the money, if he would tell him where the child's trunk was; then we went, and took him with us, to the house in Jermyn-street, where he had thrown the trunk; and as we were going along, he said, several times, he had never opened the trunk, and did not know what was in it; we found the trunk there; it was cut open behind; there was nothing in it; the prisoner continued denying the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220057"></xptr>taking the money; and as we came back, I told him, as he had told his master so much, he might as well tell where the rest of the things were, as he must have cut the trunk open; he did not tell me for a good long while; but just as we got to the place, he said, he had sold them in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Guilty, my lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses? - I have not a friend in the world, but a poor mother; it is the first time I was in custody; I served seven years to his wife before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it is the first fault he was ever guilty of, if you can shew him any favour.</p>

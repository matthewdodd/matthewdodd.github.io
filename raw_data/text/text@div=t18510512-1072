He keeps a receiving-house—we pay money-orders—this letter of advice arrived at the office in due course—it would authorize me in paying 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to James Weir—on 15th April, about eleven o'clock, a person applied for payment of that 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he signed the name of Davis, and I refused to pay him—he went away, taking the order with him, and in about three-quarters of an hour returned with the prisoner—the prisoner then presented the order—I asked him the name of the party that sent him the money; he said, "Scott"—he then signed the order, "James Weir, 30, Drury-lane, Charles-street," and the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given him—some inquiry was soon after made, and I gave a description of the persons to the police.</p>

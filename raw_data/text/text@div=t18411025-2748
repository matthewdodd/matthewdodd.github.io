On Tues<lb></lb>day, the 7th of September, I saw the prisoner near the prosecutor's house, about half-past one o'clock in the day—he was at that time a stranger to me—I went to my own door by accident, and he was standing on the curb, outside Mr. King's door—I told him Mr. King was not at home—he walked up to<lb></lb>wards my door, and said, "Can you tell me what time he will be at home?"—I said, "I do not exactly know, I will ask"—I asked Mrs. Hastings, and she said Mr. King was at home—I then told the prisoner Mr. King was at home, and to go and knock—he knocked twice—Mrs. Simpson then said Mr. King was gone to bed—the prisoner said, "Ah, poor fellow, I will let him have his nap out, and call again in half-an-hour"—on Thursday evening, the 9th, about twenty minutes after nine, I saw the prisoner again—I was standing by my own door, and saw his head peep</p>

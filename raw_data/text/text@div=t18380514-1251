                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist in Ex<lb></lb>mouth-street, Spafields—I have known the prisoner Olley about three years and Clater eight or nine years—Clater rents premises of my father in Spafields, to make up horse medicine—I often saw Olley and him together in business—he appeared to be assisting him and running errands for him—he often came to me to buy drugs for Clater—I am quite sure of his person—he was not dressed then as he is now—he was very shabby—he appeared to have very slight whiskers there, and rather dark than light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is he a married man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say any thing about that—I have not known where he lived—no more than his being with Clater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Clater's Defence</hi>. Olley lived seven years in the house where I lived for twelve years, at Wilson and Co.'s—I assure you he is not guilty of what he is charged with—Mr. S. Wood has said that he came from me—it is no such thing—he came to me, and I recommended him to Mr. Wood to get these articles, and those were the only transactions I had with him—he did not go for goods for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and live in Milton-street, St. Luke's. I have known the prisoner Olley from a child—he lived shopman with me seven years, and bore the best of characters—he has lived in the same house for the last seven years with the people who took the house—he continued there up to the time of his being taken into</p>

               <p>custody—I know his hand-writing well—he has written two or three hun<lb></lb>dred names for me in one day when I carried on the pawnbroker's business—this signature, "Robert Thomas Wood," is not at all like his writing in any way whatever—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the transfer</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that appear to you to be the free and natural hand-writing of a man, or an attempt at disguise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it is a free hand—his is a very stiff hand, as he was in the habit, when with a druggist, of writing on parcels going into the country.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MAULE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that shown to you at the police-office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—there were three shown to me—I did not then say it was a disguised hand—allow me to explain—I said when I saw it that it was not his hand<lb></lb>writing—I saw the next, and if you will show it me I will tell you it very different to that altogether—it seems written by a man very nervous—I said, "That looks like a woman's writing"—another was then shown to me, and I said, "I am satisfied that is not his hand-writing, but a man might disguise his hand"—the second did not look at all like the other, but I cannot say they were done by different people—one signature appeared very different to the others—this is not it, nor this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two</hi>)—I do not profess to be a judge of hand-writing—Olley was apprenticed to a druggist, and I was apprenticed to his brother, who is a pawnbroker—he was seven years in my employ at different times—I was a tailor and clothier at that time—in fact, I kept a sale shop, and sold every thing almost—I have been a publican going on five years—he has not been in my employ during the last three years, not as a hired servant, but he occasionally went on messages or did any thing for me—I never sent him to Clater—I did not know where Clater lived—I never sent him to buy any drugs—I do not know of his wanting any articles in Clater's line during the last three years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the number of years you have known his hand<lb></lb>writing, was it generally uniform, or did it vary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He wrote a stiff sort of hand, and I should say it was all pretty well alike—I never knew him disguise his hand, or attempt it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothes salesman, and live in Golden-lane, St. Luke's. I have known Olley about twenty years—he bore a good cha<lb></lb>racter—I have had opportunities of seeing his hand-writing—not very frequently—I bought goods of him perhaps five or six times—I have seen him write I dare say half a dozen times, and have been able to form a judgment of the general character of his hand-writing—this signature, "Robert Thomas Wood," is not at all like his hand-writing—I have been in the habit of seeing, the writing of different persons in my business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that appear to you the free, unrestrained writing of a man, or a disguised hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I must admit this one appears to me rather dis<lb></lb>guised—it is not at all like Olley's writing—he writes a different character altogether—he has lived five years, to my knowledge, in his last place of abode—I saw him two or three times a week passing by my shop.</p>

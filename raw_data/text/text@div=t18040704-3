               <p>Q. Did you compare it with any linen in your shop? - A. I went and compared it with the linen in my warehouse, and I have no doubt at all it was mine.</p>


               <p>Q. Had the prisoner the liberty to take any part of your linen on his own account? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think is the value of this five yards and a half? - A. Six shillings; I went to the Office in Hatton-garden, and had a search-warrant; I attended the execution of that warrant to the prisoner's lodgings in Tash-street, where his children were, and there I found half a yard of linen, which was cut in what we call sleeve gussets, two yards and a quarter of brown Holland, two yards of jean, five yards and a half of coloured cotton, about a yard of mixed woollen cloth, and sundry remnants of cotton; I knew them to be mine, I have pieces to match in my house that were found in his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man been with you? - A. Some months, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages had he from you? - A. Twenty-nine shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. You have said he had a wife and two children? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. When he asked you to forgive him, did he say any thing more? - A. He only begged and prayed me to forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he has only two children, perhaps he may have more? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many children did you find in his lodgings? - A. There was a young child, and a girl, I suppose she might be eleven or twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. The only reason that induces you to believe that the property found at the prisoner's house is your's, is that it matches with the property at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So it would if you had sold it? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. When this man, Coffey, took this linen from the prisoner, you were outside? - A. The moment Coffey took it, he held it up, and I went in immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards did this piece contain? - A. About twenty-five yards; I cannot say I measured it, it was linen I bought and had it dyed, and there is the man's stamp that dyed it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give him any signal? - A. Yes; nothing further passed, but the man said, I hope you will forgive me; I have had the property in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. You are perfectly sure that no conversation passed between you and the prisoner before Mr. Dixon came in? - A. I am.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live with my matter at Waltham Cross, Cheshunt; his name is John Harvey, he is a farmer. On the 14th of April, I brought two loads of hay to town, to Mr. Sweeden, the salesman, who gave me a note to go to a gin-shop to receive 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on my mas<lb></lb>ter's account—I went and received the money—there were 17 sovereigns, and 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I put it in my purse, all but two shillings, and put the purse into my right-hand trowters pocket—it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I fell in with the prisoner at the Angel, in White-chapel—I had neverseen her before—I went to try and change some halfpence away for silver, and the prisoner offered me a glass of gin; I drank it—I tossed for four pies, and lost 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave the prisoner one pie, and another woman who was with her, and a strange man one, and eat one myself—I was then going to drive home; and on going up Brick-lane, I saw the prisoner on the path, about two-hundred yards from the public-house—she said nothing till I got near the Frying-pan, in Brick-lane—I stopped there, and called for a pint of beer—the prisoner asked what I was going to give her to drink;</p>

               <p>I said, "some beer"—the offier woman was with her then—I drank some, and gave her the pot to drink, and she gave it to the other woman—I palled 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out to pay for it—the prisoner put her hand into my pocket, and drew my purse out—I felt her hand in my pocket, and saw the purse in her hand—I struggled, and as soon as she, turned round, I caught hold of her, and never let her go till the policeman took her—she passed the purse between her legs to three or four more, who received it, and ran up an alley—I saw them run away with it—I hallooed out for assistance, and the policeman came up—I never got my money—I am sure she is the woman, for I never let her go—she tried all she could to get away.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Greenford. At the beginning of last October the prisoner Franklin was my groom, and Hasard was gardener—on the 19th of January Franklin drove me up to town—on the evening before, I had communicated some suspicions to him which I had about the harness, and some other articles which had been missing—I asked him about some property that was lost, but he declared his innocence—I stated about the hay and corn that had been sold, and I mentioned the loss of some lead—I did not mention the harness which he is charged with stealing, as I did not know of it—he absconded the day he drove me up—I did not see him again till he was in custody—this harness was at my country house, at Greenford—he put the horses in the stable at Lon<lb></lb>don, and ran off immediately—I had given neither of the prisoners any authority to sell the property.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>did not lay to whom it belonged till I went to see it—I went to Sir James Leighton's stable, at Greenford, and saw the two prisoners—a person of the name of Bernard went with me—they showed me a brass chariot har<lb></lb>ness incomplete—this is it—Hasard brought it out of the stable—I asked them what they wanted for it, and one of them told me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I cannot say which, I said I would give 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—Hasard said he would not let me have it for that—I said I could not give any more, and then Hasard said I was to take them—I did so—Franklin put the horse in the cart, and put the harness in, and carried it over to my place—I put some of it in, and Franklin put some in—Hasard sold me the harness, and I paid him for it—Franklin told me it belonged to Sir James Leighton—I asked if Sir James had authorised him to sell it—I gave information to Sir James Leighton.</p>

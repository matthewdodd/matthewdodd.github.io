               <p>SAMUEL SHEPPARD. On the 17th of August I was in Gracechurch Street, I saw the prosecutor passing, and the prisoner in company with another was walking closely behind the prosecutor. I followed them about twenty or thirty yards. At the corner of Leadenhall Street I saw the prisoner draw this handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, I saw him tuck it into his bosom I ran and caught hold of him, I called to the prosecutor, and I took the handkerchief out of the prisoner's bosom. I asked the prosecutor if he had lost his handkerchief, he put his hand into his pocket, and said he had, I shewed him the handkerchief, he said it was his. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along Bishopgate Street, there were several people walking. This man accused me of taking the gentleman's handkerchief, I only pulled it out of my pocket to wipe my face with it.</p>

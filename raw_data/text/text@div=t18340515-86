            . I am shopman to Peter Pige, of Swan-street, Bethnal-green. I produce a shawl pawned at our shop by the prisoner, Sarah Baker - I have the counterpart of the duplicate - one of the duplicates produced corresponds with it - it was pawned for 6s. on Saturday night, the 3rd of May, after the gas was lighted, in the name of Ann Baker - she said it was her mother's, and she lived at No. 2, Church-street - I attended, when there was a charge against Dolly, at the office - at the door of the office I saw Sarah Baker - I told an officer, and she was taken into custody - it was between nine and eleven o'clock- our shop is nearly half a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Baker. The pawnbroker did not ask me who sent me to pawn the shawl. Witness. I said, "Whose is this?" - she said, "Whose do you think? - it is my mother's" - I have known her three years.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is her mother likely to be possessed of such a shawl? A. They are working people, but respectable.</p>
               <p>MR. BELL re-examined. This is my shawl - it is worth 30s., and is one of the two I lost that night (looking at the one produced by McKee) - this is my property - I have a private mark on each of them - I invariably attach a small ticket like this for the young men to know, and I attach another private mark which I can swear to - both have my private mark on them, by which I can swear to them - the robbery was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the same private mark used by more than one linen-draper? for instance, I suppose you have been a shopman yourself before you were a master - have you taken for your own private mark any private mark used in that shop? A. No; my private mark was my father's, who has been out of business eighteen years - I never saw the same mark in the trade - it is, "God is my help," and there is a piece of thread besides drawn into the shawl, which I always take off when I sell an article, but my shopmen, I believe, do not - I do not always put the thread on - it is a private mark to prevent my shopmen robbing me.</p>

            , who is a cabinet-maker, and lived in Ingram's-buildings, Willowwalk, but he has removed from there now - I have been the associate of thieves until recently, and concerned in several depredations - I was examined last sessions, and stated several robberies in which I was engaged - I was in custody as a witness, and am now in custody on a charge - on this night three weeks, as near as I can recollect, the three prisoners and another one were in Norton-falgate between seven and eight o'clock - I was on the opposite side, and saw a piece of glass shoved in - I saw the three prisoners and another lurking about - I watched them, and saw Westbrook go and shove the glass - they all three left it for about an hour, or rather better, and afterwards they came and stood under the gateway where I was standing, and looked at me - they went away for about an hour or rather better - I followed them to Sun-street - they came back - then Westbrook went and shoved the glass in more- that was between nine and ten o'clock, or half-past nine- the other prisoner who is not here took the glass out, and went round the corner with it leading to Spital-square - they all came and stood under the gateway - I heard the prisoner, not in custody, say, "We will strip the b - y shop before we leave it," and directly after Dolly and Sully, the one not in custody, crossed over, Sully took out a shawl, and gave it to Dolly, who went round the corner with it to Spital-square - afterwards Westbrook and Gawthorn went up to the window - Gawthorn took out another shawl, and gave it to Westbrook - I gave information immediately to Mr. Bell, and he ran after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you received any assistance since you were here, or before, from the police to enable them to find out offences and prosecute parties? A. No; I have had no money from any policeman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. Thirteen; I am not the associate of thieves now - I have reformed since last sessions - I was not committed for stealing a handkerchief, but for giving it to another boy - I was walking about on the evening in question on no business at all - I was living with my father at the time, he was supporting me - I never slept out a night hardly - I always slept at home - most always - I cannot say how many nights I have slept in Newgate - I have only been in Newgate as a prisoner once - that was two or three sessions ago, on suspicion of stealing a gold watch - I cannot say how long I was in Newgate for it - I think it was more than a week, not so long as a month, before I was tried and acquitted - I was regularly tried and acquitted - I was remanded to Clerkenwell about the watch - I have been kept in the House of Correction for evidence - I was never in the House of Correction on any charge, but for stealing the gold watch - I have been charged with felony twice, I believe - once besides this.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you the associate of thieves before you began to reform? A. Two years; I have got my living by working for my father - I did not leave home when I began thieving - I was thieving when I was living with my father - I worked for my father about two months, and then left him - I never left my father till I was in confinement - I was not employed by any one to watch the prisoners, or any other person - I have never been employed on similar errands - I have not been paid any thing by any body for the information I gave about the prisoners - I have lived with my father until the day before yesterday - I remember being a witness here against the Pickards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, after that, saying, "Did I not do well to transport them all?" A. No; I said nothing of the kind - I have known Westbrook to sell baked potatoes - I do not know that he is a weaver - I was standing in a passage when I saw this business transacted - I was eight or nine yards from them, I should think - I saw distinctly which gave the shawl to the other - I should have gone over to give information, before they took the second shawl; but somebody belonging to them was standing in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, in your deposition, "When the shawl was given to Westbrook he put it into his apron?" A. I saw his apron up, and the shawl was half way out of the window, and I could not see exactly whether he put it under his apron - I swear he had a black apron on that night.</p>

             re-examined. He had an apron on when I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, when first examined, that he drop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150058"></xptr>ped it from under his coat? A. His jacket or apron - I did not mention the apron before; but said, "He dropped it at his feet."</p>

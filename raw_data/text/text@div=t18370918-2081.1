                  </hi>. I live at Upper Clapton in the parish of Hackney. I had a watch on the 11th of August—I believe it was in the parlour, but I was in town—this is my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's cook. The watch was in the dining-room, to the best of my knowledge, on the mantel-piece; but I don't go into the dining-room—we had three servants sitting at tea, and one went to get the water, and saw the prisoner pass by; we went and took her before she got out of the premises—she said she had not got any property—she denied it—and I waited till the other servant went to see if the spoons were safe—they were and then I let the prisoner go—she ran off, I ran after her; and she said she had that about her she ought not, and if I would be quiet she would give it to me—she gave me the watch, and said it was the first thing she ever was guilty of in her life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Directly she came to me, I said I had a watch, and it was not mine; I was going after the person who gave it me to pledge—the servant said if I would return her the watch I might go about my business—she then went and looked after her spoons, and then came and took me—I was quite taken in by this person—I should know the woman among a thousand.</p>

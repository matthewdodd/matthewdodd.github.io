            . I am ward beadle of Walbrook. On Friday evening, the 9th of January, about seven o'clock, I received information, and went to No. 2, Turnmill-lane, and in the area of the house, which is inhabited by Messrs. Lovegrove and Co., I found a bundle, containing a quantity of books in sheets, unbound - it was claimed as the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I live in George-alley, and am street-keeper of Walbrook. Mr. Collins shewed me where this parcel was. I secreted myself in the doorway. About a quarter to seven o'clock I saw the prisoner coming down in a great hurry - he took the parcel up from the area as quickly as possible, and went off very quick, and unless I had been on the alert he would have got off. I sprung out and stopped him. He said a fish-woman told him it was laying there, and he thought he had as much right to it as anybody else. Mr. Green identified it at the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen the fish-woman since. - A. Never. The area has four steps, but he stooped over the rails and took it up. Anybody passing by could see it, if it had been daylight. It might be two feet from the pavement. There is a gas light about two doors off. The area is within one hundred yards of the wharf.</p>

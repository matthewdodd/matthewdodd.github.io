I went there; she had been gone about three days. I went again, and Mrs. Duncan said she had been there and left two bundles. I went there several times; at last I met her at Mr. Duncan's; I asked her how she could be so ungrateful to rob me; she told me she hoped I would forgive her, she was sorry for it; and if ever she got into place she would pay me again. I desired her to go to shew me where the rest of her things were; I went with her to one Mr. Powell's, a pawnbroker, in Oxford-road; there I found two gowns; (the things produced in court,) I can swear to the gowns; she pledged the two gowns at Mr. Powell's.</p>

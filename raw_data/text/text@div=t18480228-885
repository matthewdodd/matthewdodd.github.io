                  </hi> I am a builder, at Walbrook. On 21st Jan. I had a boat<lb></lb>load of bricks unloading at Sermon's-wharf, New North-road—Sales was in my service, and was carting them to my buildings, close by—about half-past four o'clock that afternoon, I saw my cart in Thomas's-yard, about half a mile from my premises, three-parts full of bricks—there were some other bricks of the same quality, shot in the yard—both prisoners were there—they saw me, and went up the back premises—I went into the yard—they were together—I think I said, "What are you about now?"—Thomas said, "It is the first time your cart has been here, and I hope you will overlook it"—I left them to look for a policeman—I could not find one, and came back with a person named Bradick—the prisoners were both gone—the bricks were still in the cart—they were mine, and those unloaded were mine—there were about 300 in the cart, and I should say 300 unloaded—next morning the bricks came home, with a letter addressed to me—I informed the police—I did not see Sales for a fortnight.</p>

            . I lett the prisoner's husband a ready furnished lodging, he and she were in it a month or better; they left it about a fortnight ago. There was a warrant out against him, and the woman was left in the room; I went to see that the things were safe, and desired her to get another room; after that I heard she was gone. I went and found the key under the door; I then missed a great many things, feathers out of the bed, pillows and bolster, all the covering, fireshovel, tongs, and poker, a looking glass, copper tea-kettle, and more things. After that I was informed the prisoner was in Bunhill-row near the Three Tuns; I took her up on Monday last; she was committed yesterday by Sir

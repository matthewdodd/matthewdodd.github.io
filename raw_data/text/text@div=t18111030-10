               <p>Q. Did you receive any sum of money of the prisoner as paid by Mr. Burford for coals that you had furnished Mr. Burford with. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He was employed and entrusted to receive money for you. - A. He was, he was clerk and book-keeper, he came in April 1806.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep any book in which it was his duty to enter the sums that he received of his customers and in which he was to account to you. - A. There was a book in which he was to enter the sums that he received; I have the book here, I have looked through the whole of the book, there is no such sum entered. On the 19th of July I charged him with having received sixty-one pounds, ten shillings, and sixpence, which he had not accompted for, he said he would accompt to me the next day following.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of him afterwards. - A. I believe he went away the day afterwards, on the Saturday he came about eleven o'clock and went away, I never saw him afterwards until the day I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Independant of your book I want to know whether you have any recollection of it. - A. I can say from my own recollection he has never paid me any money on that accompt, my other partner is here.</p>
               <p>EDINGTON FULCHER. I am partner with Mr. Yerraway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever accompt to you for this seventeen pounds, seven shillings, and threepence. - A. Never, I have looked the book over carefully, there is no entery.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called ten witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

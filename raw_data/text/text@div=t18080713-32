On the 6th of June Mrs. Gage came to me and said that she saw something out of the corner of the maid's box, that looked like a table cloth; I went up into the garret and pulled out the table cloth; the box was in the maid's room; there was no other servant in the house at that time; the table cloth had my mark. I then went down to her, and told her I wished to see the inside of her box, as I had found a table cloth, I suspected she had other things; she said she would not permit me to look in the box without a search warrant. Immediately I went up to Marlborough street, it being Saturday evening the magistrate would not grant a search warrant; I came home, I ordered the porter to take the box out of the room and place them in the adjoining room; he did so. I got two padlocks and staples, and put them on this door to prevent any body going in. On Saturday evening I asked her to let me see the inside of her box; on Sunday morning I asked her the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not let her go to the box - A. No. On Sunday evening I requested the same, she said no; - on Monday morning she said she would permit me to see the box. One of my young men and the prisoner went with me; she unlocked the large box. On the top there laid a pair of fine sheets, they are mine. I found there were more things in the box. I ordered him to put the locks on the door again;

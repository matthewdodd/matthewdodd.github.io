               <p>I am a lighterman. Thursday the 1st day of August my business called me to take two craft over the water at eleven o'clock at night, I had got them over the water, and was driving down with them, and I heard a noise of iron grappling. I had two crafts and a boat with me at the same time, I was the width of the pile from the stairs of Mr. Crawshaw's Dock, about ten yards, which I supposed somebody was moving it in the craft of Mr. Crawshaw's Wharf; I called out to one Bensley who happened to be the constable of the night; Bensley is here, I thought he might very possibly have stepped in the craft half a minute or two, I heard a boat row away from the craft, and heard Mr. Mason say something to the man but could not tell what distinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were in that boat that rowed away from the craft? - I did not perceive only one; I dropped my barge down, I asked another, and we followed the man that went off with the boat, and overtook him some little distance from London Bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of the boat or man in the course of this business? - Yes, I lost sight of the boat, we rowed along side of him, and in bringing him back he wished that we would let him go on shore, and let him throw the iron overboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man you rowed along side of? - The prisoner at the bar. He said we might dispose of his boat as we thought proper; we brought him up to Paul's Wharf stairs, we left the iron in charge of Mr. Crawshaw's watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of iron did you find in the boat? - Seven iron pigs and two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make observation enough of that iron to swear it is the same if you was to see it in court? - No, I did not, the prisoner was given in charge of the constable of the night with the iron.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing that happened at that time yourself, or do you only speak to the property? - I was called up about a quarter past eleven, and heard that they had taken this Mears, with some iron, and I told them to take him to the watch-house; I was not out of my room. I lifted up the sash, I was three parts undressed, going to bed, I did not see him at all, it was very dark, I saw the iron in the morning, soon after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether any iron was missing? - It was impossible to know out of about forty ton, I ordered our porter to take them into the warehouse and have them weighed, the pig iron found corresponded with the iron that was in the Joseph barge that very night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this iron? - It was left with the watchman, on the public stairs, down on the Causeway. I examined the iron and found the mark, Donnington, on five whole pigs, and one piece and found the mark Ketley on two whole pigs, and one piece. The Joseph barge is the property of

             works for him on it; before I went to bed that night I had been out on the stair head to call the watchman, to see if any fresh craft had come in, and called out watchman three times, he did not hear, and then I went into the counting house, and knocked with my stick very hard, and he came out rubbing his eyes, and I went in, as soon as I got in almost, I heard this man was brought back; this Joseph barge lay in the second tier.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. Did either of you examine what was written on the barge over night? - I did not. I observed the mark of Donnington and Ketley on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that Donnington and Ketley on it the over night? - The same night or the next morning, I saw it when I brought it back.</p>

               <p>On Saturday night, the 8th of October, I lost my handkerchief, about ten, about the middle of <placeName id="t17911026-33-crimeloc189">Greek-street</placeName>

I let the man go, and struck him across the head with my stick, which broke; then I retreated, and called watch, and the man was secured; he was out of my sight only a moment; I am certain he was one of them, it was a very light night, and very near a large biscuit baker's shop. I did not get my handkerchief again.</p>

               <p>I heard a noise in Greek-street, I had a pint of beer, and I left it, and went to the noise, and heard a blow and a stick fall to the ground; then I heard these men make use of that word, and aimed a blow at the prosecutor, but missed it; the rest ran away, and this man was taken. I am sure he was the man that I saw aim the blow at Mr. Lavender. The prisoner was never out of my sight.</p>

               <p>I had been up to Berner's-street, and returning I saw three or four young men before me, and I heard somebody say I have lost my pocket handkerchief, and my detainer caught hold of a man in black, and then he took me.</p>

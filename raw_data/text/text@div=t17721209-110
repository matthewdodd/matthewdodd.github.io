            . I am a watchman. As I was crying the hour of two, in Mansfield-street, Goodman's-fields, I heard a party of people singing and making a noise; I stood at the end of Mansfield-street and Prescot-street, till they past by me; there were five of them, and most of them had bundles; the prisoner was one of them; he had a bundle covered with a surtout coat. I was afraid to attack them myself as there were so many of them, but I made a signal for my partners to come to my assistance; some came, and we pursued them up Ayliffe-street, till we came facing the constable; there they saw us after them; upon this Hatch dropt this bundle and surtout coat. I knew Hatch, I had seen him several times before; there were also Godfrey and Waters; they are indicted, but are not taken; I desired the watchman to pick up the bundle and keep up the pursuit; then these people said, go it, go it; by which I understood they meant to attack us, for I saw they had cutlasses; I called out, and two men on the other side the way came to my assistances; upon which the prisoner, and two that were with him, made off; then we pursued them to Whitechappel; we went back to the watch-house and got more assistance; then we returned and found Hatch knocking at a door, which I imagine is his own door, in Newton's Rents, in Winfield-street; he called out</p>
               <p>"Poll, Poll, make haste, for the traps are after me;" we secured him, and took him to the watch-house. As to this surtout coat I know it to be the prisoner's; I have seen him wear it many times. I charged him with having robbed somebody; he said, no; he had been at the Man in the Moon; the master of the house was sent for, and denied his having been at his house.</p>

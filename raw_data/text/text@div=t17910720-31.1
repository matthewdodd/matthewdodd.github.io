The prisoner was a stranger to me, I was not at home; I saw them when I went out that day between ten and eleven, they were lying on the side board in the dining parlour. None of them have been found.</p>

               <p>I have been a servant of Mrs. Denton's two years, I was at Mrs. Denton's door, and a man, not the prisoner, came to me, and said, my man, what number is yours? I said No. 11, Sir; then, says he, I am very right, I came from Mr. Booth to take your jack down. Then the prisoner came in after him, and the parlour door was open. I ran up stairs. He locked the door when he went out, and when I came up the door was locked. I had put the spoons on the slab, half dozen desert spoons, I missed them directly, they were all taken away, and this man came up with three spits in his hand and the jack, and was going out of doors with it; he got out of the street door, and was as far as the parlour window; I saw a shoemaker come along, and I asked him to stop him, as he had robbed our house; I saw him stopped, I never lost sight of him. The watchman took him, his name is Cockshaw; nothing was found upon him.</p>

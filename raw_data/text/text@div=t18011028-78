            ; I saw him on Saturday night, the 10th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock, coming from my master's yard with a sack on his back; I followed him down the street, when I lost him; but saw him again the next morning, about eight o'clock, in my master's yard; I attacked him with stealing corn, but he denied it; but he afterwards owned it; I told him it lay with my master to deal with him as he liked; he cried, and said, he took the provender out of the stable at night, and he gave it to a man, near the Green Dragon, at Poplar, with a horse and cart; and that it was put into the cart; and the man offered to give him potatoes or onions, or what he wanted; I took him into custody, and Brown, the constable, was sent for; and we went to the house of Skinner, but he was not at home; we found him at a public-house, and he was asked where his stable was; he said, he had not any; Brown went to find it, and left me to take care of him; Brown searched him, and found a key of the stable in his pocket; when Skinner was left with me, he wanted to get away, and collared me; but Brown returned in about a minute, and handcuffed him, and took him to the stable, and searched it, and found a sack full of horse provender, composed of bran, beans, and hay; I knew the sack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. When Hollis confessed, was he drunk or sober? - A.Sober; I sent for the constable in about a quarter of an hour; he was a little intoxicated at the office, but sober when he confessed; we missed the sack the next day.</p>
               <p>- BROWN sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell-office; I was sent for to Mr. Bough's, at Poplar; I went and found Hollis a prisoner in the watch-house; I asked him where the person lived who received it; he said, a little above No. 40, in Rosemary-lane; that he kept a little house, and went about selling greens; I went to the house of Skinner, but he was not at home; then I went to the King's-arms, in Blue Anchoryard, Bough's servant was with me; as soon as Skinner saw me, he held his head down on the table; I took hold of him, and said, it is you I want, you must go with me; he pretended to be much in liquor; I took him to the Windmill public-house, and left him with Norton while I found the stable, which I did, and found the door locked; I went back to the Windmill, and searched Skinner, and found this key, (produces it;) I was going along the passage, and heard a cry out; I went back, and found he had got Norton against the door, and had almost throttled him; the publican stood at the door to keep the people off, and we were five or six minutes before we could handcuff him; I went to the stable which he said was his, and found the sack and provender; I locked it up, being Sunday, and on Monday morning went with Mr. Bough to Skinner in the watch-house, and then he said he bought it of a man facing the Green Dragon, Poplar, between ten and eleven o'clock at night; and they confessed it before the Magistrates.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. In what state were they? - A. Hollis appeared to be sick from liquor in the outer office, but he was very well when he went into the Magistrates; I cannot say whether he was sober or drunk; he answered every question put to him very well.</p>

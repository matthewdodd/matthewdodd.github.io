            . I work as a paviour, and was at work with Rosseter; I did not see the jacket taken - a gentleman said a man had taken it; our foreman jumped up, and said, "See if all your things are right," and Rosseter missed his jacket; I pursued up Threadneedle-street, and saw the prisoner about a hundred yards ahead - I did not call out, but ran, and as he turned Finch-lane I collared him, and said, "What have you got in your basket?" he opened it, and there was the jacket - I gave him in charge.</p>

            . The prisoner was delivered to me with the basket, and I found this piece of cane and a crooked wire in it; I found seven duplicates on him, for handkerchiefs, waistcoats, and things; he attempted to get the cane and wire out of the basket - I said, "What are these?" and he dropped them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That thing in the basket is an umbrella stretcher - I did not think I was committing any offence - I kicked the jacket before me, and picked it up at the impulse of the moment - I was going to the Post-office, and have no doubt as I came back I should have given it to the street-keeper, to find the owner; I question whether I have committed any offence, for it laid on the pavement, and the law does not allow any person to take advantage of his own wrong.</p>

            . I missed two pair of pistols and two odd one's about the latter end of February; on the 25th of February I went to the St. Andrew's tavern, there I got information, I went with the officer to Mr. Lawson's on the 26th of February, there we found a pair of pistols, which was my property. The prisoner was one of my workmen; he came to work for me about the middle of October.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. On the 25th of February was the prisoner working for you - A. He worked then I believe at his own residence, Glasshouse-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you found these pistols was he working in your shop - A. About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen the pistols - A. I did not see the pistols till I went to Mr. Lawson.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before that had you seen these pistols - A. Within three weeks, in my shop in the Minories.</p>
               <p>MR. LAWSON. I live at No. 97, East Smithfield. I bought a pair of pistols of the prisoner on or about the 22nd or 23d of February; I bought them at St. Andrew's tavern, Lower East Smithfield, I gave twenty shillings for them. The pistols that I bought of the prisoner I shewed to Mr. Rea, and I delivered them to the officer.</p>

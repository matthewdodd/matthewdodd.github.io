                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Ruislip, in Middlesex. On the 12th of December I was going across Hillingdon-heath, to my master's with three beasts, about eleven o'clock in the morning—as I went across the heath I saw five men all of a bunch—I did not know any of them be<lb></lb>fore—I had a bundle under my arm containing clothes, which I was going to take to my sister—they belonged to her—I had a canvas purse in my pocket with 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—the five men were just by a turning which goes to Pollhill—I was following my beasts on the road—they were near the road—two of them, the prisoners Steel and Williamson, came across the road and met me—Steel put his band on my shoulder, and said, "Farmer, come and see if you can understand this game, for I cannot"—the answer I made him was, "I dare say you understand the game better than I do, I have other things to attend to"—I kept on following my beasts along the road, and the two men kept walking along with me—Williamson then said, "Farmer, go and bet him a sovereign, and I will be your halves"—three of them then surrounded me—George Clarke was tie other one—they tried to <hi rend="italic">claw</hi> the bundle from under my arm, but did not succeed—I hung to my bundle—I had the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse in my breeches pocket—I had got my hand in my breeches pocket, and had got my purse in my hand—Steel struck me across my arm with an umbrella, knocked my hand out of my pocket, and five shillings out of the seven shillings flew out of my purse on the ground—the purse fell on the ground too, with the other two shillings in it—they <hi rend="italic">clawed</hi> it up, and ran away with it—Wil<lb></lb>liamson and Steel <hi rend="italic">clawed</hi> at it—I cannot say which got it—all five ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the other two doing at the time the three were about you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One of them was sitting down by the side of the ditch, and the other walking backwards and forwards by the side of the foot-path—they did nothing to me—they never came nearer to me than the footpath—they all ran away together—I hallooed out to the roadsmen, and beckoned to them—(they are people who mend the road)—Bennett, one of the roadsmen, ran towards me—he might be about 300 yards off—I cannot say exactly—when I hallooed out, Steel <hi rend="italic">clawed</hi> a stick out of King's hand, and said he would beat my b—brains out—King was one of those who had done no<lb></lb>thing—he did nothing with the stick—he did not come up to me—Ben<lb></lb>nett</p>

               <p>was coming towards me at that time—three or four more people came up, but there is only Bennett here—the prisoners ran away—I saw Steel, King, Hutchinson, and Williamson, again the same day at Uxbridge, and saw Clarke on the Saturday after—Clarke was the last of the three that came up to me—I can swear to Steel, and to all of them as being the five men—they were all together, and ran away together, and they are the three that insulted me.</p>

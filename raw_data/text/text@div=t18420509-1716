                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert Goulding, a corn-merchant and warehouseman, carrying on business in Potter's Fields, St. John's, Southwark—I have lived with him thirty years—there is nobody but him in the firm—it is carried on as Robert Goulding and Son, but there is no<lb></lb>body but him in it. On the evening of the 12th of April, about seven o'clock, I was leaving the counting-house, and went round to the different doors to see that they were fast—on coming to the back-door of the warehouse, "B No. 1," I found the top part of the door open—I went up to the door and saw two men, each filling a bushel bag with beans—there was a balk of beans at the other end of the warehouse—I asked what they did there, and how they came there—one of them, not the prisoner, escaped almost immediately, so that I could not ascertain who he was—the prisoner came towards me and said it was all right—I said, "No, it is not all right," and asked what business they had there, and how they came in—he said it was all right, and endeavoured to make his escape—I was outside the door—the door was between us—I pushed him back and kept calling for the police—he attempted to come out at the top of the door—it is a divided door—the other man went to the other end of the warehouse, and I suppose must have dropped from the first-floor window—there was no other means of his get<lb></lb>ting away—before the policeman came the prisoner had made his escape into the other warehouse, and we went in search of him—I expect he knew the warehouse, and had been there before—the sack containing the beans was just outside the door where I saw him, ready to be carried away, besides the two sacks they were filling—the beans in the sack and bags corresponded in quality with those in the bulk—after securing the prisoner we went over the warehouse, and the following morning, about nine o'clock, I examined the back window and found one iron bar of the window standing in its proper position, but it was loose—anybody without could remove it to get in—the back-door of the warehouse was fastened from within—you could</p>

               <p>not get in at the back of the premises except by the window—the front part of the warehouse was fastened with a common lock, and the Queen's lock also—they were quite undisturbed—the back-window is about two yards from the ground—any body could get through the window and unfasten the back-door within—a man could not get out of the up stairs warehouse without dropping from the window, unless he had a ladder, and that was found—he could not get out at the lower window, because I stood there.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Goulding—I was on the premises, in the warehouse B No. 1—on the 12th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I closed the warehouse—the front-door was se<lb></lb>cured by a lock and latch, and the Queen's lock too—I saw the back<lb></lb>door secured inside—there was no fastening to the front—I came out at the front-door, and saw both the locks made fast—I did not examine the window bars.</p>

I received information from Nettleton, went up to the second-floor, and saw the prisoner on the tiles of the lower warehouse endeavouring to escape—I took possession of the sack of beans and two bags—I went down stairs, round to the back premises, and met my brother constable, who got a ladder to get on to the roof, but received information that the prisoner had dropped from the wall again into an enclosed building—we went there, and found him lying on the bulk of corn—I examined the building that night—the bars of the back window seemed correct, but I did not take hold of them to try them—I tried them at nine o'clock the following morning, and found a bar unfastened—the nails bad been drawn,-and the bar removed, and put back in its place again—I bad not observed that the night before—I received the prisoner in charge—I had seen him in Tooley-street shortly before.</p>

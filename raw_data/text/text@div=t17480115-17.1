            . Last saturday night, the 9th of this instant, between six and seven, as I was coming along <placeName id="t17480115-17-crimeloc101">Ludgate-Hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you drop it?</p>
               <p>Copeland. No. The Prisoner picked it out of my pocket, and since that, the book has been brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you say the Prisoner picked it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Copeland. Because I saw him. I found my coat was pulled back, and I saw my book in his hand, and he put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you saw the book in his hand, why did not you stop him?</p>
               <p>Copeland. Because I thought it might be improper for a single person to take such a one as him; I crossed the way, and saw him pick another gentleman's pocket. I spoke to the gentleman, and informed him of it, and he said, if I took any notice of it, we might stand a chance of being beat; we followed him as far as Temple-Bar, and he returned back again. I went home to my lodging in New-street, by Fetter-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his countenance?</p>
               <p>Copeland. Yes; I observed the lower part of his face to be clarety. When I went home I got one to go along with me, and set a man and a boy on one side of the way, and I went on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Copeland . About a quarter of an hour after he picked my pocket. I came out of the house with my landlord, and I saw the Prisoner turn up Fleet-street , towards Fetter-Lane; and by St. Dunstan's church , I saw him attempt to pick a gentleman's pocket. Said I to a chairman, do me the favour to lay hold of this man, for he has picked my pocket, and he laid hold of him by the collar, and shoved him against the Temple-gate. There was another fellow with him: I laid hold of the other fellow, though I could not charge him; and I don't know but the Prisoner might think I had a proper officer; but when he found I had not a proper officer, he said, you little saucy dog, let me go: we carried him to a public house, the Two Kings and Key in Fleet-street, and I got an officer, and he said, he believed this person was no better than he should be. The Prisoner desired he might be searched, and the constable said, I don't feel any book, or any thing like it; I asked him if he would return the book, he said, he knew nothing of it ; I gave the constable charge of him, and he begged to go to Bridewell; and desired I would indulge him: the constable thought it dangerous to carry him to Bridewell, on account of a rescue; for it was said, that he had been there several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the book again?</p>
               <p>Copeland. Yes, it was brought to me by a sailor, and he trembled very much; said he, is not your name Copeland? I said, yes. Said he, have not you lost a will and powers ? I said, yes. He said, that he wanted something for finding it, but I would not give him any thing. I said, let the person come, and I will satisfy him for it. Afterwards a woman came with the book wrapped up in a sheet of paper, all over dirt; and asked me a crown for picking it up; I told her, I did not know whether it was proper to give her anything, and I did not give her any thing, and she went away very angry.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner at the bar is the man that took it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Copeland. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he saw the book in my hand.</p>
               <p>Copeland . Yes, I did; I saw it in his hand in this manner, as if he took a glance at it to see what it was</p>

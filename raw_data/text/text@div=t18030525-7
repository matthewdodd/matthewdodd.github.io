               <p>Q. Did you feel any thing? - A.No, I did not; I perceived it by its appearing white outside my gown; I had a small red morocco pocket-book, a white cotton handkerchief, seven duplicates, and a register in my pocket; I put them in my pocket when I set out, at nine o'clock, to go to my mother; I went to a pawnbroker's in Whitecross-street, where I had a gown in pawn, to mention it, but it being Saturday night, the shop was very full, and I did not go in; I asked my mother to go on Monday morning, and stop it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You walked a good distance that evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have met a great number of people besides the prisoner? - A. Yes; the duplicates were in my pocket-book; I felt my pocket-book in my pocket at different times, when I put my hand in my pocket to take my handkerchief out; I felt it not above a minute before he overtook me.</p>
               <p>SARAH BOWLER sworn. - I am the mother of the last witness: My daughter was absent from my house but twenty-five minutes, till she returned; she had the duplicates in her pocket-book, I saw her put them in her pocket when she came home on Saturday night, and I went with her to the pawnbroker's, and the shop was so full, we could not get in; I went on Monday morning to stop the gown.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SHEPHERD sworn. - On Saturday, the 23d of April, about ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop to redeem a gown for six shillings; knowing that he was not the person that pledged it, I asked him where he got the duplicate; he said he bought it; the gown was brought down to him, he looked at it, and asked me if I would purchase it of him; I told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250008"></xptr>could not; there were several women in the shop, he wanted some of them so buy it, and none of them would; he paid me the interest, and had a new ticket in his own name; I gave him a fresh ticker, and he went away; Mrs. Bowler came on Monday morning to stop it, and I told her who had got the duplicate of it; I knew the prisoner before, I believe he deals in ear-rings; his father and mother keep a cloaths shop; I sent Mrs. Bowler to his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You knew where he lived very well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The duplicate was in the name of a different person - he transferred it into his own name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he had purchased it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Bowler.) What did you do on receiving the information that the prisoner had the duplicate? - A. I went to his house, he was not at home; I did not see him till he was taken up, and was at Worship-street Office; we gave Ray, the officer, charge to seek after him. When he was in custody of the officer, he asked me whether I would make it up, and make my daughter speak soft to what she had said the night before, and he would take her cloaths out of pledge, and pay us for our trouble, and give us any satisfaction we desired, if we did not bring him before the Justice, for if my daughter said that which she said when he was taken, he should be transported; I told him we would take no brlbes, we would speak the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by at the time? - A.Ray, and my daughter.</p>

             sworn. - On the 29th of April, I was at the public-house adjoining the Office, in Worship-street, and the headborough of St. Luke's brought the prisoner there; he begged to speak to me; he went into the back parlour, and asked me if the business could not be settled; he said, the young woman should have all the duplicates, and something besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the duplicate of a person on Sunday, and went to the pawnbroker's on Monday morning; I never saw Ray at the Office; I never spoke a word to him; I saw the gown, it was not worth the money; I left it in my own name, intending to fell it.</p>

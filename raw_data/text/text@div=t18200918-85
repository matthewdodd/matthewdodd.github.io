            . On the 20th of August I came from Lisson-green in the Paddington stage, which set me down at the end of Castle-street, City-road. I certainly was a little intoxicated, and in getting out of the coach I missed my step, and fell on the foot-path. I heard a voice say,</p>
               <p>"I know the gentleman very well, and will take care of him;" the person then took me up. I turned round, and looked at him, it was the prisoner. I said I am going to Barbican; he took me down <placeName id="t18200918-85-crimeloc482">Castle-street</placeName>

               <p>"Do not take my watch." I am certain he tripped me up. He ran away immediately. I gave an alarm, followed him, calling Stop thief! a person brought him back, and produced my watch.</p>

I was passing the end of Castle-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! turned round and saw the prisoner running, he made a full stop over the area of No. 10, as two or three got before him, he then stooped in a reclining posture. I saw him take something from his pocket, and throw it down. I saw the watch taken out of the area.</p>

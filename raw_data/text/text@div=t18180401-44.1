               <p>CHARLES CLITHEROW. I am an officer. On the 14th of March, at two o'clock, the prisoner came behind me, and looked over my shoulder for a minute. As soon as the prosecutor's cart passed along Gracechurch-street he made towards it. Several persons were standing at the corner of Leadenhall-market-the prisoner stopped also. As soon as the prosecutor turned his back, the prisoner got on the foreboard of the cart, and looked round, as if there was a parcel he wanted to take out. He took a black trunk from the cart, put it on his shoulder, and carried it a few yards. I turned round, and he dropped it by the window at the back of the cart. He ran through Peter's-alley; I called out Stop thief! and ran round the corner - I fell in with him on the other side of Cornhill. I made a blow at him with my stick, and struck him on the foot. He crossed Bishopsgate-street to the Black Lion, opposite the Old London Tavern. A coach came between us. He got through Crosby-square, and there I missed him. I was going to the Mansion-house, and found him in custody. I left the trunk in the care of a person while I pursued. He was taken on another charge. I am sure he is the man - I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I have seen him about several times before.</p>

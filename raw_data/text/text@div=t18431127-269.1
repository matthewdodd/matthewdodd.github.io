                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Rye-lane, Peckham, in the parish of Camberwell. On the night of the 30th of Nov. I was out on business—I returned home about half-past three o'clock, and I let myself in with a latch-key—I went up stairs to bed after having chained and secured the door—after I had been in bed a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I fancied I heard a slight noise outside my chamber door—I listened, and heard it repeated in my dressing-room adjoining my bed-room—I opened the door, and saw some person there—I closed with him immedi<lb></lb>ately, and tried to secure him—he resisted as much as possible, and was as much as I could manage—after calling out to Mr. Lodge and the servants, further assistance was procured, and he was eventually secured—it was the prisoner—he bit me very violently on the shoulder and arm, and struck me with his fists as hard as he could—I got other hurts in the struggle, and cut my knee very violently—after some time a light was brought, and he then said, "Oh forgive me, master"—he had been in my service six months since—immediately he was secured I went down into the area with a policeman, and found the larder door, leading into the passage and up stairs, open—that was secured over night by a latch which only opens from the outside—some wire gauze which had been over it was forced out at one corner, by which means the door was opened—there is a very small circular window under the steps from which a small pane of glass had been broken, and we had pasted a piece of paper over it—that paper was forced through, and the window opened—that could have been done from without, and that I conjecture was the way he got in—he could then force his person into the larder—I found a pair of shoes immediately under that window, which we took up stairs—the prisoner</p>

               <p>having no shoes or stockings on, they were put down for him, and he imme<lb></lb>diately put them on and went out of the house in them—he did not claim them exactly—he was searched on being delivered over to the police, and some lucifers and a tap was taken from him with a key to it, which would present the appearance of a pistol—it was exactly the same shape.</p>

I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock—before doing so I secured the house—I saw the window which leads into the larder from the area—that was safe and secure—I held a candle to it and looked at it—the wire gauze before the door was also secure, and the house entirely shut up.</p>

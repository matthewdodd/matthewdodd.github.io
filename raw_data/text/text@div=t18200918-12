I took him aside, and asked him for the watch which he picked from the gentleman's pocket - he said he had none. I told the people I saw him take it, and offered to feel for it. He then put his hand into his pocket, pulled a watch out, and said he had none but his own. I knew it to be the same that I saw pass from one to the other. I did not know the gentleman.</p>

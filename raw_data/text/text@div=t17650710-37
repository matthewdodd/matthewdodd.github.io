            . The prisoner had been a lodger of mine; he had been gone away six or eight weeks; after which he came to me at a public-house where I use, and said he was destitute: this was the 17th of May was twelve months; I gave him six-pence, and said he should lodge in my house all night; he came and went to bed, and when I got up in the morning, I went into his room; he said he had nothing to do, and he would lie a little longer; I went out and left him in bed, and returned a little after eight; he was then in bed: I had some business to do in the city. I went and returned about two in the afternoon: I found the door between his room and mine open; he was gone, and seven guineas, a gold-ring, and a watch: they were taken out of of a box which was locked when I went out: I met him by accident in the Strand. I took him up, and charged him with taking the things: he told me he had pledged the watch at Windsor, where I went and found it. I took him before Justice Welch; he there confess'd to taking all the things; he said he gave another man part of the money. (The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>

On the 23d of January, Wednesday, about a quarter after seven at outside, it was moon light, I went there with a little boy, I perceived the prisoners long side of the barge, they were in a boat, I had seen them before on the river, I cannot say I had seen them very often. When I came along I saw them take up one sack and hawled the cloth on the remaining part of the vessel; they lifted it to the skiff in which they were; the Yarmouth was about two foot and a half from the edge of the water; they could reach to the cargo of the barge standing in the skiff; they perceived me coming to the barge when they had lifted the sack into the skiff, and they shoved away; I said to the little boy, pull, and I held my arm out and lay hold of the skiff; I was about twenty-two feet from them when I saw them and I called to them not to heave them overboard, they had two in the skiff, but I only saw them actually take one; just as they had taken the two sacks and heaved them overboard, I jumped into the skiff immediately; the prisoner Tucker hove one overboard on one side and then he turned to get the other over, he could not get it overboard without assistance; I never lost sight of him from the time I saw him take one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200063"></xptr>sack from the barge till the time I saw them thrown overboard. I called to one Henry Hall to shove off; I then called out to him that they had been robbing the barges, he is a watchman to Mr. Duncan, he watches on the barges, but it was not in his charge then, he shoved off; we got into the skiff and Tucker made use of an expression, and asked what I could swear to? the words that he used were, buggar you, what can you swear to now? on this I and Hall secured them; they surrendered quietly; we put them in custody of the headborough.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the barge was it they threw the sacks overboard? - It might be twenty yards from the Yarmouth. I went to that spot the next day, somewhere about nine in the morning; Mr. Hall and Corsaint made a search and got the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of these sacks of barley? - I cannot say.</p>

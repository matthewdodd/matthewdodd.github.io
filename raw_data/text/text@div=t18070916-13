            . Q. You are a city constable. - A. Yes. I was sent for to Mr. de Taster's on Thursday morning last; he called the prisoner into his parlour, and then he went into the prisoner's room; I searched him. I found nothing upon his person, but searching a cupboard in his apartment, there were two hats, one on the top of the other, and the undermost hat had the duplicates; I then took him in custody. I went to the pawnbrokers, and they produced the property. We found among the rest, one duplicate 5th of September 1807, one spoon for eleven shillings, in his own name, pledged at Barker's, 91 Houndsditch; the prisoner was very much agitated when I found the duplicate, and wanted to speak to his master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Where were these hats situated. - A. In his pantry, where he sleeps and keeps his clothes.</p>

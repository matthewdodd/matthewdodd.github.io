The prisoner Macklin is my brother—this negligee chain was in the box, at Dr. Tilt's, in which the linen was that the cook and I took out—I do not know who took this chain out—it was taken out in York-street—the cook was not there—I did not take it out—I did not see it taken out—I did not see it again till it was at Guildhall—when it was produced to me, I said it was a chain that was in the box—I had seen it in the box at the time we opened it—I know these spoons—I saw them taken out of the box—I believe they were taken out by my brother—Osborne was present in the kitchen—they were both standing together—it is a very small kitchen—I should think Osborne was half a yard from the box—he could see what the other prisoner was doing—the chain was not visible then—the chain and the spoons were taken together—I saw the spoons taken, but not the chain—the chain was still in the box when the spoons had been taken—I never heard my brother say anything about the gold chain—this was about 30th May—they were taken out the same day that my brother was taken prisoner.</p>

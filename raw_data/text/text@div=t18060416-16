            . On the 14th of March last about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came under pretence of buying a quarter of a yard of callico at eight-pence a yard, she walked to that part of the shop where there was some silk handkerchiefs on the counter, she took the handkerchiefs and concealed them under her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take them. - A. I did not;

             sworn. Q. You are shopman likewise. - A. Yes, I was waiting upon a lady about five yards distance from the prisoner at the bar, I saw her hand by her side, which gave me suspicion; she was drawing her hand up, as if she was putting it up under her apron, I immediately cautioned Mr. Acomb not to let her go out of the shop without examining of her, I immediately examined on the counter to see if there was any thing missing; I gave him a second caution; the girl told me that she had a pain in her belly, I told her I could easily relieve her of that disease, upon which Mr. Acomb immediately took the handkerchiefs from under her apron; I took her into the back room and sent for Mr. Sapwell.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is that woman, what is she. - A. I do not know indeed, she was by the shop, and when she saw that gentleman take them from under my apron, she ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. Does your landlord live in the same house?- A. Yes; I had lodged there about eleven weeks: On Friday, the 24th of July, I lost my watch about six o'clock in the morning; the prisoner lodged in the same room; he went to bed between nine and ten; I saw him go to bed; my watch was hung up over my head, in my trowsers fob; I had a gilt chain and seal to it; my handkerchief was in the adjoining room; and when I got up in the morning about six o'clock, I missed them; I found him on the Sunday week following in Ratcliffe-highway, and took him up; a black man told me where my watch was; I found it at Macdonald's, the Black Dog, in Denmark-street, on the Monday; I delivered it to the constable; the prisoner had the handkerchief round his neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see me at Wapping Old-stairs before you took me up? - A. Yes, I did, but I was not able to take him, because I had no officer with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the watch again? - A. Yes, in the hands of the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same that you had seen in the room? - A. I believe it to be the same.</p>

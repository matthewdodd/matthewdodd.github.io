I said,"Bob at the corner" - he said he had not seen him; I took him to the prosecutor, who said he did not know him; I then took him to the station - I found on these stockings, shoes, and other things; he said the next day that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060124"></xptr>had had 4l. in gold, and 4l. in silver of Bob, and that he had bought these things; that they had been that night to Astley's, and then to the New-cut; that then they took a cab, and drove to Camberwell fair, where he went in a onehorse fly, and got robbed of the rest of the money - he did not say that he knew where Bob got the money.</p>

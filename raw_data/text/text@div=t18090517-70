On the 25th of March I found my warehouse broken open; I lost sixty pound weight of beaver wool, the value of some was sixty, some seventy, and some eighty shillings; I found that I had lost half a lot of Hudson's Bay skins; I lost three dozen of beaver skins; there are three of them here. The wool had been pulled off. I have no partner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SCRIVENER. I am a hatter, 111, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I know him by bringing these skins for sale on the 2nd of May. A few days before he brought the skins he called and asked me whether I dealt in skins; I told him I did; he asked me what I generally gave for skins; I told him according to the quality, if he let me see them I would tell him what I could give for them; he said they belonged to a male of a ship. On the 2nd of May, in the evening, the prisoner brought the skins to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them - A. I do not know; there were very little passed. I was going out at the time, I desired him to leave the skins, on the next day I would take an opportunity and look at them, and give him an answer in the evening. On the 3rd I went over to Mr. Taylor, a furrier, to ask him his opinion of it; for him to come over to my house to inform me the value of them. They were sent to Mr. Taylor by a porter, he could not come himself.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were at Mr. Taylor's did the prisoner call on you - A. The prisoner called on the evening of the 3rd, he asked me if I had determined about the skins, and if I had looked at them; I told him that I had not an opportunity of looking them over, that if he would be with me the next day I would give him an answer. He said that the man that belonged to them was waiting at the public house near me, or, I believe, the first public house; he urged me very much to go and speak to the man about them, to agree about the price; I told him it was of no use my going to the man, I could say no more to him than I did, as my friend had not seen them. He said the man very much wanted money, and would be glad if I could strike a bargain, or to that effect; I asked him how much he wanted; he said twenty pounds; I told him I had not so much cash in the house; I advanced him fifteen pounds in part; he called the next evening; I told him I had not an opportunity of looking at them; he was to call again on the Friday. I saw Griffiths and Mr. Taylor on Friday; I did not see the prisoner till the Saturday; I met him as I was coming out of the London dock; he asked me if I had determined about the skins; he told me the man wanted seventeen shillings a pound for them; he would not take less, as they were any one's money; I appointed him to come up to my house and bring the man with him; he did not come. On the Monday following I saw him when he was apprehended; he came down to the London dock; he asked me if I had determined about the skins; I told him I thought they were a great deal too dear, and asked him if he could not take any less. He excused himself not coming on Saturday; he said the man was groggy; he would not come. Then he said he would take fifteen and sixpence for the skins; he wished me to go up to a public house on Tower Hill and see the man; I told him I would much sooner he would come to some house near the dock. He came to the Ship and Star, he did not bring the man. He remained with me till the officer came. Mr. Griffiths asked him if he was the man that brought the skins to my house, and if he knew any thing about them; he said he knew nothing more about them than being employed to sell them. Griffiths told him to give up the person and clear himself; he then said that he had them of a man in the neighbourhood of the name of Brice; Mr. Griffiths said, you had them of Brice, had you, in East Smithfield; he said, yes; Mr. Griffiths answered, that as soon as ever he went to Brice, he would deny ever seeing him. When the prisoner had the money of me he returned to the door and wished if the man himself came after the skins that I would make as good a bargain as I could, so as to give him a few shillings for himself, as the man would give him very little for his trouble.</p>

I did; I looked at the skins, they appeared suspicious; in consequence of that, I wrote a short note to the prosecutor; the prosecutor came. They were seen by the prosecutor and by Griffiths on Friday morning the 5th. The prosecutor called on the evening of the 4th; I marked one skin, the same bundle that

               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. I went to the Ship and Star, East Smithfield; that was on Monday at four o'clock. When I went in, I saw the prisoner and Mr. Scrivener sitting together; I asked Mr. Scrivener how he did, and the next words, I said, is that the man that you had the skins of; I spoke it out loud; Mr. Scrivener said it was; I asked how he accounted for the skins, did he carry them himself, he said he knew nothing about the skins; I am quite sure of that; after some conversation that passed between Mr. Scrivener and him, he acknowledged that it was so.</p>
               <p>COURT. What conversation passed between Mr. Scrivener and him, that should induce him to say that - A. He said you know you brought them to me; then he acknowledged that he had brought them to Mr. Scrivener</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person of the prisoner - A. No, I did not; he told me he knew me. I told him that Mr. Scrivener had accounted how he came by them, now it was his turn; I searched him then, I found nothing; he said after I had talked to him a little while, that he had them of one Brice, a tallow chandler, I told him I knew Brice very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the fifteen pounds - A. No, I did not; there were some halfpence about him; as we were going into the street, he said will you go round with me by Brice's, I told him no, I should take him up to the office; as soon as I had done that I should go and fetch Brice, I did; I took Brice in custody and took him to the office. Brice was discharged the second hearing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know Brice - A. I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. He has been taken up a good many times - A. He has. As I was bringing the prisoner from the magistrate to the House of Correction, I said I would assist him in bringing any thing out that he could give information of; I would do every thing I could to catch him. When I brought him out of the House of Correction, he told me he thought he could find two soldiers at the White Horse in High Holborn, near Mr. Scrivener's house, that saw him and Brice at that house; I took him in a coach there to the public house; he pointed out two men that I took down to the office in a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You found out two men that had observed him and Brice together - A. Yes. He told me then that if I would go to Wych-street, Drury-lane, he would shew me the house that he took the skins from. I went into the house of one Solomon, no skins I found; they denied knowing any thing at all about it. They swore at the office that they knew nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose you remember the time his warehouse was broken open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The night before that did you carry home any skins to Mr. Jones - A. I carried him four dozen my work is to strip the skins; there is four out of the forty-eight that I picked.</p>
               <p>Griffiths. These are the skins that I received of Mr. Taylor. I have had them locked up ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones. There is a mark on that skin.</p>
               <p>COURT. What may be the value of these thirty-five skins - A. About forty-six pounds; they cost me a guinea and eight-pence a pound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I took the skins to Mr. Scrivener; I never told him that I had them of a mate of a ship; I had them of Brice, that Brice had a commission of a mate of a ship to sell these skins.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean to say that you mentioned Brice's name to him. - Prisoner. Yes, I did; Brice said he had them of a mate of a ship to sell some beavers; he asked me if I was acquainted with a hatter, I told him I was not particularly; there was an excise officer of the dock, I was employed by times in it, I would ask him the question. I asked Mr. Serivener if he used any such thing, he said he did; I asked him then if he would buy them, he said he would if they were worth his money; he could not tell the worth of them until he saw the bulk; Brice asked me if I knew where Mr. Scrivener lived, I told him I did not; I asked a man that knew, it proved to be No. 111; I told Brice that Mr. Scrivener said he would buy them if they were worth his money. On the 1st of May, when I was going to the dock, he said Watkins, I have not sent these skins, I told him I was going to my employment, I could not go; he said my employment was over at four o'clock; I told him I had no objection to go at four o'clock; he said the skins lay at Temple-bar, it was a short way to carry them, he would pay me porteridge. We went into the Crooked Billet; he told me to go in there, he would call upon me; I stopped there an hour. I was on my feet going away when in he came; I asked him why he stopped, he said the people were not at home, they were at home now. I went with him a short way, he told me to stop at a door, the stairs faced the door right up; he went up and brought the bundle down; Brice brought it down. We walked in company to Scrivener's house; I was at the door before him, he was close by my side. I laid the bundle down in the passage; Mr. Scrivener asked me if these were the skins, I never saw the skins; I told him I supposed they were; I asked Mr. Scrivener, when he could give an answer, he said he would let me know in the morning. Brice asked me when I should see Mr. Scrivener again, I told him I should see him in the dock; he then asked me to go up to Holborn with him to ask Mr. Scrivener for twenty pound; I told him I had other things to do that evening, I could not go; he said he had a bill to pay he wanted twenty pounds; I accordingly went. Mr. Scrivener brought up fifteen pounds, he said it was all the money that he had in the house, he gave that in part of payment; and if he did not bargain for the skins the fifteen pound was to be returned, and the skins were to be taken away. I pressed Mr. Scrivener to go into the public house; I acted as porter, I told him to make the bargain as cheap as he could, as I got nothing by it, he said that perhaps it might be a penny or two pence a pound, they might split upon that; I told him then not to concern himself with me. I accordingly went into this public house; Brice was there, and we went away together. On the evening of the 5th, Brice was determined either to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170044"></xptr>he money for the skins, or to take them away, as he had not seen Mr. Scrivener, he wanted to see him particularly; I went into this public house, and Brice by and by comes in; I said I was waiting for you. There were three men that saw me take the money out of my pocket-book; I said I had fifteen pounds, and in case they did not make a bargain, the money was to be returned. Brice has denied of ever being in company with me, and ever knowing any transaction in the business. These men have swore to him at the office. That jew swore that he did not see Brice; his wife was in the passage at the time that he put the bundle on my shoulder. I never had any connections with Brice; I never knew any of his connections or transactions whatsoever in my life. I keep a chandler's shop, he served me with half a hundred weight of soap, and half a dozen pounds of candles; I never had any other dealings with him, than he asking me to get a customer for these beaver skins.</p>

I am quite sure they were in this public house.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember being in company with the prisoner at any public house - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Brice - A. Yes, I saw him there; I am servant to Mr. Trower, the counseller, Harper-street; I went into the tap-room about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner there counting some notes on the table; he doubled them up in one fold, and put them in his pocket-book, and put his pocket-book into his side pocket, then he went to the door; he called a serjeant of the Guards; they drank a pot of porter; the serjeant went away. The prisoner sat a considerable time afterwards, till these two witnesses came in, he said there is two faces I know; they could not see his face being in the dusk of the evening. In about an hour after the serjeant went, Brice came in, the prisoner got up to go away; the first man said when he was going by, I know you, you was a grenadier; they stopped a minute, and then Brice came in, he said he was going; Brice said what have you got to drink, they both went and sat down together in the box; the prisoner unbuttoned his coat and put his hand inside his coat; the other man just touched him, and then they both went out; it struck me that these were not his notes that he was counting of then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see the prisoner take the pocketbook out - A. No, Brice whispered to him, he was in the act of taking it out. They went out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He put his hand as if towards the pocket, but before he had taken any thing out Brice whispered to him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One can easily understand that - A. Brice whispered to him, and then the prisoner said well, well, and they went out; I saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Pray how near were you setting to these two men who have been examined as witnesses - A. I was not sitting in their company, they were as near as me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they could see what you saw - A. No, they were talking together. I was in nobody's company.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they before you or after you in the public house - A. After me; when I went in there was nobody but the prisoner and the servant maid of the house, till he called serjeant Ball in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner waiting in the house - A. An hour an a half from the time I first went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after these men came in, did he take the notes and count them - A. He counted the notes half an hour before these men came in; there was nobody else in the tap-room but him and me when he counted them; I conversed with the prisoner about some highland soldiers that went by, respecting their dress. I saw Mr. Brice in the yard on Thursday, he was looking at the list; I said this is the man. I never saw Mr. Brice before I saw him at the public house; I knew him directly when I saw him. I was subpoened to come here; I said I saw this man count some notes, and that is the way I came here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

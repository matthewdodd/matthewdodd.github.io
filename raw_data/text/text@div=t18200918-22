I was walking up the street, and he was coming down, and at that instant he made a violent snatch at my watch-chain; he got the chain, seal and ring, and then directly ran up the alley. I pursued crying stop thief; the alley is very narrow, he was stopped there, and taken into a public house close by, and was given in charge, but nothing was found on him; there was a strong light at the corner of the alley; I saw him clearly, and did not lose sight of him.</p>

I pursued the prisoner, and came up with him in the alley; next morning I went there as soon as it was daylight, and was going away without finding it, but happening to kick my heel against a stable gate I found the chain - it was about four o'clock - at five I went to the spot where the robbery was committed, and found the key.</p>

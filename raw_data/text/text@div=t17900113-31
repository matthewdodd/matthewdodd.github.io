               <p>I drive the Limehouse stage.

I said, I would tell him presently: I think I should know the saddle again: the prisoner came half an hour afterwards, and asked me how I came on with it; I told him I could not tell him, till four o'clock.</p>

I cannot swear to it; but I missed one of that description; the prisoner was servant to me when I first missed it; he went off directly: Foster informed me of the loss of it, of a Friday, about five weeks ago: I had a new saddle besides this; I bought this saddle of Mr. Talbot about May last.</p>

            . On the 9th of November, I saw the prisoner attempting several gentlemen's pockets; at the corner of <placeName id="t18151206-60-crimeloc332">King-Street, Cheapside</placeName>

He then pulled a yellow silk handkerchief out of a man's coat pocket; and the crowd was so great, that it was as much as ever he could do to get it into his pocket. He was then pushed off the pavement, and crossed the road, and I followed him down Cheapside, round St. Paul's Chorch-Yard, until I came into Bridge-Street. It was impossible to get to the man he took the yellow handkerchief from. When he got into Bridge-Street, he look another handkerchief; but what one that was, I cannot tell. I could not get up to him immediately; but in about a quarter of an hour I saw him again. I spoke to Hudson, a brother officer, and told him to be with me at the corner of Water-Lane; from all probability the prisoner would pass us on the return of the procession. He did return pass us, and on seeing us, he bolted across Water-lane into Bridge-Street, and I followed him and took him into custody. We took him into a house, and searched him. In one of his pockets we found a very sharp pair of scissors; we found some handkerchiefs upon him, among which was a yellow one, which I firmly believe to be the one he took at the corner of King-Street.</p>

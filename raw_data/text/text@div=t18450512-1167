                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at the Mazeppa Coffee-house, in Whitechapel. On Friday, the 2nd of May, I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock in the morning—I wound my watch up, and put it under my pillow—the prisoner and another person slept in the same room, each in separate beds—I got up between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—the prisoner was then gone, and my watch was missing from under the pillow—it had a silver guard to it and a key—this is it—I can swear to the whole of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Mazeppa coffee-house. On the morning of the 2nd of May, about five o'clock, I let the prisoner out of my house—he does not regularly lodge there, but had slept there that night—I heard a noise a little before five—I went up, and he was going into my room—he had the handle of the door in his hand—he said he had made a mistake, and could not find his way down stairs—I said this was the way—he turned and went down, wished me good morning, and told me to keep the bed for him that night, but he did not return.</p>

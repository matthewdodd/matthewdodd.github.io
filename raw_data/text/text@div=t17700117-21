            . I was coming up Ludgate-hill, on the 10th of this instant, about the hour of seven. I observed the prisoner and another boy before Mr. Darke's window. As I came near, the prisoner ran off, and in his running, I heard a noise as of silk drawing through some confined place, and as he ran, something dragged after him; I followed him across the way, and about the middle of the Old-bailey, I took hold of him, and said he had robbed that shop; he said he had not. He was stuffing something into his breeches; I asked him, What he was pushing there? he said it was his pocket handkerchief. I took hold of the end, as he had not quite got it in, and pulled it out: it was this ribbon. (Produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor). I took</p>
               <p>him back to Mr. Darke's shop; there he confessed he took it through the hole of the shutter, where it screws to the outside shutter.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The block that the ribbon was upon, was on the inside, at the screw-hole. We imagine he got at the ribbon by a wire, but that might be safely conveyed away.</p>

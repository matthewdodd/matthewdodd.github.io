In consequence of the usual chairwoman being ill, the prisoner came in her place, and on the 8th of May, I gave her a drawer to clean out of a closet in the kitchen; there were five sovereigns and a half in the drawer, wrapped up in a bit of paper; I forgot to take it out, and when she had left that day, I missed it - I went with the usual charwoman to her house on the next day, and spoke to her about it; she asked how much there was in it; I said, five sovereigns and a half; she said, there was not near so much.</p>

I was the charwoman at the house for twelve years, but being ill, I sent the prisoner - the prosecutrix came to me the morning after she missed this money; I went with her to the prisoner - the prisoner said she had not seen the money; the prosecutrix said, I don't wish to hurt you, if you will give me the money, if you have spent any it must be made up - I saw her put her hand into her bosom, and pull out some halfpence in one hand, which she showed, but her other hand was closed, and I saw her put a sovereign into her mouth, and swallow it - while the prosecutrix was gone for an officer, I said to her "Give me the sovereign;" she said I have swallowed it.</p>

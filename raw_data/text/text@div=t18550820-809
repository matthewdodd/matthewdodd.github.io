                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Wilford, of No. 83, Harrow-road, a leather seller. On 26th July I saw that the doors and win<lb></lb>dows were all fastened, and went to bed between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was the last person up—about 5 o'clock in the morning I was called up by the police, and found the doors and windows still secure, but there is a partition in the middle of the passage, coming out from the wall, which instead of being in its proper place, I had to push back—it was not in the same state as when I went to bed—it is a door and entrance to the shop by day, and at night is pushed forward to form a partition—it comes from the wall in one solid piece of wood, and separates the shop from the passage—it was partly across the passage—that would enable anybody who was in the passage to get into the shop—it goes from the floor to the ceiling, and runs on castors—it is larger than that dock—the staircase window on the first land<lb></lb>ing was closed when I went to bed, but I do not know whether it was bolted or not—I observed some little cakes of mud on the sill on the inside in the morning, like what would come off the sole of a shoe, but the window was shut down—the street door was open, and a door of a little passage leading into the kitchen, and communicating with the outside of the house—by open<lb></lb>ing that door you can get into the passage, and out of the house, or out of the window up stairs—the inner door, out of the shop into a passage, was also open—if a person succeeded in getting through that window they could get into the shop, by moving the partition, but not through the door with<lb></lb>out breaking it—it is like a street door key latch, when it shuts, it fastens, and cannot be opened without a key; but this was opened from the shop—on going into the shop I found that all the cushions and patent leather were gone—my brother has identified them, they are worth 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no appearance of violence to that door—about an inch and a half of candle was left burning—the landing window is rather high from the ground inside,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live at No. 9, Irongate Wharf, Pad<lb></lb>dington. On 27th July, about 3 o'clock, I was aroused by the barking of my dog—I got up, and looked out at the window over into a court, and saw a man, whom I believe to be Smithers, with several parcels of goods—he was in a private passage, leading to a public house—he was packing them one on the top of another, as if arranging them to be taken away—they were large parcels with brown paper round them, and looked like cloth or woollen goods, but I could not see what they were, because they were in paper—I put my trowsers on, went down with a light, went out at the street door, round the corner into the passage to the man, and said, "Halloo, what game are you up to here?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I know better than that"—he made a spring to get by me—I seized him by the collar, we had a slight scuffle, and he got away, as I had no shoes or stock<lb></lb>ings on—I followed him two or three yards, and hallooed "Police! stop thief!"—it was twilight out of doors, but dark in doors—about 10 o'clock in the morning I went up to the police station—two men were brought out, and I said, "To my belief, the short man is the one who I had the encounter with, that was Smithers"—his dress and everything agreed with my descrip<lb></lb>tion—I have not the least reason to doubt it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of No. 11, Duke-street, Exeter-street, Lisson-grove. On this Friday morning I was in Exeter-street, at 10 minutes to 7 o'clock, and saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stop at No. 3, Exeter-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner Pollett was the driver, he got down, opened the door and Smithere</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Summers Defence</hi>. On 27th July, I arose from bed at 7 o'clock to look for work, and went to ask for a job of work at the new bridge that they are building at Westminster, but could not get one; I got up to Paddington at 8 o'clock, and met John Smithers a little after, and we went both of us as far as Maida-hill for another job, but was refused; on our road back we were met by a man about 20 minutes past 9 o'clock, that asked us if we wanted a job; we told him we did, and he said that if we went as far as No. 3, Exeter-street, we could get one, as there was some goods there that a man wanted somebody to carry away; we never saw the man before and have not seen him since; we went, and we saw the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> at the door, and we asked him if he was the man that had some goods to be carried away; he said, "Yes," and we went up stairs with him; he then said that if we carried those goods as far as Oxford-street, we should have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when we got there, and he said that he would not have wanted us, but he had had his <hi rend="italic">cob</hi> out all night, and he had just put it up, as he could not keep it any longer; while we were considering his proposal, three policemen in plain clothes came up and said, "You must consider yourselves prisoners on suspicion of stealing this cloth;" we both said that we knew nothing about it; don't you think that had we been the men that stole the cloth, or even knew that it was stolen, we would have locked the door or made some resistance, but we did neither; four policemen then took us two, and we went to the station house; the policeman, No. 10, stopped in the room with the cowman; it is my belief that, from what was said before the Magistrate, he stopped back in that room to get the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to put it on to our shoulders, and if he did he would get off; another thing that looks strange is, that the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> heard the charge booked and we did not, but were called in by the Inspector ten minutes' afterwards, and were told that we were charged on suspicion of stealing the cloth; we were then locked up till 1 o'clock, when we were taken before the Magistrate; on our first examination, the baker that is against us now was not there; we were remanded for eight days, and then he came and gave his evidence; it seems very strange, from the evidence that he gives, that he was not there on the first examination; and from what I have learnt since, I believe he is nothing more than a made witness, for had he seen anything that excited his suspicion, he would certainly have come up the first day; I certainly think that the man that sent us to the house to get the job, must have been in some way connected with this affair; I hope that you will get this case thoroughly examined, as I think the police have got the affair together, because they did not catch the people that did it in the fact; it is a made up thing against me on account of this girl, Rose Carpenter; I kept company with her, and sergeant Hazledine seduced her, and threw her on the town; I had a woman at the police court to prove that I was</p>

               <p>sleeping in her room on the night of the robbery, that I went to bed at 10 and got up at 7 o'clock the next morning; she is a hard working woman with a family, and if I had brought her here, her children would have been starving, and I had no money to pay her.</p>

                  </hi>. I was landlord of the White Horse, Knightsbridge, on 12th Oct. I recollect Fidler coming there that day, at half-past two o'clock, with Jebb—Fidler asked for a pint of ale, a sheet of paper, pen, and ink—I saw Fidler give Jebb a check for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,-notes, a silver watch, some keys, a neck-tie, some gloves, and various other articles in a handkerchief—Jebb changed one of the notes with me, and then he tied the property up in the handkerchief—I think it had not then been removed from the table—I think Mr. Cole was in the room—Fidler and the groom left, 1 think, about half-past three—Jebb was a little intoxicated, but not so much as to be quite incapable of taking care of himself, as I thought—I wrote the receipt which has been produced, and saw Jebb put his mark to it—the check produced is the one named in the list.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coachman at the livery stables of Mr. Bathers, who keeps the Red Lion, at Brompton. About four o'clock on Friday, 12th Oct., Fidler and the groom came there on horseback—the groom appeared as if he had had quite enough to drink—Fidler had on a plain coat and police trowsers and boots—Fidler got down and fetched a quartern of gin out—he gave the groom a glass, and took the remainder himself—the groom paid for it—they then parted, Fidler going towards town and Jebb towards Putney—Jebb appeared quite drunk—I did not notice the prisoner so much as Jebb, as he was one of my own cloth—I did not consider him so far gone as the groom—the Red Lion is a quarter of a mile nearer Putney than the clock-house—the horses appeared very nice quiet ones.</p>

About 11th or 12th Oct., about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the parlour of the White Horse, kept by Mr. Fell, and saw Fidler and Jebb there—when 1 went in Jebb was sitting with his face towards the table—I cannot say where Fidler was—there was a silk handkerchief, a pair of gloves, a groom's whip, and a gentleman's cane on the table, and Jebb took four sovereigns, and I think a half-sovereign, and some silver and copper, I believe, from his pocket, and put it on the handkerchief—he then searched his pockets for something he appeared to have lost, and after searching two or three of them, he drew out what I afterwards saw was a check for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he placed them in a net purse at one end, and the gold at the other end, and put the purse into the breast-pocket of his coat—they then sat down, and had some dinner and ale—after that Jebb was intoxicated, and could not keep himself erect, and he fell forward with his head on the table—Fidler was then sitting at the table, on the other side of Jebb from me—he rose up to light his pipe I believe—he then came round the table, and sat between me and Jebb—I then heard him mutter something about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was about a yard from me, and Jebb's head was still leaning forward on the table—I then saw Fidler put his hand under Jebb's coat, to the breast-pocket where I bad seen the purse put, and afterwards withdraw it, but I did not see him take any<lb></lb>thing—I went out, made a communication to the landlord, and then left.</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker. I think I saw the prisoner when he pawned this small brooch and ring with me, but I cannot be positive of his person; I lent 2s. on the ring, and 6s. on the brooch; the real value of the brooch is not more than 12s.; there are four very small dia<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060046"></xptr>monds in it; the address given was "

            . I am in the service of a pawnbroker, in Tothill-street. The prisoner pawned this large brooch with me; I have the counterpart of the duplicate I gave, it was on the 4th of August, in the name of John Edwards, Grove-street, Camden-town - I lent him 16s. on it; it is worth from 30s. to 35s.; the diamonds are not worth 6d. a piece; they are all roses; small sparks - he asked me 1l. for it, and I lent him 16s.; I asked how he came by it, and he said it was his own - he was dress respectably.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean, Sir, that this could be made for five guineas? A. I do not suppose it could be made for that; the workmanship is very valuable - I really do not know what the pearls that are in it are worth.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to swear that these are rose diamonds? A. I should take them to be such -I had not the curiosity to count that there are sixty-five of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That is the only thing I pawned; Gray came to me, and said he had a present from his uncle- I did not see the other things, but he asked me to pawn that brooch; he assured me it was his own; I did not know it was stolen.</p>

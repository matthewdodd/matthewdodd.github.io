               <p>"Oh no, never mind, I have often left the cart here, it will mind itself you had better come in"—I went into the bar, and when I got there I found he had run into the room adjoining the bar, which is the tap-room, and ordered bread and cheese and half-and-half; I ran into the room to tell him I was not in want of bread and cheese or half-and-half, and if he did not come out I would go out myself and take my property—he said, "Make your life happy, if it is seven o'clock it is plenty of time for me"—this was past seven o'clock—I ran out and went to the door, and found the cart and horse, and all the property gone—I went in to Henry Gershon and told him—he said nothing—I then called a policeman, and gave Henry Gershon into custody.</p>

I am a dealer in metal, and live in Brownlow-street, Drury-lane.

On Thursday the 26th of January I saw a horse and cart standing on Clerkenwell-green—I took charge of it, and removed it some distance from the stall, and read the name on the back of the cart, "Henry Gershon, No. 2, Paradise-place, Spitalfields"—I took it to the green-yard—on the Saturday following I went to the house of Michael Gershon, in Princes-court, Drury-lane, with the prosecutor—I took Michael Gershon to Bow-street—while I was there Abraham came to the office, (in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, as I was given to understand,) and I took him—in consequence of further information I went to Fisher-alley, Petticoat-lane, and found some brass and other property, which I have brought here.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of August I was in Fore-street, and saw Mr. Bacon - the prisoner was seven or eight yards behind him, in company with another person; I watched them on the on the opposite side of the way; there was nobody between them and Mr. Bacon; at the corner of Aldermanbury-postern the other man (whose name is Sampson, and who is now in Cold Bath-fields prison) took out the handkerchief, and turned down Aldermanbury-postern - the prisoner was close at his side, and crossed over Fore-street, down Moor-lane; Mr. Bacon went on: Sampson returned, and went down Moor-lane, to the prisoner, whom I saw deliver the handkerchief to him, up a turning; they saw me, and Sampson ran away; I laid hold of the prisoner, took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and made him run with me down Basinghall-street; I took it to Mr. Bacon, who claimed it- the prisoner said he did not take it - I said I knew that.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was looking for work, and met this man, and in going along I turned up Moor-lane - he there asked me to take the handkerchief - I put it into my pocket.</p>

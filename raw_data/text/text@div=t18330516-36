            . I am a Chelsea pensioner. I was at the public-house on Sunday evening, the 21st of April, having a pint of porter; I saw Rogers, the prisoner, and two men sitting in a box - I sat down on the other side of the room - I saw the prisoner hugging very close to Rogers, and I thought I would take him out of the room - she was on his right side, and I saw her put her face close to him as if kissing him, and she drew his watch - I said, "Rogers, you have lost your watch;" I saw her attempting to put it under the table, and he took it from her and gave her a shove away, and came out into the tap-room; she then took up the pot, spilt the ale, and with a desperate blow, she cut his head open.</p>

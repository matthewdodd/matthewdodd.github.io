                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Emily Lewis, of 27, Groevener<lb></lb>place, Westminster. On Sunday night, 9th Jan., my mistress went out, and I was the only person left in the house—at ten o'clock there was a ring at the bell—I went to the door—there was a person there, who told me that my mistress was taken very ill, and I was to go to her at once, that he was sent for me—he told me where she was—I went down stairs for my bonnet and shawl, and left the man in the hall—when I came back he hurried me away quickly out of the house—I shut the door after me, and saw that the door was well fastened—I went with the man to Knightsbridge—he tole me to stop at a number, till he returned—it was not the house where my mistress was—he went over the way, and stood for a minute at a corner—as a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came up, he stooped down to escape my notice, and ten ran away—I spoke to a policeman, and we both went back to my mistress's house—there were some people there—the door fastens with a spring lock, inside—a person inside could open it by pulling back the lock.</p>

                  </hi>. On this Sunday night, about half-past ten, I went to the prosecutrix's house, where I lodge—I had a latch key, but could not open the door with it—I rang the bell—about two minutes after, the door was opened very quietly and the prisoner came out,</p>

               <p>knocking me down—I jumped up as soon as I could, and followed him—I think I followed the same person who knocked me down—I overtook him, took hold of him, and saw him drop a breast-pin—I picked it up—it was mine, and had been in a pocket-book, in a leather bag, in the back room on the second floor in Mr. Lewis's house—there were some papers lying on the ground when I laid hold of him—I cannot say that I saw him throwing them away, I was too much puzzled at the time—I saw the prisoner taken into Mr. Lewis's house, and saw the bracelet found—I believe it to be Mr. Lewis's—the policeman showed me a pocket-book, containing a gold turquoise, a gold union pin, a foreign coin, and some notes, which are my property——I afterwards saw my leather bag—it was still locked, but the side was cut open.</p>

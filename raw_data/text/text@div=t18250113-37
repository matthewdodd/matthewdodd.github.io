            . I was with Gilpin, and saw him seize the prisoner - I saw the prisoner pass a handkerchief to a companion on his left; and the other two companions walked down Charles-street; the prisoner called to one of them,</p>
               <p>"Jemmy," who immediately pulled off his hat, and shewed a handkerchief, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is this the gentleman's, if it is, he may have it?" but it was not; I then looked to see, if he had another, which he had not; I then went after the third boy, but he got away.</p>

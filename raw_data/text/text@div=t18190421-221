On the 15th of April, Wallwork came to the shop about ten o'clock in the morning, and desired to look at some Irish linen - I showed him two pieces, he asked me if I could send them for a friend to look at? I tied two pieces up, and took them with him myself. He took me to a public-house in Leigh-street, kept by Mrs. Churchill. He desired me to sit down in the parlour, which I did, and presently the prisoner, Morgan, came in; both of them looked at the linen, after that Wallwork left the room. Morgan then wished me to recommend him the best piece of the two - I recommended that at the highest price; he said he would have it, but he must have some French cambric for frills - he wished me to fetch him two or three lengths to look at. I went home for them, leaving the linen he had chosen with him. I returned immediately with the cambric, and found they were both gone with the linen. The landlady said they were gone out with it, and that Morgan had it under his arm. I ran out, caught sight of them, and secured them both together in Gower-street - Morgan had the cloth. He said he was going to show it to the person who was to make his shirts. I gave them in charge.</p>

            . I am a clerk at the West India Docks. My brother was mate of the Isabella, which laid in the London Docks. On the 24th of July, I was on board, on a visit to my brother. The prisoner, Rowley, was a mariner on board. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I saw him coming on board from the quay, dressed in a smock frock, which he usually worked in. He went down to the forecastle, and came up again in about a quarter of an hour. He had changed his trowsers, and pulled off his smockfrock. He appeared very bulky. There was a ship between us and the shore. My brother stopped him as he was making his way towards the bows to get ashore, to avoid us; we took him into the cabin; my brother told him to strip; he appeared unwilling to do so. My brother stripped him, and took two pieces of printed cotton from him, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the officer came did he say any thing - A. He said he hoped my brother would look over it, and offered him all the money he had in his pocket, and said he would tell where the remaining pieces were, that they might be recovered. My brother refused, in consequence of a circumstance which happened before. The second mate brought in four pieces of cotton, which he said, in the prisoner's presence, that he found them under his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell where the goods were - A. He said as my brother would not forgive him, he would not tell; he knew the worst of it, that he should be transported, and he did not care for that, for he would not stop long.</p>
               <p>ROWLEY. Q. Did you see your brother take the cotton from me - A. I did. The Isabella has sailed, and my brother with her.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 24th of July I was fetched on board the Isabella. I took Rowley in charge, and the cotton and the trunk, which contained only thirty-seven pieces. As I was taking Rowley to the office he asked me to let him go. After the examination, as I was taking him to the New Prison, he asked if it would do him any good to say where the prints were. I told him it would not, but he might do as he pleased about it. He asked me to order the coach (which we were in) to go up Rosemary-lane. I did so, and he pointed to the prisoner Chambers's door, and said, "there is where I have sold them," and that he had got 1l. a piece for them. He said he took the first piece into the parlour. Next day I went to Chambers's and found Burton at the door, he appeared to be the servant. I asked for Chambers, he came out of the back parlour; I told him I wished to speak with him; he appeared reluctant to speak to me, and wished to go to the side door; I told him I must go into the parlour, as I had a warrant to search his house. I opened the parlour door, and immediately saw nine pieces of printed cotton in a trunk. I found a piece in a drawer which appeared to have been cut off the other pieces. He said he did not buy them, but that his man, Burton, did. I brought Burton in, he said that his master's money had paid for them, and they were both present. I took them and the goods to the office. I found some gown pieces had been cut off the cotton, and told them of it; they said some had been sold, but they should be recovered again. They were recovered again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not Rowley say that the man who stole them had not been paid his wages - A. Yes; he said he carried them out of the Dock. He said he got at the trunk through the ballast port, which was left open at night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether the goods were taken at once or twenty different times, you cannot say - A. No.</p>

               <p>EDWARD WILLIAM SOMERS. I am a clerk at the Thames Police Office. I took down what the prisoners Chambers and Burton said on their examination. (reads)."Chambers said, the man brought six pieces to sell. I did not like to buy them, but Burton came in and said, he dare say they were got honestly, and agreed to give 1l. a piece for them. I paid him. We cut off pieces and sold them to different people." Burton said he was shopman to Chambers. He saw the man with him, and bought them for 1l. a piece, which Chambers agreed to give; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090057"></xptr>said it was agreed; that he should have a third of the profits of what was sold, instead of his wages.</p>

In 1822 or 1823 the prisoner came into my employ, to attend in the office and go on messages - he left me in October, 1826, I think; he can write but very indifferently - I do not know his hand-writing; in consequence of some communication I received, I gave information at Bow-street, and under the direction of Ruthven, the officer, I wrote this letter, (No. 1); I had previously received this other letter on the 6th, (No. 2); I took my letter myself to King-street, Long-acre, and gave a boy 2d. to take it into No. 31 - I saw him taken it in there; in consequence of receiving one letter, and writing another, I went to the corner of James-street at six o'clock in the evening of the 7th of January; I saw the prisoner there- I went up to him, and said, "Brewer, I have brought you the 10s. you wrote for;" he said, "I will not take it in the presence of a third person:" a young man named Handeside went with me from my office; the prisoner said,"Come round the corner," and I followed him round into Long-acre; I then said to him, "Brewer, how could you send me that letter;" he said, "I am in great distress, but I do not wish to injure you;" I said, "Here are the 10s." - they were in four half-crowns, and he took them from me; in consequence of an arrangement, I then gave a signal to Ruthven, who was immediately on the other side of the way by moving my hat; Ruthven came up, and took the prisoner - he did not take any thing from him in my presence.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was cross-examined by the prisoner at considerable length, a minute statement of the particulars would be indelicate; he denied having gone with him to Hyde-park and other places, for any purpose; when witness was seriously ill, the prisoner had made tea for him, and he believed had eaten at his table; his wages were 1l. a week - witness had given him a coat, he had attended him at Brighton, when witness had a dislocated arm - witness had never written any letters for the prisoner. When the prisoner was in Clerkenwell prison, for assaulting two boys in Kensington-gardens, witness did not write to him, and knew nothing of three letters produced by the prisoner - he did not allow him 1l. a month while in prison, but had given a Mrs. Sherritt what wages were due at the time he was sent there - he did not know the prisoner had been in the Guards till he had lived some time with him; the prisoner never dined at his house with one Stevens - does not know Captain Hunter, but might have seen him, and never said he was afraid of him; the prisoner might have taken tea with witness when he was laid up; was never at a Police-office, nor ever had a warrant against him; the prisoner had frequently applied to him for money, for relief, and a character; and in consequence of a letter he received he paid 5s. per week for rent for about a month or five weeks, and had given him old clothes once or twice - he never took the prisoner's trunks from his lodging to the French Horn public-house; he never took a double bedded room at the George and Blue Boar inn, nor had the prisoner come into his apartments in Dean-street, or introduce him as Captain Doyle; did not know a person in the regiment, nor any private soldier whatever - had not slept at the George and Blue Bear this ten years.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. Mr. Finch called there on the 7th of January, and made a representation, and had some advice given him - I believe this letter was written in consequence of that advice - he was advised to write a note; I marked four half-crowns, and returned them to him, and met him that evening in Long-acre about six o'clock; I agreed with him that he should give me a signal with his hat - I got there just before he came; I saw the prisoner in James-street -Mr. Finch and a person with him walked by - I believe Mr. Finch spoke to him, but the prisoner sheered off, and turned into Long-acre, followed by Mr. Finch - I was on the opposite side - a signal was given; I immediately crossed, laid hold of the prisoner, and put him in the passage of a house - he put his hand into his pocket, and said, "Here are the 10s.," giving me the four half-crowns, which I have no doubt are the four I marked; on the way to the office, the prisoner observed "This ought to have come out long ago;" this letter was in the prisoner's hand or pocket; I rather think he took it out of his pocket with his hand, and said he would not part with this letter but with his life - it might save his life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not catch me by the hand, and this hand was in my pocket? A. The money he took out of his pocket, with which hand I cannot say - I generally lay hold of people by their right hand.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is this the letter you sent him? A. Yes; (letters read.)(No. 1,) To J. W. Stevens, No. 31, King-street, Long-acre.</p>

               <p>SIR, - I write mrely to express my surprise at not receiving from you what you promised to send me once a forghnight - I have resrved your note, where you say I might expect to receive it till after Christmas, some weeks; you will have the goodness to send me, by return of post, what you promised, or I shall take those steps that will be very unpleasant to you; it is not my wish to make you uncomfortable - recollect it is your conduct to me that compells me to expose you; you tell me I have no claim on you - the first person I will appeal to is your mother, and after that to the public; you must suppose, sutuated as I am, wanting common necessaries of life, and being turned adrift by you, I am ripe for every thing - it is of no consequence to me; if you can concienessly take steps to injure a man who never injured you, do it as soon as you think proper, and if you do a heavy curse will fall on you: reflect for a moment what has passed betwixt you and me; it was not a day or a month, but for years, and now tell me I have no claim on you, and sey me to even wdnt a meal yesterday - I was without foad the whole of the day - the same to-day; I have nothing to pledge, or I would not have troubled you for the money to pay the doctr; the 10s. did not pay the doctr; if I do not receive the 10s. to-morrow, the ill able, I will walk to your mother's, and will explain every thing to her; it is in your power to prevent it, by sending me what you promised me once a forghtnight - I have your note to prove my assertion; I shall expect an answer to-morrow. I am your's. &amp;c., J. W. STEVENS.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. FINCH. Q. Had you seen the prisoner between the time of his being committed to pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190061"></xptr>son, and the receipt of this letter? A. Yes, several times; I certainly never promised to send him any thing: I understood by his threatening to expose what had passed between him and me, that he meant to accuse me of an unnatural crime; I had had him to attend me when I had a fistula, and could not have a female.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What was due to the prisoner? A. Near 20l.; I think it was 18l. odd - the greater part he brought me himself, 5l. at a time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the letter that was sent to Mr. Finch; I cannot read nor write: I have been in his service, but not as a regular servant, nor regularly employed - I have not been there for three days together in a week; the letter sent to me was brought by a boy; I was obliged to go out to get a person to read it; I did not know who it was from, or what was its contents - I went out, and the first person that accosted me was Mr. Finch; he said, "Do you want me?" I said, "No, Sir, unless you want me;" he said, "Yes; you want the 10s. to pay your rent: "I walked from him - he put the money into my hands; it was taken and produced at the office before the Magistrate: I certainly did make use of the observation that it ought to have been out years ago; I have no witnesses, and I hope you will be merciful to me.</p>

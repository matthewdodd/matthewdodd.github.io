             sworn. - On the evening of the 18th of last month I was walking up <placeName id="t18050220-43-crimeloc265">Fetter-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him about the White Horse? - A. No, he accosted me; I looked up the gateway, from that circumstance, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 18th of January, I was about thirty yards up Fetter-lane, making water at some inn that is just at the beginning of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200041"></xptr>Fetter-lane, when the prosecutor came up to me; some man halloaed out, do you want the White Horse; sir, said I, the White Horse is as far as you can see on the same side of the way; the gentleman walked on, and I walked on about my business; he turned round, and said, you have picked my pocket; I said I had not done any such thing; some gentleman came out with a light, and I was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

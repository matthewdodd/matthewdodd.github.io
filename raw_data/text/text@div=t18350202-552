                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 77, Cruflford-street, Russell-square, in the parish of St. Pan crag. The prisoner was my footman—he came into my service on the 24th of November last—I had the plate stated in the indictment, at that time—when I hire a new servant, I count over the plate which I give into his charge, and give him an inventory—I did so when the prisoner came—I have the plate always brought up to my bed-room at night by the house maid—she takes it down the following morning, and delivers it to the footman—on the morning of the 20th of December, the house-maid took the plate-box out of my room—I had some of it in use on my breakfast-table, and at lunch—the prisoner waited at both those meals—I have a son a proctor, who resides in Doctors' Com<lb></lb>mons—I very frequently go and dine with him—when he has a party larger than usual, he requires some of my plate; and I had a box made for the purpose of sending it backwards and forwards—it is a smaller box than the one which is carried up to my bed-room—when I went to dine with my son, it was the prisoner's duty to accompany me, to wait at table—on the 20th of December, I was engaged to dine with my son—the prisoner had notice to attend me, as usual, to wait at table—there was no plate re<lb></lb>quired to go to Doctors' Commons that day—after taking lunch, I went out to take a walk with a friend, about two o'clock, and returned about four o'clock—I then saw a man standing in my passage—I asked the cook who he was—she was in the passage—the prisoner was down stairs—the man went up into the drawing-room—he was a glazier, and went up to mend a window which the man-servant had broken—the cook accompanied him—I saw her in the drawing-room with him—she was holding him a light—I went up stairs to dress about five o'clock, while the man and</p>

                  </hi>. I am gaoler at Marylebone police-office.

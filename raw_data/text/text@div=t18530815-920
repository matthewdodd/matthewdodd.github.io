                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Holls, a baker, in Union-street, Somers'-town; I live there. On Saturday night, 30th July, I was in the neighbourhood of Broad-street and New Oxford-street—I was sober; I had only drank two half pints of beer all the week—I wanted to get to Somers'<lb></lb>town—I saw the female prisoner, and asked her the way there—she told me she would direct me directly—she had no bonnet on—she asked me to give her a glass of gin—I went into a public house and gave her one—I then went with her I suppose fifty or sixty yards—in going along she said she would show me the road directly, but she was going in after her bonnet—we came to a court, and I went down the court because I was a foolish man, I suppose—when I got to the door of a cottage, she said, "Walk in"—she then told me to shut the door and bolt it—she did not give any reason for going in, but when I was inside she told me to slip the bolt, and I did so—she then told me if I would give her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she would strip naked—I said I would have no such thing—I tried to leave the house—I put my hand up to the bolt but did not reach it, she seized me too quickly; she caught bold of my left band trowsers pocket—I had a crown piece in that pocket, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, a key, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my right hand jacket pocket—I am not positive which—when I treated her at the public house, I took the money out of my jacket, not out of my trowsers—she caught hold of me, and I could not get her band loose—I seized it with all my might, but found she was stronger than me—we had a struggle; I was on my knees, and she sung out, "Why don't you come in? come in!"—and the male prisoner came in and struck me—I was then on one knee, and he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me on my back on a kind of cot or couch; he held me there with his arm across my throat—while he did that the woman was emptying my pockets—I missed about 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a key—I had a watch, and I saw the man make a <hi rend="italic">grip</hi> at the chain of it—the watch was concealed under the waistcoat, and did not go—I do not know what became of the female, the man held me down till she escaped—they did not say a word that I know of—I believe they both left me; I found the door open, and was glad to get out—I spoke to an officer, and gave a description of the persons—he took them.</p>

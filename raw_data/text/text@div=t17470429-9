            . I was in my Kitchen, and I heard my Men cry out, Stop Thief! I asked what was the Matter when they cried stop Thief, then the Prisoner dropped the Quarter of Lamb.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of your own Knowledge?</p>

            . I was brushing the Side block down, and there were two Women cheapening a Bit of Meat with my Mistress; while my Mistress's Back was turned, the Woman cried, Mistress, Mistress, a Man has got a Leg of Mutton ; I cried Stop Thief! and I caught him about four or five Doors from our House .</p>
               <p>Q. What did he drop?</p>
               <p>Collet. The Quarter of Lamb.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the Person?</p>
               <p>Collet. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up that Lamb that you see him drop?</p>
               <p>Collet. I did not take it up, but I saw it brought back .</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it, did you show it to your Master ?</p>
               <p>Collet. Yes, my Lord, and I took him to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had him to the Watch-house, what did he say then?</p>
               <p>Collet. He said he never meddled with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from him when this Lamb was dropped down?</p>
               <p>Collet. I was just coming out of the Door, and I saw him drop it, and I pushed by directly; and I came back directly when this Lamb was brought in, I believe it was some Customer picked it up; it was the first Grass Lamb we had this Year.</p>
               <p>Court . Then you don't know who those Women were.</p>
               <p>Collet. No, my Lord, I don't know where they live.</p>
               <p>Lewis. This Fellow returned from Transportation the first of February last; whether he staid his full Time , I cannot tell. Mr. Alderman Davis spoke of being here , I expected to have seen him here. The People that saw the Prisoner take it, thought it was a Leg of Mutton; they cried, the Man has taken a Leg of Mutton . This Fellow has an exceeding bad Character .</p>

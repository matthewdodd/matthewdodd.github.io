               <p>DISPORT CROSSDILL sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 22d of December, a silver table spoon of mine was missing, as my servant informed me; the next morning I was sent for to Sir Sampson Wright's, when I was informed, that the prisoner had offered it to sell; my spoon was there, and produced in my presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe this man lived in your house as a servant? - No, he did not; he lived with my father in law; he was his coachman.</p>
               <p>Did he occasionally assist at dinner, in carrying down the plate, and other articles, as other servants do? - I suppose he did; there is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was carried before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>I believe this was the story he told there, that in carrying down the plate he had trod on a spoon, and bruised it, and afraid of losing his place he sold it? - The bowl of it was bent; nothing of it was deficient.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner brought me this spoon, and gave it to me to sell; I asked him whose it was; it was on the 22d of December last.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - Between eight and nine in the morning; he said it belonged to a servant that lived in the Minories; I told him that he must send for that servant, and in the mean time I acquainted my brother with it, and sent for a constable, and took him to Bow-street; in about half an hour I was sent for to Bow-street; this is the spoon, in the same state in which the prisoner offered it to sell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I see the crest is the most plain part of it? - Yes, it is very plain.</p>
               <p>Now, I believe, before he went out of your shop, he told you he was a servant in Mr. Crossdill's family, and that he had trod on the spoon, and bruised it? - He did so; not at first, but after I had stopped him, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>He said he meant to replace it with another? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>He offered his silver watch to purchase another with? - He did.</p>
               <p>He said that afterwards; after he had trod upon it he bent it together? - Yes, he said he set his foot upon it.</p>
               <p>Did he say he doubled it together? - First of all he said he trod upon it and bent it; and then, he said, afterwards, he set his foot upon it to bend it as it is now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to prosecutor. How long has this man lived in your father's family? - Two or three months; I do not know who he had his character from.</p>
               <p>During the time he lived in your family, what character did he bear? - Upon my word I cannot say any thing against him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you learn at all whether he said any thing of this to his fellow servants? - No, quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Fitter, your father-in-law, remarkably strict with your servants? - Very properly so.</p>
               <p>What was the rule of the family, with respect to breaking any thing? - None at all; with respect to myself, I keep my servants in very good order, and, at the same time, I am rather humane to them, for, when my own servant told me there was a spoon missing, I told him do not make yourself uneasy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell any of your fellow servants of this accident, and to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090047"></xptr>enquire of them whether you would run any risque of displeasure by it? - I was afraid they would mention it to my master, and I was willing to make it good.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in the family? - About five months.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been obliged to make good any damage or accident before? - Yes, Sir, the last place I lived in, I was obliged to make good every thing I lost or broke.</p>
               <p>But not at Mr. Fitter's? - No, Sir, they never mentioned it to me; my witnesses are not come, and I have not had an opportunity to look them up; I lived with Mr. Bray, at Clapham, better than eight months.</p>

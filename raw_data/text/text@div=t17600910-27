            . I live at Chelsea; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment out of my father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. I found this gown (producing one) on the prisoner's back when I saw her in the compter; I heard she was in Woodstreet compter, so I went and found her there; she was committed for something else.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it made of?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. It is silk and stuff; the pawnbroker has the shift body, and two aprons; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find them?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. I found them about the beginning of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in your house?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. She came backwards and forwards a chairing in our house.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for herself?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. When I found my gown upon her she did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say where she had it?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. I did not ask her, because I knew where she had it; she told me where the stockings were in pawn, and I went and fetched them, and paid a shilling and a penny.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>She lent me those things.</p>
               <p>Q. to A. Clark. Upon your oath, did you lend the things to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. Upon my oath I never did; I never lent her the worth of a halfpenny or farthing in my life; she never asked me to lend her any one thing; she has asked for a penny or two-pence to get her a dram, or I have told her to go to the public house in my name.</p>

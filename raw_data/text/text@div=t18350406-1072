                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Castle-street, Hounds-ditch, but am now in custody. I had dealings with the prisoner about the 26th and 27th of February—it was on the Thursday and Friday I dealt with him—he came to me on the 26th, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, with a parcel of samples of silk in a paper, and asked me to buy some of them, and ultimately we agreed for 144 or 145 yards, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, all round—it was silk and cotton mixed—the shots were cotton, and the other parts silk—he came back again, and said, "Won't you buy any more of it?"—I said, "No"—he came back in about ten minutes, and said, "If you will have more of it, I will let you have it a fraction cheaper"—I offered 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for about 300 yards—he would not take it without I took 400 yards, and he brought 425 yards—I think that was at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had them to sell for a gentleman who wanted to raise money—I bought 552 or 553 yards of him in all—about three weeks after that I went to Plymouth—I was very ill at the time—I saw Messrs. Dabb had Stevens, at Plymouth—they bought 115 yards of the silk of me, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—it was that which I bought of the prisoner at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but I gave them liberty to pick out the best patterns—Mr. Dabb and I had some conversation afterwards about the silk, and in consequence of what he said, I left the silk in the hand of Mr. Hertz, where I lodged, and came to London for the purpose of ascertaining about the silk, to get the man I had them from—to get a regular bill of parcels of the silk, which I had asked him for when I first bought it—he had promised he would bring it to me immediately, but he did not—after coming to London I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner on Wednesday morning—I had a great deal of trouble in going after him, and not letting him know what it was about—he came to my house by his sister's orders—I did not want to tall him what had taken place—I said to him, "Mr. Lazarus, you must make the measurement good, and had better give me a regular bill of parcels of the goods I bought of you"—he said, "I will bring it to you in less than two hours; I will go to my man, if you say there is short measure, and will bring it in two hours"—he went away, and promised to come again, but did not—I was looking for him the whole afternoon, and found him in a public-house in Gray's-inn-lane, or Portpool-lane, in the evening—I went out with him, and kept him in conversation, meaning to give him to the first policeman I saw; but I did not see a policeman—it was dark—I gave him into the custody of an officer in Barbican.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now when you went to Plymouth, what account did you give of the silks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I bought them as a job-lot, from a person in London—I was not asked the name of the person—I did not give it—I did not men<lb></lb>tion whom I bought them of, till I went to my attorney, which was on Wed<lb></lb>nesday afternoon—I had come to London on Sunday night, very ill indeed, and was not out of bed on Monday—on Tuesday I went in search of La<lb></lb>zarus—I first mentioned that Lazarus was the person I bought them of, when I had him in custody—I told my attorney, Mr. Yates—I had been told at Plymouth that the goods were suspected to be stolen, the par<lb></lb>ties there had heard of the robbery—I did not give the account of Lazarus to save myself—I had no idea of saving myself—I knew who I bought them of, and went to London to get my man, and to know whether they were the goods that were stolen—I came to London and asked him for a bill of parcels—I did not tell him what had happened—I told Mr. Dabb that I had exchanged these goods for jewellery—I did give a watch and chain in part payment of the third lot of goods—I told Mr. Dabb so—I swear I told him that, and nothing else—I never used the word jewellery—that is jewellery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not state before the Magistrate that you had offered the goods to Mr. Cohen, of Prescot-street, and to a man who went about, whose name you did not know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was to Moses and Mr. Myers—I told the Magistrate I offered them to Mr. Cohen, and to a man who goes about, but they would not let me go on with the name—I did not say that I did not know the name of the man, and could not tell where he lived—Mr. Jones, the prisoner's attorney, interrupted me at the time, and would not let me speak—he is the same Mr. Jones who taught the porter—the porter was examined before the Magistrate, but he had been taught by Mr. Jones what to say, and all the other things—I found him in Mr. Jones's company, and he knew every thing that had hap<lb></lb>pened—he said he did not know Lazarus at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mention the name of Myers, was it not at the house of Myers you yourself first left a portion of the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was at Mr. Key's—I did not take any to a pawnbroker's—none were sent there, to my knowledge—I did not authorize any body to take them—all the goods I disposed of at Plymouth were what I offered to Dabb and Co.—I offered them to all the shopkeepers at Plymouth, Devonport, and Stonehouse—I did not give Hertz any to pawn—I heard from Mr. Dabb that he had pawned some, but I knew nothing about it—some of my linen was pawned as well—Hertz is a poor man, and has done so, I understand; but I really do not know any thing at all about it—I left my goods in the care of Hertz, to give them to Dabb—they were in a sort of tea-chest, which was packed full—I did not pack them up as tea on board the vessel—they were in a wrapper and paper, and then in the tea-chest—we do not enter goods in a steam-vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever in your life charge Lazarus with having any know<lb></lb>ledge of the goods, till you yourself found that you were charged with being in possession of stolen goods, by the gentlemen at Plymouth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not, because I did not see him till Wednesday morning—Mr. Dabb did not ask me about it—he told me there was a rider at his house who thought he knew the goods to be stolen from a gentleman in London, and I (considering I had no bill of parcels of them,) thought it best to go to</p>

               <p>London to see about the matter; whether they were honestly come by or not—I bought them on the 26th or 27th of February—I was not able to go about my business for three weeks—I bought them at home—I have no bill of parcels when I buy a job-lot of goods, unless it is at a regular ware-house—I measured them when Lazarus brought them—in the first lot there was a deficiency, but it turned out to be greater—I was by myself when I measured them—there was a gentleman in the room when I paid Lazarus for the second lot—that was Mr. Herschell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not charged with being the receiver of the goods, before Sir Peter Laurie? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I know of—I had no idea that I should be sent to gaol—I was not allowed to produce Herschell as a witness—I was stopped by Mr. Jones—Mr. Adolphus, my counsel, was at the second examination—he did not offer to call Herschell—I do not know what my solicitor has done—I believe I have a counsel here to-day—I did not say before the Alderman that there was no person present when I paid for the goods—when I met the prisoner in Portpool-lane, I was going to give him in charge to the first officer I met, but I could not find one till I called on Collingridge, a refiner, in Wilderness-row, and told him to assist me to get one—I could not find an officer from Wilderness-row to Barbican—I did not see any officer—I might have seen a policeman far off, but I thought the prisoner would slip away before I could call him—if I had sent for a policeman when I had him in the public-house, he would have been sure to have gone away, for he was more acquainted with the landlord than I was, and he would have had assistance and gone away—some of his friends were there—there was a house-full of people who might have done me a mischief.</p>

I recollect being in Levy's house some time near the end of February—when Lazarus came there, I was in the back room, looking at some goods—Levy left me, and opened the door to a knock, and I saw Lazarus come into the back-room—he carried a kind of basket with goods in it—it had some covering—I saw it opened, and it contained silks—I saw them taken out—Levy first took out one piece—they both took them out—a few words passed, like contention, about buying and telling, between Levy and Lazarus—they drew on one side of the room, and I on the other—Levy began to measure some of the silks; and when he had mea<lb></lb>sured ten or twelve yards, Lazarus said to Levy, "Let me have the money, I have no time, the people are waiting for the money—you may take my word, I will be answerable to you for the measure, that it shall be right"—I saw Levy give him some sovereigns, I cannot say how many exactly, but there were above twenty, and Lazarus then left.</p>

I turned about, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, I took it from him, and took hold of him (produced in court and depnsed to).</p>
               <p>Q. Where has it been since?</p>
               <p>Teise. It has not been out of my custody since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was a little boy that took the handkerchief, and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see a little boy near you at that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body nearer to you than the prisoner at that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he was the nearest to me.</p>

               <p>I hope the court will take it into consideration, I have very good friends to my character; I never was guilty of such a thing in my life. I have belonged to a privateer, and am discharged.</p>

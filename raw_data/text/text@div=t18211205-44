            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 26th of November, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner off Iron-Gate stairs, in Drummond's wherry - I boarded the boat, and said "What are you doing with this boat," it had "J. Drummond, Hermitage-stairs" on it, he said he was going to the Phoenix. I found part of a pair of braces in the boat, and in his trowsers pocket, a pipe key, which he said was the key of his lodging, at the Maze, in Tooley-street - I asked how long he had left White's-yard; he said six weeks. About four or five o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 2, White's-yard, where I knew he lodged, and the key opened the door of the front room - I found a shirt and two handkerchiefs there; a woman was there whom I knew he lived with. I shewed the things, and told him where I found them, he claimed them, and on Wednesday, Knott saw and claimed them - I had seen him at that house before in September.</p>

The prisoner was eight days in my service, and in consequence of her being tipsy she was discharged, and on the day stated she was intoxicated; I told her she must leave - she was very impertinent, and said she would not go till she had had her tea; I said, "Get your tea" - she did not seem to do that, but was very saucy; I then said I should look through her boxes - she said, "You may look, you have nothing to lose;" I then looked into a bundle of hers, and found a loaf of bread quite new - she said it was her own, and she had bought it; I sent for an officer, who found the other things.</p>

             (Police-constable D 4). I took the prisoner; I found this handkerchief in her pocket, and this spoon was wrapped up in a napkin between her bed and the mattress - I found another halfquartern loaf under her pillow.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. This handkerchief and spoon are mine, and I believe the bread was; she gave us a reference to a Clergyman at Bath; she did not say she had lived in town, but we find she has; property worth 20l. or 30l. was found in her box.</p>

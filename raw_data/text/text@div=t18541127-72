                  </hi>. I am nineteen years old, and am the son of Robert Crossley who was tried here last Sessions, and who is now in prison; he kept a beer shop in Bermondsey—I resided with him there, and assisted him in his business—I know Baker, who was butler to General Eden—I first saw the prisoner to notice him, on Saturday, 9th Sept., about 10 o'clock in the morning at my father's shop—on that day, by my father's direction, I went to General Eden's house—I got there about half past 7 o'clock in the morning, and received from Baker a rush basket with a flat bottom, which contained plate—I took it to my father's house, and gave it to him when I got in, and he took it up stairs, and put it in the front bed room—in about half an hour the prisoner came; my father went up stairs with him, and I followed—they weighed the plate, and while they were doing so the prisoner took out a tankard; it was an old fashioned one, with a bust of Queen Anne at the top, and about thirty coins let in—my father said he thought it was gold; the prisoner said, "No, it is silver I know, because I have such things passing through my hands every day;" and he asked me if I had got a file—I said I had got one down stairs; he desired me to fetch it—he tried the tankard with the file, and I believe it turned out to be silver—it was gilt—that, as well as the rest of the plate, was weighed; there was some spoons and forks, and a fish ladle, of old fashioned make—the prisoner and my father together weighed it, in what had been a potatoe machine which was kept up stairs; it weighed about twenty pounds—they were iron weights, potatoe weights—after it was weighed, the prisoner put it into the basket again from which it had been taken—I saw 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold paid to my father by the prisoner, out of a little canvass bag, such as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), just the same colour—I cannot swear to it, as it had a string like this (<hi rend="italic">red tape</hi>)—after the money had been paid the prisoner asked me to carry the basket out for him to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said, "Take this; I am going to take this along with me, and I will pay you for your trouble"—he left the house first, and I followed him to Weston-street, and found a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> waiting under the arch of the railway there; he took the plate of me, got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and drove off—I saw him again between 4 and 5 o'clock on that afternoon; he brought back the same basket, but without the plate—on the following morning, about the same time, I went to Onslow-square again (I got up that morning at 6 o'clock; I think my father and mother, and my little brother slept in the same room with me that Saturday night, and my brother Robert slept in the same bed as me)—when I got to Onslow-square, I saw Baker again—I had taken the basket in the after<lb></lb>noon previous, Saturday: and left it there, and on the Monday morning I received it again from Baker filled—I took it to my father's house; it con<lb></lb>tained plate the same as before, but new fashioned—my father took it up stairs—I gave it to him directly I got inside the door—about 1 o'clock the prisoner came, and they went up stairs together—I was up stairs cleaning myself in the room where the weighing machine was, and where the family slept—I saw the prisoner empty the basket, and weigh the plate—there was a plain silver teapot, four large silver dishes, four smaller ones, and some silver spoons, which the prisoner admired—he said that they were very massive table spoons—he put about half a dozen of them in a paper, folded</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270097"></xptr>
               <p>them up, and put them in his pocket after they were weighed—the plate was then put into the basket by the prisoner, and I believe there was about the same quantity of money passed as the day before; it was all in gold, and was taken out of the same bag—the prisoner employed me to carry it as before, and I followed him to St. Thomas's-street East, on the other side of the river, where there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> waiting at the bar which stops carriages from going down; it was not a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand—the prisoner took the plate of me, got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and drove away—he did not give me any money; he gave me a glass of gin—on Wednesday, the 13th, Baker came to my father's house, and remained there till the 25th, when he was taken into custody, and my father also—after my father was taken I accompanied sergeant Whicher to Petticoat-lane, and found the prisoner there; he had just come out of a house there, a public house I believe—I then said some<lb></lb>thing to Whicher, and he took him into custody.</p>

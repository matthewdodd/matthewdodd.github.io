                  </hi>. I live at Hounslow. On the evening of the 5th of October I saw the prisoner in the Haymarket, between six and seven o'clock—we got into conversation, and went to a public-house, and had something to drink—I met with two other females—I and the three wo<lb></lb>men went to a house in Coventry-court—we got into conversation together there, and after a few minutes the prisoner left the room—I had not given any of them money to get drink, but I gave one person a shilling for the room—soon after the prisoner had left I put my hand into my pocket, and missed two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which I had taken of Mr. Jenkins—my notes were safe when I gave out the shilling, and the prisoner left the room in five or ten minutes—the women were in close conversation, but I do not know what might pass—I was not quite sober, but knew what I was doing.</p>

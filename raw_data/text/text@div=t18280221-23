            . I am conductor of the Bow-street patrol. On the 5th of January, about a quarter to eight o'clock at night, I and Wilson met the prisoners coming down Quaker-street, Spitalfields, in company together, each had a bundle in his hand; I took Glover - Wright directly threw down his bundle and ran away; Wilson ran after him - I picked up Wright's bundle and asked Glover how he came by those bundles; he said they were clothes belonging to his father; that he had been to his aunt's in Long-alley, who gave them to him for his father, who had left them there; I asked what Wright was, who had run away - he said he was his brother; I asked what made him run away if they were his father's clothes; he said he was so timid, he always ran away. I had never seen him in custody before - Wilson returned without taking him; I took Glover to a public-house, and found in his hat a shaw I and some feathers, which he said were his mother's; I took him to the watch-house, and then went and took Wright at his father's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you tell Glover that what he said would be used against him? A. No. nor did I either threaten or promise him - he said he lived with his father.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with Skillern. I could not overtake Wright; Glover informed us where to find him - we went that night, and took him at his father's; I asked if he was the boy who ran away - he at first said he was not, and then that he was.</p>

On the 5th of January my wife brought me my tea, and said several people had been there, inquiring after different names - that she went out, and found the door open when she returned; I went home with her about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and found the door half open - I missed this property, which I know was safe the day before, in the box; the property in both bundles is mine. I cannot say whether the house was fastened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the value of the property? A. My things are worth about 4l. 10s. - the waistcoat is worth 12s. - it is quite new; the breeches 10s., the coat 12s., and here is another waistcoat, worth 5s., but they cost me 6l. 10s. I was married at St. Luke's about seven weeks before the prisoner was taken - my wife's maiden name was Merrott.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I went out at a quarter to six o'clock - these things were there then; I left nobody in the house - I shut the door, and took my husband his tea; I did not lock it - the windows in my room were shut: I had to come back for my work - the clock struck six when I was in Liverpool-street, coming home; I found the street door open - I am certain I had shut it; it goes on a latch; I did not go in, but went for my husband, who was working at the livery-stables; I waited till he was paid - he went into the house before me; we found the box pulled from under the bed: there are lodgers in the house - we only rent one room; an old lady lives up stairs - I cannot say whether she was at home. I value my things at 9s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were married seven weeks ago, were you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GLOVER's Defence. I had been from my master's to my aunt's at the same house as these people live in - my aunt rents it; a man who stood at the door gave me two bundles, told me to take them and wait at the top of Longalley, as my father and him were going to sea - I waited a long time, nobody came, and I returned to the house; nobody was there - I went to my mother; she said she thought they were not got honestly, and told me to take them back; the officer took me as I was returning -Wright, being frightened, ran off.</p>
               <p>WRIGHT's Defence. I met Glover, who asked me to carry one bundle back to Long-alley, when the officers met us; not knowing anything of the property I flung it down, ran home, and told the prisoner's mother that he was taken.</p>

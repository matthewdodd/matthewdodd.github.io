            . I am a servant, and live in Leonard-street. On the 29th of March, about five o'clock, I overtook the prisoners in Newgate-street - they were quite strangers to me; I only saw the male prisoner at first; they were not walking together - he was stooping when I overtook him, and said he had picked something up; he went on, stopped, and I overtook him again three or four yards further; then he showed me some earrings; he went on to the corner of Newgate-street - he had not walked above a dozen yards altogether when he showed a parcel to me; he said he had picked them up, and was never so lucky in his life before as to pick any thing up of any value - I said, "Have you?" he then crossed over to the New Post-office, and near the Bull and Mouth, St. Martin's-le-grand, I saw him again on the same side of the way as I was on; he showed me an ear-ring and ring - I had seen the ring before; he asked me to read the bill for him; they were tied in paper; I read it - the amount was 5l. 18s. 6d., it was for a pair of ear rings and two gold rings - we gave it to the Magistrate at Guildhall, and it has not been returned- he asked if I would buy them, and said I should have them for 1l.; that he was in distress, and a little money would be more useful to him than the parcel - (I did not see the female prisoner till the man was taken into custody;) I said I could not, and then he said I should have them for 15s.; I gave him 14s. 6d. for them - he then left me, and I did not see him any more till he was taken into custody - I took the ear-rings and rings; the officer, who had been watching, came up, and asked if I had bought any thing; I delivered them to him - he took both the prisoners into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not at first deny to the officer that you had bought any thing? A. Yes; I then walked on five or six yards; the officer spoke to me again - I told him, and delivered them to him; I did not suppose I had done wrong; the prisoner stopped and spoke to me first.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TYRRELL. I am an officer of the Post-office. On the 29th of March, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners in company, going backward and forward in Newgate-street, which excited my suspicion I saw the man follow the prosecutrix down Newgate-street, and show her something in a paper; he followed her to the end of Jewin-street, and suddenly parted from her - the female who was in his company kept on the opposite side; I told the street-keeper to call the prosecutrix back, and just at that moment the male prisoner crossed over, gave something to the female, and said,"Here is 14s. 6d.;" I took hold of them, pushed them into a house, and took the 14s. 6d. out of the female's hand - I am certain they were in company; she was very reluctant to give up the 14s. 6d., and dropped a ring out of her hand; it appeared a wedding-ring - I searched the male prisoner, and found in his waistcoat pocket a strip of paper, on which was written "Two pairs of gold ear-rings, two gold keys," amounting to 5l. 18s. 6d.; I gave that paper to the Magistrate, and it was lost - the street-keeper came back to me, and said the prosecutrix had bought nothing; I sent him back again; he brought her back, and said she had bought the ear-rings - I found a key in the male prisoner's pocket; I searched his lodgings in Green-street, Commercial-road, and on his shelf found another paper, with the same words on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say they were together - had you your eyes on them the whole time? A. I cannot say that I had; I saw them for four or five minutes before he addressed the prosecutrix, and saw him speak to several young women, which excited my suspicion - he was standing when the prosecutrix passed him; he then went in front of her.</p>
               <p>MARIA ANN COPELAND. I am matron of Giltspur-street Compter. When the female prisoner was brought in the officer requested me to search her - I took her into an adjoining room, and saw her put her hand to her bonnet I felt her bonnet, and said, "What have you here?" she said, "Nothing but curl-papers;" I said, "I insist on searching, for there is something more;" she was going to strike me - I turned to call the officer, and when I returned with him, she approached towards me, and said, "You may now search me," and I picked a paper off the ground, containing four rings.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HAWK RIGGE. I am a street-keeper. Tyrrell beckoned to me about the middle of Aldersgate-street - I followed the prosecutrix, and asked her to return with me, and if she had bought any thing - she said No, at first; she afterwards gave me the ear-rings and a mourning-ring- I have also those picked up in the prison, and have had them ever since.</p>

            . I am a jeweller. These ear-rings are brass, and not worth 1d. - the rings are brass, and worth nothing; I would not give 1 1/2d. for them all.</p>

                  </hi> I am a shoemaker, in Church-street, Lisson-grove, On Monday evening, 15th Nov., about half-past five o'clock, the prisoner came for a pair of clogs—she tried several pairs on, none would do, and she went out—after she was gone Mrs. Hanton told me something, and I went after the prisoner, stopped her about twenty yards from the shop, told her she had something, and saw the toe of a Wellington boot under her shawl—I took her back to the shop, and found the fellow boot under the chair she had sat on—I sent for a constable, and gave her in charge—they had been hanging on a nail at the back of the chair she sat on.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Swinney. I am wife to the prosecutor, and let the prisoner at the bar a lodging; she was with me about five weeks. She was to have paid me fifteen pence per week, but she never paid me but one week's money. She lay in a little table bedstead by herself. At five weeks end she kept away, and I feared she had taken away some of the things. I got some of my neighbours to look through a crack in her room door, who said, they thought the bed was gone. Then I went to look for her, and found her at a neighbour's house, hid behind a curtain. I took her home to shew me if all my things were safe. She went up with me into the room, and there I missed the bed, bolster, blanket and 2 sheets. I ask'd her where they were, but she would not own any thing till I sent for a constable. Then she own'd that she had pawn'd the bed, bolster and two blankets to

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix offered to take my note to be paid for them at Michaehmas, as she knew I had 5 l. left me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Powell. I am servant to Mr. Scriven in Swallow Street, St. James's. The prisoner brought this pair of sheets ( here produced) and pawned with me; one on the 27th, the other on the 28th of May. for eighteen pence each. I have known her three quarters of a year; she used to bring things to pawn for her neighbours. I never heard any harm of her before.</p>

            . I live in George Street, Grosvenor Square. I am a pawnbroker. On the 11th of June the prisoner came to me, and said she would bring a bed of a gentlewoman's, and asked me if I took in things. I said any t hing honestly come by. She brought this bed the next day; and she also brought this blanket and bolster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she use your shop before that?</p>
               <p>A. Fletcher. She had brought things three or four times before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. According to the date the pawnbrokers mention, she must have pawned them three weeks before she left her room.</p>

            . I am constable. On the 29th of June Mrs. Swinney sent for me, and told me she had been robbed by the prisoner, who was then siting with her. I examined the girl, and with a good deal of talking to her she confessed she had taken the things mentioned, told where she had pawned them, and went along with me; where I found them accordingly. I took her before justice Trent, and he committed her. I had a search warrant, and the pawnbrokers delivered the things to me.</p>

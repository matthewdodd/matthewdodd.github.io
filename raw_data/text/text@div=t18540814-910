                  </hi>. I am living at No. 3, Avery-row, Bond-street. On Tuesday evening, 20th June, about 7 o'clock, I was in Hanover-square; the prisoner came up to me and asked me whether I could take a note for him to Mr. James, of No. 10, Wardour-street—I said, "Yes;" he gave me the note, either in the square, or in George-street, which is close to it—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—after giving me the note, he walked down with me to No. 16, in George street, and told me I was to bring an answer back to No. 16, George-street—he said he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my trouble—I left him at No. 16, George-street, and went with the note—I went to Mr. James; it is an oilman's shop in Wardour-street—I handed the note to a shopman; he took it to Mr. James; I did not see him open it, but he came to me with the note in his hand open—he had some con<lb></lb>versation with me, and I then went back to George-street—I did not find the prisoner there—on the following Saturday, I accompanied a policeman to Leicester-street, near Leicester-square; that was about 3 o'clock—while I was there with the policeman, I saw the prisoner; he was walking in the street—I did not see where he went to—I afterwards went into a coffee shop, in Leicester-street—there were two men in the room; the prisoner was one of them—I then came out of the coffee shop, and went back to the policeman—I did not return with him into the coffee shop.</p>

I am acquainted with Mr. Nisbett—I happened to be at his house on 21st June, when the boy brought this note in—it is not my wife's writing—I know nothing whatever about it—I accompanied the boy back to Bury-street, with a policeman, but did not see anybody there—I think some man came to the door and knocked, and made some inquiry—I asked the lad if that was the man, and he said "No," it was some stranger.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Lisle-street, Leicester-square, and let lodgings. The prisoner and his wife lodged at our house in the early part of June—he was in debt for rent—at the time he left it was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was on 14th June—at the time I had some conversation with him about a cheque, he owed me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I suppose—I pressed him to pay it—that was about the end of May—he showed me a cheque on Messrs. Coutts' bank for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it would be cashed on 12th June, and then he would pay me, or before then if he could get it cashed—it was an engraved form of cheque, like these produced—I did not notice the name of the person drawing the cheque—I think it was payable to William Coyle or bearer—in consequence of that I waited until 13th June—I then went up to his room again on the subject;—he rang his bell for me—he showed me the same cheque again—he gave it into my hand, and said, "You see it is written on 'Cannot be paid until the 22nd'"—I saw those words written on the right hand side of the cheque, at the bottom—I said I did not understand cheques or bills; I would take it down to my brother, and show him—I was about to leave the room with it for that purpose—I had got as far as the door, and had got the door open, and called to my brother, when Mr. Coyle took the cheque from me, and both he and his wife said, "No"—they would not allow their cheque to be taken down stairs—I said I would bring it back immediately—he took the cheque from me, and ran and put it into the fire—I called my sister, who came into the room immediately—I said, "He has burnt the cheque; take it out of the fire"—it was not all burnt at the time—she was going to the fire, and he caught her by the neck of her dress, and held her fast, and his wife took the poker, and poked the cheque into the fire, so as entirely to destroy it—they left the lodging next day, the 14th—they left an empty trunk behind them, and a few articles in a hat box, which the police took possession of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am an omnibus proprietor, and live in Three Nuns-yard, Aldgate. I was at the Three Nuns coffee-room on the 22nd of January—the prisoner was also there—I had seen him there before—I saw him looking round, and taking particular notice of the coats—he took one coat, and spread his Macintosh over it—he had no opportunity of taking it—he then folded his Macintosh over my coat, which he removed from the peg, and rolled under his Macintosh on the seat—in a few minutes he went out—I went out, and he began running—I called, "Stop thief!"—a man at the gateway stopped him—I then came up, and took him—he had my coat in the Mackintosh under his arm—my gloves and snuff-box were in the pockets of the coat.</p>

Between five and six o'clock this evening I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner was coming down the gateway—I stopped him—he said, "How do you do?"—theprosecutor and another gentleman followed him, and brought him back—I did not perceive any thing but the Macintosh under his arm.</p>

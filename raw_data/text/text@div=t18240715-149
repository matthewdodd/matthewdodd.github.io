            . I live next door to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150062"></xptr>Dickanson. After this robbery I heard that the prisoner was in custody, and saw him - I held him out no threat or inducement to say anything: I felt desirous to render him a service, as his father was in my employ. I said I wished him to tell the truth about the business, but at the same time said I could make him no promise, as I had not seen the prosecutor. He told me voluntarily that he had been in company with Taylor, Coltman, and Somerset - that they were at the Red Lion public-house at Twickenham, on the night of the robbery, and left there about eleven o'clock, proceeded to Mr. Dickanson's premises and stole two leaden pumps, a cistern, and a large quantity of lead off the stables and out building, and that soon after twelve o'clock Philpot came with a cart to take it away - that he brought the cart into Mr. Dickanson's meadow; and loaded it with the lead, but had got more than it would carry: they threw part of it down, and left it in the meadow, and again finding that they had more than the horse could draw, they took more out, and threw it into the gravel-pits. Philpot left them with the cart - he and Coltman then retired to a barn, the property of Sir W. Walham, where they slept.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What induced you to get this out of him - A. A wish to serve his father. I thought if he told the truth he might possibly be saved, but did not tell him so. He was committed to prison last Session, by this Court, and to my surprise two or three days after I heard he was at Twickenham, and finding he had escaped by accident I had him apprehended. I was informed he understood that I had obtained his discharge, and sent to him to say it was not so - he called upon me, and was detained. When he was examined here he declared that he knew nothing about it.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was tried and convicted of stealing this lead, and was fined 1 s. I was examined here last Session. On the morning of the robbery I saw the prisoner at Mr. Dickanson's premises: he told me the lead was all ready and waiting for me - I had brought a horse and cart for it. He, Coltman, Somerset, and Taylor were there: they all four assisted in putting it into the cart: there was more than I could carry, and I threw it off the cart. I was stopped at Brentford with it, and escaped, but was afterwards taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you ever here before except as a witness - A. I was tried for another felony besides this and was confined three years. I gave an account of this robbery to Mr. Thackrah in the gaol, before I was liberated.</p>

            . On the evening of the 5th of March I was at the Red Lion at Twickenham, and saw the prisoner there in company with Coltman, Somerset, and Taylor, for two hours or more. Between ten and eleven o'clock one went out, and then another - there was a good deal of whispering between them: they went towards the Duke's Head, public-house, which is half a mile from Mr. Dickanson's. I had applied to the overseers for a lodging that night, and was refused, and went into a shed belong-to Sir W. Walham, and about three o'clock Coltman, Somerset, and the prisoner came into the shed, and remained there till about nine - they then got up, and were brushing each others clothes, which appeared to have cobwebs about them. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Be d - d if it will do all to go one way" - he and Somerset went over the common fields, and they agreed to meet at the Broadway. Coltman went home to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who gave you the coat you have on now - A. No one.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get it - take care - A. A gentleman gave it to me - it was Mr. Thackrah. I was taken up once for being in company with one Facey - nothing was done to me. I was never charged with felony, or in confinement. I was working for a biscuit-baker, and took a biscuit for my tea - he took me before a Magistrate.</p>

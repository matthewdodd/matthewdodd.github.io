            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. I apprehended the prisoners in Cable-street, about three-quarters of a mile from Mr. Holder's, about half-past eight o'clock; Carr had a bundle under his arm - Berry was just a-head of him; I asked Carr what he had carrying - he said clothes; I asked where he got them - he said it belonged to the lad a-head of him; my brother officer Fogg took Berry - Carr said then they were hired by a man to carry it for sixpence - Berry told the same story.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CARR. I told him the gentleman was gone on a-head. Witness. No, he said a gentleman had given them to him in the Commercial-road, but he did not say where he was to take them to.</p>

             . I am a silversmith. The Prisoner at the bar came to my shop, the corner of High-Holborn , the 7th of May, about noon, and brought me a silver table-spoon, and offered it to sale ; she said she had half a dozen of these spoons , but had sold the other five; I asked her why she did not sell this where she sold the others. I examined her pretty closely, and then she said she found it in a tub of hogwash at the King's Arms Tavern in Pall-Mall. I sent my servant to know the truth of it, and he said, the people there told him they had not lost a spoon; I told her, if she would not tell me the truth, I would take her before a Justice of the Peace. I sent for Mr. Jones , a headborough, and had her before Justice Broadhead, and whilst the Justice was writing the Commitment, she took us to the house where she had the spoon.</p>

             (constable.) When the Prisoner was before the Justice, she said she would shew us where she had the spoon; we went with her as far as the Hay-Market, and then she said she had it at Mr. Birch's, and Mr. Young delivered the spoon to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the spoon?</p>
               <p>Jones . This is the spoon.</p>
               <p>Birch. I believe this to be my spoon.</p>

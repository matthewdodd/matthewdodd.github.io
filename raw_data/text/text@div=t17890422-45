Money, says I, yes; that I have plenty; then says he, deliver it it directly, for we must have it; then I put my hand in my coat-pocket; I had two brace of pistols about me; and the other prisoner, Gillett said, you may as well deliver it, for we must have it; by that time three of them had got their sticks up; he then put his stick across his arm, and came up with his hand, as if to receive the money; I had two brace of pistols about me; I pulled out a pistol from my breeches pocket; and one of the other two said, we are as good be off, we had better be off; and they ran off, and I fired right in amongst them; and I followed them, crying out stop thief! I am an officer in the excise; and I had been out after some smugglers, which is the reason of my being armed; one of these sticks I can swear to, but the other I will not; I pursued them, they separated, Gillett was never out of my sight, but Forsith got clear off; the corner of the Bank I pickt up this stick; Gillett was stopt in about ten minutes; I am sure to his person.</p>

               <p>My husband keeps the sign of the Crown in Nightingale-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you known the prisoner? - About six weeks; at the time he is charged of doing the robbery, he was in my house; my child was very ill; there were several people dancing up stairs, and he was with them; I went up stairs to take my child up to-bed; I had the child in my arms, and a pillow, and two bottles of medicine, and a candle; I had occasion to go through the club-room; there is a passage at the end of the club-room, which parts the room where I was going to and the club-room; this was a little before eight o'clock; I recollect it, for there was an old lady lay ill in the room; and I asked her, if she wanted any thing? and she asked me, what o'clock it was? I told her; he came up to me, and took the candle to light me; he is a very civil young man, it was on the 5th of March, on a Thursday.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know that; how come you to recollect it? - It was a particular day, I went to a burial that day; and Mr. Smith, the Justice, sent to my husband afterwards to know whether he he had seen Forsight at his house that evening; I should not have recollected it, but for the circumstances of his coming up to me, and holding the candle to light me.</p>
               <p>How many people were there in the club-room at that time? - There were forty or fifty men and women.</p>
               <p>Did you know them all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to come here? - The Justice desired I would appear on his trial, as he had been informed he was at our house that evening; he said that as he was fully committed, nothing could be done, but I must appear here.</p>
               <p>What part of the room did the prisoner come from, when he came and held the candle? - He came from the further part, he came running towards me.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the room? - Not above a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner dancing while you was there? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any body dancing? - Yes, some of the company were dancing, but the prisoner was not, he was standing up; there is another witness here, her name is

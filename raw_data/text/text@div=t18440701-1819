I am at the head of the police in the East and West India Docks—I received information on the 29th of May, in consequence of which I went to the warehouse, No. 6, which had been superintended by the prisoner—I found there, among other things, Nos. 3066, 3067, 3068, 3069, 3070, 3071, and 3072 bales of pickings—they were weighed, and corresponded with the weight fixed against the number in the warrant precisely—the numbers were smeared over with ink, which obliterated the original marks of the number and weights—they are in Court now—as they stood the smeared marks wen not placed outside, but there were other marks on them, which had no con<lb></lb>nexion with any cargo which was landed in 1844—these marks must have been put upon them, and were "40,489," signifying the 489 ship arrived in 1840—those marks were external—on removing the packages, I discovered the smeared marks, and found they contained cotton pickings of the weight named on the warrants—I went to Mr. Blackmore the same day, with Mr. Williams and Jupp—Blackmore took us to his warehouse, and there I found packages marked "8066," "8068," "3069," and "3071 "—they did not tally with the weights in the warrant—when I took them to the warehouse, they weighed more in the gross—they altogether varied—the mass was good cotton—Nos. 3068 and 3071 were entirely good cotton—in the other two the majority was good, with damaged at the top—the inside was good—good cotton is worth about four times the damaged—I afterwards went to a Mr. Hamilton's warehouse, in Dunster-court, and found the other three number—they weighed double the quantity marked on the warrants, and the cotton was nearly all good—3070 and 3072 had the greater portion good, with bad put in the top—it was so in the bulk, wherever there were pickings they were at one end—I had it all removed to the Company's warehouse—I found the bags of pickings with correct weight in the Company's warehouse, and the cotton at the two places on the same day.</p>

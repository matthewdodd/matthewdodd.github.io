            . I am a constable. On the 27th of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, running; an ass was across the foot-path, which made a stoppage: the prisoner, with another, ran down Artillery-lane; I took him about twenty-five yards down the lane, and, on opening his jacket I found this pocket-book at his left side. I saw Mrs. Stulpner in about two minutes - she was pointed out to me, and claimed it, and stated the contents accurately - I opened it at the Mansion House - he said a person gave it him to carry, but did not say to whom, or where he was to take it; the other got away.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The other boy came up and said if I would carry it he would give me 3d.: that he had just picked it up, and did not like to carry it: he ran away when this gentleman took me.</p>

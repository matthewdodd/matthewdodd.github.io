The prisoner came in and asked to look at a gold eye-glass for Mr. Jones, of Jermyn-street—I took a tray of gold and silver articles from the counter, and showed him some—he said he wanted one with two glasses, a double one of the best chased solid gold—I showed him two, and said the price was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said the one that Mr. Jones bad he had paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—I was obliged to leave that part to ring a bell for a person to attend to another customer—I then came back, and missed an article from the tray that I had shown the prisoner—he went out, and said ten minutes would do to send them round—I followed him and saw him go into a public-house—he was examining something—I got a police<lb></lb>man and took him, found one frame that I had not missed, and on searching him further we found this other, which I had missed—I went home and missed them both.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brook street, Ratcliffe. On the 26th of Dec. I saw Mr. Hubbard at the corner of Devonport-street—he fell down—the prisoner came up to him, wiped his eyes, and picked him up, and then she felt his pocket—she took some money out and counted it—there was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she was going to put it in her bosom—I hallooed out, "Pull the man's money out, and put it into his pocket"—she pulled her hand out of her bosom, closed, and put it into his pocket—she pulled it out and said, "Now it is in"—I said, "I don't think it is"—he was then going on, and she was going with him—a Mr. Wiseman came up and said, "Where are you going?"—the prisoner said, "To No. 4, Vinegar-lane"—he said, "He shan't go there, you are going to rob him;" and he said to a boy, "Go for the policeman"—the prisoner lifted Mr. Hubbard's waistcoat, and looked at his watch and said, "It is right"—I saw her take 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from his trowsers' pocket, some coppers from his right-hand waistcoat pocket, and some coins from the left.</p>

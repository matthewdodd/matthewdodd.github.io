The Prisoner came to our Shop the latter End of January last, with a Child in her Arms, and bespoke 10 Dozen of Candles; after which she begg'd leave to sit down with her Child in our Kitchen: we did not refuse it, so she came in and sat down by the Dresser, where the Spoon and my Velvet Hood lay. She staid some Time in the House, and dined with us; and told us the Candles were for her Aunt, who kept the Jewel-Office in the Tower and as we had served that Person before, we were civil to the Prisoner, and she staid with us from 11 in the Morning, till 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon: she then went out, telling us she would go to the Box-maker's, and order a Box to be sent, into which the Candles were to be put. As soon as she was gone, I miss'd the Spoon and Hood, which lay upon the Dresser, and remembering I had seen both of them in her Hand, while she was in the House, I went after her to the Box-maker's, but she had not been there, nor did I see any thing more of her, till last Wednesday, and then I happened to see her going to take Water at the Old Swan. I taxed her with having taken the Goods, and she confessed she had sold the Spoon to one Basil Denn , who lives on the Left-Hand Side of the Way, upon London-Bridge. My Husband went to Denn's, and enquired for the Spoon, but it was never produced. She owned she took both the Spoon and the Hood, in the Presence of me, my Husband,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160004"></xptr> and my Mother (Eliz. Wilson ); my Servant was in the House the same Time she took them.</p>

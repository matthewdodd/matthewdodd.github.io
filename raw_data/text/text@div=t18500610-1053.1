                  </hi>. I keep the Wheat Sheaf, in Baker-street, in the parish of Enfield. On 16th May I went to bed soon after twelve o'clock at night, leaving the door barred, locked, and perfectly safe—I got up at a quarter before six, and found the bar door inside the house broken open—I missed from the till four shillings, six sixpences, six 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces, and about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-worth of copper; and from a little box in a bureau a hundred 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces, which I had seen safe before I went to bed—one of the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces was black on both sides, one side not so black as the other, and there was a little mark like a T, but it was not perfect—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it there over-night—it lay at the top some days, and I noticed it particularly—I found a window open at the back of the house—it was close to the ground—a pane of glass had been broken out of it before—the glass was quite cleared away—I could put my head in, but not my shoulders—a man could put his hand in and open the window from the outside—I am sure the hasp was fastened.</p>

On this Friday morning, about three o'clock, I had been oat of bed about ten minutes, I heard a noise, as if some one was at my timber—I opened the window, and saw two men going from the back of the Wheat Sheaf, up Mr. Cracknell's garden, which leads from Mr. Ade's garden—it is not a thorough foot-path—the tallest had rather lighter clothes than the other—I could not see him, as it was not light—they resembled the prisoners in height—I had not known the prisoners before—Cracknell's garden is separated from the Wheat Sheaf by a fence, five feet high—I heard them open the gate at the top of Mr. Cracknell's garden, and shut it, to go into Churchbury-road.</p>

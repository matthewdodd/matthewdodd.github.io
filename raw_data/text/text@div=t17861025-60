            ; when I first came to the house, I hang the watch up in the bar; it hung for a considerable time; on the 15th of August my husband was taken ill; the prisoner was sitting in the kitchen reading the newspaper, about four yards from where the watch hung; I went out and returned, and the watch was missing; I suspected the maid, and threatened to take her up; the prisoner said, if you take us all up, my pretty face must go before the Justice; I did not suspect the prisoner; I took him to be a gentleman of five hundred a year; I lost a punch ladle before on Thursday night the 18th of August; we found the watch at one Mr. Purse's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you kept the Talbot? - Just come there; we kept the Opera coffee-house before.</p>
               <p>The road to the rooms that are most frequented, ( you understand me without more explanation) is through the bar, is it not? - If you was to come there you would go through the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I never shall be that way I assure you; how long had this gentleman of five hundred a year been at your house? - He came on the 10th; he staid a week.</p>
               <p>Was it you that presented the bill of seven pounds for his week's board? - No, Sir, my husband; but then he had three or four gentlemen eat and slept with him; he always had one or two, sometimes three gentlemen slept with him.</p>
               <p>Did not he refuse to pay it? - I do not know</p>
               <p>Was you present when your husband said, if you do not chuse to pay that bill, I shall charge you with stealing a silver watch? - He was taken up on the 18th and carried before a magistrate; he was at large from Friday till Monday; there were advertisements with a reward to find the watch; he was taken up again on the 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Did he continue at your house after this? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you take in newspapers from Bow-street? - No, I never saw this watch advertised.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Young man, what do you say for yourself, you are proved to have pawned this watch the very day it was lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all about the watch, nor never saw it, nor was I through the bar that day, I can solemnly deny that I ever pawned a watch for these two years past but one, and that was my own.</p>
               <p>Purse. I have no doubt about him; I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Prosecutor. After this man was taken up and discharged, he brought an action against you for false imprisonment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That action is still depending? - I was served with a copy of a writ to answer the 6th of November; the term is not yet begun.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner's witnesses called, but none answered.)</p>

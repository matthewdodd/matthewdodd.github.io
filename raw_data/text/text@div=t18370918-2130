                  </hi>. I am servant to Sir Charles William Maxwell, of No 8, Hertford-street, May-fair. I do not know the parish—on Tuesday, the 19th of September, about four minutes before two o'clock, I was sitting in the kitchen with the maid servants at dinner, and heard a noise in the pantry, which joins the kitchen, at the back of the house—I went into the pantry, and in the act of going there I saw a person leap from the pantry down a step into the wine cellar, and run to a door at the lower part of the passage—I ran along the passage and met him at that door—there are two folding doors leading from the pantry into the wine cellar, and he jumped through those doors into the wine cellar—when I went into the kitchen to dinner I had not left a soul in the pantry—I cannot say whether the wine cellar doors were shut or open, no further than I left the pantry as usual, and I should think they were shut—I had left the plate in the pantry, which is part of the dwelling house, and under the same roof—I saw the person going along the pantry into the wine-cellar—he had some plate in his right hand—I ran along the passage, and met him at the door, and seized him by the collar, as he took his leap from the cellar to get into the area, where he struggled with me—in the meantime he kept dropping the plate around</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180091"></xptr>
               <p>me and himself—I saw that—I held him till the policeman came, and then he was taken into custody—the prisoner is the man—the policeman has the plate—he did not take all the prisoner had—I had some taken back into the pantry—I cannot tell what quantity of plate the prisoner dropped in the struggle—I counted the plate after it was taken back—the maid servants picked up some—they are not here—I know the quantity I took from the prisoner myself, and gave to the policeman—it was Sir Charles William Maxwell's property.</p>

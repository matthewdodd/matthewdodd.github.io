               <p>I am niece to Mrs. Clarke; last Friday was a week, she gave me several things to carry home to the prisoner's; I took them with the man till we got to a public-house; my aunt lives in Nightingale-lane, and keeps a clothes shop; I do not know where the public-house was; I was to go to his aunt's, as he said, but he took me to a public-house; he took the things away from me in the passage of the public-house; I never saw him afterwards, but he did not pay for them; he took them from me without my consent; as soon as he snatched them out of my hand, he went through the house; my aunt told me not to deliver the things without the money.</p>
               <p>Jury. What did you go with him to the public-house for? - He told me that was his aunt's.</p>
               <p>Court. This public-house is a thoroughfare? - Yes; I went into the public-house, and told them the affair, and they took my aunt's name down, and place of abode.</p>

            . Did you deliver these goods to the man or not? - No, I did not; he snatched them from me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clarke. I gave her charge not to deliver the things without the money; he came back again after these goods had been snatched away, and said the shirt would not do, he must have a better shirt.</p>
               <p>Was your niece returned then? - No, she came back in half an hour after; when he came back, I asked him if the other things would do; he said every thing would do besides the shirt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman to Mr. John Ewart, brother to the Member of Parliament for Liverpool. On Saturday night, the 30th of April, about ten o'clock, the carriage was in Percy-street, Tottenham-court road—I lost a cushion out of the rumble behind, which was open—I did not miss it till the policeman came up to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>).</p>

I was on duty in Percy-street, and saw the prisoner standing on the step of a carriage—I saw him put his right arm over the rumble, push the cushion out, and throw it on the ground—he got down the took it up—I secured him, and he began crying—I went after the coachman and told him of it—I am now living with my friends.</p>

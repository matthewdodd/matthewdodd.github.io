On Monday, the 4th of March, the prisoner came to me—I did not know him before—he said, "I have got an order for fifteen dozen pairs of slippers to sell"—I asked him the price—he said, "15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I agreed to give him the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen for his trouble in selling them—I said I would not trust my pro<lb></lb>perty to anybody—he said, "Well, you shall go with me to the warehouse"—I packed up the goods, and went with him to Mr. De Pass, in Cateaton-street—a porter carried the things—when we got there the prisoner told me to stay at the door, that I should not spoil his custom—the porter took the goods in, and the prisoner went in with him—he said as he went in, Mr. De Pass would know they were not his goods if I went in—the porter came out directly he had left the goods—the prisoner came out in about a quarter of an hour, and I asked him for my money—he said, "The gentleman has not paid me yet, lie has ordered four dozen ladies' slippers more, and will give a cheque for the whole amount"—I walked with him towards my house—when we got about half a mile he wanted to borrow a shilling—I did not lend it to him—at last he jumped right over the way into a street I do not know the name of, and ran away—I ran, and halloed after him, but could not catch him—I saw him again on the Saturday morning by White-chapel church—I said, "Halloo, where is my money, Fuller"—he began to abuse me, and said, "You say I robbed you of your goods, I did not; did not I give you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit?"—I said, "No, you did not," and seized</p>

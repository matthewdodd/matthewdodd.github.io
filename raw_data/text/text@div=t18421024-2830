The prisoner came to my shop, and represented himself as an author, and made small purchases—I afterwards missed some books—he came one day, and said be wanted some Bibles and Prayer-books, to take to some ladies at Green<lb></lb>wich, who would come to town in a day or two, and would call and pay me for them—he was to show them, and asked me the price—I said they were all marked in common figures, if they took them they could call and pay for them—they were never returned or paid for—no one ever called to pay for them—the prisoner never accounted for their not being paid for—these now produced are the books.</p>

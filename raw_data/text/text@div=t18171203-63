               <p>SARAH SMITHERS. I live in Cock-lane. I know the prisoner, Gray, I have seen him meet the prisoner, Budd, several times. On the 4th of October I saw him come out of Wood-street to the corner of Silver-street, and go into the Cooper's Arms-Gray was there; I had followed him from Cock-lane; I saw them together in the house, and saw Budd pull something out of his pocket, and give it to Gray, it looked like ribbons. I found where Budd lived, and gave his master information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Gray used to frequent Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>MR. MICHAEL WALFORD BOYLE. I am in partnership with Charles Spurden and Fisher Walford. We are wholesale haberdashers, residing in Friday-street; the prisoner Budd had been two years in our service; he had access to the whole of our stock, which is very large. Smithers gave me information on the 30th of October; I sent for Budd, and spoke to him about this; in consequence of what passed, I got a search-warrant, and went to the prisoner Gray's apartments, in Pomberton-row, Gough-square, with Cartwright and Armstrong. While we were searching, Gray came in, and said they were his apartments; we found the articles stated in the indictment there, which, to the best of my belief, are our property. There was no appearance of business in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I will not swear I had not sold them; we do not sell in town-there was a woman in the room.</p>
               <p>DANIEL CARTWRIGHT. I am an officer. I went with the warrant - I have known 
               <persName id="t18171203-63-person449">Gray</persName>
             a long time, he is not an haberdasher; we found the bonnet in his cupboard, and the ribbons in the table drawer.</p>

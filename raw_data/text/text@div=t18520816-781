On Aug. 5, about half past 9 o'clock at night, I was sitting in my back parlour—I could see into the shop, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and a man helping themselves to the bonnets—the man took three bonnets from the counter, and gave them to the prisoner—there was nobody in the shop—I went in and disturbed them—the man ran away, and the prisoner took the bonnets to the opposite side of the way into a court, and threw them down—I called out to her to stop—she stood on the other side of the court, trying to hide herself—I wanted her to pick them up; she would not—I picked them up—she ran down Sun-street, and I followed her, and did not lose sight of her at all—I am sure she is the same woman—there was also a bonnet shape and a hat—the man took them; they were my property,</p>

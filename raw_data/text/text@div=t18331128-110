               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROWE. Q. Was this about ten o'clock at night? A. A few minutes after ten o'clock; there were plenty of persons about before and behind me when I missed my handkerchief; the woman was not behind me, she was in front of me; when I turned there was no one but the prisoner behind me for several yards - I either said I felt something go from my pocket, or that I felt my pocket lighter, I cannot tell which; I did not feel my pocket touched - the prisoner made no resistance; I found a handkerchief in his hat, but not mine - the magistrate said I should have secured the woman, but she could not have taken the handkerchief.</p>

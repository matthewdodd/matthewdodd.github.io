               <p>Q. You were the worse for liquor - A. No, I was as sober as I am now. The prisoner asked me to go with her; it being late I agreed to go with her. I went home with her, she persuaded me stop with her all night, I told her I had no objection to stop with her till daylight; I undressed myself and went to bed; I did not find things pleasant; I told her I should stop about half an hour. I got up, she still persuaded me to stop till day light; I told her I could not, I did not like the apartment. I had given her what I had agreed for. I sat down on the chair, and when I was tying my stocking on, she said if you do not give me more money I will charge the watch with you; she took my coat and ran off; I did not miss my coat till a few minutes afterwards.</p>

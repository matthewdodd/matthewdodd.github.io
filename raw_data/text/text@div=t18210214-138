            . I live in Homer-street, New-road, and sell thread, tapes, and things. The prisoners Twine and Norman, came and asked me to buy a box; she said, they were in distress, and wanted 1 s. for it. I said I had not got one - they said they would leave it till to-morrow; I said, they had better sell it. I gave them 6 d. and said, they should have the rest in the morning. I found a pair of scissars in it after they left. Next morning they came for the money - I said, they had better take the box back and not bother me; they said, they wanted money for breakfast - I gave them 3 d., and they bought 3 d. worth of things, and said their sister gave them the box.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STEVENS. I am an officer. I took the prisoners in charge, and found the beads round Twine's neck.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOHN DAWSON. I am the prosecutrix'e father. The prisoners all three came into the house, and asked for some coffee, which my wife sells to the working people. A parcel of boys came after them, and I ordered them out. Norman and Twine were near the fire-place - she said her petticoats were untied. Norman afterwards surrendered herself and said, they took the box to an old iron shop and got a key to it for 2 d., and sold it to Clendon. I went to her - she said, she had not seen the girls, or the box.</p>
               <p>TWINE's Defence. I left the other prisoners and went home, and afterwards met Norman with the box.</p>

               <p>NORMAN's Defence. I did not know that Twine had it till we came out.</p>

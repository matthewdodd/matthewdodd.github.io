            . I saw the prisoner running away, and followed him; I took him to the corner of Wild-passage, Drury-lane, about one hundred yards from Broad-court; Mr. Bower came up very soon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Directly I turned round he began to throw me down, which was the reason I ran; he knocked me about, and a young woman who was with him said I was not the man; he said, "I will send you where I have sent a good many more - I will transport you for life."</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BOWER. The lady who was with me, said,"How could you see him take it? you could not see him," but she spoke under fear. I am sure he is the man - he was a short time out of my sight; he struck me, and knocked my hat off; I lost sight of him while I picked it up. <rs id="t18271025-51-verdict326" type="verdictDescription">

The prisoner being almost starved I took him into the stable and gave him victuals and money, and let him lie in the loft; in a chamber joining to the lost I had a box in which I kept my cloaths, and other things.

When I was got up he was missing; then I missed my money from out of my box, three guineas, one half guinea, and 9 s. 6 d. I inform'd his father at Hampstead, who came and went with my brother after him towards Stratford-upon-Avon. My brother did not go quite there; the father return'd and brought me a guinea and half, and 1 s. 6 d. from the prisoner, as part of what he had taken from me. About a month after this the prisoner came to London again and was taken and had before the justice. There he denied it, but own'd it to me and the justice's clerk.</p>
               <p>Thomas Bingham was call'd and did not appear, and his recognisance order'd to be estreated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said he did not break open any lock.</p>

I saw the prosecutor in Whitechapel - he went on to Church-street; I saw the prisoner take from the prosecutor's pocket a yellow silk handkerchief - he put it behind him, and give it to another young man, who was close to him - they both walked away: the other person got away - the prisoner ran, and was taken; I swear he is the person who took it.</p>

            . On the 3d of November, I went out about two, and returned about five o'clock in the afternoon; while I was out my house was robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment. I found the outer door and the kitchen door broke open; I sent three boys round among the pawnbrokers, to give them information of what I had lost, and to desire them to stop them, if any of my goods should be offered them; I found one suit of my clothes at a pawnbroker's in Holborn. I had some hand-bills printed and distributed; I was informed the Friday morning following, that some of my clothes were stopt in Rosemary-lane; I went there and found two coats, two waistcoats, four shirts and some other little things.</p>

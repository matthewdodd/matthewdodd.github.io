                  </hi>. I am assistant to James Peachey, of Goswell-street—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Luke. I was behind the counter at a quarter to seven o'clock on the evening of the 27th of Sep<lb></lb>tember—my attention was drawn towards the door—I saw the prisoner leave the shop with the clock in his arms—it had been inside the front the shop—I ran out and overtook him—he said it was given into his arms by a man in front of the shop—he was walking very leisurely—the clock was worth five guineas—we might have taken 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

On the 27th of September I saw the prisoner and another at the top of Old-street, Goswell-street, very near Mr. Peachey's—I watched them—there was an accident with a horse and gig—his companion attempted to pick a gentleman's pocket, but did not succeed—they went to Mr. Peachey's, and the other lifted the clock from the shop</p>

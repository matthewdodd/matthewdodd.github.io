            . I live at No. 11, Charter-house-lane. I have known the prisoner three years; last September I called on her at Mrs. Clark's, she asked me to lend her some money; I told her I had none. She went to her box, fetched a fruit knife and a tea-spoon, and asked me to pledge them for her, she had no money to buy tea and sugar; I pledged them at Mrs. Fothergill, in Aldersgate-street, for four shillings; she had then been at Mrs. Clarke's about a fortnight as near as I can say. I took the four shillings to the prisoner; I kept the duplicate; the duplicate was in my tea chest, when the officers came, they found it there. I was taken under the search warrant, while I was at work.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did he take them from you by force? A. No; I had them loosely in my hand, and he took them, and said, "Go back, and fetch some more;" I turned back with them in my hand, and he said, "You had better give them to me, as the young ladies are going out this evening;" I did not say at the office that I gave them to him - I did not ask him to give me them back, as I thought his statement was right; I did not know him before - I was just turning round when he took them; I had him in my sight; I did not perceive him raise his hand to take them - I said I would bring these with the others; I will swear that was part of my answer to him - I did not say "Take them," nor put out my hand to give them to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they brought to you the same day they were stolen? A. Yes, between seven and nine o'clock in the evening - they are damaged, and I could swear to them among five hundred.</p>
               <p>MRS. LLOYD. These are our combs, and the same I sent with the prisoner - I know them by the colour and shape, and by a scratch on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you put the mark on them? A. No, my husband does - it is a letter; they were not damaged when I parted with them; they cost us about 3l.; I think they are worth that now.</p>

               <p>Who did you find there? - The prisoner and the ticking were both there; I did not know the piece of ticking.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday night the 7th of April, about nine, I met him coming down Portpool-lane, and he passed me with this on his shoulder; I knew him and pursued him, and he run away; I stopped him; he run knowing of me; I overtook him in Bradshaw's-rents, and then he threw this piece down off of his shoulders, I saw him drop it down, I called out stop thief! and some people came out with a candle, and he run into the corner and I took him; I never lost sight of him, there was no thoroughfare in the court, I took up the piece of ticking and him by the collar, I took him to Clerkenwell Bridewell, and the piece of ticking was advertised.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had not you that piece of ticking in your arms when you came and laid hold of me at the bottom of the court? - Yes, you had dropped it.</p>

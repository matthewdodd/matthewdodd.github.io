            . Last Friday was sevennight, as I was going home, I went to the Two Blue Posts, and saw the prisoner there with a tea-chest by her. I asked her whose it was. She said it was nothing to me. I found a cream pot in her pocket. I carried her to Sir John Fielding's office. She was in liquor, and would give no account how she came by them. They were advertised. and Mr. Stiles came and owned them. (The chest and cream pot produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

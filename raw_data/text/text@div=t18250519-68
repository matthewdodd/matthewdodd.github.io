            . I am a woollen-draper, and live in Great Bartholomew-close. On the 25th of April, I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Mr. Morton's pocket, about the middle of Fleet-street - another person was in his company, about his own age - I told Mr. Morton, and directed him which way they were gone; I saw him give the handkerchief to his companion - I joined in the pursuit, and saw Morton take them; the other got away while I was looking for a constable - I am certain of his person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How long after it occurred did you give the prosecutor notice? A. About five minutes - I told him as soon as I saw which way they went; I had two friends with me who rather checked my giving information - I took some time to consider of it; the prisoner was searched at my suggestion - I had seen the other receive the handkerchief; I might have informed the prosecutor in two or three minutes; I told him as soon as I could - I had lost my own handkerchief not three minutes before.</p>

             (police-constable H 85). On the 27th of February, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner in Essex-street, Whitechapel, about eleven o'clock - he had a load on his back - I followed him till he came to a court - I then stopped him, and asked what he had in his bundle - he said he was shifting his lodging, and he had clothes in it - I said I should like to see what he had got, and he wished me to follow him to his lodgings - he went to one house and looked at it, and said, "They are not up" - he then crossed and went into another house, and threw his bundle down - I found these sacks in it - I then took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did he not tell you where to find his master? A. Yes.</p>

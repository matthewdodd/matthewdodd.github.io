            . I am a cabinet-maker in Whitechapel-road. On the 9th of March I saw the prisoner with this box in his hand and an apron over it, he chucked it out of his hands, I ran after him and took him. This is the box that he threw down, when I stopped him the people asked what he had done, I said he had stolen this box, the prisoner said he was a poor fellow, he had not got any work to do; I said this is the way to make people poor, you do not go away from me, I took him to the magistrate. This is the box that he threw down, and the prisoner is the man that had the box.</p>

               <p>JAMES POWELL. On the 22d of July, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was in the street - I could not get into my own lodgings. I met Fearnley, and west with her to her lodgings, which are a second floor back room in <placeName id="t18270913-257-crimeloc1449">Collingwood-street</placeName>

I had not been in the room two minutes before I heard sovereigns jingle - she was sitting at my side. I had examined the contents of my purse previous to going there, and had spoken to nobody but herself. I put my hand to my pocket, and my purse was gone. I accused her of robbing me, and insisted on her returning it to me; she then called out, and the other two prisoners attempted to get into the room - I did all I could to prevent their coming in till the watchman came, but they did come in, and shortly after, I saw Chandler standing with her back to Fearnley, and putting her hand behind her - I suppose she took my purse from her. Brown shortly afterwards went out of the room - the watchman came in soon after, as the landlady had called him; he searched, but could not find my money - Fearnley and Chandler were still in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you quite sober? A. Yes - I had met some people on business, and left them about twelve o'clock, I slept in Collingwood-street after this, at the same house - it is in the City-road - I could not get a bed any where else. I suppose I was robbed before the other two came into the room.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to No. 3, Collingwood-street, and found the prosecutor, Fearnley, and Chandler, all in the second floor back room - he said he had been robbed of four sovereigns and about 20s. in silver - he accused Fearnley of taking it, and said Chandler came to the door and stood before Fearnley. I took Brown in her own room in the same house - she said she had got nothing - I found no purse - she denied having been into the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not been away before you found Brown? A. Yes - a short time.</p>

            . I was with Yabsley.

               <p>FEARNLEY'S Defence. I met this gentleman, who went home with me. I refused to go to bed till he gave me some money - I got up to come away; he pulled me about very much; Brown came to the door but did not enter - Chandler came in; he then left off pulling me about; I said"You good for nothing wretch, I will have the watchman here;" he then said, I had robbed him - the money that chinked was 3s. 6d.

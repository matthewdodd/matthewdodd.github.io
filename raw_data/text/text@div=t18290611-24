            . I live in Spitalfields. I have a stable in the Tenter-ground; it was broken open on the 2d of April, between eight and ten o'clock - I had not been there that day till about half-past ten at night, when the watchman sent to me; I went down, found the door open, and missed my harness; I saw it again on the 4th of May, at the watch-house - I went that night to the corner of Dorset-street; I saw a cart there, and two men in it, but I do not know who they were; I followed the cart - I had not known Kerman before.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ROBERT CHAPMAN. I went to the stable with my father, and missed the harness - that is all I know.</p>

            . This is the harness I went to see on the 3d of April; when Kerman came to me, he said it was on the cross; I had not known him before - I went and looked at the harness, and thought I knew part of it, but I could not swear to it - Mr. Wall came to me, and when he said Chapman had lost a harness, I told him of it; I did not intend to have it, but merely went to see it, that I might know what to say if any body came to me - when Kerman came to me at Smithfield, I said I could not find the man I expected; he called on me several times afterwards, and on the 4th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, Mr. Wall came, and asked if I had a set of harness; after some talk he said, "To tell you the truth, we have lost some:" I said, "When did you lose it?" he said, "On Good Friday;" I said I would do my best to get it - I never saw the prisoners together; it was I and Kerman who were in the cart - I went to buy Mr. Wall's harness, and Kerman said I should not have it without the money; I went and told Wall, who gave me a 5l. note, which I went and gave Kerman, and in that way we got the harness from Goodear's house - I had not inquired whose the harness was before Mr. Wall came to me, but I left word with my wife that if any body came about harness, I could give information.</p>

On the morning of the 2nd of June I was in St. Paul's Churchyard, and saw the prisoner draw a handkerchief from the prosecutor's left pocket with his left hand—I seized him—he directly put the handkerchief between his legs, and a companion that was with him took it from between his legs behind, and carried it off—it was a brownish coloured handkerchief, with spots on it.</p>

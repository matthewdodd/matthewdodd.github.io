                  </hi> I am of James Baster, a clothier and outfitter. On 10th Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my parlour, heard a noise, looked through the partition, and saw man, with his head above the counter, on his hands and knees—I went in—he got away—I missed two pairs of trowsers from the counter near the door, which I had seen safe five minutes before—they are my husband's goods—I saw the man's face—to the best of my knowledge it was Williams—he had on a cap, and a dark coat—I saw him next at Greenwich police-court—the things have not been found.</p>

On 10th Feb., about seven o'clock, I received information, and saw whiting and two man at the entrance of the Thames Tunnel—I passed on a hundred and fifty yards, and met Williams coming towards the Tunnel from Deptford, carrying a bundle—I stopped him, and said I was a constable, and asked what he had in the bundle—he</p>

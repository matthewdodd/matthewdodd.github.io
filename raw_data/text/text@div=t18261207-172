            . I am a watchman, and have known the prisoner for ten or twelve years. On the 20th of July, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I met him in Fleur-de-lis-street, with two others rolling a cask - the prisoner sometimes rolled it, and at times the other two - they were about four hundred yards from Mr. Barwick's; the prisoner knew me - he came over, and said, "Charles, are you going to work;" I said, No - I had no work to do, but I said, "I see you have got a job, but you shall take it no further;" I tried to secure him, but the others assisted him, and they all ran off, leaving the cask with me; I took it to the watch-house - the others were afterwards taken, but the prisoner was not found till lately.</p>

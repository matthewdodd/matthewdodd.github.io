On the 5th of March, about eleven o'clock at night, I went round the premises - they were then all safe - the pump at the kitchen door, and the pump in the stable-yard, were safe - next morning, about six, I found the pump gone from the stable-yard - the pipe of the pump by the kitchen was screwed off, and the leaden cistern in the green-house gone, and a quantity of lead was taken off the roof of the out-building; a field, called Seven-acre-field, communicates with the premises. I observed the tract of a narrow-wheeled cart going in and out of the gate. I traced it about one hundred yards into the road - there is a paddock there, in which I found a quantity of lead, such as I had lost. On the following Monday I went to Brentford, and saw the pump, cistern, and some lead in a cart in the Magistrate's yard - the leaden pump was found in the gravel-pits.</p>

            . I was convicted last Sessions of this robbery. On the morning of the 6th of March I was apprehended at Brentford, with a quantity of lead. I got it from Mr. Dickason - the three prisoners were with me. I took my cart into Mr. Dickason's meadow, and they all put the lead into the cart. Grimshaw was with them - a cistern, a pump, and some more lead were put into the cart - there was more than I wished to take - the prisoners said,</p>
               <p>"Why did you bring such a horse and cart as not to be able to take so much;" - I said, I had a great mind to shoot it all out, and have nothing more to do with it. I had met them at the Swan public-house, at Isleworth, on the 5th. I had the cart from Wasley, at Isleworth, and went straight to the prisoners. I was stopped at Old Brentford with the lead - neither of them would go with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030066"></xptr>you been tried before this last business - A. Once; and was imprisoned eight or nine months. I have told the truth for my own sake.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not told that if you swore against them you would get off very light - A. Yes; Mr. Thackey said, if I would tell who robbed the premises, I should be free.</p>
               <p>Q. It was from no motive of repentance or the love of justice, but to free yourself - A. I had repentance; I gave information a few days after I was convicted myself.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You have received your punishment, and have no hope of any further favour; A. No; four men could hardly lift the cistern. I mentioned their names to Mr. Thackey - he said they were all desperate characters, and wished me to speak the truth.</p>

            . On the evening of the 5th of March I was at the Red Lion; the prosecutor and Grimshaw came there; they had two pots of beer, and there was a good deal of whispering; they might stay there an hour and a half, and went away towards Mr. Dickason's estate; the Duke's Head public house is in that direction. I went from there to Lady Baroness Howe's premises, and laid down under the lean-too of a cow-house to sleep; this is half a mile from Mr. Dickason's; and about three o'clock in the morning; Somerset came and awoke me, and wanted to know why I lay there; he said there was a warmer place further on; and in the morning I found him, Grimshaw, and Coultman, all laying in a place where they cut chaff. When they left the Red Lion Somerset was not with them; they said they were to meet him by the Duke's Head public-house, and if I saw him I was to tell him they were waiting there. For a quarter of an hour before I went away they were cleaning each others clothes, which were very dirty with cobwebs, as if they had been lifting something. When they went from the barn Grimshaw said,</p>
               <p>"Be d - d if it will do to go all one way." He and Somerset went over the fields at the back of Twickenham to come in at the end of Cross-street and meet the other two. Coltman went over the footpath towards his mother's to breakfast; it was then about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Somerset awake you - A. Yes; and told me to go to a place where I found the others in the morning. I noticed their jackets; they appeared as as if they had been lifting something; Taylor was not there.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How far were they from their homes - A. About a quarter of a mile; I had been at work, and had no lodgings; I came to apply to the parish for relief, but could get none that night.</p>

Somerset said</p>
               <p>"Hallo! what have you Isleworth chaps been at." I said the wooden legged cobbler's horse and cart was stopped at Brentford with lead in it, and the man who was in it jumped out and ran away.</p>

            . I am an Excise-officer; about five o'clock in the morning of the 6th of March, I stopped a cart in Brentford, with a very heavy cistern, and several pieces of lead - the man who drove it set off.</p>

             ZAGNANE. I live with Mrs. Barnett, and was with her on the night of the robbery. Somebody pushed her off the pavement, at the corner of King's Head-court - I did not see the parcel taken - She cried out - I had observed Porter follow us.</p>

When we got into Beach-street, the two ladies were before us, at the corner of King's Head-court; the prisoner shoved the prosecutrix into the kennel, and snatched the bundle out of her hand; I did not know he was going to do it - He was about six yards from me; the ladies, and several other persons, ran after him - I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to pursue - A. No, I was as had as him. I went to the coffee-shop-the people were talking about his being there with a bundle under his coat - I did not see him - I came out-the prisoner called to me, I went into the yard to him - He had the bundle under his coat; the little girl belonging to the house opened the door; he said, "Here they come;" she went in; I went to a house with him, and sold it for 5s. 6d.; I do not know the woman's name, I showed the officers where it was; the prisoner treated me with a pot of beer - I slept with him that night. I had none of the money - I was taken up for it, and told this then.</p>
               <p>ELIZA NELSON. I live at the coffee-shop, in Chequeralley. I saw the prisoner and Porter together in the yard, about six o'clock; Porter had the bundle under his arm; the prisoner said, "Here she comes;" I had heard of the robbery; they ran under the bench, and got out of the yard through the next house; they both came into the house together; my mother sent them out - They were both in the house together that morning; the bundle was in a yellow handkerchief.</p>

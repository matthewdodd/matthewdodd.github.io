               <p>Mrs. Chambers. On the fifteenth of this month, I was in my shop near Mrs Spire's, she got up, and said she had lost a bushel of golden-pippins, which cost her ten shillings. I ran to the top of the market, and by enquiring, found a woman had gone up Black-horse-alley, into Fleet-street, in which is the sign of the Plough; I found a woman had been in there, and was gone out again, but had left the basket there empty. I went out, and at the end of the market, I was shewed to the prisoner, and told she had a bushel of pippins; I took hold of her, and charged her with taking them: she down upon her knees, and said, She had out-lived all her acquaintance, and wanted to be either hanged or transported, or else she would cut her own throat. I found she lived in Bare-lane Clare-market. I went there, and found the bushel of golden-pippins in a narrow sieve.</p>

            . I live at the Plough Black-horse-alley, Fleet-street; the prisoner came into our kitchen, and desired she might leave some apples there, 'till she brought a woman to fetch them away; she went out and came in again with a woman, and emptied the basket into another, and left this behind, and the other woman carried the apples away, and she went out with her.</p>

               <p>On Monday was a week, was the day that this happened, I walk'd about the market to see what I could get best for my purpose; I saw nothing but rubbish; I came up to this Spire's shed, there was a man ask'd her the price of her golden pippins; she said, twelve shillings;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240016"></xptr> he said he would give her ten shillings; said she, I gave ten myself; I said, I think he is a good customer; after he went away, I ask'd her the price of a bushel; she said, she would not bate me any thing of eleven shillings; I said, I do not think I can make eleven shillings of them; then there came a man, and bought a bushel; he gave her some half-pence; she said, curse the half-pence; I said, if you will take my money I'll give you all silver; I said, I had no basket; said she, I'll not let my basket go upon any account; I paid her eleven shillings all in silver, and said I would return again with the basket, as soon as I can meet with a basket-woman; if I go into eternity I will not tell a lie for it; when I was gone, she said, stop the woman with the basket; Pox on you, said I, do not you get a shilling, and I will soon return the basket; I went and set them up at the Plough, and then went to look for a basket-woman to carry them, and left the basket with intent to return it; I went down into the market again, and one of her companions in the way of higgling took hold on me, and Mrs Spire's came; do not you know that I gave you eleven shillings for them, said I, at the time that the man paid you some half-pence; said she, I do not know whether you did or not. If right takes place I ought to swear a robbery against them, for having my goods torn back again after I had paid for them; no, no, here is a Judge here and another in Heaven; they made such a halloo-belloo nothing could be like it; I was obliged to give up my own basket and my own apples; my sieve and my apron; and I had nothing in my pocket but two-pence half-penny.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs Spire. Did the prisoner cheapen the apples.</p>
               <p>Spire. No: I never saw her in my life to my knowledge, 'till Mrs Chambers found her; nobody had ever cheapened that fruit.</p>

On the 11th of January I was at work in my shop, about four o'clock in the afternoon; my wife observed two men make a halt before the door, she said there were some customers coming into the shop; I saw the prisoner at the same time take hold of the two umbrellas, he unhooked them off the hooks and walked away with them deliberately; I pursued him and brought him back to the shop door; he then threw the umbrellas down. He said he was going to look at them; he went away from my shop about thirty yards with them. My apprentice girl took the umbrellas up; these are them; they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The crime I now stand indicted for I was led to believe I was totally clear of, as I was in custody for it in January sessions, and was discharged from the sessions house, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. to Godwin. How came you not to prosecute last January - A. That was owing to the mistake of the officer; he got the bill of indictment the day before the sessions ended; he said if he was not tried that sessions, he would put a note in to detain him; I believe that was not attended to.</p>

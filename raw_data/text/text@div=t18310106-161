I remember, on the 21st of October, having a hole dug in my garden, in which I deposited a considerable quantity of jewellery to the value of 400l. - I had at that time in my house, as a guardian, a man named Price and his wife; the prisoner was about my house at that time as a <rs id="t18310106-161-deflabel920" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

On the night of the 21st of October I was up part of the night; I did not see the prisoner that night, but Price told me he was in the house - there were some shots fired about my garden that night, and next morning the jewellery was missed; on Sunday morning, the 24th, I was looking about the garden, near some ivy - the prisoner was then in the garden, and in his presence Price pulled down an ivy-bush, said, "Look here," and pulled out a case of jewellery; the prisoner did not make any remark - I also found a diamond brooch, which was left in the hole; Price was indicted last Session - the prisoner came as a witness for him, and in consequence of something that appeared, I had the prisoner taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You had applied for some person to come and protect you in this house some time before? A. Yes, and Price and his wife came; they had been there about three months- I gave them apartments rent-free, for the purpose of having a person to live there, as I had been uneasy about my jewellery; Price suggested that it would be prudent to conceal it in a well under the carpet in the drawing-room, and after that it was suggested by me that it should be put into the garden; Price said he would dig a hole for it - the prisoner used to come as a jobbing-carpenter- Price was a surveyor, and he gave him directions when he was at home; the property was buried on Thursday morning, the 21st of October, and was missed the next morning - about eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st of October, Price went out, came in, and said he had been shot at; about an hour after that he proposed to fire, and I said "Do" - it was to frighten away what I supposed were bad characters in the neighbourhood; I had seen the prisoner that day at work in the house; I believe his hour for leaving was six o'clock; I saw him again at eight or nine o'clock the next morning, in his usual course of employ - on the Sunday morning he came to make an excuse for not coming to sit up the night before, as Price had desired him; Price was in my house on the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday - he always left at seven o'clock in the morning, to go to his office, and returned at four in the afternoon; the prisoner joined in the firing on Friday night, but not on the Thursday night; he was not in my house then, to my knowledge - he fired on Friday night, in consequence of directions from myself and Price; he had been desired to sit up.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you find any dead men in the garden? A. No; I had no suspicion of Price at that time - Price melted some bullets; I believe the prisoner was present on one occasion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You missed your jewels on the 22nd? A. Yes, but the firing continued that night - I did not then know that the prisoner was in the house on the Thursday night; he proposed to sit up the Friday night - Price and I proposed he should, and in the course of that night price and the prisoner both fired.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Royal Oak, at Fulham, about three quarters of a mile from Mrs. Dyott's. I have known the prisoner four years - he came to my house on Sunday, the 24th of October, at near eleven o'clock; I opened the door, which was closed, and he proceeded to the tap-room - I sat down with him; there was no other person there, but my wife, and a lodger and his wife were up stairs; there was no one in the taproom but the prisoner and me - after he had sat down for half an hour, and had a pint or two of beer, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have been to work at our old shop;" I said, "What old shop?" he said, "At Mrs. Dyott's, at Walham-green;" I said,"What have you been doing there?" he said, "I have got a goodish job, I have been there to work for these three weeks, or there abouts, and I have made a d - d sight better job than I should if I had worked for Mr. Plaw(his former master) for half a year" - I said, "How so? what, have you sent in a great many materials?" his answer was, "No, I have not; the truth of it is, the house has been robbed, but I want nothing said about it - or not the house, rather the garden;" I said,</p>

               <p>"Robbed what do you mean?" said he, "There has been a goodish bit of property taken away, to the amount of upwards of 300l. or 400l. - I was there the other night, and Price and I went out into the garden, fired a pistol up in the air, and ran in- we told Mrs. Dyott that some one had shot at us; we stopped in doors, and after a time we fired out of the window - this morning I have been up there, and we went into the garden searching after the property; Price told Mrs. Dyott he thought it must be somewhere in the gardon, and we goes to the ivy, which is by the side of the wall, and Price pulls out a box that had got upwards of 60l. worth of property in it; d-d fool, we might as well have had that while we had been about it - I did not know but he had got that;" I said, "Akers, if you go on with this story you must take care, you will get taken up on this suit, as sure as you are a man" - he repeated it over and over again, and told me of it two or three times; a lodger of mine went up stairs, fetched some bread and meat, and said we would have a bit together - I appeared as a witness on the last trial; the prisoner did not say any thing about money; he said, "Fill the pot, here is plenty of blunt;" I told Ledbetter, the officer, of this at the last Session,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. So you keep the Royal Oak public-house, at Fulham? A. Yes - I have not a publican's license, but a license to retail beer; it was a sort of grocer's shop before, and I continue that - I have a board over the door, but no sign yet; I saw the prisoner about ten minutes before eleven o'clock that Sunday morning, and it might be half an hour, or three quarters of an hour afterwards that he told me this - he was as sober as ever I saw him for what I know; he and I have been particularly intimate - we began our beer business on the 11th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060082"></xptr>of October, as soon as we could; I could not think otherwise from what the prisoner said, than that he had been joining in the robbery - I did not take the earliest opportunity of telling what I knew; he was a particular friend of mine, and I would as soon have done my brother an injury as I would him; I should not have spoken of him, provided I had not been subpoened on the last trial - it is best known to Mrs. Dyott who could have found out that I knew any thing about it - it was afterwards that I told Ledbetter; I did not say much about this conversation at the last Session - I was only asked a word or two; I was ordered down before I told the whole - they did ask me if I knew Akers; I said I did, about four years - they asked whether he came to my house on the 24th; I said he did, and told them at what time, and what he said about going out to fire pistols, and whether he said he found any thing in the garden - I told them he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word about this man, whom you say you knew, having told you that he had joined in having committed this felony? A. Yes; that they went out into the garden, fired the pistol in the air, and that he told me he had had a good thing of it; I did not give any information to have him taken - I did not, on the last occasion, give all the account of the conversation which I have to day; Sims and his wife lodged with me on the 24th of October - I turned them out, because his wife robbed me- Sims was at home on that Sunday; when the prisoner came he was up stairs - he came down about twelve or half-past twelve o'clock, and brought some mutton down for Akers and me to join him to eat, because it would be spoiling, as he said; my wife heard what the prisoner said - as for Sims, I do not know whether he was down stairs or not, but I think, if he did not hear it down stairs he did up; he was there most of the time - I do not know who else was in my house, there were so many people after one o'clock; he was upon this conversation the greater part of the time, and there were a great many people, but nobody but him and myself in the first place - I could not swear that either heard the whole of it; it was told to me alone, and part of it was repeated in the presence of my lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of the story, which consisted of his participation in the robbery, repeated in the presence of the lodger? A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If I understand you right, the story was first told to you alone? A. Yes; I have known him four years, and been in the same employ with him, at Mr. Plaw's seven or eight weeks - I received a subpoena on this trial, and on the last; I know nothing of Mrs. Dyott- the prisoner said Mrs. Dyott and Price were with him on that Sunday; I have not seen my lodger since last Session, except one week he was in my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you give information against the prisoner? A. I gave no information; I was taken to Bow-street the day after - he was taken three weeks or a month ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent; I believe I have friends who will prove what this man has said is false.</p>

            . I am a smith and bell-hanger; I lodged at Mr. Moore's shop at Fulham, about six or eight weeks -I know the prisoner well. On Sunday, the 24th of October, I remember his coming to Moore's house, between ten and eleven o'clock - I was then in the tap-room, which is facing the doorway which leads into the street - there is a little shop in front, and the tap-room within; while the prisoner was there, he, I, and Moore, were drinking together, and Akers said, he had been sent for by Mrs. Dyott that Sunday morning, and that she, him, and Price, went into the garden, to see if they could find any of the stolen property - he said Price told him to shake the ivy-tree, and that he, being clean, told Price to shake it himself, as he would not shake it any more; and that was the whole of the conversation that took place respecting that - I remained in conversation with Moore and the prisoner from the morning till seven o'clock in the evening; I was in the house the whole of the day, and continually with Akers, up and down stairs - he said he had a friend at home and wished to go home, but Moore pressed him to dine with him, as an intimate friend, but whether he did dine with him or not, I cannot say; I was not out of his company above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he went home about seven o'clock; I wished to go home with him, but Moore, as an old shopmate, went home with him himself - he was the worse for liquor; nothing about his having a good job of it, or his having got more in three weeks, than he should at Plaw's in six months, ever passed in my hearing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known much of the prisoner? A. Not till he and I stood godfather to Moore's children, which was two or three Sundays before; I had seen him before, as he had brought work to a shop where I was working, but there was no intimacy between us - I have not known Moore a great while; I left his house because we fell out, as he accused my wife falsely of a robbery; he did not turn me out, he said he expected I would go - I paid him every farthing of the rent every week; I do not owe him any rent - I owe him 5s., but I have not been that way; I cannot say when I left him - it might be seven or eight weeks before Christmas; I called to pay the 5s., and he was not at home; we eat in the tap-room that Sunday morning - I brought some mutton down from my own room, and Moore took part of it; I do not know whether I said it would spoil, there was not much I know; I understood Akers that he had been watching at Mrs. Dyott's on the Friday night, and he had been sent for on that Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had been sent for before that Sunday morning at all? A. I told you all I mean to say- I do not remember any thing of the kind; he said he had been there on the Friday night - he never said a word about firing shots in the garden, nor out of the window; I have stated to you what I have to say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did the prisoner get there that morning? A. Between ten and eleven o'clock - I had the front room over the shop, and my wife was there; I was not away more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I lodged at the prisoner's house on the 21st of October; it is the first house on the right-hand side after you pass the Wheatsheaf, in the turning leading to Parson's-green - he is a carpenter, and has four children; I remember his coming home on the night of Thursday, the 21st of October, about a quarter or twenty minutes after nine o'clock; the reason I recollect it, was, that the beer came at nine o'clock - after that Mrs. Akers and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060083"></xptr>were talking in the passage; we heard a noise, and went to see what it was - the door blew too, and we were shut out - the neighbour next door, but one went round the back way, and let us in; I am married, and have one child - my husband is a carpenter; I know Akers came home after that time - I do not know when: I saw him the next morning; he was not at home the following night.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where he had been, till about half-past nine o'clock, you do not know? A. No, nor where he went in the course of the night.</p>

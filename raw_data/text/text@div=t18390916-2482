                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of John Howell and three others—our house is in Regent-street—it is our dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. James, Westminster. The prisoner came to us in February last, as town traveller—for some reasons, on the 19th of August, at seven o'clock in the evening, I paid him his wages, and sent him off.</p>

On Monday, the 19th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought a brown paper parcel to my house, and as he left he said, "I will leave this parcel here till the morning, and then I will call for it"—I took charge of it—I saw Mr. Parker in the evening, and gave it to him.</p>

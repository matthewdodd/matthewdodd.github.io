                  </hi>. I am the wife of James William Wells, of Swinton-street, Gray's Inn-lane—he is a sailor. On the 15th of January I went into a pork-shop in Tottenham Court-road—as I stood at the counter I felt a drag at my pocket, turned round, and found my pocket outside my dress—I charged the prisoner, who was behind, with robbing me—he said, "I have not," and called, "Mother"—I said he had no mother, and held him till the policeman came and took him—I had felt my pocket just be<lb></lb>fore I got into the shop—I then had a crown-piece and a quantity of shil<lb></lb>lings and sixpences—only two shillings and a sixpence were left.</p>

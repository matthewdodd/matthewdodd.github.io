                  </hi>. I lodge in Arundel-street, Strand. On the 28th of May, in the afternoon I was walking in St. James's-street—I was watch<lb></lb>ing the line of carriages—I heard a scuffle behind me—I turned and saw the prisoner in the custody of two officers—one of them had my handker<lb></lb>chief—this is it—it is mine.</p>

About three or four o'clock I saw the prisoner, and watched him some time—I saw him make many attempts at several gen<lb></lb>tlemen's pockets—I saw him go behind the prosecutor and take this hand<lb></lb>kerchief out of his pocket—the moment he took it out, as he dropped his hand with the handkerchief in it, I seized him, and my brother officer assisted me.</p>

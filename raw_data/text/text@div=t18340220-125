            . I am a silver refiner, in the employ of Mr. Smart, No. 60, Princes-street, Leicester-square - on the 8th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and offered a silver spoon for sale - my employer saw a crest partly rubbed out, and I saw it also - he was asked how the crest came to be rubbed out- he said he did not know there was one - Mr. Smart asked where he got it - he said he bought it of a Jew in Piccadilly - he was asked his name and address - he gave John Harding, No. 19, Berwick-street - we told him we should keep the spoon and make inquiry - I marked the spoon, and afterwards gave it to Stone, the constable, and gave him the name and address the prisoner gave us - on the 18th the prisoner called again - we told him he had given us a wrong name and address, and asked his reason - he said he was so flurried at the time he did not know what he said - I then asked him what his right name was, and where he lived - he said John Foster, No. 19, Edden-street, Regent-street - I asked his landlord's name - he told me, and I knew that was correct - I gave that information to Stone - and at Marlborough-street I saw one of the Duke's spoons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not he merely ask you the value of the spoon? A. No, he did not, I am positive - he came twice afterwards, and demanded the money - I have seen the crest - it is out of an Earl's coronet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. I lived at 11, Shepherd-street, in the service of the deceased—her name was Ann Matthews—for a long time she went by the name of Brown, but her proper name was Ann Matthews—she was always called Brown while I lived there—I know the prisoner—the deceased was his aunt—he had lived there a little better than two years—they lived together like man and wife—on Saturday evening, 8th Oct., the prisoner left home a little before the candles were lighted, about dusk—it had struck 12 when he returned home—he was then <hi rend="italic">betwixt and between</hi> as to drinking, but he was perfectly aware of what he was doing—the deceased was sitting on the hearth-rug, with her feet towards the fender, in the back parlour—that was the room in which they slept—she sent for a pot of beer—the girl, Sarah May, went for it—she prisoner came in while she was sitting on the hearth-rug, but she had been sitting there a good bit before he came in—when he came in he turned the bedclothes down, the first thing, with the intention of going to bed, and he told the girl to go to bed likewise—he then called his aunt a very improper name, and said she was sitting in a dirty position before the fire—the deceased replied, <hi rend="italic">"Jem</hi>, you can go back where you came from; I can do without you, and I don't want you here"—he then jumped up, and with his fist he gave her a violent blow on each side of the temple, but it did not bleed; it was bruised, but did not bleed—he took her head like that (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>), and hit her violently with both hands on each side of the head—the prisoner was standing up behind the deceased at the time he struck her—I begged him not to do it, as it was getting Sunday morning.</p>

I went to answer a lady and gentleman that came, but I heard no bustle in the room while I was gone—I did not attend to the lady and gentleman; they did not</p>

               <p>come in; I only answered them at the door—the room where this occurred was the back parlour, on the ground floor, as you come in at the door—I did not go out to drink during the three minutes—at the time the prisoner put his foot on the deceased's chest she was quite dead—he had neither shoes nor stockings on then—she was lying on the floor, flat on her hack—he said to me, "There is nobody can make you open your mouth; if you say anything we are sure to he transported;" or something of that kind—I have men<lb></lb>tioned that before to-day—I have been waiting about here for this trial—I have been in the public houses opposite—I did not say there that I wished this man might be hung—I did not say so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you then to be shown it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought if ever he came back again I might stand the same chance as his aunt; I did not wish him to come back again—I do not now wish him to be hanged, and if it was to do any good I would as soon be hung up as him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 14, Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square. Between 1 and 2 o'clock, on Sunday morning, 10th Oct., I was called by a man named Westlake to see the deceased—in consequence of what he said to me, I sent my son to No. 11, Shepherd-street, not being able to dress so quickly as usual from having had a fall and injured my wrists—I followed him—I had known Mrs. Brown, the deceased, half a year previously—I had been called to attend her in May last, for the first time, and I had subsequently been called—when I got to 11, No. Shepherd-street, I saw the deceased in the parlour, lying on the bed—observing some marks on her forehead, I took the old woman aside into the passage—I examined the forehead, and found the marks of a blow on each temple—the one on the left side was slight—that on the right side was more severe, and the skin was slightly abraided—I should say the deceased was between fifty and sixty years of age—when I observed the marks, the prisoner said she had fallen against the sofa—I am confident he said <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the sofa—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the Tuesday following—I found on the external part of the body various marks of bruises of long standing—a severe bruise on the left hip, extending on to the back, and the two marks before mentioned on the temples—the mark that extended to the back was apparently recent—the old bruises were in various parts, and she had on a plaster—I examined the head; on removing the skull-cap, and the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>; I found a coagulum</p>

               <p>of effused venous blood on each side corresponding with the external bruise—there was effusion of liquid venous blood in the ventricles at the base of the brain, and all through, a general effusion—I saw quite sufficient to account for the death—the cause of death was effusion and extravasation from the rupture of a vessel from concussion of the brain—that was caused by external blows—there is no doubt that a violent blow on each side of the head would cause what I observed—it is impossible to say what time would elapse before a person would die after receiving such a blow—it might be longer or shorter—it does not follow that death would be immediate—it would mainly depend upon the size of the vessel so ruptured—I examined the chest and abdomen—all the vital organs were perfectly healthy throughout, unusually healthy—I examined the contents of the stomach, it contained about from half to three quarters of a pint of fluid, apparently of a natural kind, but there was no appearance of spirit or of any other deleterious substance having been drunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Judging from the blow described, the coagulum you noticed within, and the rupture of the blood vessel, would not the concussion produced by such a blow he almost instantaneous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should fancy that death would be very quick from such severe blows—but very frequently insensibility would not immediately follow even from such blows as that.</p>

               <p>Bond-street. On the Saturday night, 9th Oct., about 12 o'clock, the prisoner came to me for the purpose of getting a doctor—I went for the doctor, and Mr. Clark attended.</p>

Ann is a <hi rend="italic">dying</hi>!" Mrs. Brown is <hi rend="italic">a dying!"</hi> and knocked violently at my door—I have seen the deceased exhibit violence toward several of the servants—I have seen the prisoner with scratches on his face, and, I think, on one occasion with a black eye.</p>

About 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, 10th Oct., I went to the house of the deceased, in Shepherd-street—I saw the prisoner there, and said to him, "I understand Mrs. Brown is dead? "he said, "Yes, poor creature, she is"—I said. "Very sudden, was it not? "he said, "Yes"—I drew down the sheet of the bed, and there saw her dead body—I looked at the marks on the temples, and found there were two bruises, one on each side—I said to him here are some bruises here—he said, "Yes; I will tell you; she was sitting on the hearthrug, and she fell over, but while she was sitting on the hearthrug she said, "So help me G—d! I will never come into bed with you again alive"—I took two constables to the house, and said to the prisoner, "It is necessary that you should come to the station and make that same statement to the inspector"—he said, "Yes; I will go"—on the way to the station he put himself in different postures showing me how she was sitting, and how he lifted her up; that he assisted Mary in getting her into bed—he asked me whether that was not natural enough, and I said, "Yes"—he made a statement to the acting inspector at the station just similar to what he had told me.</p>

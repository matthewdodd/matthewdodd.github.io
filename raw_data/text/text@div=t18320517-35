On the 11th of February the prisoner came, about three o'clock in the afternoon, to look at my apartments; my servant showed him up stairs - he said he wanted them for a lady and gentleman, and said he should come again in the evening, or on Monday morning; I had to let a sitting-room and two bed-rooms - I went out in the evening, and in the meantime the prisoner came again; I returned at twenty minutes before nine, and then my watch was gone, which I had seen safe at eight o'clock, in the back room; I am sure he is the person - the watch has not been found.</p>
               <p>MARIA MARSHALL. I am servant to the prosecutrix. I was at home when the prisoner first came, and am sure he is the person; he came again in the evening when my mistress was out, and asked if she was at home - I said No; he then asked if I would allow him to look at the bed-rooms, to see if there was a cupboard in them - I said there was; I went up to the room with him - he then asked me to let him sit down till my mistress came home, which he did; I went down, leaving a young lady in the room with him - in about ten minutes he sent her down for a glass of water, and as she was going up again she met the prisoner on the stairs, and he went out - he had left a card with me, with the name of Mr. Clint on it.</p>

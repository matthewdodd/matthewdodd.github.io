            ; I lost a pair of stays, and a gown, and a hat; I lost them on the 12th of September last, from my bed-room, up two pair of stairs; I hardly left them an hour before I missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get them again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took them? - I have every reason to believe that the prisoner at the bar took them, because I had no other person in the house besides my own family.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of? - Four children and my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge with you? - She had not slept in the house, but she took a lodging at the house the day before.</p>

            Have you ever seen her sister? - I have; I have left this in the custody of an officer, while I went to my house, and when I came back, the sister was drest in the same clothes, and the prisoner was undress; the officer asked me which is your prisoner now; I put my finger on the prisoner; now you are right, the officer said, that is the same; so I pitched on the prisoner, for all she was undrest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her sister before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at her, Mrs. Roberts? - This is the person that took my lodging, she had been a twelve month before to take my lodgings.</p>

            Is there a strong likeness between them in the countenance? - Yes, there is, but not in the voice-besides this one offered to take me to the place where the things was, if I would let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. Is her sister about her size? - Much about in height, but a good deal lustier, and fatter in the face. I have very great reason to think that she knows of my things; it was she and not her sister that came to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Kirby. You have seen the sister, does she correspond in height and size to this woman?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. if any thing, my opinion is that this is the lustier of the two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby's man. Of the two the sister is lustier than this.</p>
               <p>Court to Kirby. I ask you about the voice, are the voices alike? - I cannot say to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can say that I never see the person in my life till she swore to me.</p>

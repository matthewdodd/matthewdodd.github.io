I saw Mr. Stewart walking with a friend - the two prisoners went up to him, followed him a little way. Raven then took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and gave it to Hilliard, who was close by. I crossed over, and told Mr. Stewart, who went after them with me. I pointed them out, and charged them with it. Raven said it was more likely that I took it, and cried - a crowd collected, they were taken into a bootmaker's shop. I put my hand down the prisoner Hilliard's breeches, and took the handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220021"></xptr>out. I had seen him put it there, it was half way down his thigh.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Gast, of Oxford-street. On the 16th of June the prosecutor had been making a purchase at his shop, and I had to follow him down Oxford-street; I saw the two prisoners follow him, and when they came to the corner of <placeName id="t18310630-115-crimeloc620">Regent-circus</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were they strangers to you? A. Yes; I am porter to Mr. Gast, the gunmaker - this was about half-past two o'clock; I was ten or twelve yards from him - there was no person between me and Collier at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. If there were other people about him could you see this? A.There were some persons between us occasionally, but not at the time the act was committed; Rose had a dark coat on, and a black hat-band round his hat - Rose was not taken at the time; they were in Company together.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Have you the slightest doubt that Rose was the other man? A. I have no doubt whatever.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was in Oxford-street on the 16th of June, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw Collier run down Oxford-street, and into Shepherd-street - Parlaman and another were following him; I ran and took him - they both identified Collier as the person who did it; I went to search the stables, but could not find the purse - I heard it was found by a woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you speak to the two young men who were in pursuit of Collier? A. I did at the watch-house; I do not know whether I did before - they did not tell me of the purse being thrown into the yard at the time I took Collier; I did not search the yard for about an hour.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FARRAND. I am a Police-constable. I was in Oxford-street; in consequence of information I received, I looked for Rose, and apprehended him - I had seen the two prisoners in company many times, but not on that day.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you absolutely feel the purse in your pocket at that time? A. I felt the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Had you passed some distance from the shop? A. Yes, I suppose a mile.</p>

He did not knock, but the dog barked, and my mistress's sister let him in - this was not the prisoner, but another man. I went up stairs, the prisoner was not in the passage then. I went away for two or three minutes; when I came back again the prisoner was in the passage. I followed him through the passage, and asked him to paint the window over again, as the cat had dirtied it, and my master would be very angry if he saw it - I left him, thinking he would paint it. In a few minutes I went into the kitchen, he was at the shutter. I asked him if he was going to paint it again? he said it was not quite dry. I left them, and went down to breakfast, expecting they would go on painting - they went away, and shut the door after them. The prisoner had a basket in his hand - I supposed they were connected together. I had left them in the passage, close to the parlour-door; the property was in the parlour closet. All the family were in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is one of them - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did you see them go out - A. Yes, I saw them through the kitchen window. They left together, and walked pretty fast up the walk. The property was safe half an hour before they came, and I missed it before anybody else came. The proper painters did not come that day.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister. I was in the parlour, cleaning some china, heard the dog bark, and went to the door; a tall man stood there with an oil-can in his hand; he asked if the parlour shutters were to be painted? I said I did not know. He said he would do a little about, and the other man would come soon. He began to rub the door. I went up stairs, came down, and told him the door was not to be painted yet, he said,</p>
               <p>"Very well, I will wait for the other man." While I was absent he left the door - I saw him at the back window with a brush; I found the prisoner in the back kitchen, the other man must have let him in - I thought he was the right man who had been at work for us. My sister went to the back door, and told them they might paint the door if they liked. After that I sent the servant up, she found the door open; soon after I heard a great noise and the door shut. I saw the prisoner and the other man running up the walk - the prisoner had a basket in his hand.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I came down stairs about ten minutes after eight o'clock, and saw two men in the stone kitchen; the prisoner was painting the window-frame - I know he was one of them.</p>

On the Saturday following I heard of another robbery of the same description, at Finsbury-square.

               <p>Q. Had you any clothes in the room - A. Yes, in a chest; the chest was locked, nobody slept in the room but him, he came down on the next morning at six o'clock, I opened my bed room door and spoke to him, he answered very low, and let himself out; there were only three bolts to the door, he paid for his lodging on the overnight, and desired to be called at five o'clock. I told him that was too soon, this was on Monday morning; I did not go into his bed-room till the Tuesday; I observed the lack of the chest had been forced; I missed two coats worth thirty shillings, a pair of pantaloons worth five shillings a neck handkerchief one shilling, two waistcoats four or five shillings, and a new hat that was worth a guinea. The hat was in the room where the prisoner slept, and all the other articles were in the chest; on Tuesday the 16th, in company with the officer, I found the prisoner at the gate of the London docks, I charged him with taking these things, he made a strong resistance, and tried to escape, we prevented him, he said he was very sorry, he would go on board a man of war; I found my new hat on his head, and my pantaloons, and one of my white waistcoats, and the coats he said he had sold to Moses.</p>

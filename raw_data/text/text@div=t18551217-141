                  </hi>. I had chambers at the Albany in Aug., I left them at Michaelmas. I answered an advertisement of the prisoner's as valet, and the prisoner presented himself to me; I did not want a valet, but a general servant, and he was quite satisfied—some of the rooms at the Albany adjoining mine were being repaired—I had three rooms, and there was a kitchen for my servant—the servant's room was at the top of the house, but it was locked, as I had been out of town some time, and the key was on a bunch which I had just put away, and as the prisoner came just as I was going out to dinner, I told the servant to put some sheets on the other bed on the ground floor, which I had previously occupied, but the room had not been used for some time—I slept in another room on the ground floor—(I have taken a house in St. James's-square, which at that time I was looking after, and everything was disarranged at the Albany, as I was on the, eve of moving)—the prisoner came into my service on 7th Aug., and I went to a party that evening—the prisoner brought me my hot water and boots next morning, and waited on me at breakfast, but said nothing to me, and I went to my engagements in the City at my usual hour—I returned about 6 o'clock in the evening, and just as I was going out again to dinner, the prisoner said, "You came to my room last night, you know you did; you wanted to take liberties with me, and wanted to get into bed; I shall give you into the hands of the police or go before a Magistrate, unless you give me a sum of money"—I said, "How much will satisfy you?"—I was so horrified at this charge, that I lost my presence of mind; "will 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. satisfy you?"—he said, "No, a lawyer will give me that for making such a charge"—(this was at half past 6 o'clock; I had dressed and was going out, I do not think I saw him when I came in till he came into the room at half past 6 o'clock)—I ultimately gave him a cheque for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and brought him the money next day—I was at that time on the eve of marriage, my mother was in very bad health, and was obliged to be taken away to drink the waters, and my father is of an excessively excitable temperament—those matters operated on my mind—if I had been alone in the world, I should not have hesitated a moment what course to pursue—the prisoner left my service on the following day, on the afternoon of the 9th—I told him he must go, and, of course, he was quite willing to do so, and I after<lb></lb>wards received a letter from him—it was this day fortnight—I destroyed the first letter, but this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is another letter, which I received from him this day fortnight—it is excessively insolent—I know his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dec. 7th, Oxford.

"How much money will you want?"—he said, "I do not know, Sir," and then, after some hesitation, said, "20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave it into his hands, and the constable and my brother in law came from behind the curtains, and he was taken into custody—there is not a word of truth in the filthy accu<lb></lb>sation this man has made—it makes one sick even to think of it.</p>

            . I received these tools from Gaskin, who came to our shop alone, on Monday morning, the 24th of July, about eight o'clock, and asked if I bought such things; I said, I bought any thing if it was not stolen; he had not the goods then, but came again with Sanders, and brought them; he asked 3s. for them - I took them to the bed to my husband, and he told me to offer 2s. 6d. for them - and they took 2s. 4 1/2d. for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What shop do you keep? A. A marine-store-shop. I never saw either of them before - there were twenty-five tools brought; I did not know what they were worth.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WAKEMAN re-examined. Q. What was the worth of these things? A. They might have been worth to Mr. Cubitt 14s. or 15s., but I might have got only a 1d. or 2d. a piece for them; I have kept that shop about fourteen months - we do not buy such things of boys without asking where they get them; Gaskin told my wife he was a stone-mason, out of work, and forced to part with his tools.</p>

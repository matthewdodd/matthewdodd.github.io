            . Mr. Osbourn came to me on the Monday morning, being a neighbour, and desired I would go with him to enquire after the prisoner; he went Bagshot way, and desired I would go round by Colebrook; he hired two horses; I went on to Salthill, and enquired at the Castle, and found a person like him had taken a post-chaise on the Sunday night at ten o'clock; I found the post-boy, who informed me he set him down at the Turk's Head at Reading. I went there, and there I found he had spent 14 s. besides the expence of the post chaise; they knew him, (that is, the prisoner). I found he took a post-chaise at the King's Arms there, and went to Newbury. I pursued him there. When I came to the George and Pellican there. I heard he was gone for Marlborough; I took a post-chaise, and overtook him about a quarter of a mile before I came to the Black Bear at Hungerford. I drove by his chaise, and when I was about an hundred yards before him, I got out: he, seeing me, spoke to the boy that drove him, that he wanted to speak to me; I took him in custody: he directly confessed that he took the money away; and said he would go back with me. I took him to the Black Bear at Hungerford; there he returned me four guineas in gold, 5 s. and 6 d. in silver, and 4 d. in halfpence, and owned it was the prosecutor's money.</p>

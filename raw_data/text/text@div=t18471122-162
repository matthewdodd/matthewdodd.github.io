               <p>to bed about eleven o'clock—myself and servant were the last persons up—we both went to bed together—the house was quite safe—the kitchen window was shut, but not fastened—my son came down first in the morning, about eight o'clock—he called me—I went down, and found the house in confusion, and the kitchen window wide open—I missed a shoulder of veal, weighing about nine pounds, some bacon, coffee, tea, sugar, cheese, some brushes, a curtain, a counterpane, and four pigeons—the counterpane was over the pigeons, which were in a crate in the yard.</p>

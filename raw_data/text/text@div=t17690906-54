            . On the 19th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I met with two girls, standing at a door in <placeName id="t17690906-54-crimeloc293">Great Earl-street</placeName>

The girl at the bar was one of them. I went up into her room, and agreed to give her two shillings to lie with her. I gave her a shilling to get a pot of beer before we went to bed. The other girl fetched it. There was no body but the two girls and I when we drank it. After I was gone to sleep, the prisoner got up, and was gone, I suppose, to Elwood's room. Elwood and another person came in, and he had the complaisance to take me by the collar, and draw me out of bed: then he held me by the collar, and gave me a blow on the cheek. I desired to have my breeches, which I had put under the feather bed; but I found them at the foot of the bed. I put them on, but found there was no money.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060035"></xptr> I had the money, mentioned in the indictment, sewed up in a purse, in my fob, when I went to bed. Elwood said, Go along, French bugger. Then the prisoner came into the room with them. There was some silver saved, which was in my waistcoat pocket. I went down stairs, and met the watch; then we took the two prisoners, and carried them to the round-house. They were searched, but none of the money was found. This was about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Le Roy. Neither one nor the other. I had been to make water in the yard, and then I felt, and know I had my purse and money. This was before I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take your money from, when you sent for the beer?</p>
               <p>Le Roy. I took it out of my right-hand waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. from Elwood. Whether you did not draw three-pence from your master, when you had earned six-pence?</p>
               <p>Le Roy. No, never. I brought this money with me from France. I changed some of my French money in the packet with a gentleman that was going over.</p>
               <p>Q. from Elwood. Whether you did not offer to make this up, provided I would give you ten guineas?</p>
               <p>Le Roy. No, never.</p>

            , a shilling for a pot of beer. He offered me a shilling: I said it was too little. He said he had no more. After that we went to bed. I did not choose to oblige him, so he used me ill. I was even obliged to call murder. Then he wanted his money again, but I would not give it him. He then put on his clothes, and we both came down together. After that it was a full half hour before he brought the watchman and constable.</p>

               <p>Finch. On Monday the 25th of July I was going out in the Evening; my other Servant,

            , told me he saw some of my Goods conceal'd in a Cellar: So I went down into the Cellar, and saw them between the Ceiling and the Boards, but did not take any Notice of it that Night, but went to consult some Friends how I should act. I sent the Prisoner out the next Morning and then tax'd the Maid with it, as they were pretty great; and then I call'd all three before me, and said, One of you must be the Aggressor; come, Thomas, let me look in your Trunk; he said, with all his Heart; and there I found the Piece of Scarlet Cloth mention'd in the Indictment; upon which he confess'd the other Things.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say then ?</p>
               <p>Finch. That he took the other Things: I ask'd him for what Use he took them; and he said, to wear. Then I said, it is not agreeable to your Character in Life, it would but expose you.</p>
               <p>Q. What were those Things between the Board and the Ceiling ?</p>
               <p>Finch. There was five Yards of Genoa Velvet, and two Yards and Half of Black Silk. After that I question'd him about the Watch he had bought; and he then confess'd he had taken a Guinea and a Half in Gold out of my Tiln, and in all about five Pounds.</p>

               <p>St. Marylebone. On Sunday morning, 14th Jan., between one and two o'clock, I got into conversation with a woman in the New-road, and went with her to a house where she was to get me a bed—she did so, and left me alone—I then wound up my watch, and counted my money—there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was a chain to my watch, I placed it and the watch in one pocket of my trowsers on a chair, and the money in the other—I had been drinking, but knew what I was about—after I had been in bed about five minutes, the prisoner and another man came into the room—the prisoner had a poker in his hand, and said, "You impudent b—, what do you do with my bed, it belongs to me and my mate, we are coach-painters and pay 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for it"—he laid the poker across my face, bid me be quiet, then seized my clothes, boots and all, and went down stairs with them—I got out of bed, and asked for my clothes—the door was open, and I heard them wrangling whether I should have my clothes back or not—I went to the top of the stairs, and the prisoner threw me my trowsers back—I exam-ined the pockets, and found the watch and money were gone—I asked for my boots—the prisoner said, "I will give the b—his boots," and threw them up as well—I afterwards got back the other clothes—I went, got a policeman, came back, and searched for the prisoner—there was then no one in the house, they had all gone before I came down.</p>

             . The two Prisoners and I, one Night about five Weeks ago, were in King street and saw this coat hanging on a chair , through the Window; we attempted to open the Door once or twice, but there was a Woman in a Back Room, who prevented us; at last we did get it open, Beale went in, took the coat, and brought it out; Bristow stood at the Door, and took it out of his Hand. We went with Intent to get some Hats, but could not. I was just come from Work, and met Beale, in Wardour-street , and knew that they intended to go out. When Beale went into the Shop, I was on the other Side of the court; it is a new court, and this House is the corner. We carried the coat that Night to Bristow's House, and they said, that in the Morning they sold it to Mrs Chandler for Half-a-crown. Beale is a Shoemaker, the other is a Carman; I have been with them before on these Occasions.</p>

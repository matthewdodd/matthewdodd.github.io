               <p>Q. Had you yourself heard any noise in the course of the night, or the morning before you got up? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks upon the floor when you came down? - A. No, I did not, the floor was dirty.</p>

               <p>Q.Your master got up after you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It had been light sometime before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. They broke open the cupboards where the plate was, and the cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, from all these circumstances of breaking open the shutter close to the fastening, and finding out the places where the plate was, do not you believe the robbers knew something about the house? - A. That I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. At your opening the door and going out, did you make a noise that could be heard at Mr. Oldham's? - A. I do not know, I did not make much noise, because I was afraid of waking our family.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What sort of a noise was it? - A. I thought it was something like the opening of a shutter.</p>

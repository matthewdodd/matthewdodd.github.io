               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. What is that paper you are looking at? - It is merely to refresh my memory.</p>
               <p>Court. I see no objection to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is word for word; it is a mere story.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner Wilson, lodged and worked most part of the time with his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240038"></xptr>fellow-prisoner; after he lodged in my house, I found I had been robbed; he begged the favour to lodge with my aprentice a few nights, because his shop-mate's wife was come to town; he certainly lodged there one night; about three weeks after, I missed some goods out of the room where he slept; I will not be sure of the day; I found most part of these goods at his sister's with the constable; the things were tied-up in James's apron; I could swear to the goods, they are in the Court; he confessed his shop-mate had induced him to commit the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise of favour made him to tell? - Yes; we went into the room to him, I told him, if there was any thing more and he would confess before I went out of the room, I would shew him all the mercy I could; he would not; but after he went out of the room I told him I would not forgive him if he did not tell the whole; when he came to the Justice's, I do not recollect any promise being made him; he confessed before Sir Sampson, that his shop-mate had induced him to commit the robbery, and we found the rest of the goods in Hollier's room; Hollier worked for another master; at Hollier's were found a pair of boot-legs, and some odd pieces of leather besides; they were marked with a G and B, the currier's mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In what part of his house were the things found? - Hollier took part of them out of a closet in his room; he produced them there as things brought by the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was in the habit of taking things there that were to be worked up? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did Wilson say any thing about the things that were found at his brother-in-law's? - I do not recollect he did; he acknowledged the whole of the robbery, and said the other persuaded him to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Alfred Bartholomew, in Brown's-lane, as nursery maid. On the 29th of May, I took out his child Matilda—she had a coral necklace on—I was in Norton Falgate—the prisoner pulled the necklace off the child's neck, while I was standing at a linen<lb></lb>draper's window, looking at some things in the window—he put his hand to her neck, and pulled them off—I saw them in his hand—I said, "You have got my child's beads"—he ran to go across the road, and the witness caught him—the prisoner went into the shop—I followed him—there were several persons in the shop—he said, "You are my friends, I am innocent," and he put his hand over which I saw was clenched—Mr. Cansdell sent for an officer, and the prisoner was taken; the beads were never found—I never lost sight of him.</p>

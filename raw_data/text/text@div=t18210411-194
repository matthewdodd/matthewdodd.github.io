            . I am servant at the City of London public house, City-road. On the 13th of April, about ten minutes before nine o'clock at night, I was about six doors from this house, and saw Lacey go into the garden and go down the area. I had seen the prisoners before, walking up and down, in company with another man and woman. I then saw Jones go in, and in a short time saw him come out with a bundle, and directly after Lacey came out with another bundle. I saw Mr. Cheslin, my master, coming, and I told him. Brown took Jones alongside his bundle. Lacey threw down his bundle and ran away. I and Hunter pursued him to the corner of River terrace, and took him without losing sight of him. His bundle remained where he threw it. Both bundles were taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I saw the last witness, he gave me information. I saw three men and a woman walking about, - I do not know them. I went with my beer, and as I came down the road I saw two bundles falling. I saw one bundle drop, and Lacey ran from where it dropped. He was taken in my sight, - the bundles were taken to the watch-house. I did not see Jones till he was at the watch-house.</p>

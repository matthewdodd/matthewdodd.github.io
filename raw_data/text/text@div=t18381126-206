                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Finsbury-square. The prisoner was in the employ of myself and partner, for three months, as clerk and town traveller, at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it was his duty, among other things, to carry out goods on approbation—on Friday, the 12th of Octo<lb></lb>ber, I sent him out with the articles here enumerated—he was to show them to a person in the City, and bring them back—he did so, and also on the following day—on Monday, the 15th, he took them again, and asked me if he might take the gold watch in the drawer to show, saying, "I</p>

               <p>think you said you would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it?"—I said yes—I have the book in which is the list of the things enumerated, with the exception of the gold watch, and they were entered on the 12th—I saw no more of the prisoner till the 6th of November, when I found him in custody—I have never got my gold watch, and there is one child's cup missing—the value of the whole property was about 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Mr. Walford, jeweller, &amp;c., from Liverpool, was recommended to Mr. Lawrence, as being likely to purchase a quantity of new plate, which Mr. W. has brought up with him from Liver<lb></lb>pool, for immediate disposal. It consists of tea plate in sets, and mugs, mustard-pots, &amp;c.; nearly all of which are gilt inside, and quite new, mo<lb></lb>dern, and about 200 oz. In explaining that it must be sold immediately, and at a great sacrifice, no doubt it is necessary Mr. W. should explain, that having a very pressing engagement to pay a sum of money on Tuesday morning in Liverpool, which will, after Christmas, yield Mr. W. an enor<lb></lb>mous profit, he is induced to make the temporary sacrifice, for one that will be so much more to his advantage. Mr. W. begs to say he must be in Liver<lb></lb>pool on Tuesday morning, with at least 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash; the remainder as might be agreed upon, Mr. W. would not object to a bill. Mr. W. only came in just now from Liverpool; and if Mr. L. will call on him at the Russell coffee-house, 26, Great Windmill-street, he can see the goods, and Mr. W. will wait at home this morning to see him."</p>

               <p>Q. Was the closet locked?</p>
               <p>Watson. It was, but the key was in the door. At that time the prisoner was my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the money last?</p>
               <p>Watson. I saw it between seven and eight o'clock at night, and missed it at eleven, when I went to take it up to bed, the box and money were both gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Watson. She was gone also, I did not see her after nine o'clock. I went to see for her the next day, and between one and two o'clock I took her at the Savoy, and carried her before a justice of the peace. She owned she had taken the money away. After this I was informed, that the box had been seen, at the Chequer alehouse in St. James's. I went there and found it; it was produced by Mrs. Fowley that keeps the house. There were in it some notes which were there when in my house.</p>

            . On the 28th of July last, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came into my house and desired she might have some stakes dressed. She took me on one side and gave me a bundle, after that this box, in which was thirty shillings, and then desired me to put them by for her. She came again the next day, took out all the money, but twelve shillings, and went away (the box produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

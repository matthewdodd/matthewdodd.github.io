               <p>Q. I believe you have seen these sacks - A. I have examined six hundred and two; ten are still missing; we lost six hundred and twelve: these six hundred and two are my master's property.</p>

            . Q. Did you assist in landing any sacks at Queenhithe - A. Yes; on the 4th of April; it was a large quantity. I cannot say how many. Mr. Dodd, the prisoner, paid for bringing them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You were not employed by the prisoner - A. No; a young man employed me, down by the water side, and the prisoner paid me for it.</p>
               <p>MR. DREWITT. I live at 75, Upper Thames-street. I am a sack merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these six hundred and two sacks come to your premises - A. They did. The prisoner brought me a sample sack, on the beginning of April: he said he was recommended to me by Mr. Barrett, of Queenhithe.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he bring this sample sack - A. As a sample of six hundred and upwards. I told him I could not buy sacks by sample. I asked him, whether it was to be by money or credit; he told me, it was for money. I told him, I must see the bulk. He told me, he had had a very good character of me: he would send me the remainder of the sacks; and, if I had any objection, he would pay me for warehouse-room. On the 4th of April, in the morning, Mr. Dodd came in; he said the sacks were now landed at Queenhithe: he desired me to send my cart for them. I sent my cart to bring part: they came, twenty in a bundle; they were dirty, as though they had come up in a coal-barge. The sacks all came to my premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, were the sacks packed in an ordinary way that sacks are - A. No; I asked Dodd the quantity; he told me, there were six hundred and twenty-four, or six hundred and twenty-six, I cannot tell which. I was going out of town that morning. I asked Dodd, if he would call on Monday morning; he came on Monday morning; I asked him the price: we agreed for three shillings and sixpence. I told him, I was not quite satisfied in the sacks; there were twenty-two short of the compliment that he sent them in for: he said, twenty-two was no object; I might pay for what I had got, and no more. I then had doubts in my mind. I turned to Mr. Dodd and said, I wanted to know from whom they came from. I hope they are perfectly right. He said, they are perfectly right, and he should have two or three tons at least, in a week or two, and you shall have the first offer: he said, there could nothing happen in the parties for six months; so I got them marked and sent away: I pressed for the name; he told me, I knew the party. He pulled out a bill of parcels: he said, this is the gentleman the sacks belongs to,

Cleaver instead of Benjamin Cleaver. When he brought Mr. Cleaver, I asked Mr. Cleaver if they were his property; he said, no. I asked Dodd, where he had this property from. I really, said he, so help me God, know not. I sent for a constable and had him apprehended. These sacks have laid in my premises ever since.</p>

He said, if I came forward and said, all was right, he would give me five pounds. I went to Mr. Drewitt; I there learned that he had sold sacks in my name: they were not my sacks; I knew nothing at all of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lived with Mr. Parson's, a wholesale grocer, for a number of years, and innocent I came to this bar, with respect to the charge; and when I go I shall go innocent. I was only employed as a broker. I know no more of the robbery than a child unborn. The barge-man brought the sacks to me; his name is Cooper. After I was in custody, he came to my house, to hear if I had sold the sacks. He was informed that I was in custody; and, since that time, I have not seen nor heard any thing of him.</p>

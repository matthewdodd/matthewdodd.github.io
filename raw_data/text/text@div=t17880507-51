               <p>Did she say how it was taken? - She said it was taken out of her hand, she said, certainly; she did not know perfectly which man it was that took it out of her hand.</p>
               <p>What did she say about the mistake; - The mistake was, that she gave him two guineas instead of one; instead of giving him his own guinea back, she said, she gave him his own and another.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell my Lord that just now, that is very material; then she said, she had given it them out of mistake, two guineas instead of one; it was her guinea, not their's? - It is very true, and when I apprehended them, they said, that they had got a guinea in mistake; they offered me the guinea to go about their business, and for me to return into the person it belonged to.</p>
               <p>I do not quite understand that? - They said, that was the guinea they got in a mistake; I was to have nothing, only the woman's property.</p>
               <p>Who was present at that time? - This man.</p>
               <p>With was with you in the shop? - I went to Mr. Gibson's; I saw Mrs. Gibson take the guinea in her hand; and say, it was her guinea.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say, she gave two guineas instead of one? - I did not hear her.</p>
               <p>If she had, must you have heard it? - There were a great many people in the shop; Jones took the guinea out of his pocket, and held it over to the publican and me to settle the mistake; I said, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070059"></xptr>had better go back and settle the mistake; I got into the chaise, and Milligan followed me on horse back.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Gibson. You was present at the time? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did your wife say, she had given two guineas out of a mistake? - No; she never said any such thing; Milligan lives about Hampstead; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gray. I wish you would look at these two commitments, you will find a great spite in it; the first commitment is for bail; and the next is, for feloniously stealing.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Gibson. When these people were brought back again to you; did you say, you had given them two guineas instead of one? - No; I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Did you say it was a mistake? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones to Milligan. Did you hear any offer made to Mrs. Gibson or Mr. Gibson, of any sum of money? - They wanted to make it up, and to go to the publick-house and have something to drink.</p>

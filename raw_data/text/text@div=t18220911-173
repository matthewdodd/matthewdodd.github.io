On the 26th of August, I went to bed at ten o'clock, and saw all the doors and windows fastened and bolted. I got up at seven o'clock in the morning - I had heard no noise in the night. I found every drawer in the parlour broken open - I went and told my mistress; I then went down to the kitchen, and found the lock of the area door broken off - it was double locked at night. There is no area gate; they must have got down by the cistern - some of the flowers were knocked off the window. I found the pannel cut out of the kitchen door, which I had barred and bolted. There was a hole large enough to let a person through - they had taken a door, which goes from the kitchen to the stairs, (and was plated with iron, and fastened with three bolts) off its hinges, and laid it down. They then had free access to the parlour. The articles stated in the indictment were stolen. I lost a half-crown, two shillings, and twelve pence from the kitchen drawer. I saw a shirt at Queen-square on the 5th of September, which I knew to be my master's.</p>

Pace went over the way; I remained at the door and asked if he lived in the parlour; he said,</p>
               <p>"I do occasionally, or a girl I cohabit with; I have got the key." He opened the door, I went in with him; I found no bundles there, but on looking under the pillow, I found two shirts, one linen and the other calico; I turned them over slightly, and said,</p>
               <p>"Whose are these, I suppose they are some of your wife's chemise,?" he made no answer; but on looking round further, he asked for my search warrant; I said he should be satisfied about that; and as Pace was coming in at the door, I asked him again about the shirts - he said they were two of his own old shirts,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110086"></xptr>and he believed I should find them nearly worn out. I pulled out my handcuffs, he then resisted, and we had a great struggle to secure him; we took him to the watch-house, and on the first of September, Handley and I apprehended Hedges.

               <p>WILLOUGHBY's Defence. On the 27th of August about five o'clock in the morning, I was going down Peter-street, and met Hedges and Brown. Hedges asked if he did not leave two shirts at my house; I said, Yes. He cohabits with the woman as well as me; when Cooper came, I opened the door for him immediately.</p>

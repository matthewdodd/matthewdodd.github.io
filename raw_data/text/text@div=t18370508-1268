On the 18th of April I was in Holborn, and received information which induced me to go to No. 5, Rose-alley, Eagle-street, Red Lion-square—the outer door of the house was open—I observed the ground floor window was covered with an apron and coarse towel, but they left a small space through which I could see—I looked through, and saw the male prisoner sitting by the fire, with something in his hand which had the appearance of a small mould—I observed him take a spoon from the fire, and pour the contents into what he had in hit hand, and which I supposed to be a mould—I tried the window gently, and found it was fast—I also tried the door—I procured the assistance of Thornton, another officer, and we returned to the place—I knocked at the parlour door, and then heard a noise like a window sliding backwards and forwards, and then the female prisoner, Lee, opened the door, and we both went in—the male prisoner was still in the room, sitting where I had pre<lb></lb>viously seen him, near the fire—I saw a towel in his lap—I took it from him, and in it was rolled up the bowl of a metal spoon—I found an iron spoon on the fire, and some white melted metal in it—in the bowl of the spoon was the same description of metal—on my taking the spoon off the fire, the male prisoner attempted to throw a large kettle of water over me—it was cold as if it had been just put on the fire—he succeeded in throwing an iron spoon over—I afterwards collected the metal from the fireplace—I asked him what he was doing with the spoon on the fire—he said, "Making the fire up"—I found a paper up the chimney, containing plaster-of-Paris, and afterwards found a small file, some sand, and some spoons of the same white metal as was being melted—while I was searching about, the male prisoner said, "You may search about, but you will not find any thing"—I saw a mould which Thornton found outside the window—the male prisoner said, "Never mind, that was not on the premises."</p>

This is a plaster of Paris mould for casting counterfeit sixpences—it has been used for that purpose, and has a counterfeit sixpence now in it, made of Britannia metal—a mould of this size would retain heat five or six minutes after it has been used, and if the coin remained in the mould, it would of course retain the heat considerably longer—the two sixpences produced by Dunkett are both counterfeit, and have been cast in the mould—neither of the three are complete—there is a roughness on the edge which should be removed with a file—the files produced would answer that purpose—they have white metal in them—here are two ladles and two broken spoons of a similar metal to the coin, and an iron spoon which appears to have been used to melt white metal—it has some now adhering to it—here is some plaster of Paris in powder, which is the material of which the moulds are made.</p>

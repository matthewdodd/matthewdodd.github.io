            . I live at Holborn-bridge with the prosecutor, the woman came to my masters shop last Friday night and desired to see some India handkerchiefs, I told her we had got none, but we had some London made; I show'd her some, she did not like them, she went to the other counter, then she ask'd what she must give for the eleven, and what for one singly. Then she went out in great haste, which gave me some suspicion. I mist the handkerchiefs, my master was behind the other counter, I told him; we both went after her, and brought her back, she said she had not got any thing, and she would not be search'd. We found the piece under her cloak.</p>

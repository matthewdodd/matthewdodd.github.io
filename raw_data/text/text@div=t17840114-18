               <p>Court. Did you afterwards know that this place where you found the things, were his lodgings? - Yes, we knew that from his accounts and from his wife; and I saw some china images there that he bought of us sometime ago, at the first search we found a quantity of drops and various things that are used in our way, he was then committed; as he was going to the Compter, he asked the constable whether we took those things or not, from the box under the bed, and we went to his lodgings again, and found in two baskets some more things, and under the bed we found a box that contained drops of various forts, that had been manufactured at different times for seven, eight, or nine years; the box was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140024"></xptr> about nine inches wide and two foot long. On a second examination he confessed every thing.</p>
               <p>Was any promise of favour made him if he confessed? - No; the Lord Mayor said, he did not know his situation; he said he had done wrong and was very sorry for it, he gave no account as to his taking the things.</p>
               <p>Did he acknowledge that he had taken them? - He acknowledged every thing that was laid to his charge was true; we always looked upon him as an honest, industrious man, till we heard otherwise the beginning of December.</p>
               <p>Court. Has he any family? - Yes, a wife and two children.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am not capable of telling you.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you took them for the use of your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What was you to do with them? - To mount them by degrees, I never sold any of them in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Bailey. In what mannr did you supply this man with these articles necessary for mounting the girandoles? - The drops were generally told out when he took a pair of girandoles, but since we knew him he has gone to the drawers and helped himself.</p>
               <p>Court. But was he ever intrusted with any very large quantities for the purpose of mounting? - There were drops that would mount twelve or fourteen pair, and every thing that is used for mounting, in this assortment, the morning this happened I asked him if he had any thing of ours at home, he said he had nothing but that pair; none of the drops that I found there did I give him out for any purpose to mount whatever, there are drops there that the moulds have not been used these seven years; there was a spy glass, I never had but two of them cut.</p>

            . I went down to Ham-yard, and saw the prisoner and Hampson sitting by the side of a sawpit; the prisoner was sewing his shoe, and the other was hammering a stone; but first of all I had a paper of awlblades sent from the prisoner, and I bought them; he asked if I wanted to buy these - I said they were of no use to me; he said he had got them to sell cheap, at 2d. a dozen; I said I did not want them - but I bought the whole lot for 8d., and I took them to Dennis.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who sent you to purchase these things? A. Mr. Dennis, in whose service I then was; I bought a hammer of the other man - I met the prisoner afterwards in Oxford-street; I told him he was wanted, and he had better get out of the way - I could not take him myself; I should be afraid to tackle him, for he had threatened me, and I was obliged to be as civil to him as I could; I cannot recollect when I saw him last - I will not swear it was not on the 30th of September; I stopped and drank with him - it was more out of good-nature than any thing else.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, after that, tell the officer where he was? A. Yes; I told the officer every thing.</p>

He instantly ran up Catherine-wheel-alley, and I after him; the moment I called Stop thief! the officer was at the end of the alley, and secured him, without my losing sight of him.

            . I am beadle of Bishopsgate. I was in Catherine-wheel-alley, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I placed myself across the passage, which is narrow, and the prisoner ran violently up the alley; I stopped him, the prosecutor came up instantly, and charged him with stealing his watch. I did not see the transaction, I only heard the scuffle. The prisoner said three others thrust him into the alley, and he was not the thief. I asked him why he ran away - he made no answer. I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going by, three men laid hold of me, and shoved me up the alley - two ran down the alley, I ran after them to know why they did it, and the gentleman took hold of me.</p>

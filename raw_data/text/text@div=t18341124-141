                  </hi>. I am a City officer. On the 9th of October I was called in by the solicitor for the prosecution—I put such a letter at this into the general post, and left town for Weymouth the same night by the mail—next day I went to the house of Williams and Co., at Wey<lb></lb>mouth—I was in a back room adjoining the counting-house—I saw the prisoner there—I did not see her come in—I came from the back room into the front office, and the prisoner was writing this receipt (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—she wrote nearly the whole of it in my presence—when she had finished writing it, I took it from her, and asked her if that signature was her name—she answered, "Yes"—I said, "How will you take it?"—she said, "In Bank of England paper, if you have got it"—I said, "I must trouble you to step into the back room, as I wish to ask you a question or two"—she said, "I hope there is nothing amiss"—I produced the letter in one hand, and the draft in the other—this is the document I speak of, (No. 1.) and this was the draft—I showed the letter and bill to her—she pointed to the letter, and said, "That is my handwriting,"—the face of the draft was towards her—she pointed to me to turn it, which I did, and she said, "That is my handwriting," alluding to the indorsement: I think I have gone rather too fast—as soon as I got her into the back room, I said, "You are not bound to answer me any questions unless you please; it will either be used for or against you"—that was before I asked her a question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your producing the letter and bill, did she state what you have said without your asking her the question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she said it was her handwriting—I held the bill in my hand—she pointed to the indorse<lb></lb>ment, "C. Hillier," and said it was her handwriting—when she said, "that is my handwriting," she referred to the "C. Hillier," on the back—she said, "I can only speak the truth"—I then told her I understood the signature purporting to be Lord Stradbroke's was a forgery—she said the had taken it of an agent in France, and that Lord Stradbroke was not personally known to her—I asked her in what part of France—she said, "Nantz"—I asked her the name of the agent—she said, "Percy"—I asked her when she took it—she said, "On the 16th of this month"—I said, "The 16th of this month has not arrived yet," and she said, "It was the 16th of last month"—I said, "September?" she said, "Yes, the 16th, I left on the 18th"—the said, "I took it in a money transaction for some pictures," or, "in a pic<lb></lb>ture transaction"—I do not recollect which she said—after this I went with her to Augusta-place, into two rooms there—she brought away a carpet bag, a trunk, and basket, containing wearing apparel and other things—I kept the trunk, and she had the key in her possession—there was a purse in her trunk, but nothing important—I found this piece of blotting-paper in the trunk, of which I took possession, and which she kept the key of—in consequence of a mark on the paper of the first letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240116"></xptr>
               <p>I went to Mr. Thomas, a stationer at Weymouth, and made inquiry there—I found some paper corresponding with that in the trunk—there was some marked "Thomas, Weymouth"—here is the whole of the paper found in the trunk—it bears the same impression in the corner as the paper—the letter is written on, "Thomas, Weymouth"—it was in the same trunk.</p>

On the morning of Friday, the 10th of October, about one o'clock, or half-past one, I saw the prisoner there—she said she had a letter from Messrs. Drummond, the bankers, and inquired if we had received any instructions to pay her some money—I do not know whether she produced a letter to me—this letter (No. 2) was produced to me in the course of the morning, before she left the office—on her making the inquiry, I said we had received instructions respecting the payment of some money—I inquired if she was furnished with a receipt for the amount—I do not recollect whether she stated the amount—she said, "No," she was not furnished with one—I said it was necessary she should write a receipt, which must be on a stamp—she said, "Perhaps I had better get a stamp then, and bring a receipt," and immediately inquired whether we kept stamps—I produced this stamp (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) and she filled it up—this is what she wrote on that occasion—in consequence of something I said while she was writing the receipt, Forrester was introduced into the office—immediately she began to write, I had him brought in.</p>

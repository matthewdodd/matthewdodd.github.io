                  </hi>. I am a stone-mason, and live in Exmouth-street, Hampstead-road. On Monday night, the 11th of November, I met the prisoner in Hampstead-road—she accosted me—after a little conversation she went with me to my lodging—there was a young man in the room, who lodges there—there was only one bed in the room—the prisoner got into the bed with me—we left there at six o'clock in the morning, went to a public-house, and then to a coffee-shop—she left me about one o'clock—I told her I had to go to Marylebone police-office to meet a friend—I missed some money on Tuesday evening—the last time I saw it safe was in a public-house, where I was with my friend, about half an hour after I left the prisoner—I then joined her again at Marylebone office—she then had a cloak on, which she had not in the morning—we went to a public-house—I saw her pick up a fourpenny piece in the street, and she paid for a quartern of gin with it—we went to another public-house in Rathbone-place, and went to a variety of public-houses, and after that I missed my money—when I saw it I had three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and three shil<lb></lb>lings—I have found none of it—both of us got very drunk, and the pri<lb></lb>soner sent for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I felt in my pocket for money, and it was all gone but some halfpence—I had not seen it after one o'clock—I told her I had lost my money, and she must have taken it—she laughed, and made some reply—I told the caiman to stop, and call a policeman, which he did—on the way to the station-house the prisoner delivered me a key which had been in my waistcoat pocket, where my money was—I do not think my money had tumbled out—I was not down on the floor or on the seat—I might have fallen asleep—there was some money found on her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Noble.

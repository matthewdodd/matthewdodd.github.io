             came into my apartment with Mrs. Day, she came as a slight acquaintance, her excuse was to ask me how I did, it was on a Sunday; Mrs. Day staid a short time, she said her dinner was ready, and went home; the prisoner staid, I asked the prisoner if she would stop and have a bit of victuals; she did, and we had a pot or two of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a stranger. - A. I am a watchman: I had seen her once or twice before. I had been up two nights and two days, I was very drowsy, I had a little liquor, not much; I laid myself down and fell asleep, leaving the prisoner in the room and nobody else; I slept till the dusk of the evening before I awoke, and then I found the prisoner was gone. I went to the place where I hung my key, I opened my box, I missed my purse and the money altogether; the box was locked, and the key hung in its usual place.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in the purse. - A. One guinea, two half guineas, three seven shilling pieces, and nine shillings in silver. From information of Mrs. Day she and I went to a house in Little Saffron-street; the prisoner was up stairs, Mrs. Day fetched her down to me; I charged her with robbing me, she denied it; I got a constable, he took her to the watchhouse; she denied it there some time, till the constable said he must strip her to see-whether she had any money about her; on that she put her hand into her pocket, and counted out one guinea, two half guineas, three seven shilling pieces, and four shillings in silver, she said that was all she got from me; the purse was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no mark on the money, I suppose. - A. They were all new money except one seven shilling piece, and that was an old bent one.</p>

After several times threatening to search her she pulled a pocket book out of her pocket with the money in it, she counted it into my hand; I told her that was not all the money she was charged with; she said there was all that she had, and all that she had seen of it.</p>

Between eight and nine o'clock he and Mrs. Day came; Mrs. Day came up to me and brought me down stairs, he was there, he said he had lost his money, and that I had robbed him; I said I had not robbed him, before they searched me at the watchhouse: I put my hand into my pocket and took out the money; I said that was all the money I had got.</p>

               <p>E. Rice. He is not, my husband is very ill. so he cannot be out when I am: the company had not quitted the house, only one had been out once, and the prisoner twice. I opened 2 cupboards where I used to put them, it was not in either of them; I looked under the table and said to the men, it is hard I should loose my tankard. I thought they had played the wag with it, I looked at the prisoner and said don't you know of it, he said no; said I to my knowledge, you have been outtwice, he answered he never had been out since he came here to drink, and said many bad words. I sent the maid for a constable unknown to them. The other young men said they were very willing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040034"></xptr> to go to the compter, or where I pleased till I was satisfied. Then Boulton slid towards the door-way, and laid hold on the door to go out. I took hold on the skirt of his coat, and said he should not go out any more than the rest. He said he wanted to make water, then I said he shall go into the cellar. He went down, when he came up again, the constable was come. The prisoner sat down by the table, and said I wanted to persuade him to say he had it. I said, if you have it don't frighten me but let me have it. Then the constable took him into the kitchen with the others. Then Charles Price came out and bid me not be frighted, for I was likely to have my tankard again. Then he went out.</p>

            . I went to this house to have a little beer before I went to work, Boulton called me on one side and asked me to do him a favour, that was to go to Mrs. Daws's for the tankard, or else for her to bring it under her apron. I came out of the kitchen into the tap-room, and told Mrs. Rice, I had heard of her tankard; she ordered the constable to go with me. We went to the woman's house nam'd Dawes, where the tankard was left, but she was not at home; so I went to my work. When we found where the woman was, we went again, she was at the Cart and Horses; we asked her for it. She said the prisoner brought her a tankard. She show'd us where it was, and took it out. She said he told her he found it among some rubbish. She delivered it to the constable, and we brought it to the prosecutrix. They had a warrant against the woman but she is absconded.</p>

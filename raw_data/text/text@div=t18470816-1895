                  </hi> I am in the employ of Isaac Jacobson, of No. 112, Oxford-street—on Wednesday morning, the 4th of Aug., the prisoner came to our shop, shortly before eleven o'clock, and asked to took at some gold watches—I showed him some—he asked if I would have any objection to send some to the Boar and Castle, for his father to look at—he selected three—I went with them to the Boar and Castle, and went up stairs with the prisoner into a bed-room—after I had been there some time, from his man<lb></lb>ner I began to get very uneasy, and asked him if the gentleman who wished to see the watches, had not better step into the shop, as it was only a few doors off, and he would see a great variety to look at—he said he would see—he went out of the room, came and said if I would go with him to his father's room he would look at them and choose them—I walked across the room, and we met near the door—we were walking out together, side by side, through the door-way, and just as we got under the door-way, he struck me two or three blows on the side of the head with a life-preserver, which I produce—he laid hold of my left hand which had the watches in it—by a sud<lb></lb>den jerk I pushed my hands away from him, and, turning round at the same time, caught his had falling on my head with the life-preserver again—the watches were partly in his hand and partly in mine—they were never out of my possession—he never got them—I called out. "Murder!" and held him till the waiter came to my assistance, and he was taken into custody—this is the hat I had on at the time—(<hi rend="italic">producing it, very much broken</hi>)—this is the effect of the blows—it is not beaten through—there is no hole in it—I had a large bump on my head, and I was constantly bathing it for a fortnight afterwards—I have been under the doctor's care ever since.</p>

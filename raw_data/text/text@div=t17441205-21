            . I was a nurse in Mr. Edwards's house; the Prisoner came in at a back alley, between three and four in the afternoon, and broke the door of the room open - She burst the door open by breaking the lock, which made a louder noise than a pistol can do. I listened and heard her feet go cross the room: I went up stairs, and saw the door on a jar. I was afraid of going in for fear there should have been men with their cutlasses. I went to the door, and she bounced out upon me - I know her from one of an hundred, a brazen faced jade: I laid hold of her, and it came off in my hand; I laid hold of her another time, and a second piece came off; I hold of her a third time, and she got away: I went after her, and cried out, Stop Thief. and she was taken in the alley. Mr. Edwards had desired me to give these shirts out to wash, I had laid them upon the table, and when I went up to look for them, they lay upon the ground, between the stove and the wall: nobody had been in the room.</p>

            . I live in the same house; the last witness came up, and asked me if any body had been up stairs. I said, No. She said, she heard somebody's feet. The Prisoner was then got into the alley. I went down and took her. She said, Don't hurt me. And I said, I would not. <rs id="t17441205-21-verdict139" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am in Mr. Newby's employ. Smith came in and asked to see some wedding-rings, which were shown him; Wilson then came in, and joined him in conversation; they then asked to see some seals and keys - they had selected a ring, but not paid for it; I suspected them, and shut the door; I saw Smith take a seal and put it up his sleeve; I then rang the bell - Mr. Newby came down, and an officer was fetched; I saw Smith put the ring on the counter, saying, "Here is a ring of your's;" it was not the ring they had selected.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did they see you ring the bell? A. Yes; they attempted to get away - Wilson broke a pane of glass - only 1d. was found on them - a 6d. laid on the counter.</p>

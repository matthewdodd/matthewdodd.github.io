On Sunday evening, the 8th of Feb., about seven o'clock, my attention was called to a very strong smell of fire in the passage leading to the prisoners' house, No. 3, Bridge-row, in the parish of Hammersmith—I had seen the elder Stone pass our house about half-past five o'clock in the evening, coming in a direction from the house of Catch<lb></lb>pole, which is about five minutes' walk from the prisoner's house—he passed our window going ia a direction for his own house, but I did not see him go into it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness's husband—I let the house, No. 3, Bridge-row, to the elder Stone, I think in June last, at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, at a quar<lb></lb>terly tenant—Mrs. Hyde came into the house first, and Stone, sen., about a month after—they lived together as man and wife—Stone, jun., hat not been there long—he came a little before Christmas—in Nov. last Stone, sen. came to my shop and asked if I was insured, and where (I am not cer<lb></lb>tain about the time)—I told him yes—he asked if Carter, who was a tenant of mine, was insured—I said yes, that I insured with Mr. Austin, who is agent to the Union, and said Carter was insured in the same office—he left me, saying he would go over and tee about insuring—he came back and said he had been to make inquiry, and asked me to let him see a paper connected with insurance—the prisoners, all three, lived at the house up to the beginning of Feb.—I saw them occasionally going in and out—I was at a friend's house on Sunday night, the 8th of Feb., when there was an alarm of fire—I went to the prisoners' house—I live next door—I got there a little after eight o'clock, and observed smoke coming from the up-stair window—the house is only one story high—I tried to get in at the window, but it was fast—I at last broke the front door open—there was to much smoke coming from the window we did not get in, or we should have been suffocated—I went through a little shop which the front door opens into, to get up stairs—I at last got to the top, but was suffocated with smoke and fell down against the person behind me—when I recovered I knelt on the floor, and saw the bed was on fire—there was an old bedstead and the bed which was on it was on fire—it was a sort of bag of shavings—it was a common bag of cooper's shavings and tome tow mixed with them on the ticking—I pulled the bag down stairs into the road—I went up to the room again, and when the air got in, the partition of the room and the bedstead began to blaze—the wooden partition was fixed to the house—I had some difficulty in getting the fire out—if I had not had plenty of water I should never have done it—we saw smoke coming out of a box under the bedstead—the lid was closed, and smoke coming out where it shuts down—there Was no sign of fire outside the box—we opened it and found in it a lot of cooper's chips, and a bag of chips and shavings, and a large piece of coke or cinder, about us big us my fist, in the middle of the bag—it appeared to have</p>

               <p>been put into the bag to set it on fire—the bag had a hole cut in it, and the coke put in—it was burning—there was no fire-place in that room—I thought the box when opened smelled very strongly of turpentine—I think there was also a clothes-horse, one chair, a tub, and, I believe, a horn lantern in that room—we saw fire through the chinks of the partition in the other room, which were made by being burned—I burst a piece out of the pannel with my feet, so that we could get water through, and found fire was underneath the floor—we got it out—it appeared as if a piece of the floor had been taken up and a lot of old baskets, chips, and cinders put in, that was burning underneath the floor—there was an old-fashioned tent bedstead in that room, and a piece of old white curtain over the top of it, of no value—the place was so full of smoke we could not get into that room—I ran down stairs to my own house, and by bursting open two doors I got into the room—I found a bag on the bed there, filled with shavings like the other, and it was all in a blaze—there was no bedding in that bed nor any ticking—the bag rested on the sacking—there was a chest of painted deal drawers in that room—we observed smoke coming from the bottom drawer, and on opening it it contained a lot of cooper's chips and cinders, lying along the middle as if thrown in with a fire-shovel—the chips were burning—I saw no cinders on the floor, but in the drawer, which was it<lb></lb>self on fire—there was a stove in that room, but no remains of fire—I put my hand to the stove and it was quite cold—there were five drawers to the chest—we opened them, and the one above the bottom one was strewed with cooper's chips, which were in every drawer—I found three or four bags of shavings altogether, one in each bed, one in the box, and another under the second bed, which was not on fire—I think there was one chair in the back room, and a washhand-stand—there was no furniture up stairs but two bedsteads, a wash<lb></lb>hand-stand, a chest of drawers, and two chairs—they sold sweetmeats in the shop, and we found some in the shop—the whole stock, I should think was not worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the officer, Jupp, came to my assistance, and he found a policy of insurance in the drawer which was on fire—Sergeant Mount afterwards pro<lb></lb>duced a key, which I knew to be the key of the street-door I had given to Stone when he took the house.</p>

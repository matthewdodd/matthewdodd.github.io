                  </hi>. I live in Great George-street, in the parish of St. Pancras. I keep the house—the prisoner came into my service on Mon<lb></lb>day, the 23d of October—she did not sleep in the house, but used to come in the morning—on Friday morning she came between seven and eight o'clock—I was sleeping on a sofa in the front kitchen—I found her rum<lb></lb>maging a drawer, and told her to go up and light the parlour fire—she laid the fire, but did not light it—I had two £5 notes, a sovereign, and half-sove<lb></lb>reign, in a red morocco box, which I had seen over night in the table drawer, in the kitchen—the box was locked—the prisoner was rummaging in that drawer, which made me turn round to ask what she did there—she said she wanted some wood to light the fire—I said, "Go up stairs and light the fire, do not make such a noise here"—she went up and decamped—I missed my box—I went to look for her, and met her father and mother—they begged two hours' grace—I traced the notes, and have the Bank clerk here—they gave me notice that the notes came into the Bank—nobody knew of the money being in the box, to my knowledge, but myself and my wife—the prisoner was in the kitchen when my wife put the money into the box, but whether she saw her put it in, I cannot say—I saw my wife put it in, lock the box, and give me the key—the prisoner did not give me any intimation that she was going—I found heron Saturday night, getting out of a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> to go into her father's house—she ran away as hard as she could—a gentleman knocked her down, and as she was getting up, I came up, and I gave her in charge—when she was with me, she had scarcely any thing to wear—my wife gave her a shawl, and shoes and other articles, and when I took her she was well dressed—she had new stockings, a new gown, new shawl, and bonnet, but before she had nothing to cover her, and could not get any thing.</p>

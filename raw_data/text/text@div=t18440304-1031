On Saturday, the 17th of Feb., I received twenty titlers and twenty loaves of sugar from Stubbs and Absolom's, in Rood-lane, to take to Sims's wharf, in the Borough—the wagon got to the wharf about ten minutes past eight—I left Rood-lane about a quarter to eight—when I got to the wharf two titlers of sugar were gone—it was not possible for them to have falllen out, because the wagon was boarded up, and they were not so high as the wagon—there were two tarpaulings and the coat I have on over them—I received information as to some person being about my wagon—I did not obseve anything myself.</p>

I was with Day—I directed his attention to the prisoner and the other man—they separated, and the prisoner crossed Phillip-street, and turned down Storey-street—we followed them—when was got about two yards from the prisoner, he threw down the bundle and ran—I told Day not to lose sight of him—I took up the sugar, and went and met him—I said to him, "Do you know what you threw away?"—he said, "You know by this time, it is sugar"—I said, "Who gave it you?"—he said, "A man with a velveteen jacket, breeches, and cap gave it me"—I asked where he was to take it to—he said, to a street three or four turnings down, but he did not know the name of it, nor what house—this is the sugar—it was packed in a black bag, which looks like an old petticoat that has been sewn up, and been put over a fish-basket—it smelt very strongly of fish.</p>

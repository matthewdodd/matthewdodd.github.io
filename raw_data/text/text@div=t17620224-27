            , chamberlain. Last Saturday was three weeks a quilt was stole off the bed, and a week ago a sheet was likewise stole out of it; and last night I went into the room, thinking I heard somebody, and I saw a bundle, and there was a quilt and a pillow case taken and tied up. I went to call somebody. In the mean time the prisoner went downstairs, and I called to somebody in the yard to stop her; she was had back to the room, and a woman happened to be in the yard, saw something hanging down like a sheet, a little below her clothes. So she took hold of it, and said, Here are the sheets wrapped round her, and they were my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that they were your master's sheets?</p>
               <p>Turrell. By a mark of coloured thread, by which they are well known to me. Then we sent for a constable, who took her before my lord mayor, and she was committed.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses to call?</p>

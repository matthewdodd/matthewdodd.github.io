                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">Jun.</hi> I am eleven years old, and live with my mother at 5, Hinton-street, Bethnal-green. I know the prisoner—he lived at our house with a woman that was called his wife—on Wednesday night, 26th Sept., I was called up-stairs a little after ten o'clock—I saw Mrs. Baines standing on the landing—the prisoner was in his room, lying on the bed with his clothes on—Mrs. Baines asked me to get her clothes; I went in, got them off a chair, and took them to her—she said to the prisoner, "I will let you know when I put on my clothes," and he got up and took away her clothes from her, put them on the bed, and lay on them; he then got off the bed again, came on the landing, and kicked her twice—I saw him do it—she was at the top of the stairs—he kicked her in the stomach the first time—she staggered back and held by the bannisters—he had his boots on at the time; they were bluchers—the second time he kicked her it was on the breast—she put her head down on the stairs and cried, and he went and laid on the bed again—she had no clothes on—she was lying down when she received the second kick—she lay down when he first kicked her—she did not lie there a minute, for I asked her if I should help her down, and she came down with me into my mother's room, the front room; she walked down—she then sat on a chair and cried—she asked me to help her down on the floor; I did, and she laid on the floor in our room and groaned—my mother was out—I asked if I should fetch anybody, and I fetched Mrs. Marling, the person next door; and after Mrs. Marling came in my mother came home—the prisoner was given into custody that same night—my mother called him down stairs; she called him three times before he came—Mrs. Baines had been packing up her things during the day; she was going to move, and my mother also—her crockery was packed up in a basket in her room; I saw one piece lying on the floor.</p>

I lived at 5, Hinton-street, at the time in question—I came home on 26th, about ten minutes to eleven o'clock, and found the deceased lying on my bed, groaning dreadfully—I called the prisoner down stairs—after some time he came—he kissed his wife, and said some<lb></lb>thing to her in a low tone, which I could not understand—he asked me if I could do anything for her, and I think he asked her to go up-stairs—she said, "I can't"—after that, he said something to her, and she called him a brute—I do not know that he made any answer to that, but he went on and said she was not hurt, she was only <hi rend="italic">shamming</hi>, that she did it to collect a <hi rend="italic">mob—he</hi> said nothing about the injury, nor did she in his presence—I went with her to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital, On Thursday morning, 27th Sept., the deceased was brought there—I attended her until her death, which was on the 28th, thirteen hours after her admission—I examined her when she first came—I found no external marks of violence on the abdomen—she was very ill, and suffering a great deal of pain in the abdomen—she seemed better until towards night, when she got worse, and gradually sank—I examined the body after death, I found the membranes of the intestines as if inflammation had taken place in them—I should suppose it to have been of about two days' standing—I also found slight disease of the lungs, but I attached no importance to that as it respects the cause of death; it was of very old standing—I found all the other organs of the body comparatively healthy, at least there was nothing about them to account for death—I attribute the death to <hi rend="italic">peritonitis</hi>, or inflammation of the membrane covering the intestines—a kick with a boot would cause that—I should say the inflammation was of about two days' standing, at any rate very short; I could not say the number of hours, I should say between one and two days—I have heard the evidence—I should think an injury inflicted on the 26th might have caused what I saw on the 28th—it would depend very much on the condition of the deceased, and the intensity of the inflammation—I should say she had been in a sickly state before.</p>

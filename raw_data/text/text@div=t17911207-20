               <p>I opened my brother's shop a little after seven, and was informed the lead was gone; I looked, and missed it; I took down the shop-window, and did the business as in general; I was informed of and saw the two prisoners go through Swan-yard with the lead, in flats, some in a basket and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070022"></xptr>open, and each man had a parcel; they were in company together, following each other; I pursued them; they went on their old course; I got a constable in two minutes after I had seen them go into an old-iron shop, in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields; the constable's name is Lawrence; we went in; one piece of lead was out on the counter, and the other on the ground; I charged the prisoners, and left the lead there while we took them to the watch-house, and came back for the lead, which Mr. Lawrence has had in his possession; I took home the pieces myself, and measured them, and found them exactly to correspond.</p>

Has he been sworn on the Old Testament? - Yes, I have: I live in Wheeler-street; I keep an old-iron shop, as they call it; but I deal in rags the most; the two prisoners brought some lead to me on a Wednesday morning, the 30th; I believe they were apprehended in my shop; they came together, and threw it down; as soon as I saw it, I told them it would not suit me; the prosecutor and another came in almost immediately, and took them into custody; they came back for the lead; I did not know the prisoners; I had not dealt with them before, to the best of my memory.</p>

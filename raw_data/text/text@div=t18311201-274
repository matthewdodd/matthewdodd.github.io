            . I am a Police-constable. I heard a noise, and hastened to the place; I heard the prisoner run up some steps a little way from the house - she said, "Oh God! I have lost my shoe;" she came running towards me; I had a lamp in front of me - I turned the light on, and saw one of her hands grasped; I caught at it, and, to the best of my belief, I heard three sovereigns fall - I then searched her, and found two half-crowns and three sixpences in her bosom; I searched the place and so did others, but we found no sovereigns; the prosecutor said,"That is the girl that robbed me of five sovereigns, two half-crowns, and three sixpences."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you, that he gave me two half-crowns and three sixpences? A. No, you never said any such thing; another officer found 8 1/2d. in her pocket.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had given her the money.</p>

            . I am Mr. Pearce's haybinder. On the 25th of March I bound thirty-one trusses of hay - I left them safe about half-past seven o'clock at night, next morning, about four o'clock, I missed five trusses. I know the prisoner - he is a hawker, and keeps a horse and cart. The hay was in a meadow. The rick was fenced round.</p>

            . I am a hawker, and live at Winchmore-hill. On the 26th of March I was coming up with a load of goods, between Gerrard's-cross and Beaconsfield, and met the prisoner, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, with five trusses of hay in his cart. I heard Pearce had lost some, and told him of it. He found his hay at the prisoner's house at Beaconsfield.</p>

On the 25th of March I saw the prisoner at Heston between three and four o'clock in the afternoon - I overtook him again between eight and nine o'clock that night, in the road leading from Heston to Harlington, and spoke to him, he had his cart with him; he was about two miles from Pearce's hay-rick, and was going towards Beaconsfield.</p>

             re-examined. Harlington is between Heston and Beaconsfield. On the 27th of March, in consequence of what I heard, I went to Beaconsfield with my haybinder and a constable, and found four of the trusses of hay in the prisoner's shed where his horse stood, the other was loose - the horse was eating part of it at the time; we took him into custody. He said he bought it at Croydon, in Surry. I am sure the hay is mine.</p>

               <p>JOHN ROBINS. I went to the prisoner's house, and found four trusses of hay, and part of a loose truss in his stable. It was my master's hay, and the same I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the hay.</p>

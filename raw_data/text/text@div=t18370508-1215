                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 67.) On the 10th of April, I was in Regent-street, City-road, at a quarter past nine o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner carrying something bulky on his shoulders, in a bag—I stopped him, and asked what it was—he said a piece of coal—I found it was lead—I asked where he brought it from—he said from Davies Wharf, out of a canal boat—I said what was the name of the boat, or the master—he did not know either—he said he was going to sell it, to get a little money—I went to the wharf, and found it had been taken from the roof—I compared it—it fitted exactly—here is 112<hi rend="italic">lbs</hi>. of it.</p>

            . I was not at home when the things were stole, but I know them to be mine; my wife made the child's frock: I bought the coral; it had E. C. on it. After the prisoner was taken up, I heard her before Justice Welch confess she came into my house (the sign of the Lemon-tree) for a dram, and asked the maid to let her go backwards: she took an opportunity to take the things out of the child's cradle.</p>

            . On the 20th of October, between 7 and 8 o'clock, the prisoner came into our house for a half pennyworth of gin; my servant served her: she asked to go backwards. The cradle was in the kitchen, which we are obliged to go through, to go into the yard: the things mentioned in the indictment were missing in a quarter of an hour after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrys. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner brought this frock, stay and coat, and offered to pledge them with me, and wanted 6 s. on them. I had reason to suspect her, from her answers to some questions. So I took her to Justice Welch's, where she confess where she had them.</p>

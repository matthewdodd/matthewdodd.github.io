            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty this evening at Kensington; I met the prisoner and two more men about two hundred yards this side of Kensington turnpike; the three men passed me. I thought I knew the prisoner; I said to my brother officer that was with me, there are three thieves going along the road; and before we crossed the road we saw a small cart walking by the side of a waggon. We followed the waggon. We saw the guard of the waggon; he said he had some suspicion they were going to rob the waggon. Just before they got into Kensington the cart stopped, and the waggon went on. I directly saw two of the men cross out of the foot-path; they went towards the cart; they had some little conversation. I said to Mills, there is something coming. I heard something coming through Kensington. He said he did; and as soon as ever the coach came by (it turned out to be the Exeter coach) the prisoner and the other man jumped from the cart when the coach past. The prisoner and the other man followed the coach as fast as they could run. They had not run far before one of the three men was up on the coach, in the boot; the other men were following. I heard something fall from the coach, where the men in the bottle-green coat was. I said to Miles, stop; he did. We board the parcel drop close to the wheel.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it - A. About ten minutes before seven o'clock. It was a wet night, dark, and not many people on the road. Directly I saw the prisoner pick up the parcel I jumped from the footpath and took him into custody. I said to him, I know you, none of your tricks, if you do I will cut your ear off. I directly drawed my cutlass. I took the prisoner into the Adam and Eve public-house; I searched him; he had a knife, one shilling, and a watch upon him. I left the prisoner in Miles's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What cart was it - A. A light jockey cart, with a very good horse indeed to it. I think we had some moon at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you saw somebody following the coach had you seen these three men together - A. Not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they get into the cart - A. No, they went and talked to the men in the cart. This is the parcel I took from the prisoner's shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Rees. Look at the parcel - A. This is the parcel I sent to Mr. Curtis, of Plymouth; they are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Brentford; that gentleman took me into custody. I was not in the coach, nor in the middle of the road, nor had I the parcel on my shoulder.</p>

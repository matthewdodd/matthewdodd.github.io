               <p>JAMES BLACKWELL sworn. - On the 5th of this month the prisoner came to my house and asked if two corporals lived there; I gave her for answer, no, there were not; she then went into the next house to enquire, and about five minutes after, my wife missed the things out of the parlour; I learned that she lived three doors from me; I went there to look for her, she was not in her room; I came down stairs, and as I was coming down I saw her conceal the property in question behind the water-tub; I then suffered her to pass me and go up stairs; I went into the yard and saw the property; I then went up stairs to her and asked her what things she had taken from my house; she said she had not taken any thing; I then said, what did you conceal behind the water tub; and then she begged I would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found them by the watertub, and I put them there again.</p>

On Sunday, the 4th of September, I was in company with a friend, in Gray's—I nn-lane, going towards Holborn, and saw the prisoner Frary—he came up, put out his hand, and said, "Halloo, old fellow, how do you do? we have met again"—I did not take his hand, but stepped off the curb for him to pass, and in doing so, he pulled my watch out—the prisoner Winter was with him—they were walking side by side—Frary ran away immediately with my watch, and Winter ran with him into Fox-court—my friend and I followed them—I stopped Frary, and my friend stopped Winter—they were taken to Grays—I nn-lane, and I gave them into custody to the officer—I am sure Frary took my watch—he had not got above three or four yards when I stopped him—we were immediately surrounded by girls of the town, and they had the opportunity of getting rid of the watch—it was silver, and had a key, a chain, and two seals—it was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the women came up before they were secured.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Chandler, in St. Paul's Church-yard: On the 22d of December, about half past four in the afternoon, I went out, to order some beer for some workmen, who were at that time in the house; on my return, as I passed the window, on the outside, I saw a piece of goods move out of the window; when I came in, I saw the prisoner take it off the iron rail, within the shop, and go off with it; he was in the inside of the shop; when I went out I shut the door: I immediately took him by the collar, with my right hand, and the goods in my left, and dragged him back into the counting-house, to Mr. Chandler.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt it is your master's property? - A. I can swear to the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You shut the door, as usual, when you went out? - A. Yes; I left it on the latch.</p>
               <p>Mrs. CHANDLER sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the prisoner open the door, take the cloth with his left hand, and put it under his right hand, and turn to get out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut then? - A. Yes; it was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what o'clock it was? - A. Yes; about half past four, the 22d of December.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

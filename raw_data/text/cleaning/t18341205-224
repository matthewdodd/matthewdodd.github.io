                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Kennerton-place, Knightsbridge. Between two and three o'clock on the morning of the 30th of November, I met the prisoner at Knightsbridge—we went as far as Park-lane, and into Brick-street—she took me into a passage—the policeman discovered us, and ordered us to move on, which we did—we went to Park-lane again, and she suddenly left me, saying, "Stop a mi<lb></lb>nute"—I felt, and missed my watch—I followed her, but did not over<lb></lb>take her—I saw a policeman, and told him—I went further, and met an<lb></lb>other policeman, who told me to go towards the Haymarket, which I did, but did not see her—I found her, on returning, in Vine-street station-house—I went there, described the watch, and it was produced—it was safe in my fob while I was walking with the prisoner.</p>

On the 30th of No<lb></lb>vember, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prosecu<lb></lb>tor in company with the prisoner, in a passage in Brick-street—I desired them to go away, and when I got to Down-street, I saw the prosecutor running—he made a complaint to me, and I gave information to different policemen—I saw the prisoner in custody afterwards—I am positive she is the woman I had seen with Maddox—she walked down Piccadilly between me and another constable, towards the station-house—she staggered to<lb></lb>wards the other constable, and threw her hand towards the rails, as if she was throwing something—I said, "You have thrown something away, stop"—she pretended to faint, and laid hold of the rails—I found a watch inside the rails of Burlington-house, wrapped up in this handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to my brother, John London, living in Crawford-street. On the morning of the 7th of January, Harcourt and. Flannigan came into his shop, Nos. 11 and 12, Edgeware-road, in the parish of St. Marylebone, between nine and ten o'clock—they asked to look at some Guernsey shirts, but did not buy any—I saw Harcourt look at the skylight, and appear to make observations—I paid particular attention to them—the skylight is over the shop—there is an open space, where there is a casement, and any one by taking out a pane might put in their hand and open the skylight—about nine o'clock, the same evening, I saw Harcourt, Flannigan, and Gardner, in front of the shop, looking in at the window—they did not stay a moment after they saw me looking at them, and I had seen Gardner outside in the morning when the other two were in the shop—when I looked out after them they were all gone—Gardner appeared as if he had been waiting for them—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in silver and copper, in a drawer in my shop—there was some silver bent—some was brown, of a darkish colour, which I have no doubt were the same as these—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—we shut up between nine o'clock and half-past that night—the skylight was then safe—I did not leave the shop till towards ten o'clock—I live in the house, for my brother—it is his house—he has no partner—he does not live there—while I was in bed, the next morning, a young man came and gave me some information—I got up, went down, and saw the shop—I saw the furs which had been in a back-room were in a disturbed state—they were then lying on the foot of a ladder, which had been put up to the skylight—the skylight was open a little, and a pane of glass had been cut out—I went to the till, and the money was gone—there was about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper, and the half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences were gone—I went to the window, and found four lengths of velvet, six silk handkerchiefs, three scarfs, a chinelle shawl, and some other little things, which had been safe the night before—upon that, I gave information to the police, told him the description of the money I had lost, and the men whom I sus<lb></lb>pected—in the course of the morning 1 stood in the shop, and saw</p>

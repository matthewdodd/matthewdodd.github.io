Field's and Brown's chambers; I went into the shop to enquire for him; and in consequence, I went after him; but however, I did not see him till I saw him at the Stamp-office; on seeing me, he immediately ran out; I followed him; and as soon as he got to the top of the steps in Somerset-house-square, he turned round, and asked me if I was following him? on which I answered I was not; after that he went up to the gate that leads into the Strand, and came and asked me which was the way to the Strand? I informed him it was on the left hand; he walked a few yards on this side of the way, and then crossed over, and went through several courts, and enquired for somebody at one or two places; I proceeded, and never lost sight of him; he turned round several times to ask me if I was following him? I said not; in a court leading to Clare-street, he turned round, and said he would knock me down; upon that, I desired several people to lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Now, I would ask you whether the prisoner is the same person you saw on the 9th of January, at the Stamp-office? - It certainly was; I have no doubt about it; not the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. What time of the evening was it that the young man came to your shop? - About seven o'clock on the 9th of January.</p>
               <p>It was candle-light? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Was your shop a shop of considerable custom? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>How long after this was it, before he was apprehended? - It was about the beginning of March, or the latter end of February, that he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>And this person had not been in custody till then? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him all this time? - No.</p>
               <p>There are a great many young men who are clerks to attorneys? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You attended at the lord mayor's when this young man was taken: did you point to a young man who was clerk to the sitting alderman then? - I did not.</p>
               <p>I ask you whether he did not go voluntarily to the office? - Yes, he did, very quietly.</p>
               <p>I do not know whether it has happened to you, as it has to me this afternoon, that you have taken one person for another? - I might have done so; but I am certain as to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. On your cross-examination, you said he went quietly: what day was this? - On the day he went to the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>On that day he was taken; was he taken to your shop? - He was.</p>
               <p>Jury to the witness. You have told us that the prisoner came out of the Stamp-office, and asked you the way to the Strand; and that you followed him? - In Clare-street there are two courts; from Clare-street he went through the market; and was going into Vere-street; he was going to turn towards the dead wall, but did not go; he did partly go, but returned; he went afterwards up a court, and then he returned from that court into Clare-street, and went through Clare-street quite into Vere-street, through the market; on this side of the market, which leads to Wild-street.</p>

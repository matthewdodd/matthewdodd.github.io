                  </hi> I live at the King's Arms at Fulham. Before the 25th Jan. I had a snuff-box, a seal, and a watch key in my bar—I afterwards missed them—the box and seal were in a desk in my bar, which was broken open—on the morning of the 25th Jan., about eight o'clock, I found the bar had been entered by turning the screw of the box which the lock shot into—I had locked the house up safe the night before, from half-past twelve to a quarter to one o'clock—on the morning of 2nd March, I was called up by my horse-keeper, about a quarter before seven o'clock—I came down to my tap-room, and sent for the police-constable—I saw the prisoner there appa<lb></lb>rently half asleep, as if he had been intoxicated—I gave him into custody—under his feet was this snuff-box, which I lost on the 25th of Jan.—it could not have remained in the place where I saw it all that time—I also lost some French coins and various articles beside—nothing was found but this snuff-box, a watch-key, and a seal, which was on the prisoner's person—the prisoner owned the seal himself, he said it was his—a knife of the pri<lb></lb> soner's</p>

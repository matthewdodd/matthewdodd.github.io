                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of 192, Piccadilly, in the parish of St. James, Westminster—it is my dwelling-house—I have employed Lovell on three or four occasions to clean out my shop after the hours of business—I employed him on 21st Jan., as near as I can tell, up to ten o'clock, or a quarter past—he came after business hours; the shutters were up, and he came in at the private door—I left the shop, and went up<lb></lb>stairs—I came down about every quarter of an hour, to see how he was getting on—I noticed that he ought to have cleaned under the door first, as I did not like the door open late, and he said he would do it directly—I came down about ten, he said he had done—he then advanced towards the shop door, which opens into the street, and moved the three bolts—I believed he fastened it—if I had not thought so I should have tried it myself—I then said, "You must come out by this door," the passage door, and I locked if, and took the key to my bed-room—I was called about five in the morning, and found the shop door open—my desk in the shop was broken open, and my cash-box, which was safe at a quarter-past nine the night before, was gone—I saw it at a quarter-past nine, and when I let the prisoner out at ten I tried the desk, and it was locked—there were two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, about thirty-two</p>

               <p>sovereigns, and other money and papers in the cash-box—under the desk I found this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was present when Cronin searched the shop, and saw him find some lucifer-matches and the remains of a taper that had been burnt—some hours after, I found in the shutter-box, under the counter, a filthy handkerchief, and marked with blood—there were also marks of urine about the shop—there is room in that place for any one to have lain down—I went in myself—it is the length of the shutters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother. I never saw this chisel before (<hi rend="italic">looking at the one found in the prosecutor's shop</hi>)—I never had it in my hand—one of the gentlemen had something in his hand when he came to our house, but I did not handle it, or look at it—I cannot swear whether it was this—my son lives with me—on my oath, I never, to my knowledge, saw either of the other prisoners—I can neither read nor write; my husband can, but we have very little of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your husband is a labourer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I recollect the morning the gentlemen and the policeman came to my house—my son had been gone out a very few minutes then, and he came in a short time after—I told him the policeman had been, and he went down immediately—we occupy the first floor—we sleep in the same room—my son came home in the evening, and was in bed before eleven o'clock—I was then in bed; my husband was going to bed—on my solemn oath he did not leave the room again till a few minutes before the policeman came—we have lived in the house nine years—my son can read, but not write.</p>

                  </hi>. I believe I am the prisoner's father. The prosecutor called at my place on 21st Jan.—I cannot say whether Cronin is the officer who was with him—I am a builder's labourer—I do not use such tools as this chisel; I never used that, to my knowledge—I cannot say whose it is—I never had such in my possession, I am positive—to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge I never saw it before you handed it to me—I can read and write a little—my son went to school—he can read a little, but I never saw him write—I told him the gentleman and a policeman had been inquiring for him, I sup<lb></lb>posed there was something amiss, and he went off to the place directly—the night before, he came in at about a quarter to eleven—the bed-room door was bolted or locked in the night—I went to Marlborough-street, and they would not allow me to go before the Magistrate—they <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me out, and would not hear what I had to say,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Which day did you go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Last Monday; I did not go before that—my son went out at six o'clock on the morning he was taken—he had not been gone more than a quarter of an hour when the gen<lb></lb>tleman and police came—I told the gentleman and policeman, if they had any doubt, to search my place; and I handed them my tool-basket, and they would not have it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turner, and live at 4, Hopkin-street; I have lived there twenty-eight years. I have known Lovell since he was a boy—there is not a young man in the parish who has got a better character for honesty and sobriety.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know him in Mr. Cummings' employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he was something in the bricklayer's trade—he lived at 10, Peter-street, within twenty yards of me—I have been there—I am not aware that he can write.</p>
               <p>(William Mitchell and John Casey also gave Lovell a good character; but the officers, West, Brown, and Cronin deposed to his being the associate of thieves.)</p>

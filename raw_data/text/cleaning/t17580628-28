               <p>Parry. Mr. Cruchfield belongs to a club at my house, Mr. Hall I do not know, the prisoner gave me the order, and I gave him a glass of wine, he bid me get a bill ready wrote for the wine and bottles, but said he should bring the hamper back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prepare the bills?</p>
               <p>Parry. I did, and charged for bottles and wine. He said he would go and get a cart from Bartholomew-close, and come and take it away. He was gone not a quarter of an hour, and came back again, and said he wanted six or seven shillings to give Mr. Jefford change, at the Blue-Boar in Cannon-street. I opened the till, and gave him 8 s. After I found he did not come according to his time, I went to Mr. Jefford to know if any such person called there. I was informed no such person had been there. Since that, I was coming down Holbourn, there I saw a mob of people, in the midst of whom I saw the prisoner, he was taken up for defrauding another vintner. I asked him if he did not remember his coming to me with such a pretence, and his getting 8 s. of me; he owned that he had the money, but said he did not rob me of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shew'd him no paper; I ask'd him to lend me 8 s. and he lent it me.</p>
               <p>Parry. He came with a paper when he gave me the order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before ?</p>
               <p>Parry. I never saw him before that time to my knowledge? that order I found to be entirely false.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I have no friend within one hundred and forty miles of this place; I only borrow'd the money, and he lent it me out of his pocket. I once was coachman to this Mr. Hall, but have been out of place about a year and a half.  <rs id="t17580628-28-verdict155" type="verdictDescription">

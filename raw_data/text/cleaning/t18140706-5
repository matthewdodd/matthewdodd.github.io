In the morning, she was gone. It is very easy for her to have got out of the house, as the door was only upon the latch. I had not tried the door to see whether the latch had catched or not. On the 8th, I met the prisoner. I saw some of the articles at the Horse and Leaping-bar, Whitechapel; they were in the servant's possession of that house. I only found part of my things.</p>

After I carried her the beer, she had the bundle open; I saw a shift and apron; she was shewing them to a young woman in the taproom, asking her to buy them. I gave her three shilling for the apron, and eighteen pence for the shift. I delivered them to Coombes, the officer.

The prisoner lodged with me - he did not pay his rent regurlarly; I applied for it several times - it was about 8l.; and on the 14th of June he gave me this bill to get discounted to pay my rent and give him the difference - I endorsed it, and got it discounted at Henry Hodson's, in New Church-street - I paid 5s. for the discount, and paid the prisoner 7l. 2s. 6d.; on its becoming due, it was returned to me as dishonoured; I paid it - the prisoner had then removed to Mr. Clark's, at Kilburn; he had remained five weeks with me after paying me the bill.</p>

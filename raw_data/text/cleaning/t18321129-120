Last Tuesday, the 27th of November, I left the kitchen about ten o'clock, and went up stairs - I left six silver spoons on the dresser - they could be seen from the street; I was absent two minutes; a young woman then knocked at the door - I went to it; she gave me information, and pointed out a person - I ran across the street, and called Stop thief! I followed him, and got within a yard of him, but did not see his face; he was the same height as the prisoner - he threw six spoons into a potatoe-warehouse in Kenton-street - the man's figure was the same as the prisoner's, and he was dressed as the prisoner was at the office - I saw him at the office at twelve o'clock - I went into the potatoe-shop; a young woman picked up the spoons; I knew them to be master's - our area gate was locked.</p>

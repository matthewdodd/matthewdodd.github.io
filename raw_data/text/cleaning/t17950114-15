               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar your servant or apprentice? - No, I never knew him; I never knew of the loss of the cloth till I heard of it; I lost it from my war house.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it before it was stole? - I cannot recollect having seen it for some time; it has my mark and stamp on it, and it appears by my book that I never sold that piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Your servant might have sold it in your absence? - It is regular to enter every thing sold in the book.</p>

               <p>Last Thursday morning, about half after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in company with two more, looking into different warehouses in Basinghall-street, looking into windows and door ways; I perceived the prisoner at the bar to open the door of Mr. Andrews's warehouse, and walked in; I see him go in, and had suspicion he was going to bring something out; I went after a constable; returning back I see Prior, the officer, with the prisoner, and the property under his arm in the street.</p>

               <p>I have got a piece of cloth, the prisoner brought it out of Mr. Andrews's warehouse; I was on the opposite side of the way, I saw him come out of the door with it; I detected him within ten yards of Mr. Andrews's warehouse; he said, if I would forgive him, he would not do so any more.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That piece is my property, I know it from a seal that it has, and the character of the cost price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark it yourself? - No, it has a leaden stamp with -</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt of its being your property? - No, none in the least.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who said, his father was a coach-maker, he had been to sea, and was now with his father, and they knew nothing but honestly by him.</p>

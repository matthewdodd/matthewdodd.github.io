                  </hi>. I am a constable of Woolwich. On Wednesday morning, the 11th of October, from information I received, about six I o'clock, I went to Plumstead Manor-way, in Kent, and saw the prisoner Smith nearly at the bottom of what they call the short Manor-way, stand<lb></lb>ing alongside a brown gelding—I clapped my hand on his shoulder, and told him to consider himself my prisoner—he said he was very glad of it—I conveyed him to the cage, and have had the horse in my possession ever since—it is here now—it has been claimed by Lewis, of Woolwich.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shepherd. I saw the prisoner Smith on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 11th, coming along the top of Mr. Lewis's marsh—Edward Mears was with me—Smith had a brown gelding with him, with a halter, leading it—he came as far as the gate, which he opened, and led the horse into the Manor-way—he turned round and shut the gate after him—he walked a few yards with the horse into the Manor-way, and there stopped awhile, he then turned the horse round and opened the gate again, led the horse into the marsh, and shut the gate after him—he waited awhile, and then opened the gate again, came out, and shut it after him—he came a little way along the Manor-way, and stopped there till the officer Cook went up and took him prisoner—I think he saw me, for I was standing nearly in front of him—I think he saw me and my companion after he first came to the gate—when I first saw him come out of the gate it was about half-past six o'clock in the mornings—it was Mr. Lewis's horse—I am acquainted with the marsh, and am frequently down there, I and Lewis had asked me to look after his horse.</p>

On Monday, 22nd May, about noon, I went with four other officers to the second-floor of No. I, New-court, Great Wild-street, Drury-lane—I directed Hughes to remain in the court, to stand by the door under the second-floor window—he would command a view of that win<lb></lb>dow—the street-door was open—we went up to the second-floor room, and com<lb></lb>menced battering the door, which was strongly barricaded—there was a door nailed to the usual door with large spikes, to make it thicker and more dif<lb></lb>ficult to enter, and against that door these large pieces of wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to go from the door to the wall on the other side—after considerable difficulty we got in, and Neville and Swanson secured the prisoners, who were in the room—Thomas was standing with his shirt-sleeves tucked up above his elbows, and a frying-pan in his hand—Sarah was standing close to the win<lb></lb>dow, which was open—there is but one room on a floor—before we got in I heard a noise resembling the breaking of glass, and ordered Harvey to go down in the court to Hughes, whom I had left there to watch—on entering the room I observed this earthenware pipkin on a clear fire with white metal in it, which had been recently upset, with the metal pouring from it through the fire—I saw a tub containing water, which I immediately emptied on the fire—I then commenced picking up the metal which poured through the fire—this is it—I believe it is Britannia metal—on the hob I saw an iron pot which contained metal, not in a fluid state but quite hot, I could hardly bold the spoon—it appears to have been melted, but left there to cool—under the stove I found another iron spoon, and this knife on a table close to the fire, with plaster of Paris adhering to one of the blades, and on the same table a pair of scissors and two files, one of them with white metal in its teeth—on a shelf in the room I found a quantity of copper wire, having a silvery appearance, as if used in the galvanic battery; and under the table three tin bands for forming plaster of Paris moulds, with plaster adhering to them—I searched Thomas, and found in his right breeches pocket three good shillings</p>

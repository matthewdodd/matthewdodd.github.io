On the evening of the 19th of November, an opposite neighbour sent a young man to say there were three suspicious characters about our door - I took my hat and went to the opposite side of the way, and saw the three prisoners all go to the shop - they each of them took hold of a piece of woollen cloth and moved it - they then stood about three quarters of an hour, watching the movements of the persons in the shop; I then saw Warren go in, and take hold of the cloth; I ran over, and he dropped it close to the door; I seized him and Le Count, and took them into the shop; the officer brought in the other; when Warren took the cloth the other two were at the window, and holding up their fingers, as signals.</p>

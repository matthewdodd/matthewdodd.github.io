            . I ask'd him how he came up without a candle? he made but very little answer; I told him he came of no good design; he went away, and pretended to go down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who it was ?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I did by his tongue, it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with him before?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I was but little acquainted with him; the next morning I got up and missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him go down stairs?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I cannot say I did; he seemed to attempt to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your room-door fastened?</p>
               <p>Tompson. No, I was oblig'd to leave it open on account of the boy that was not come to bed, that lay in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your watch when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I hung it on a nail by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Tompson. It was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you before you fell asleep after you spoke to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I do not know; I am a dray-man, and our business is very laborious, so that we soon fall asleep after we get to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake in the morning?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I awak'd about 8 o'clock, then I missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the alehouse boy lie in the same bed with you?</p>
               <p>Tompson. He lay in the same room, but not in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Which got up first, the boy or you?</p>
               <p>Tompson. The boy did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I had a mistrust of the prisoner, because there had been a watch lost in the next room to where I lie, and he was suspected of having that. I got a warrant of Mr. Fielding, and went and took him in his lodgings in Eagle-street, Piccadilly. I took him by the collar, and charg'd him with taking my watch, and he own'd directly he had it, it was in his bed, he took it out, and delivered it to me, (produced in court and deposed to.) I asked him how he came by it, he said he gave a guinea for it; I asked him who he bought it of, he said of a man, his name was Davey.</p>

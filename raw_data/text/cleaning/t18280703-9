On Monday last, at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I went out for about five minutes, and as I came back I met the prisoner coming out of the shop door with these handkerchiefs open in his hand - I gave an alarm, and attempted to take them from him; he avoided me - I cried Stop thief! and ran after him for some yards; he was so closely pursued, he threw them down - a neighbour named Chapel picked them up. and gave them to me; Hall stopped the prisoner - I had seen them safe a few minutes before; there are three pieces and three loose ones, twenty-seven handkerchiefs in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He brought them out exposed in his hand? A. Yes; the prosecutrixs are not here - I have lived with them twenty-five years; the premises are their joint freehold - the handkerchiefs are worth 5l. 8s.; they cost that - I know the value is deteriorated lately, but they are worth that - I cannot say what they weigh; some of them are India - they sell for 7s. each; the British are from 6s. to 7s. 6d. each - we get about 1s. on each; these were bought since the fall - tolerably good handkerchiefs are sold at 28s. a piece, but not like these.</p>

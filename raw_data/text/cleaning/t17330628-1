I shew'd him two that were very heavy. He seem'd to be well pleas'd with them, and call'd for Pen and Ink to set down the Weight and Value. I began to suspect that he wanted to make off, and I happen'd to think right, for he took up the two Rings and ran out; I follow'd, as well as the Gout would let me, and cry'd, Stop Thief! He was soon seiz'd, and when I came up to him he had the two Rings in his Hand, and I took them out my self.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had bought a Rings of the Prosecutor some time before, and I afterwards found that he had charged me 5 s. more than they were worth, and so because I would not be cheated again, I took these two Rings to shew to a Friend before I paid for them.</p>

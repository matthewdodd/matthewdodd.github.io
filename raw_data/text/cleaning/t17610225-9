            . I live in Long-acre; I was informed by one of my servants that there had been some worsted offered to sale under the real value, and it was imagined it was stolen: as soon as I saw it, I thought it was of my own work (I manufacture in a different way from any in London) I did not then consider I has sold such to Mr. Bluck: it was not the prisoner that brought it, but another woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here?</p>
               <p>Soley. I believe not. I took her to justice Welch, and she said she had it to dispose of for another woman she took me to the prisoner, who was then in Swallow-street. I asked the prisoner if that worsted was her property: she said it was. (Produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe this worsted to be my property, I bought it of Mr. Soley: the prisoner said before justice Welch she did not steal it, but said she found it about the middle of Drury-lane: but afterwards she confessed she stole it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dison. The prisoner and another woman came to sell two bundles of worsted where I lately carried on business; I was then in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it offered to sell to?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dison. To my successor; she said she took it for a debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this bundle produced here one of them?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dison. No, it was not; one of them was green, the other scarlet. Justice Welch sent to me, and desired I would attend her second examination; and in my hearing she confessed she stole it from her master Bluck's shop at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bundles was she charged with stealing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dison. She was charged with stealing three.</p>

I apprehended George about ten minutes before one o'clock on the morning of the 27th of October, in Albion-street, Commercial-road; I found a silver watch, six silver teaspoons, 9s., a 10l. note, and a 5l. note on him - all the property but the notes were in his pockets; he said the watch was his own, and that he found the spoons - he had something clenched in his left-hand; I asked what it was - he said only a piece of paper, but it turned out to be the two Bank notes; he afterwards said he had found all the property together in Finsbury-square, watch and all - there was a half-crown, and a sixpence among the silver.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Burton in Eagle-place - he is a chair-maker; I know Hamstead, but not the other. On Friday evening, the 26th of October, about five minutes to eight o'clock, I was there, and four persons came into the shop between five and six- our shop is about four doors from Robinson's; it was George, Hamstead, Buce, and Dennis - Buce and Dennis are neighbours; they generally came there to see us work; Buce and Dennis went back into the yard; the prisoners remained in the shop - master has only a yard behind the house; Dennis came out of the yard in about a quarter of an hour - I did not see Buce again; Dennis had something in his hand when he came back, I could not tell what it was; whatever he had, he must have left in the shop, for he took nothing out with him; he joined the prisoners, and they all three went out together: in about a quarter of an hour, master came in, and ordered them out, and as George went out, he threw a bundle of shoes under the bench, and left them there - they were translated shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you worked for your master? A.

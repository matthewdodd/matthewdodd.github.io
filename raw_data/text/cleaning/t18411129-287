                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Limperani; we live in Albany-road, Camberwell. On the 12th of November, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I was going home with my daughter from Walworth-gate —I got to the corner of Albany-road, between the wall and the Watch-box, exactly at the angle of the road, I felt the proximity of three young men who had been following us—I felt myself touched, and one of the men immediately passed me—seeing him put his left-hand into his pocket, and connecting that with having been touched, I put my own hand into my pocket, and immediately missed my purse—I saw a man pass me who I thought had put his hand into my pocket—I told my daugh<lb></lb>ter I had been robbed, and my purse was gone—a policeman being in the immediate vicinity I gave information immediately—the man who passed me, and put his hand into his pocket had on a brown Taglioni coat, with pockets in front—I lost a purse containing, as nearly as I can recollect, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—next morning the prisoner was produced to me—from his personal appearance he bears a resemblance to one of the three men who were there—I did not turn my head to look in his face—I had got change from Mr. Townsend, and one of the shillings was excessively black between the head and the rim—I have since seen one which I believe to be that—to the best of my belief this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a shilling</hi>)—the purse has not been found—this shilling is the only one I can identify.</p>

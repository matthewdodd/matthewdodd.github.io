About four in the afternoon of the 8th of September the prisoner came and asked if I could kill ten sheep, for Mr. Hill, of Newgate-market—he said they were coming from Barnet, and he had to go on the road to meet them—he did not know what time they would come—he asked if I could kill them that evening—I said yes, if they came in soon—he came again about</p>

On the 12th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, to look at some prints, and another woman to look at a shawl; my fellow shopman attended to them; some other persons came in for muslin, to whom I attended; the prisoner left the shop - I thought some things were missing, and that they were all concerned - I went out, and took the prisoner, about five or six yards off, and brought her back; she asked what she had done - I said I thought she had got a piece of print; she made no reply, but these two pieces of print fell from her; the other three persons were in the shop, but not near enough to drop them.</p>

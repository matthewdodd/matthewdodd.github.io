                  </hi>. I am a druggist, and live in Gloucester-terrace East, Commercial-road. On the 4th of Oct., between one and two o'clock at night, I was going home—I was sober—I had been drinking—I was knocked down by the prisoner and another person running violently against me, and jost<lb></lb>ling me—I put my hand to my waistcoat-pocket, to save my watch—it was immediately dragged from my neck by one of the parties—I got up and ran towards my own house, immediately returned, went across the road, and the prisoner, who is the person who took my watch, was secured—I did not lose sight of him till he was apprehended—the other escaped.</p>

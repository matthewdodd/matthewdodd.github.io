                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Clare-market. About four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 20th of February, I saw the prisoner come to the door—he looked through the window, put his hand inside the door-way, untwisted this pair of boots off the nail, put them together, and ran away—I pursued him into the market—he ran into Bear-yard into a public-house, and into Vere-street—the officer and I took him to<lb></lb>gether—he had thrown down the boots, and my apprentice took them up—I am positive he is the person who took them—I had watched him about the door for several days.</p>

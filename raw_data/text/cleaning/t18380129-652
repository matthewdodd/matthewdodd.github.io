                  </hi>. I live in Red-cross-alley, in the Borough, in the parish of St. George-the-martyr. I remember the day after Christmas-day—I was in the court about a quarter to eight o'clock that evening, and saw the prisoner Bryan—he lives in the parish—I saw him when he first came into the court—he came by himself—his wife had come before him—I knew the deceased John Bryan, and had lived three years next door to him—he had a brother named <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan—there had been a quarrel that even<lb></lb>ing between <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan and the prisoner Thomas Bryan, and blows passed between them—that was at a quarter to eight o'clock—a very few words passed between them, and then the blows took place—the women inter<lb></lb>fered when they were fighting, and took <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> into the deceased's house, and after that the prisoner, Thomas Bryan, went away from the court—he did not say any thing when he went away—he was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—the court was quiet while he was gone—there was no disturbance then—neither of the Mahoneys were present at the first quarrel—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Thomas Bryan came back and the two Mahoneys with him—Daniel Mahoney was in his shirt sleeves, and I think Patrick had his jacket off—Daniel is the son of the other—I did not see any thing in either of their hands at all—when they came, Thomas Bryan said, "Where is <hi rend="italic">e'er</hi> a b—Bryan now? I am not alone now"—he said to the elder Mahoney, "Never mind, <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290189"></xptr>
               <p>(that means a person who has stood godfather to a child)—Mahoney said he had been listening for a long time, and did not know that Bryan, his <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>, was concerned in it, or he would have come—(I had told Bryan's wife to go home before that)—I said, "There is no Bryan here to answer you"—Thomas Bryan said, "Never mind, <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>, I shall see John the <hi rend="italic">Iron</hi>, either over the bridge or on this side the bridge"—(the deceased was called John the <hi rend="italic">Iron</hi>—he worked at Mr. Alderman Thompson's iron-wharf)—Thomas Bryan then said, "Never mind, <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>, if I do not see him to-night, or any of the Bryans, I shall meet them over the bridge to-morrow, or on this side the bridge, or any of his brothers, I don't care which it is, and I will give them blood to drink, or they shall give it to me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any appearance of any of the Bryans out in the court at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the prisoners then went away—they went the same way as they came—after they were gone, <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan, the deceased's bro<lb></lb>ther, came out of his house into the court, and asked who was looking for him—upon which the two Mahoneys returned, but not Thomas Bryan—the two Mahoneys came right up to my door—<hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan was standing under the lamp at my door—the elder Mahoney (Patrick) came up, and shook hands with him very heartily under the lamp by my door, and asked him how he did—young Mahoney (Daniel) also came up the court, but I did not hear him say any thing—a young man named Reardon also came up the court, and tome others whom I did not know—they went two doors from my house—I did not hear the deceased's wife call out after that—I heard nothing; but I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> between <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan and some of the women, at the second door to me where they had gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear anybody, on the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> taking place, call out for the de<lb></lb>ceased to come out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear him called out myself, but I saw him come out of his brother Patrick's house—not out of his own house—(<hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> had been in that house) before that the deceased had come out of his own house with his child in his arms, and took the child to his brother Patrick's house; and when he was called, he came out of his brother Pa<lb></lb>trick's house, which is four doors from his own house—I did not hear him called—when he came out of his brother's he went into his own house, and came out again—he hardly staid a minute in his own house—when he came out he went down to where the mob was—where the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was going on—it was in the same court—Redcross-alley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see what he did when be went down there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard him saying, "In the name of God, what do you all want here?" and I saw no more of him till they dragged <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan away from the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—pre<lb></lb>sently I saw a kind of clearance, and they dragged <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan into the deceased's house—I then saw the deceased on the ground, and noticed a great quantity of blood come from his head—I did not see any blow struck myself—Mrs. Grant and Michael Bryan went to pick him up—Michael Bryan is no relation to him, nor to the prisoner Bryan.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many Bryant live in that court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are three brothers and a nephew—I cannot say whether the prisoner Thomas Bryan was the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290192"></xptr>
               <p>worse for liquor—I cannot say that he was much—it was Boxing night—Thomas Bryan went away with the Mahoneys, not by himself, when they first left—I do not know that <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan was taken down the court by the deceased's nephew—I am quite sure about the words Thomas Bryan used when he came back with the Mahoneys—, he called out whether there is ever a Bryan here; and said, "If I was alone a while ago, I am not alone now;" and Mr. Mahoney said, "I have heard the disturbance a long time, and little did I think it was you there, or I would have been here before now and cleared the court"—he said, "Never mind, as we cannot find <hi rend="italic">e'er</hi> a Bryan now, I shall find him to-morrow, or either of the brothers, I don't care which it is; I shall give him blood to drink, or he shall give it to me"—the deceased had come out of his own house first with the child, and took it to his brother's house; but when he was called out he brought the child back to his own house, left it there, and went down the court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What became of you when you heard him say, "In the name of God, what do you all want here?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stood at my own door, which is not within four doors of them—I could not see what was going on—it was very dark, and I was very ill—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> seemingly at the bottom of the court—there were a good many people there—there were none of the other Bryans there, that I could see, but <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the deceased came out of his house, and went down to the bottom of the court, how many Bryans were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Jerry and his wife—there was no other Bryan that I could see, only Thomas Bryan—I did not see whether the deceased did any thing, when he said, "What in the name of God do you all want here?"—it was too dark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am going on for eleven years old, and live with my mother in Redcross-alley. I remember last Boxing night—I was standing in the alley, on the railing, about eight o'clock in the evening—I saw the two Mahoneys in the alley—I think they were in their shirt-sleeves—I saw them when they first came up the court—I did not see Thomas Bryan with them—the court was quiet when they came in—<hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan and Tho<lb></lb>mas Bryan had been quarrelling before this, but <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> had gone into his house, and Thomas Bryan had gone out of the court—he did not live in the court—I did not hear either of the Mahoneys say any thing when they came into the court, but I afterward saw young Mahoney with a poker hitting the deceased, John Bryan—I did not see him with the poker when he came into the court—I do not know whether he had it or not when I first saw him—I knew the deceased—I saw him come into the court—he came out of his brother's house—he came out of his own house first, with his little boy, and went into his brother's house with it—about a quarter of an hour after I saw him come out of his brother's house with the child in his arms, and go into his own house with the child—I did not see him come out of to his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290193"></xptr>
               <p>own house again, but I saw him afterwards in the court, near his own house—I had not heard anybody call before be came out, nor before I saw him standing in the court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he do after you saw him standing near his own house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard him say to Thomas Bryan's wife, "You had better go home in peace," as <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Bryan's wife was quarrelling with the deceased's wife—the Mahoneys were not there then—they had not returned—(they bad come up once in their shirt-sleeves, and gone away again)—I did not see the deceased do any thing after the Mahoneys came up the second time—I saw him in the court—I saw young Mahoney come up the court with a poker—the deceased was in his own house then, smoking hit pipe—it was after that he came out with his child, and went back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see either of the Mahoneys do any thing to the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I saw the youngest one (Daniel) hit him on the shoulder with the poker—it made him stagger a little, and I saw him (Daniel) hit him twice more on the head with the poker—he then fell—he was close by the railing at that time, and I was standing over him at the tine he was struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before young Mahoney struck the deceased, did the deceased strike him, or attempt to do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not see it—I do not think he could have done it without my seeing him, where I was—I did not hear them say any thing to each other before the blows wore struck—the deceased had no hat on—he had what is called a <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> cap, which fits close to the head—old Mahoney was standing by while the deceased was being knocked down; and after he was down he came and kicked him—he was about as far from the deceased at the time he was knocked down as I am from you—(<hi rend="italic">about six yards</hi>)—I did not hear him say any thing at the time the deceased was being knocked down—he kicked him twice after he was down—he kicked him once first; then his wife, who was among the women, came and kicked him; and then he kicked him again—he caught hold of his wife's clothes, and kicked him—I did not see in what part of his body he kicked him—the deceased had his cap on while he was on the ground, and he had his hands over his head—I did not notice either time where he was kicked—they were not very hard kicks—I did not see any more of the Mahoneys after that, for they ran away—I did not see any policeman come—I hallooed out "Murder!" and the Mahoneys ran away—Mrs. Williams was at her win<lb></lb>dow at the same time, and she called "Murder" also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a dark night or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The lamps were lighted—they are gas lamps, but there were a <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> of women and men, and they took the light away—the lamps did not give much light where this took place—there was light enough for me to be sure that young Mahoney knocked the deceased down with the poker, and old Mahoney kicked him—I saw them quite plain—I did not notice what was done with the poker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did the deceased come from at the time you lay young Mahoney struck him with the poker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came out of his own house, and was going into his brother's house—he did not come from the bottom of the court where the disturbance was—he came out of his own house—I was standing on the railing, and stood over the deceased when he was struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you stood over him, why could you not see where he was kicked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was dark down there—it was more dark on the ground than in any other part—persons were standing between the lamp and young Ma<lb></lb>honey,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290194"></xptr>
               <p>and that made it dark—I had been standing on the railing almost half an hour—I did not see the deceased come out of his own house, and go down the court where the quarrel was—I was before the Coroner at the first examination—I was not sworn the first day—I was not asked any questions the first day, because I did not know the Lord's Prayer—a Ca<lb></lb>tholic priest gave me instructions, and then I was sworn—I could not say the Lord's Prayer the first day, and I was taught it by the priest—I was never before a Magistrate in my life before—I did not hear any one say, "Will you see your mother struck?"—a person named Mary Ann Bryan was in the court—she lives at No. 6—she is no relation of the deceased—his wife's name is <hi rend="italic">Peggy</hi>, I believe—old Mahoney did not say or do any thing while his son struck the blows—he was near to the dark part of the court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he pulled his wife by the gown, are you quite sure he did not stumble over the man, and kick him by accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he stooped his head—he kicked him about the head, I dare say, for he kicked towards his head, but it was so dark I cannot tell where it was exactly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There were people between where you stood, and the gas-light? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and that made it dark on the ground—I could see the faces of the people, but it was dark on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Red Cross-alley. I knew the deceased John Bryan, but am not related to him. About eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, on boxing-day, I was at my own door, in the court, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner Thomas Bryan there—I heard him inquiring for John Bryan, or any of the Bryans, and he said he would serve them so and so; that he would jump on any of the Bryans in the court, and if he did not catch them then he would have John Bryan as he was going backwards and forwards on London-bridge to his work, (the deceased used to go over the bridge to work,) and he said if he did not have help then he would go and bring help, that he would bring his <hi rend="italic">gossips</hi> from the Back-alley—the Mahoneys—I have been told that the Mahoneys do live in Back-alley—Thomas Bryan then went away, and was gone for a quarter of an hour or better—I did not see him return with the two Mahoneys—I know <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan, the de<lb></lb>ceased's brother—I did not see him come out of the house, but he was at the bottom of the court, and was rather in liquor, and a great many women had a quarrel down at the bottom of the court—I did not see the deceased there—he was next door to me, at his brother's house—I saw him come out, with his child in his arms—I do not know what made him come out—at this time the two Mahoneys were down by his house—I followed him down the court—he put his child in doors, came out, and advised the Mahoneys to go home, and to take no notice of women's quarrels; as they had begun it, to let them finish it betwixt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What part of the court were the Mahoneys in when he said that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close to the deceased's own house—the elder Mahoney then said he would jump on any man who would say any thing against his <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>—at this time <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan was rather in liquor, and six or seven women got round him, and were <hi rend="italic">clawing</hi> him opposite the deceased's door—the deceased's wife and I assisted <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> into the house, and got him in doors, as he was in liquor—I did not go in doors with him—the two Mahoneys and the deceased at this time were coming up the court, talking together—I followed them up, and as I came a little towards my own house, I saw something white lay against the palings—I had been two doors further up, and there were a great many women and people in the way—I did not see any thing done to the deceased, but I saw something white against the paling, which turned out to be him—he had a white smock frock on—I looked at him, and thought it was one of the women, and said I would let her stop down a bit, as she deserved it, having begun the quarrel—some<lb></lb>body said, "It is John Bryan," and then I went to pick him up—I saw a man standing against his head—I looked, and it was young Mahoney, hold<lb></lb>ing a poker over his head with both hands, as if he was going to strike, but I did not see any blow struck—it appeared as if he was going to strike me—I said, "Mind, young fellow, don't you go to hit me with the poker, I have not interfered on either side"—I drew back—there was a door open behind me, and I got in—I got up on the stairs, and remained there two or three minutes, and when I thought they were gone I came out—I helped to pick the deceased up, and he was taken away by the policemen—I saw</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I saw the two Mahoneys come into the court—they had nothing in their hands—I saw the deceased come out of his brother's house with his child, which is two years and a half old—I did not see what became of the child—I saw the deceased talking to the Mahoneys, and heard him say that he never inter<lb></lb>fered with women's quarrels, and to go home and be peaceable and quiet—I did not hear them say any thing to that—I saw a man named Reardon striking hands with the deceased, and saying he would rather take his part, than ill use him—I heard the elder Mahoney say to his son, "Will you tee your mother struck?"—the deceased at that time was standing with hit back against the shutter of our window.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he struck Mahoney's wife, or done any thing of the kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I saw—I think he could not have done so without my seeing, for I was standing close by—I then went into my house, and was gone about five minutes—when I came to the door again, I saw the elder Mahoney was putting his hands together, and he said, "Be off, all of you"—the de<lb></lb>ceased was on the ground at that time, and I saw the elder Mahoney kick him on his head—that was after he said, "Be off, all of you"—he then took I woman by the clothes and brought her along; and as he passed the body he kicked him a second time—I then put my door too, and saw no more—I am quite sure the first kick was somewhere about his head—it was not on the shoulder, it was on his head, towards the upper part—I am quite sure the kick was on some part of the head—it was a violent kick—I can<lb></lb>not say whether the prisoner had boots or shoes on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Bransby Cooper, of Guy's Hospital. I remember the deceased being brought there, on the 26th of December—he was alive then, and lived till the Thursday week follow<lb></lb>ing, the 4th of January, when he died—he was suffering from a large wound on the left side of the head, which was bleeding profusely—there was a con<lb></lb>tusion on the left temple, and a smaller wound, near the vertex of the head—he was unable to speak when he was brought in, but was conscious of what was being done with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose it was a perfectly hopeless case from the first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say, certainly not, as far as we were able to judge when he was brought in—there was not appearance enough to prove a pressure of the skull on the brain—I examined the head after death—on removing the scalp, I saw a large quantity of extravasated blood, and discovered an excessive fracture, without any displacement of the bone—it had extended over a large artery, and ruptured that artery, and formed a large coagulum of blood, which, pressing on the brain, caused death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had known the state of the wound to be as you found afterwards, would you have trepanned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would not have altered the case—there may be pressure of blood from various causes—trepanning is of use in cases where the pressure is from blood, and not from the bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it such an injury as was likely to have been in<lb></lb>flicted by such an instrument as a poker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think it very probable that the contusion on the temple might be the result of a kick that alone would certainly not be the cause of death—there was no mark on the shoulder when I examined after death—I did not examine it particularly before—there was no sign of violence on the shoulder after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the two wounds, besides the contusion, so situated as that they might be inflicted by one blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it possible they might be in<lb></lb>flicted by one blow—they were about two inches, or two inches and a half apart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You consider death was caused by the pressure of coagulum of blood on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that proceeded from the rupture of a vessel which was caused by a large fracture of the skull which I found—that fracture corresponded with the wound outside.</p>

On the 18th of November I left my till with 2s. 6d. in silver, and 4d. in copper, in it. I was alarmed by my apprentice. I found the money gone. I pursued the two prisoners with him, and overtook them in South Molton-street. They were walking. They were searched in my presence. Two shillings and sixpence in silver, and two pence in copper was found on Saunders, but no money was found on Williams.</p>

I told him it did not look well his having the till open; he said he had not got it open; he was leaning over the counter, and walked out.

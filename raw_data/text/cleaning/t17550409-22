Mr. Reynolds said he knew nothing of it, it might be so for what he knew; he asked how long it was ago? Powel said it was two years ago; Reynolds said he had sold fifty watches since that. I asked him to produce his books, saying, it might save some trouble, shewing him my search-warrant; but he refused shewing me his books, and took us up stairs, and said, we might search and welcome; he also shewed us in a Buroe several silver watches, and also he shewed us some below, but the prosecutor said none of them was his watch.

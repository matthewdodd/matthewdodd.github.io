On the 10th of March my wife told me I had been robbed of a guinea; she accused the prisoner. I took her before Justice Girdler; then she confessed she had robbed me of a guinea. I know that I had four guineas and half a crown in my breeches pocket, which I had put the Sunday before in a drawer in my room. I was informed of my loss on Saturday; I saw the money there the Sunday preceding; the drawers were not locked.</p>

            . I am wife to the last witness. About nine o'clock that Saturday the prisoner and I went into the yard together; the prisoner came back first of all into the house, and left me there; I heard afterwards she had been fetching some things out of pawn; I suspected she had been at my money; I went to look at my drawers; searching my husband's breeches I found but three guineas instead of four; I knew that there were four there on the Monday before; I had talked of buying a quilt of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100031"></xptr> this woman; and in her presence had pulled the money out of the breeches and returned it again; and the prisoner knew it was there. I took her up; she said she was sorry for what she had done; and offered to pay it back again at a crown a week.</p>

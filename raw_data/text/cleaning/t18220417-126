            . I am a labourer, and live at Ham; I worked at Hounslow. On the 25th of March, before dinner time, I was at the Horse and Groom at Kingston, and saw Day there. He asked two men who were there, if they had seen Dummey. I have heard Walton called by that name, and answer to it. They said No, they expected him, and in he (Walton) came; three or four of them called him Dummey. He asked if the ragman was come. A man came in afterwards from Kingston, who answered to the name of Ragman. Then Walton went out, and brought in the copper in a bag; the ragman weighed it in the taproom, and said it was eleven pounds and a-half, and put the money on the table. Day sat on the same bench, and took it up, which Walton did not object to.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170051"></xptr>The ragman took the copper away directly. The prisoners remained and drank together, and drank with me. Walton said he had like to have lost the copper, for some boys were bird-nesting in a ditch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose he meant the boys might have found it before him - A. No.</p>

Shaw was present then, and said he had given them 7 d. a lb. for it. They said he only gave them 4 s. 6 d.; and Walton said he had had it ever since Mr. Lucas's sale (which I know to be three or four years ago); and that he went over to Kingston for Day, to procure him a man to buy it.

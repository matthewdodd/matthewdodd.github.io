About ten o'clock at night I saw him come from his caravan, cross the way, and turn down Gray-street to his stables - He appeared to have his hand in his breeches pocket, and his lanthorn in his right hand. He got to the stable, and unlocked it with his right hand; I caught hold of him, and told him I wanted him - He made great resistance. In the scuffle he threw something white from him, with his left hand, out of his breeches pocket-it hit the pail which was behind the door. Forster picked up a bag, which contained four 1l. notes-(looking at them)-these are the notes; they were folded up in a small compass. We found a bad shilling in the pail, and another out of it. We found a 25l., two 10l., two 2l., and six 1l. notes on him, all good, and ten guineas in gold, wrapped up with the good notes, in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. His left hand would be near the lock of the door - A. He threw them behind the door. I am positive that I saw him do it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Freeman, and saw the prisoner throw something away with his left hand, after Freeman had seized him. I found the canvas bag about two yards from him; one shilling in the pail and one out, both bad.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw him throw them. I found 23s. 6d. in his left-hand breeches pocket.</p>

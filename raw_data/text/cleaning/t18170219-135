On the 31st of January, at a little before seven o'clock in the evening, I was accompanying two ladies home to the Minories; my watch-chain hung out; the prisoner, in company with two others, ran against me, and said to his companions, "Do not shove so:" I was in a line with them. Thinking they might want to molest me, I turned round, and missed my watch. I cried out, stop thief! and took hold of him by the coat - He got away. I took one of his companions, who also escaped. The prisoner was immediately surrounded by people.</p>

I saw the prisoner, and two others, run against him-the prisoner was nearest to Mr. Dobson - I saw him draw the watch out of his fob, and give it to the boy next to him. Mr. Dobson called out - I took the boy; he threw the watch down, and got away, and I pursued the prisoner. I am sure I saw him take it. I gave Mr. Dobson the watch.</p>

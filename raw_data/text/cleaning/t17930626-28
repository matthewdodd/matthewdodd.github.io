               <p>Jury.

I saw him at the bottom of the street, and seeing that he was stopped I then returned immediately to my shop, because I had left it with nobody in it; he was soon brought to the door by the constable, and several people more; the constable had the watch.</p>

               <p>I was going from St. Martin's-court, and coming towards Bear-street, Leicester-fields, I observed a great concourse of people, in the front of them I observed the prisoner, I heard the cry of stop thief! imagining it to be the prisoner, I immediately ran the other side of the way, and seized him; I see several people snatch at him, he himself was calling out stop thief! I immediately seized hold of him, and clapped my hand to his pocket, in his left hand coat pocket I found the watch, and then Mr. Bettesworth came up, and said that he had been robbed, and I took the watch and boy to Bow-street, and have had it in my custody ever since.

               <p>Court to Bettesworth. Had you delivered him that watch, or was it on the counter for him to receive when he paid for that, and the other things that he bought? - It was undoubtedly left till he had paid, while we looked for the other things.</p>

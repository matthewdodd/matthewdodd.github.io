                  </hi>. I am a tailor; I live in Ebury-street, Pimlico, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square; it is my dwelling-house. I know these two coats—this one belonged to a neighbour in the street, and this other to a young man, a clerk—they were in my custody—I lost three other coats, which have not been found—one pair of trowsers has been found—the value of all I lost was about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these two coats I can identify, as being in my custody—I missed them on the same day I went before the Magistrate, on 24th June, about half past 4 o'clock in the morning—they had been safe about half past 12 the night before—they were then in my front parlour, which I use as a shop; the work had been done on them—they were ready to go home—one of the officers rang the bell, and called me up—I went down, and found the street door all correct—one of the windows in the parlour was wide open—the blind was still there—that window was not open on the night before—I was the last person up—I cannot say that the window was fastened, but it was shut down flush, that I am quite sure of—it is a window I hardly ever open—I stand against it when I cut out—the last time I saw it down was, perhaps, about half past 10—I am sure it was after 9—somebody had opened it between half past 10 and half past 4, and I missed these things—I found a pair of trowsers in the area—they had been on a brass rail in the front parlour, facing the window, when I went to bed—I never saw the prisoners, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter. On the evening of 23rd June, I was going from Brompton home to Pimlico—I got near my own door, 3, Ebury<lb></lb>square, about half past 3 o'clock—I saw both the prisoners—I did not know them before—I can swear to them—I was close to them—there was another man with them who was not taken—Savage had a bundle wrapped up, I could not see what was in it—he stood in a little court in Ebury-square, and Collins and the other man left him; and when they had got a little distance he called them to come back—he said, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, I am not certain which—they went on a little further, and Savage followed them—I followed and watched them, and saw Savage put the bundle into the flap of his trowsers—he then came towards me, the other two men went away—I saw a police<lb></lb>man, and told him what I had seen—I ran as far as Cheshire-cheese-court; I there lost sight of the other two men—I afterwards saw Savage at the top of Sloane-street.</p>

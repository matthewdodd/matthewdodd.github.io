I was sitting by my fire side on the 1st of April, about eleven o'clock at night, when my door was push'd a little way open, and the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out. I heard them taken out, and went to the door, but saw nobody. Next day, between eight and nine in the evening, there was a cry of stop thief. A lad that lodges with me ran out, and took the prisoner He had stole a joll of salmon. I took hold of the prisoner, and said, my boy, did you not take such things from me last night? He was very drunk, and said nothing, but after a great deal of examining he owned that he and another boy took them; he said the other boy's name was

            , that they took out the two gowns first and carried them into an alley, and then went and took the petticoat, and when at the constable's house, he confessed they were sold in Rag Fair, and before Mr. Fielding he said Knight sold them while he was at the door, and that he did not know the person's name nor the street but he could carry us to the house. He did so; it was in Red Lion Street, Roper's Alley, Goodman's Fields. He went into the house, and the woman at the bar was sitting by the fire with a child in her arms. The woman said she never bought any old cloaths in her life that her daughter dealt in them, but she did not, but we found the petticoat there. The prisoner said her daughter bought it in the fair, and nobody had any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the boy say he sold them for?</p>
               <p>M. Lawrence. He said he sold them for five and six pence. When we were looking about, the boy said we must go up stairs, for they keep things there. We found the petticoat under a bed up two pair of stairs; I believe it was not the prisoner's bed, for after we had found it a person came into the room and said to the prisoner's daughter. O you base jade how could you carry any thing into my room? we found one of the gowns over the prisoner's head where she sat ( produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

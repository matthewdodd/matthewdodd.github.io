            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew's, Holborn. I saw the prosecutor about half-past twelve o'clock, standing with his back against some shutters to rest himself - he appeared sober; I saw the prisoners in the act of hugging him - they passed me, and turned down Field-lane; he described their persons to me minutely - I knew them before, and described them to the next watchman who brought them to me; I took them to the watch-house, and directly the prosecutor saw them he said they were the women who had taken his money - they denied having seen him; I searched them, and found 16 1/2d. on one and 5d. on the other, but no coin that the prosecutor could identify; they were out of my sight upwards of an hour.</p>
               <p>Sullivan. Q.Were you not drinking with the prosecutor till we were taken? A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not received 15s. not to appear? A. The prosecutor and I were drawn by stratagem to a public-house on Monday last - I was brought there by a message that the prosecutor wanted to see me; I went, and was told he had just gone out, but would be in in an instant - he came in soon after, and a proposition was made for him to receive what he had lost, and drop the proceedings; I told him the consequence of it, and he had better get away - they wished us to drink, and we refused; he being a cripple could not get out of the house so fast, and they thrust 15s. into his hand.</p>

            . I live in Lower West-street, Smithfield, and am a whipmaker - I have not worked in London, but at Bristol; I have been here about two months - I have known the prisoners two months; one of them lives with her mother, but I cannot say in what part of London - I have heard the mother say so; I have heard she is her mother - I have seen the prisoners in the street where I live; they do not lodge in the same house as me- I have seen one with her mother in different parts of the street many times; I have come to certify that I have seen the prosecutor make up what damage there was.</p>


               <p>Q. How did you know they were taken up? A. A friend of theirs met me, and asked me to have a drop of porter the day before yesterday - I did not know they were in custody before the young man told me; he said a friend of his was charged with robbing a man of 6s. - I believe he is a plasterer or bricklayer; I have seen him with his fellow-tradesmen, plasterers - I was not very intimate with him; I have many a time treated him with a pot of beer, but not in the prisoners' presence - the last time I saw the prisoners was in Holborn in the street; I have seen them at the Horse Shoe and Magpie, Saffron-hill, with their mothers - I forget their names; I might know them, and not their names - I saw the prosecutor at the Three Tuns, Brooke-street, Holborn; we went there together, for this girl's friend brought me into his company (pointing to Sullivan) - I do not know where he is, or his name: I saw him this morning, but not since - the prosecutor lives in a street leading out of Holborn to the left: the young girl's friend brought him to the house, and asked how much he had lost by the girl - the man said he did not know that the girl had taken anything; the friend said so - and he said he had lost 6s.; he mentioned 6s., neither more nor less, to the best of my opinion - the young man said he was very sorry for it, and if he would be satisfied to take it, and what expense he was at afterwards, he would pay him; I heard this.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to be wanted on this occasion? A. The young man asked me to drink, and I did not know what it was upon; I did not think what it could be about till I got into the house - then it was talked over; I said nothing, only that it was an unfortunate job that it happened - he had told me it was for picking a man's pocket; I was present at the time the money was offered - the man got 15s., and said he should be satisfied with it, and he took the 15s.; this young woman's friend gave it him - I do not know where he is; he did not send me here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here? A. I was walking about the yard as other people - I had no business to bring me here; her mother told me the trial was coming on to-day; she was in the street: on my oath the prosecutor stretched out his hand, and took the 15s. in the public-house himself, and shook hands with the party when he left - it was not thrust into his pocket; Saunders was present at the time; the money was reached to the prosecutor, and he took it - it was not put into his pocket in my presence; I saw him receive the money - I swear it was not put into his pocket; when this was done I parted with him.</p>
               <p>Q.You knew what was to be done, that the prosecutor was to have his money returned? A. When I came into the house I did; he did not exactly say he was going to make it up; he had 13s., and another person lent him 2s. - that was the man who came in here with me (Boyd;) I knew the prisoners, one as much as the other - I have been at several houses with them; the Horse Shoe and Magpie - I was never in a private house with them; I do not know where they lived - I was never in their mothers' house; I only know them by meeting them in public-houses.</p>

            . I am a hawker, and live at No. 10, West-street, Smithfield, when I am in town - May also<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160030"></xptr>lodges there: I have lodged there, off and on, for nine months. I only know the prisoners by seeing them walking up and down in the street; the young man, Sheen, met me - he is a bricklayer; he does not keep company with the prisoners to my knowledge - I have seen him speak to them, that is all; I have known Sheen about a twelve-month - he lives in White Bear-yard, at the top of Leather-lane - I think it is Ayre-street-hill; I was walking up Holborn-hill the other evening, he asked me to go to White's-alley, Chancery-lane, for he was going to meet a person - I went with him to a public-house, sat down and drank a pint of porter, and after we had drank, this short man came in; I did not send any message for him - I do not know that Sheen did; he came in after Sheen - they sat down, talked about one thing or another, and then began talking about his friend being in prison; I believe Sullivan is his friend.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to know her name? A. Why, yesterday morning I saw it up on the gate, and he showed it to me on the gate outside the yard; I do not now know whether it was her name - he asked the man if he wished to come to any terms, and not prosecute his friend; May was sitting alongside in the same seat at the time - the man said he did not know himself what to do; he did not wish himself to do any harm, but he would speak to the watchman first - he went down to Greystoke-place, and inquired after the man; we went altogether, and then returned to another house - I went out a bit, and when I came back the watchman was there: I have seen Sheen outside the Court, but not for this hour and a half. After the watchman came in they began talking, and he asked what expences he was at; he said 15s. - he said, "Will that satisfy you?" he pulled out his money, and said, "All I have is 12s." - he happened to find two sixpences more; I lent him one for about an hour, and his brother, I believe, gave him the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Then four of you were raising the money to prevent the prosecution? A.He asked me for the money; I knew what it was for, but I was sure of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the man took the money. or was it put into his pocket? A.Sheen sat at one end of the table - he handed it down, and this gentleman took it up, whether he put it into his pocket I do not know, but it was said it was better to put it into the landlord's hands till the following evening.</p>

I was called to take care of the prisoners: I went to a public house to the two prisoners; they said they had stopped the prisoners with a copper, and at a public house in James-court I should find more goods; I went there, and there I found the rest of the goods contained in the indictment (repeating them); these were in the lodgings of Cook.

I am a watchman of St. Luke's parish, and was beating the hour at five o'clock; one told me he saw two men; I got a brother watchman; they came back with another load; my partner left me being tired, and another watchman came by and helped me; Cook came out with the copper; as he came out of the court I caught him by the collar, and asked him where he was going with that; he said, what is that to you; I insisted upon knowing; he said he was going to set it up; I said he should set it down; he put it down and offered to strike me; I took out my little staff and swore I would knock him down if he offered to resist. I sent another watchman to the prisoners house to see that nobody came out; he went down there and took the other prisoner.</p>

            . On the 1st of January I saw these two prisoners come down the court; one had a copper, the other a load in a bag; they went into the house and left the loads, and came out again in about ten minutes, with each an empty bag under his arm; I called my wife up, and said, something was going forward that is not right; she got up; they returned in about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120009"></xptr> three-quarters of an hour with each a load again; my wife and I followed them to the door, and saw them go up stairs with the goods; when they were examined before the Justice, the Justice asked the man that had the copper, if he had the copper; he said, yes. He carried it into the house and brought it out again, and that the other was the man that had the load upon his back.</p>

               <p>I was coming to my work on Friday night: a man stopped us in Houndsditch, and asked me to set him up a copper; I said I could; he asked me if I would come in the morning about four or five o'clock; I said I would do it, he said they were out of his house, for he was afraid of having them seized. This man met me, and gave them me, packed up, ready for us, by the Fox at Greenland-road; as I came to Shoreditch church he asked me if I could lodge them at my house, for he was just got into a new lodging, and did not care to disturb the man; I agreed to it; after that I took another turn, and then he said he would call his landlord up. As I was coming out of the lodging, between seven and eight, Blundell stopped me; I said I was going to set the copper up; I said I was no thief, if he would go with me I would shew him the man I had the copper from. He threatened to knock me down.</p>

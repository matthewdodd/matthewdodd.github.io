I was house maid in the service of Mr. George Warrener, who keeps the George and Vulture hotel and tavern, George-yard, Lombard-street, on Friday, the 10th of Jan., but am not so now—at eight or ten minutes after ten o'clock that evening, I went up to the room No. 6, to light the fire—I put the key, which I had got from the bar, into the door, and found the door was unlocked—it was always kept locked—I had a candle with me—I went as far as the bedstead, and heard some person breathe—I went to a table, which was in the middle of the room, and saw two men—it was the prisoners, Howell and Smith—they were standing upright—I did not see them doing anything—they ware between a chest of drawers and the bedstead—the drawers are about half a yard from the bedstead—they were close to the drawers—I asked them, "How dare you in here?"—they mentioned Mr. Gatayes' name, but nothing more—one said, "Mr. Gatayes," (which is the name of the gentleman who occupies the room)—I ran to the door, and tried to lock them in, but I had not power—they forced the door, and pushed it open against me—I ran to the top of the stairs—I screamed out—they ran after me down the stairs, caught hold of me by the back of my neck, and put their hands across my mouth—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the George and Vulture, George-yard. On Friday night, 10th Jan., I was in the hall, and heard screams—I opened the hall-door, then went to the hall on the opposite side of the passage, and found the two prisoners on the stairs with the last witness, all tumbling down stairs as hard as they could scramble—nobody was with me—the prisoners and the girl were on the staircase, and nobody else there—I collared them both, took them into the other hall, across the passage, and kept them in custody till the police came—they resisted—both used violence—I have not yet recovered the use of my thumb—Mr. Gatayes occupied this room—my house is in two parishes, but the part of the room in which the prisoners were first seen, and the door of the room, is in the parish of St. Edmund the King and Martyr, the door, the bed, and the chest of drawers, and the space between them—part of the room, is in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill—it is generally the custom to lock the room No. 6—I had not seen the key hanging up previously—it always hangs in the bar, when the room is locked but if it is not locked, the last witness would have the key—I was present when Howell was searched at the station—a key was brought to my house by the police-inspector—I tried it myself to the door of No. 6—I did not mark the key, but it was one like this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it opened No. 6—some rings are missing—we have had the room searched, and cannot find them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You know nothing about the rings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—we have a practice of hanging the keys up below—a guest could come and take his key, and unlock his room—when the servant called out, I saw Howell and Smith, about half way up the first flight of stairs, running down—there was no gentleman with me—one of the Waiters came out of the servants' hall, and was in the hall at the time, but I was at the foot of the stairs, and caught hold of them at the foot of the stairs—I swear I saw Howell half way up the stairs—a person could not have come in from the passage, and get there, after I heard the cry, without my seeing them, because I was on the alert—I had received information, and was waiting in the hall, in case anybody should come—I was close to the passage, and immediately crossed the passage into the other hall, to the foot of the stairs—the tavern is not a public thoroughfare—one entrance is in George-yard, the other in St. Michael's-alley—one in the parish of St. Michael's, Cornhill, the other in St. Edmund the King.</p>

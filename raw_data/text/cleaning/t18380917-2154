                  </hi>. I belong to a merchant's ship. I came home about three weeks ago—about one o'clock in the morning of the 26th of August, I met the prisoner just in the Borough—I had passed the day very well—I had had a pint or two of beer through the day—we had two or three words—I went home with her, and went to bed—I put my breeches down by the side of the bed—there was a sixpence, and one penny in the rackets—I took my boots off, and put them by the side of the bed—I left the watch round my neck, with the guard—I fell asleep, and awoke between four and five o'clock—the prisoner, and my boots, money, and breeches, were all gone—I got up, and overhauled about the room, and told the policeman of it—I had given her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before I went to bed—my watch was found at the pawnbroker's on the Monday—I have not found my boots since—this happened on Sunday morning—this is my watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

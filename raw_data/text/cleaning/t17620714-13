The prisoner came into my shop, and took out a jack plane and an oil stone, about one o'clock at noon. My next door neighbour told me the prisoner had taken something out of my shop. I live near the Cock in the Corner. I ran after him up the Old Bailey, and near Surgeons Hall I took him, and found them both upon him. I carried him before the sitting alderman. He said he asked one of the men for them as he knew. I had no man at home at that time.</p>

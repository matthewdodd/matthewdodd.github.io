            . On the 30th of June I was with Mr. Davis; he gave me two 10l. notes, a 5l. note, and four sovereigns in a purse - we went to the Red Cow; I saw the prisoner there - I had a full opportunity of viewing his features; I am confident he is the man - on going out Mr. Davis fell down; I stopped to assist him, and the prisoner stopped to assist me - he then ran off as fast as he could towards Hammersmith; I called to him, he said he must go, or he should be locked out of his lodging - soon after he was gone I put my hand into my bosom, and missed the purse and all the money; I have not seen it since - we had some ale at the Red Cow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. I am servant with Mr. Davis; he at that time lived at Hammersmith - we had been to London that day; he has frequently given me his money to take care of - I opened the purse when he gave it me, and counted the money before his face; I am quite confident it did not fall out of my bosom - it must have been picked out, but I did not feel it taken; I had put it low down while we were in the public-house - the prosecutor asked if I had the money safe; I told him to put his hand to my bosom, and he would be convinced, which he did - the prisoner saw that.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did he give you the three notes at once? A. No, at different times - he did not give me any thing, but I drank with him; here is one of the notes I got changed at one place; I do not know which - I know it by the writing on the back.</p>

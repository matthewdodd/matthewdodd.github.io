I asked her, if I was to pawn them in her name, or mine; she desired me not to pawn them in her name, because the pawnbrokers knew her; then I said I would pawn them in mine; I did not mind it. I pawned them in my name, and brought the money to her, and she went to market and bought a fine stock of greens.</p>

On the 18th or 19th of January I mist the things mentioned in the indictment out of my drawers up one pair of stairs in my bed-chamber. I was at a public house at the time; we searched the house, thinking the thief might be in the house, but could find nobody. The next morning I went and searched the pawnbrokers, and I found the two gowns and petticoat at Mr. Bond's, a pawnbroker, in Hounsditch. Then I went to Mr. Howard's, and found that the white sattin and apron were pawned there the day before.</p>

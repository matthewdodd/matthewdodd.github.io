On Tuesday the 20th of January, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the door, and asked if Mr. Mills was at home. I told him, yes; I asked him to wait in the counting-house while I went up to him. I asked his name; he said; no matter about my name; I was to tell Mr. Mills, a gentleman wanted him. When I got up about three steps, I remembered that Mr. Mills had told me, when I came up again, to bring some wafers, and returned for them. I had left a silver spoon in a glass on the shelf. When I returned to the counting-house, it dropped from behind the prisoner. I called Mr. Mills down, who asked what his business was, he gave two or three different names; Mr. Mills sent me for a constable. The prisoner said his name was

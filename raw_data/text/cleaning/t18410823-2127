I gave him no money, but found him in food. On the day stated he went out between eight and nine o'clock. I went out about four o'clock, and met two persons, who could have proved I bad no property. I staid out all night, and the next morn<lb></lb>ing he called on me, and asked me to walk with him, and he gave me into custody. I know nothing of the sheet. The duplicate was found seven or eight yards from the curb.</p>

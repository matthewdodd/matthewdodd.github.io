I found my reticule was cut, and two purses had been taken out, each of which had silver in it- I have never seen any of the money or the purses since; I can swear the two prisoners were at the corner of the street, and I believe Gandy was the one who said "Ladies pass on" - he was taken immediately, and Atkins on the 30th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were there not a great number of persons there? A. No; there were several passing and re-passing - those who did pass were obliged to go into the road to cross; I wished to pass on- when I heard the expression, Gandy was before me, and the others were chiefly before me or on the side of me; I should think it could not have occurred by accident - I was impeded in my walk.</p>

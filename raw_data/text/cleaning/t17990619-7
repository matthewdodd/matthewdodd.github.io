               <p>Q. How far is Cooke's house from the house you went first to? - A. Next door, there is a paling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190011"></xptr>about this high that parts the yards; after the goods were owned by the prosecutor, Cooke owned these stockings as being his, and the neckcloth, which were all in one bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Those stockings; you have last produced, were they claimed by the prosecutor, or Mrs. Vickers? - A. No, they knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Before he was asked as to whose property they were, what had been said to him? - A. Nothing in the world, but bringing the people, where I had found the goods, into his presence; the man behaved extremely civil at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. They live very near your office? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were their lodgings? - A. In French-alley, Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know they cohabited together as man and wife? - A. I have been told so; Mrs. Turner afterwards addressed her by the name of Mrs. Cooke; I found a phosphorus bottle in the fob of Cooke's breeches.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. She went by the name of Hayne? - A. No, she went by the name of Cooke.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she ever called Hayne? - A. Yes, but not many times; I have not heard it only since this affair has happened; before that she was called Mrs. Cooke.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard her called Hayne before that? - A. No, always Mrs. Cooke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she throw the bundle over? - A. Yes; and told me, as she gave it me, that her husband and she were having words, and she was afraid he would cut them up; I heard them at high words; I took them and put them into Mrs. Turner's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same bundle that the officers came, afterwards, and took from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not opened it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the same state you received it from Mrs. Hayne? - A. Yes.</p>

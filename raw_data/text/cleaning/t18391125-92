                  </hi>. I am a farmer and live at Harefield, in Middlesex. On the 1st of November I had been to London, and on my way home I met the prisoner at the Horse and Groom public-house at Uxbridge, about a quarter before ten o'clock in the evening—I knew her before, as she had been hay-making for me last summer—she asked me to give her something to drink—I gave her and her companions a glass of peppermint and took one myself—as I was coming out at the door, the prisoner caught bold of my left arm and said, "Come along, I want to speak to you—she led me about six yards, then gave me a twirl round, and got my purse out of my breeches pocket and ran off—I said to my boy, "Run boy, run, she-has got my purse"—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in ray purse—she ran round by the market-house, and the police-man afterwards took her—I have never seen my money again, nor the purse—it had been in my right-hand breeches pocket—I did not give it her at all. nor attempt to take any liberties with her.</p>

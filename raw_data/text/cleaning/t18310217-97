            . I keep a broker's shop in Lower Whitecross-street. On the morning of the 10th of January the prisoner came to my house before I was up, and brought a grate - it was by nine, or before nine o'clock; he told me he had brought a fine grating, and put it into the passage - he said he wanted the same for that as he had for one he brought before; I told him I had not the money then, but if he would call in a few minutes I would pay him - he went away; I got an officer, and when he came again he was taken - I took the grating to the watch-house - this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Great James-street, Bedford-row. I keep a cash account at the house of Glynn and Co., and am in the habit of drawing checks on that house—the prisoner was in my employment from six to nine months—he was first employed as a permanent clerk—he ceased to act in that capacity, I should think about two years ago—I have employed him occasionally, and given him writing to do out of the office since that time till the present—I do not doubt that he had an opportunity of knowing that I kept an account at Glynn's—my check-book was usually on the table in my office—this is the book—there are three checks printed on every page—on the first discovery of this forgery I examined the book, and missed the last sheet from it—I have two numbers on my checks, my own private number, and the printed number which is on them when Glynns issue them, which is B. X., 901 to 1200—my number is put on them when I fill them up—it would not be on the blank checks—the check produced is not my handwriting, or any part of it, nor was it written by my authority—the signature, I should say, was a good imitation of mine—I am acquainted with the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing, and have seen him write frequently—I believe the filling up of this check to be his writing—the signature is not like his writing, it is an imita<lb></lb>tion of mine—the name and address on this bank-note, "James Martineau, 9, William-street, Islington," I believe to be the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe the prisoner is a relation of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the family do not consider him a relation—his father was my uncle—he is an illegitimate child—I have frequently seen writing of his in the office, briefs that he has copied—I cannot recollect when my attention was last called to it—his is a very stiff handwriting, and he writes very slow—I call his whole writing peculiar from A to Z—his f is always peculiar, ending square at the bottom, and every letter—this "James Martineau" is not much feigned—it is not much like his ordinary writing—it is more like his writing than that in the check—I have a stronger belief about it—he lived at one time with his mother, but I do not think he did latterly.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 25, London-street, Caledonian-road, Islington. The prisoner lodged with me about three months, up to the 25th or 26th of July last—he was to pay me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—the first month he paid me pretty fair, but after that it was dropped, and went on for several weeks—he owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent before he left—that was up to the very day he left, 26th of July—on that day he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid me with two sovereigns—I did not see whether he had any more money about him—he came down and said, "Cocking, I shall pay you"—I said, "Very good"—he said, "Will 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. do for you?"—I said, "I don't know, my rent is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will name it to Mrs. Cocking; I dare say we shall not be particular for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I went into the shop—my wife came in—I said I would not mind 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so he handed me over two sovereigns—I said, "I have not got change, I will go and get it"—he said, "Never mind for the present, any time will do in the course of the day"—I thought it would be handy for him, and I got change and gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he appeared as usual—not at all excited—a cab fetched his boxes away that evening—he left with it—he rode outside—I do not know where he went—next day, or the day following, he came to ask if there were any letters for him—I did not see any change in his dress then—I did not let him in—I never saw him after that day.</p>
               <p>(Thomas Hewit Key, lecturer, at University College; William Wells, at<lb></lb>torney's clerk, Tokenhouse-yard; Ellen Clark, wife of a bookseller; Sarah Morgan, wife of a cabinet-maker; and Mary Dodd, wife of John Dodd, of No. 56, Marchant-street; gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

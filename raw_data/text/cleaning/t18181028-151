On the 17th of September, about five o'clock in the morning, I missed my jacket and trowsers-they must have been taken in the night. He did not then sleep with me-my bed-room door was locked, but I found both my bed-room windows wide open, and a ladder near the window-part of my family slept in the room. I found my things at Shadwell Office three or four days after, in custody with the prisoner. He said he would pay me for them.</p>

About half-past eleven o'clock on the morning after the robbery, I took the prisoner at Stepney, and asked what time he was at home the night before, he said at eleven o'clock - He was four miles from the prosecutor's. I asked who let him in? he said the door was open, and all in the house must have seen him.</p>

            . I am private watchman to Mr. Gunn, who lives in the Commercial-road. The prisoner lodged in the same house with me. On the 16th of September, I went to take him some victuals in prison. He said there was a jacket, a pair of trowsers, and a shirt in Mr. Gunn's hay-loft, and asked me to pledge them-the chaff-cutter found them there-he was in Mr. Gunn's service. I went home about three o'clock on the morning of the robbery-the prisoner was not at home then.</p>

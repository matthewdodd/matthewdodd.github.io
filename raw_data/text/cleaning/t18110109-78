            , Bow Street. I had taken the handkerchief out of his hand before he ran away. This is the handkerchief, it is exactly the same pattern I had in my pocket in the morning, it is worth four or five shillings. In going down Bow Street, he looked round. and two or three young men kept buzzing about, we put him in an Hackney coach, he begged that I would not appear against him. He said he was a very good young man, it was his first offence I told him, if he told me where he lived, and he had a good character, I would not take him to Bow Street.</p>
               <p>MR. CASS. I am a linen draper, I was with Mr. Cooper on this evening, we were walking arm in arm together, I observed two or three young men behind they appeared to be in company together, I turned round two or three times to let them pass, the prisoner was the only one that passed us, and after the prisoner passed us I observed the handkerchief in his hand; Mr. Cooper laid hold of his arm with one hand, and took the handkerchief with the other, he told the prisoner it was his handkerchief, I think he denied it, when Mr. Cooper took the handkerchief, he ran across the street, Mr. Cooper fell down, (I saw two or three young men running across the road, they appeared to be pursuing as well as us) I cried out stop thief, he ran into a court, I catched him as he returned back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the afternoon of that day, I had been to see a relation, in my way home I met an old school-fellow whom I had not seen some years, and on our coming up Catherine Street in the Strand, my school-fellow put a handkerchief in my hand, and before I had time to ask him the reason of so extraordinary a circumstance, the prosecutor came up and asked me for the handkerchief, upon which I was alarmed, and had no doubt he had stolen it from the prosecutor; upon the prosecutor's attempting to take me, I ran away; I do solemnly declare my running away was not from a consciousness of guilt, but for my unfortunately happening to be with one who had so departed from moral honesty, and what adds to my affliction is the shame it has brought on my family; I hope your Lordship will extend mercy to me, which will be the study of my life to shew my gratitude.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

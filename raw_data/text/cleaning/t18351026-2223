                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at Patton. In consequence of a message from Tyler, I went to his house on Sunday, and saw the prisoner—I told him I was sorry to say he had come there under very suspicious circumstances, and I wished to ask him a few questions—I told was, nor my profession—I am sure I said, he need not answer unless he chose—he stated to me that he had bought the mare of Mr. Jones of Epping, for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that he rode her to London that night, (Friday) when he bought her, and that his master, Mr. Dillimore, told him it would do for old Sale of Abberley, and he was to bring her down next morning—he called it of Abberley, or some such name—I said, "I suppose you mean Abbotsley"—he said "Yes"—he told me that Jones was a hay farmer, at Epping, and wished him to be written to—he expressed a wish to go to Sale's—I told him no, I would go myself and leave him there—previously to going to Sale's, I asked him what name I should tell him—he said, "My name is Owen, but they call me <hi rend="italic">Bill Lowens,</hi> and if you will tell him <hi rend="italic">Bill Lowens</hi> wants him, he can come and clear me"—I consequently went to Abbotsely, and appointed Sale to meet me, at Dine o'clock next morning instead of which, Sale came at three o'clock that afternoon—at three o'clock on Sunday afternoon, I was sent for to the Swan Inn, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and Sale together, and a man watching them—they were in conver<lb></lb>sation—on their seeing me, Sale came away from the prisoner, towards the door—I said to Sale, in the presence of the prisoner, "Well, Master Sale, can you clear this man? he says, you can"—the prisoner made no answer, but Sale said, "No, Sir, I dare not have any thing to do with it, I know the man, but I know nothing of the mare," and I believe he added where could he get 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for her—I then asked Sale the pri<lb></lb>soner's name—he said, "Bill"—I said, "He must have some other name"—he then said, "William"—I asked him for his surname—he hesi<lb></lb>tated some time, and looked very hard at the prisoner—at length the prisoner said, "Owens Owens," and Sale repeated it—Sale then went away—I first appointed him to meet me to go before Mr. Pimm, the Magis<lb></lb>trate next morning, and next morning we went before Mr. Pimm, who remanded him till next morning, telling me to write to Jones, at Epping—Sale did not appear before the Magistrate—I wrote to Jones, and re<lb></lb>ceived an answer, without a signature to it, but with the Epping post-mark—I took the prosecutor before Mr. Pimm, who swore to the mare, and received her—Potton is forty-eight miles from Hackney.</p>

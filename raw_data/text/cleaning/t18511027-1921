                  </hi>. I am a maltster, and am now living at 4, Bell-lane, Spitalfields. On Thursday, 23rd Oct., about 1 o'clock, I was in Good-man's-rents, Minories; and a person who was afterwards with the prisoner, but who is not in custody, came up to me, and asked me whether I wanted to buy any tobacco—I told him I did not, and he asked me to buy a watch—I consented to go and see it, and he went with me to Mrs. Abrahams, at the Golden Lion, in Goodman's-yard—while I was there with him, the prisoner came in—I am quite sure he is the man—he asked the other man whether he had shown me the watch—he said yes, and the prisoner took the watch from him, and said to me, "Look here; you can have this watch for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it cost 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I took it out of his hand, looked at it, and thought it might be stolen property—I wanted to get away from them, so I pulled out my watch to show them I had one, and did not want it—the prisoner said, "D—n it, old fellow! let us have a bargain; buy something of us," and he pulled out a chain—I told him I did not want a chain or anything else—he then palled out some handkerchiefs and shawls—I told him I did not want them, and he asked me to advance him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the chain—I told him I did not want to part with my watch, or to buy anything—he said he had been on board ship, and his master was a black man, and he had some tobacco wrapped round his loins—he said he lived at this Golden Lion—he wanted me to give him my watch and something else for his chain, or to give my watch for the watch he had—I refused all his offers, and he said that he lodged there, and he would go up-stairs and fetch another watch, I believe it was—as he passed the corner of the table to go out he snatched my watch out of my hand and threw the chain on the table, saying that would make satisfaction—he went out of the room, and I did not see him again till he was in Newgate—I was going to follow him, but the other man pulled me back to show me the quality of the chain, and told me that Dubois gave a doubloon for it—he then said he would go up after his mate, and I never saw him again—I went out in search of a constable—I identified the prisoner in Newgate last Monday—I was in his company ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I have doubt he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Abrahams, who keeps the Golden Lion, Good man's-yard, Minories. On 23rd Oct., between 1 and 2 o'clock, in consequence of the parlour-bell ringing, I went there, and found the prisoner, prosecutor, and another man—I had seen the prisoner before, about 11 the same day, when I served him and another man with a pint of beer at the bar—the other man took up the newspaper, and the prisoner took a silver watch out of a bag the size of the watch, shook it, and put it to his ear—they stayed in front of the bar about ten minutes, and I had a good opportunity of seeing the prisoner's face—the very moment I went into the room, between 1 and 2, I recognized him—they then called for a pint of beer, for which the prosecutor gave me a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece—I afterwards heard some one go out, but did not see who it was—the prosecutor then came out, and made a complaint to me about the two men—he said the stout man had taken his watch, and I then found that the prisoner was gone—he has never lodged in my house, but I think I have seen him in and out several times.</p>

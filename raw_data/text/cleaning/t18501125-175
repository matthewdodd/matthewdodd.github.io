                  </hi>. I live in Surrey-row, Blackfriars-road. On 5th Nov., I was going down Charlotte-street about half-past ten o'clock at night—I saw a mob of persons—as soon as they saw me coming, they opened, and as soon as I got in the centre of them, some one knocked my hat off—there were seven persons standing together—it was just at the entrance, going into Mr. Sherman's house—when Wright knocked me down on the pavement, the girls and boys held me down, and Wright turned my poc<lb></lb>kets inside out, and ill-used me while I was down—I had a penny-piece in my pocket, and some bits of paper—Wright gave me two black eyes, and struck me with his fist and the stump of his arm—Leary held me while I was down—when my hat was knocked off, one of the other boys ran away with it—while I was on the ground, the whole of them held me tight—there were two more boys about the size of the prisoners, and three young women—they held me so as to allow Wright to make his escape—Leary was one who held me—my penny was not stolen; it was in my trowsers-pocket—Wright turned out two of my pockets, but not the one where my penny was—the hoys and girls told Wright to get away while they held me—I was knocked down two or three times with great force—Wrightgot way, and I got from the others, and followed him up William-street to near Swan-court—when he got near Swan-court, he told the other two boys to seize me, and while they were in the act of seizing me, he ran down Swan-court—they did not seize me, but Wright got down Swan-court, and knowing them to be bad characters there, I did not go after him—I had seen him once before—I am positive the prisoners are the persons.</p>

I cried "Police!"—they might have put me in fear of my life; they did not do it—I resisted, I had a right to do so—Wright gave me two black eyes—I did not give him one—I did my best—I do not say I did not hit him.</p>

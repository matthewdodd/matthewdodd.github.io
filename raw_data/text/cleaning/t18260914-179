The prisoner lodged with me on the 22d of August - in the course of that day, I had put one pound worth of copper, that I had not marked, and twelve penny pieces which I had marked, in a bureau, which I locked, and hung the key up in the bar - I locked the bar, and when I went to bed, I went to see that it was safe; I went to a room under the prisoner's, and left the door open; when the watchman called four o'clock, I heard the prisoner get up from over my head, and go down stairs - I went out and listened, and heard a rattling of copper; I went down and seized the prisoner, who was taking copper out of the bureau, and putting it into his night cap - he had nothing on but his shirt; he had got 2s. 10d. out.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was calling four o'clock when Mr. Keen called me in - I took the prisoner - Mr. Keen said he had thrown the money somewhere, and not to let him stoop till he got a light; I found the money in his cap.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had occasion to come down to go to the yard, and one of the men asked me to bring up some water; I went into the tap-room and could not find a pot; I put my hand against the bar door and it opened; I put my foot inside; Mr. Keen heard me and came down - I had not touched the money.</p>
               <p>JURY to HENRY KEEN. Q. Was any marked money in the cap? A. Yes, and I have some more in my pocket to match it.</p>

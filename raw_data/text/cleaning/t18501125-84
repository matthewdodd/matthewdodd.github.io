                  </hi>. I live at 98, New Bond-street, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On Saturday night, 26th Oct., I left home at half-past eight o'clock—I returned about twenty minutes past two, on the Sunday morning—I went in-doors, with a latch-key, and went up-stairs, to the first-floor landing—there was a light burning, which if usually left for me—on opening the drawing-room door, as I usually do if I am out late, and looking in, I heard something fall on my second-floor, which is over the drawing-room—I immediately called out for my servant, to know if it was her—I had no answer—I then rang the up-stairs bell, and called out, "Thieves! there is a thief in the house!"—I then opened</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250075"></xptr>
               <p>the bedroom door on the first-floor, and immediately heard somebody Walk across my room up-stairs—I then went down to the street door, unbolted and opened it, calling, "Police!"—I kept the door open, and returned four or five steps up-stairs, so that I could see across the staircase, and I immediately saw the prisoner running down from the second-floor to the first-floor—I ran down very fast, thinking he was coming to the door—I shut the door, and kept it shut, calling out, "Police!"—I fancied there were two or three persons in the house by the noise, but I only saw one person—I remained outside the door, calling, "Police!"—the policemen came up, and we went into the house, with my latch-key—there was only my female servant in the house, and her sitter, who had come on a visit to her—when I went into the house with the policemen, I examined the premises—I found the landing window had evidently been opened just before—there was a little catch at the side of the window, and that was up, and the window was a little open—a person inside could lift the little catch up, but not outside—the window looks out on the leads at the back premises, and goes over to a large table-yard which leads into Blenheim-street—a person from that yard can get to Woodstock-street; they adjoin—I then told two policemen to run round the corner, thinking that was the only chance the persons had of escape—the prisoner was then gone—he was brought back shortly after, in custody of the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure he is the person you saw in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite sure—when I saw him in the house the light that I spoke of shone in his face, it was just below him—I did not go so high as the window on the landing when I first went up—a person from that; window could get on the leads, it is level; and from there to Blenheim-street—there was no sign of breaking on that window; but there was another window, about six feet below that, where they could have got in, which was not fastened—that opens on the leads, on a sort of skylight—it leads to the bedroom on the first-floor—I believe that had no fastening—I had not been in that bedroom that evening before I went out—I cannot tell whether the window was open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When the policeman brought me round, you said you did not know me, and they placed me on the stairs, and you said you thought I was the man. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I said you were the man—you had had your coat turned up on the neck, and the policeman took you on the stairs, and then I was quite sure it was you, but I said at the door that you were the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Thorn, and sleep at the top of the house. On that Sunday morning I was awoke, and went down<lb></lb>stairs, about half-past two o'clock—I saw the prisoner in custody—I had noticed the window on the staircase on the Friday—it was then fastened by two catches, which hang down one on each side of the sash—that window had not been opened on the Saturday—it was still fattened—the bedroom window just below that, is a sash-window, and has no fastening—any one could get in at that window from the yard at the back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi> You did not find that window open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had seen it about seven o'clock on the Saturday evening—it was then shut down—there was no pane broken, or anything of that sort in any part—my sister slept with me—I never saw the prisoner before—a person could open the bedroom window from the outside.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 166). On Sunday morning, 27th Oct., I heard a cry of "Police!" in New Bond-street—I ran to the spot, and saw the prosecutor; he said there were thieves in the house—several more constables heard the cry of "Police!" and they went to the spot—two of the constables went into the house; I stood at the door—I then ran round to Blenheim-street, leading to Woodstock-street—that is at the back of the premises—just before I got to Woodstock-street, in Blenheim-street, the prisoner came out of Mr. Freeman's stable-yard, which is at the back of Mr. Thorn's house—you can get to that yard from the back of Mr. Thorn's, and from several other houses in New Bond-street—the prisoner ran, and I pursued him, calling "Stop thief!"—he turned out of Woodstock-street into Oxford-street, and from there to South Moulton-street—when he got about thirty yards down South Moulton-street, a brother constable, of the D division, stopped him—I heard something fall on the pavement, and I saw my brother constable pick up a dark lantern—a box of matches fell into an area, they were burning: another constable got over and picked them up—I did not hear the prisoner say anything.</p>

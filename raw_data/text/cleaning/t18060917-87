             sworn. I was in company with Armstrong on the 29th of August at an old iron shop, Raven row, Spital Fields; when we were in the shop the prisoner at the bar came just with in the threshold of the door with something of that kind wrapped up in his apron; the shop is kept by a jew; he gave the prisoner a wink with his eye and a nod with his head, he immediately turned out of his shop and I immediately followed him; about ten yards from the shop I got hold of him, I told him I was an officer of Worship street office, and I would certainly see what he had got in his apron, I looked in his apron, I saw this bit of carpeting, I then asked where he lived or who he worked for, he said that was no business of mine; I searched his pockets, I found a letter with Mr. Sadgrove's direction, I sent down to Mr. Sadgrove, he came up to the office and said it was his property.</p>
               <p>(The property identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the piece of carpet to carry a bedstread; I never was in any jew's shop in my life, I was walking along, the officer stood on the cill of the door, he asked me what I had got there, I said I had a bit of carpet.</p>

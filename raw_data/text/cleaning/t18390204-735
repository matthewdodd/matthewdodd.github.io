                  </hi>. I live in Lark Hall-lane, Clapham, and am an attorney. On the 22nd of January, I was in St. Martin's-lane—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned instantly, and saw the prisoner about a foot behind me, with both his hands behind him, and my handkerchief in his hand—I said, "How came you by that handkerchief?"—he said, "What handkerchief?" I said, "The one you took out of my pocket"—he threw it down—I took it up, and placed my arm round his neck—he struggled, and nearly threw me down in the mud, but I put out my right hand, and a friend assisted me—I got up again, and put my arm round his neck again—he struck me about the head and body, and called to some companions to help him, but I held him till the officer came and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I was coming down St. Martin's-lane—there was a crowd, and the prosecutor was calling "Police"—I ran up, and collared the prisoner—he said, "I will go with you, but I am not going to be lugged about for nothing"—here is the handkerchief, it was not soiled at all—he was struggling very hard with the prosecutor.</p>

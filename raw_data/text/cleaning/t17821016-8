               <p>On the 7th of July on Sunday morning about six o'clock, I took the prisoner with something which will be produced on his back; the prisoner lodged at my house about two days, the prisoner was coming down stairs with his knapsack full of things, he is a <rs id="t17821016-8-deflabel41" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>The things in the knapsack were found in my house; two men came on Saturday the 17th of some month, I cannot charge my memory; one of the men seemed to be like a soldier, I know the man that was tried before, the prisoner is the other man, he is greatly altered, but that is the man; I came in while they were selling something to my man, my man bid him 5 s. for them, I offered them 5 s. 9 d. one said I will be damned if you shall have them, then they returned and sold them for 5 s. 9 d. they consist of old iron, and brass and locks, and several things.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell particularly what they are. - Here are the things mentioned in the indictment, the brass locks and iron locks, here is a part of the engine.</p>
               <p>Court to Horwood. What may these things be worth? - They may be worth 30 s. they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Court to Franklin. These men appeared like soldiers? - One of them had coloured cloaths on.</p>
               <p>They were both strangers to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to buy a variety of articles of these strangers worth 30 s. for 5 s. 9 d.? - To me, to sell again, they are not worth the money: I deal in all sorts of metal.</p>
               <p>Court. And with all sorts of people.</p>
               <p>Jury. I would give him 5 s. for one of the locks.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had stood at that bar, indicted for receiving these goods, on this evidence, that jury I have no doubt would have convicted you; I advise you to be more careful for the future: receivers make thieves.</p>

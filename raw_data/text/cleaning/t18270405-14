            . I am carman to Edmund Ronalds, of Upper Thames-street. On the 28th of February, about twelve o'clock, I had thirty firkins of butter in my cart, which stood at <placeName id="t18270405-14-crimeloc74">Gerrard's Hall, Basing-lane</placeName>

I saw a crowd in pursuit, and before I got up the prisoners were in custody, and the firkin on the pavement.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Bailey, a carman. I was standing in Bread-street, close to the church, talking to two people; Ronalds' cart passed me, and three men were following it - their backs were towards me; I could see down Basing-lane, and saw the cart turn down Basing-lane; I kept looking, and in less than five minutes they all three returned, one having the tub of butter on his shoulder - that was Watts; the other two eased it a little, as he turned the corner; they went on towards Old Fish-street - I followed, and said, "Stop him!" Watts immediately threw it off his shoulder, but was stopped, without my losing sight of him; Haddow, who was talking to me, laid hold of Moore directly - he was one of the three.</p>

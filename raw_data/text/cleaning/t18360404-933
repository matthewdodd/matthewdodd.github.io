                  </hi>. I live at No. 430, West Stand, in the employ of Messrs. William Stratton and co., linen-drapers. On the morning of the 19th of March, the prisoner, in company with another girl, came to look at some silk handkerchiefs; and, from information I received from a young man, I watched, and saw the prisoner take this piece, of seven silk hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs, from the counter, and conceal them under her shawl—they are worth 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they being to Mr. William Statton and two other persons, his partners—the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I can undertake to say that they fell nearer the prisoner than any other person—it fell close to her—she had a shawl on, under which it must have been hidden under when she first got up.</p>

I did not, I can assure you—the handkerchief was full two yards from me, and was pushed along past Davies's elbow—the box the edging was in was pushed by—he would not show the edging to me—the gentleman said, "If you have got them give them up, I will let you go" I said, "I have not got them?"—he then said to the young gentleman, "Are you sure you saw her take them"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Why did you not come and take them from me?" I held my shawl quite open, and said I had not got any thing of the kind-the handkerchief he cut off was half-a-crown, which she had in her hand, and the policeman would not let her pay for it.</p>

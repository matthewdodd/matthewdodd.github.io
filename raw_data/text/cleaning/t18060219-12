               <p>Q. Have you the whole house. - A. Only the kitchen. About six o'clock on the 24th of January I went out of an errand (the candles were lighted in the shops), I double locked my door, I was gone about a quarter of an hour; when I came back I saw a number of people at the door, I went up to my door, I saw it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of force or violence on the door. - A. The lock was sadly bent with the force; I missed from my room my brother's coat, she had the coat in her hand, and the kettle was down on the ground by her, as she was standing at the door.</p>

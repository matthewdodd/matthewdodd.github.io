On Sunday, the 14th of March, I went to take a walk with my wife between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. We returned about seven o'clock in the evening - it was nearly dark. I tried, but could not unlock the door, as there was something in the lock; I tried again, and the key went in all of a sudden, when two men opened the door, and ran out. I instantly seized them both - the prisoner was one; he struck me on the head with something which cut my head through my hat. Both hit me several times; the blow stunned me, and the blood ran dow my face, I staggered, caught hold of the wall, and they ran off. The prisoner turned round, and said</p>
               <p>"He is done for." I instantly recovered myself, and pursued. A man caught the prisoner, and I immediately seized him, and brought him back to my house. On my taking him back, he dropped a telescope, which was mine; I had left it on the table. He also dropped a dark lanthorn - I lost the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Where did he drop the telescope - A. At the door.</p>
               <p>ELLEN DEAKIN. I went out with my husband. I followed the men, who rushed out of the house; they blew the candle out. The prisoner was never out of my sight, until he was taken - I am certain he was one of them; they struck my husband on the head. All the drawers were broken open and emptied, and the articles stated in the indictment gone.</p>

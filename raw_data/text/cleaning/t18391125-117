                  </hi>. I am the daughter of William Rowland, who keeps a grinder's shop in Cross-street, Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the morning of the 13th of November, I was in a room adjoining the shop—I heard a chinking of money, and went into the shop directly—I saw the prisoner coming from behind the counter, I caught hold of him, and asked what business he had there—I do not recollect that he made any answer<lb></lb>he got from me by struggling—I followed him outside the shop, and caught him again—there was another boy outside, to whom he attempted to give what be had got in his hand, but I was too close to allow of that—I laid hold of the prisoner, and he dropped four shillings—a little girl who was going by picked them up, and gave them to me—I took the prisoner in, and gave him into custody—I noticedthat the till was drawn out, and the prisoner came from the end of the counter, where the till was—I thought there had been about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I gave the four shillings to my father, who gave them to the officer.</p>

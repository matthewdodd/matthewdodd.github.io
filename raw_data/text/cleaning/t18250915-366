            . The prisoner was in my employ, and authorised to receive money - he never accounted to me for five sovereigns received of Miss Rivet, for Mr. Dallimore, of the Globe, in Fleet-street - I was present when the officer searched him on the 28th of July, and found five sovereigns in his coat, the officer asked him where he got the money, and he confessed, it was part of Mr. Dallimore's bill; he ought to have accounted to me every day, at five o'clock, for what money he received.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you make this charge before the Magistrates? A. No, because the person could not appear - I had found it out that day, but the Magistrates committed him for the 3 s. 11 d. - I stated this case, but the Magistrate said he could not hear it in the absence of the witness. I told the Magistrate we had found part of Mr. Dallimore's bill, but the whole of it was 6 l. 12 s. - the prisoner did not say he had lost part of this money - he said, he had lost a part of a bill of 13 l. 5 s., which he had received about two months before - he stated he had lost ten guineas, and paid me 4 s. a week.</p>

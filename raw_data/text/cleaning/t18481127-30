                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Rigby and Co., of 80, Gracechurch-street, brush-makers. We have a warehouse in Bull's Head-passage, in which brushes and articles of that kind are kept—it is over a butcher's shop, occupied by Charles Lintot, the prisoners' brother—having missed brushes on several occasions, on 14th Nov. I and the officer Davis placed ourselves to watch the premises on a shelf about six feet above a hole is the boards, where we suspected an entrance had been made from the butcher's shop—the board was down, so that for anybody to get in they must slide or lift it up—about half-past ten o'clock I heard a noise in that direction, and noticed a part of the flooring being raised—I did not see anybody get through the hole; it was too dark—I—heard a footstep go up stairs—I then spoke to Davis, and got down from the shelf, and went to the hole—Davis turned his light on, and I saw Benjamin Lintot with his head just above the hole—Davis tried to seize him, but he dropped down, and Davis fell in trying to catch him—he got up again, and followed him.</p>

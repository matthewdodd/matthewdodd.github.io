               <p>Q. Do you remember going up into the bed-room on the 17th of September, in the afternoon - A. I do; about four o'clock. The first thing I saw was my husband's watch with a gold key, a great coat, a new coat, a pair of smallclothes, two waistcoats, a sheet, and five neck handkerchiefs; one a silk one. I saw all the things then. I locked the room door about four o'clock; I had made the bed. I went down stairs; I left the room door locked.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday, the 17th of September, between eleven and twelve at night, Mr. Dunkley came to me; I went with him; but I made no discovery until Monday. I had some information that the prisoner and another woman had been selling some clothes; I apprehended the other woman first, and when I went to No. 5, Leg-alley, where the prisoner had lodged; she was gone from there; I then went to a court in Clare-market, there I found the prisoner in bed. In that room I found a waistcoat; Mr. Dunkley was with me; he said, it was his, he had had it fourteen years. I took the prisoner in custody, and likewise the woman who had purchased the things of her; the other woman acknowledged that she had purchased them of the prisoner, a coat, waistcoat, and smallclothes, for her husband. I took with me the waistcoat only; there was no other clothes there. Mrs. Homer said the things should be forth coming. In about half a hour after, Mrs. Homer, the landlady, came up to the watchhouse, and brought me a pair of smallclothes; she requested me to look in the pocket; in the pocket of the breeches, I found a duplicate of a blue coat; the blue coat and the breeches are here. Mrs. Dunkley went with the duplicate, and took her husband's blue coat out; she did not understand it. I produce the blue coat, waistcoat, and breeches.</p>

The prisoner told me, she herself, committed the robbery; she said, she took some keys, she unlocked the door, put on her apron to bring the property away, and she locked the door, and took the keys back again; she expected Mr. Dunkley up to search the room, but they could not find any thing in the room; she had sold all the property, but the sheet she had pledged; she did not say where.

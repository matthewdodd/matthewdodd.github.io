            , of Venterer's Hall; he said, he had left his service and had returned again to it; I believed his story to be true, that he was in the service of Mr. Martin. I gave him the article, and the bill of parcel of the same goods. He came again the next day, and said he wanted a pound of black tea and a pound of green tea for the same master's use for the country. I gave that to him, with a bill of parcels. On the 22nd he came again, he then said he wanted a pound of green tea, for town; he represented that to be for his master's town use, it was his master's custom to have a pound of black tea and a pound of green, that he should have taken it the other day; he had the green tea, two pounds and a half of currants, three pounds of moist sugar, and nine pounds of loaf sugar; I let him have them believing him to be Mr. Martin's servant; each time he came he said he was glad of having returned. My brother is my only partner, his name is Thomas; he called again on Saturday the 29th, I had suspicion; I sent to Mr. Martin; the messinger returned, I detained the prisoner, and took him before the Lord Mayor.</p>

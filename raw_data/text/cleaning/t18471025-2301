On Friday afternoon, the 1st of Oct. about ten minutes past five o'clock, I was in Sun-street, Bishopsgate, and I saw the five prisoners at the corner of Ship-alley, with another man who is not is custody—they stood there seven or eight minutes—I saw the prosecutrix come along with a lady and gentleman; they passed by where the prisoners were—when they had passed a few yards, the prisoners and the other man passed on behind the ladies and gentleman—Martin, I be<lb></lb>lieve it was, passed and walked in front of the lady next the kerb—Parker then walked up to the right side of the lady, the other four covered him be<lb></lb>hind, and I distinctly saw Parker put his left hand in the lady's pocket, in her dress; he withdrew his hand instantly, and passed something to the hand of Palmer, who was on his left—I was six or seven yards from them, walking towards Palmer; he looked over his shoulder, saw me, and started off, and Parker followed him—the other four crossed to the other side of the street—I followed Palmer and Parker—Palmer outran me—I caught Parker; he said twice, "I have not got it," and laid down on the ground—I was fearful I should lose the lady, and took Parker up and carried him under my arm, went to the lady, and told her what I had seen—she felt in her pocket and said she had lost her purse.</p>

            . I am butler to the Countess of Barrymore. I had the care of the plate. I lost two silver table spoons on the 16th of January, I found them at one Brotherton's, a pawnbroker, who told me the prisoner pawned them; he was seen going by the door two or three days after, he was apprehended by one of the servants, he was brought into the house, and charged with stealing the spoons; the Countess came in, and the prisoner went down on his knees, and asked her pardon, and said he was very poor, and he hoped she would forgive him, she said she could not, the law must take its course. (the spoons produced.) When they were lost, they had a cypher, a coronet over the cypher, denoting they were once the spoons of the Princess Amelia, but when they were brought back from the pawnbrokers, the cypher and coronet were erased, and they were marked W. I. By observing the spoons, it is easy to see that something has been scratched out.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Little Bell public-house, St. John-street, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. On Saturday, the 16th of May, about half-past nine o'clock at night, Mrs. M'Kinnin came in with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and asked for change—it was placed on the table—there were two females in the room—the prisoner was one—she was in the bar—she had been at my house about two days before—(I did not know her—she was there on the Thursday before, and said she had come to London on account of a law<lb></lb>suit for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my daughter gave her leave to come into the bar, it being a wet evening—this was two days before the transaction)—I gave the note to my daughter, and told her to put it in the drawer—it was on the table—the prisoner said she would put it into the drawer—I cannot say that I saw it in her hand—my daughter and the prisoner were in the bar—when I came back, in a moment, the note was gone—there was nobody in the bar but my daughter and her.</p>

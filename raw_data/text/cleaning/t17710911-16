The prisoner took a garret of me the 12th of August, at 2 s. per week. On the 19th I asked him for the rent; he said he would pay me presently; he went out; I went up stairs, and found the sheets and a pair of blankets gone. I got a warrant and took him up on the parade; he begged I would not hurt him, and he would pay me at two shillings a week out of his pay, and the serjeant should stop it. I went to the serjeant; he would not have any thing to do in it.</p>

She had a pair of stockings or two of mine to wash. I went one evening and again another; I never was there any more. I never spoke to the man, much less took the room of him. My serjeant was here, but the trial was so long he could not stay.</p>

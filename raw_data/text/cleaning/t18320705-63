The prosecutor asked me to go to London; in going along he asked if I had any money - I said No; he said no more had he, and he would give me his daughter's watch to pawn, which I did, and we spent the money together - in going home, we had a few words, and he said, "I will fix you for it;" he then went and stopped it - he has been convicted here himself.</p>

            . There is not a word of truth in it; I had three or four shillings in my pocket; I could have taken the pigs myself, but the prisoner had nothing to do, and I asked him to go with me - I gave him plenty of victuals and drink; he lives next door to me, but hardly ever comes into my house - I was here about two years ago, but I never was tried; it was about a horse I had sold to a young man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You was convicted of stealing a bag of nails, and had six months in the House of Correction, and your son is there now. Witness. No I was not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you partake of any of the money? A. No, I did not - he said he had no money, but he left me in Smithfield, and came again in about an hour; he then said he had seen his sister, who gave him 1s., and a cousin of his, who gave him 1s. 6d.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a shop in Bosher's-court, Tottenham-court-road. On the 4th of February I saw some persons at my door—I went out, and missed these boots—I found the prisoner about twenty yards off with them in his possession—I caught hold of him, and said, "I hate caught you now"—he begged me to let him go, and said he was a very poor man, and he seemed to be so—these ore my boots—they had been on the step of the door, but I had not put them out—some per<lb></lb>sons had been stopping at the door, but I do not know that he was one.</p>

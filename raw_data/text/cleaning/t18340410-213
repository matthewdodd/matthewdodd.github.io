               <p>JOHN CONERLEY (police-constable H 135.) On the 12th of March, about a quarter past seven o'clock, I was on duty in Essex-street, Whitechapel - I saw the prisoner come out of Whitechapel, with these three cheeses on his head - I asked what he had got there? - he said, he brought them from Ratcliffe Highway, and was to meet a man at Shoreditch church with them, who would give him 1s. - I said that would not do for me, and was taking him to the station-house - he threw down the cheeses, and ran away - I left my brother officer with the cheeses - I pursued, and took the prisoner.</p>

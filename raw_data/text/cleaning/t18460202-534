I was coming over Blackfriars-bridge, and saw Lambert take hold of the prosecutrix's gown with his left hand, and take a purse very dexterously from her pocket with his right hand, and give it to his companion, M'Carthy—the prosecutrix was at the moment crossing off the pavement—I said to her, "You are robbed"—she felt, and missed her purse—I am sure Lambert was the person who did it.</p>

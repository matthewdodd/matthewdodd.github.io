            . I am an officer. I live at No. 7, Barrosa-terrace, which is the next house. On the 19th of September, the prisoner, Knock, called on me for the key which was left with me, and a bill in the window referred persons to me for it; the other prisoner was with him. I believe him to be the man; when they had got the key I went into my yard, and my attention was drawn to the house by a noise like wrenching, I got over the paling to the house, looked throught the kitchen window, and saw Knock and the other prisoner apparently twisting the leaden pipe - They were stooping, I ran to the front door and into the kitchen, and charged them with stealing the pipe; I collared the other man, one of them took his hand out of his pocket, put it through a broken window, and threw something into the garden; the other man rushed by me into the street, Knock ran after me and threw me down stairs, they both got out and took separate directions; I followed Knock through a field, calling, "Stop thief!" I secured him and brought him back; I never lost sight of him. I found the leaden pipe twisted off, and we fixed it to the other part and it corresponded; it was fresh wrenched off-the brass cock was found immediately, under the window in the garden.</p>

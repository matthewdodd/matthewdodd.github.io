About half-past four o'clock in the morning of the 1st of April, I saw several persons in White-street, which is near these premises; it was twilight - I watched them, and while I was informing my brother watchmen, up came the prisoner, with his coat buttoned from top to bottom; I told him I thought he was about no good, it being Sunday morning; he turned short round on his heel, and ran as hard as possible - I followed, crying Stop thief! and saw him drop this piece of printed cotton; he was not three minutes' walk from the premises; I only lost sight of him in turning the corner, and am certain of him - nobody was before him - I secured him; he said he was stopped for nothing - a watchman came up with the cotton, which he had dropped at the corner of White-court, White-street.</p>

I saw the prisoner come out of Sweeden-passage into Moor-lane - I pursued him through White-street, and by No. 8, I saw him drop this print; I told a watchman to pick it up; it was taken to the watch-house, and claimed by the prosecutors - I followed him into Rope-maker-street; I only lost sight of him in turning the corner; no other person was to be seen in the street - I secured him; it was quite daylight; after that I saw three people taking property away from the prosecutors' premises; I took some from one of them.</p>

               <p>Burchel. It was not lock'd, but fastened with a string twisted round a nail.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Burchel. He was taken up by a watchman, on suspicion of robbing another house, and to the constable and the watchman he had confessed the robbing of mine; so they brought him to me, and he told me before them, that he and two others had got over the wall into my garden, that they found the door only fastened with a string, which they cut with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the string to have been cut?</p>
               <p>Burchel. It was cut; he said they took the copper pot and tea kettle from out of the places where they had stood, describing the places.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what time of the night it was when they got in?</p>

             seven or eight years, she is a very honest woman; she came in with the pot to Mrs. Goddard's.

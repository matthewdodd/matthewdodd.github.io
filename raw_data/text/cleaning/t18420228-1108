I have examined the sacks produced by a policeman—they belong to them, and were in the warehouse on the evening of the 24th of February, at seven o'clock—when I shut up, I saw them safe—I secured the ware-house myself at that time—on the same evening, about nine o'clock, in consequence of information I received, I went to the warehouse, and met Laidler, about twenty or thirty yards from the warehouse, with a bundle of sacks upon his back—I stopped him, and asked where he was going with them—he said somebody had engaged him to carry them—I asked him to return to the warehouse—I took him back, and kept them till I got a policeman—I examined the warehouse, which is by the side of</p>

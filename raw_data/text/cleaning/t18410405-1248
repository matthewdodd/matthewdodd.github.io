                  </hi>. I am thirteen year old—I am the son of Martin Mero, a manner, and live in Edward-street, Limehouse-fields. On Thursday, the 18th of March, I went to Greenwich—Palmer went with me—I had nine sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and a watch-chain in my pocket—I stole the ten sovereigns from my mother—I left heron the 17th—we went down to the Greenwich rail-road station, and then went to Deptford theatre, after walking about all day—after we came away we came by an eating-house—I said, "I will go and tell a policeman the crime, and he will take me home"—I did not do so—Palmer said, perhaps we might get a lodging-house—we did get one at the prisoner Moriarty's—a man named Smale took us there—Palmer paid her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two of us to sleep there that night—she took us to an adjoining house—about nine o'clock next morning she opened the door, and let us out—after walking about all day we came back about a quarter to seven o'clock—after a little while Palmer said he was very dry, and sent Mrs. Moriarty out for a pot of beer, and I sent for a pot, then he sent out for another pot—then Mrs. Moriarty said, "We have had enough beer, let us have some gin"—then Palmer sent out for half a pint of gin, and then there were two half-pints more sent for—by this time we were getting pretty drunk—then she said we had had enough gin, let us have some rum, but she did not return with rum, it was some sickly kind of stuff, it was sweet in your mouth, and bitter afterwards—I know the taste of rum—she returned with it in a pint pot, and told Palmer to drink hearty out of it—he did so, and</p>

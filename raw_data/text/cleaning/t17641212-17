The prisoner came to my house, on the 21st of November, between four and five in the afternoon, and called for a pot of beer; he had a woman with him; he took her into a back room, where they were some time: after that, he came to the bar, and asked for a half-penny-worth of gin; I served him; the woman then I believe was gone: he then went into the back-kitchen, and spoke to the child over my wife's shoulder. When he was gone, my wife immediately followed him, and said to me, he had taken a silver spoon: I missed it immediately, as he was bidding a gentleman good night, about a yard or two from the door. I went and laid hold of his arm, and said, Sir, I believe you have got a spoon of mine, and insisted on his going back to be searched: I put him into the little room, where he and the woman had been together. I called for a candle, and as he was fumbling, I saw the handle of the spoon in his hand; I said I saw it; then he gave it into my hand: (produced and deposed to.) I charged him with another I had lost, of the 27th of October, and he owned he did take it: that I never had again.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you missed these things? - We missed them only that morning looking over our things, she was then going away; there is a waistcoat of mine, and some other things of mine, that I found at the pawnbroker's, but the man that drew up the indictment said, as I had not got them again, there was no occasion to put them in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before? - I I never did to my knowledge, she came to the house of Mrs. Brown's, and left a pair of sheets for nine shillings.</p>

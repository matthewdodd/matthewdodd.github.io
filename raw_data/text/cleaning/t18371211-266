                  </hi>. I live at No. 24, Ludgate-street, in the parish of St. Gregory by St. Paul, in the City of London. I know the prisoners by sight—I found them at my shop on Wednesday evening, the 6th of December—my young man told me they had taken a diamond ring, and placed another instead of it, and I gave them in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Walton's service. About five o'clock last Wednesday afternoon, the two prisoners came and asked to look at some diamond rings—I showed them some small ones—they said they wanted to see some larger, which I showed them—on turning my eye I saw there was a tray of brooches there, and I put it into the window—I turned, and then a man came in and asked to look at some tooth-picks—our boy went to speak to him, and I saw Melloy go to the door—Allen was then looking at the rings—the other man went out—Melloy then returned, and persuaded Allen not to have a ring to-night—I had shown him one ring at sixty guineas, and saw a common rose-diamond ring in its place—I said, "It is very strange, there was a sixty guinea ring here, and now I see this beastly thing"—I requested they would wait till Mr. Walton came.</p>

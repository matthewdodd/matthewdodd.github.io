            ; on Monday, the 29th of April, between five and six o'clock, the two prisoners at the bar came in for a piece of print for a gown; I was up stairs at the time Mr. Pitt was shewing them the print; I came and stood on the stairs, and they both looked at me in a way which I thought very suspicious; when I came into the shop, she pretended she could not find her pocket; the man stepped in between the woman and me, and she turned round and dropped the print from under her petticoat; I saw it drop from her; when I took it up it was warm.</p>

               <p>Merryman's defence. I had been to the warehouse, and I met my brother accidentally; I told him I wanted to buy a gown against Whitsuntide; I asked him to go into this shop with me, and I there looked at some prints; I asked him if he would take so much off for the gown; he said, how much was I going to pay; he could not take less than half a crown a yard; I bid him two shillings and four-pence; he said how many yards did I want; I said, six and a half; in measuring the piece, he shoved that piece from the counter; I directly picked it up, and this gentleman here came up from behind me, and said, I had dropped it; (that is the very truth about it) he said he had lost about twenty or thirty pounds that week; and he would make me pay for all.</p>

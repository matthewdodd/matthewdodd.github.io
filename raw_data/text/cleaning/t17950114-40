               <p>On Tuesday the 23d of December, the cart was sent out between two and three o'clock, and about five o'clock I heard of the loss.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am carman to Mr. Deykins; I was sent out with some parcels in the cart; Jenkins is my fellow servant; I went to deliver a parcel on <placeName id="t17950114-40-crimeloc237">Fish-street-hill</placeName>

When I came back to the cart I see a man discoursing with Jenkins, not this prisoner, and this prisoner at the bar was on the shafts of the cart, with a parcel in his arms taking it from the cart, upon which I runs and seizes hold of him, shoved the parcel from him on to the copse, and pulled him off from the copse of the cart; he had it completely in his arms off from the copse of the cart. He did not get away from me, but it was some time before I could get him secured to take him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the parcel? - I took the parcel where it was directed to go into Wapping; I was afraid to go back with the parcel; I left it there all night and went for it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you whether it was the same parcel you received the next morning? Did you put your mark on it that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the directions sufficient to know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to the next morning? - I delivered it to the hands of my master's son.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has had it ever since? - I delivered it to Mr. Deykins, junior.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you see that parcel before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brings it here? - I received it of my master this morning, Mr. Deykins, junior. This is the parcel, it was cut open at the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to this charge—I have also gone by the name of Henry Simpson, which is my real name—I have been in prison before, and came out on 16th March—on 18th March I met Lawrence in King-street, Covent-garden—I bad seen him in Coldbath<lb></lb>fields prison—he asked me what I had been doing since I left—I said I had done nothing; I had been at home with my aunt and sister—I had told him in prison what I had been charged with—he said I was a foolish fellow, and he could tell me things that would bring me more money, with less danger to myself—I had never seen him before but in the prison—he told me a public-house be used of an evening, and the hours he was at home at his own house; and, also, that he always bad 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by him; and if I brought anything, he would buy it of me—he asked me to come to his house next morning, and go out with him—I went about half-past 10; and we have made appointments since that time, and, unless I have been too late for him, we have been out almost three days every week since, and always shared the same purse—on 29th April I met him about half-past 10, and was with him the remainder of the day, excepting at dinner and teatime—we passed the prosecutor's shop, in Fleet-street; and he told me to go in, as there was no one of any conse<lb></lb>quence there—I went into the shop, parting with Lawrence next door—I have heard the statement made by Shelford as to what took place in the shop, and I took three antique rings clandestinely—I came out, and joined Lawrence at the corner of Bell-yard—he pulled out his watch, and said, "What a long time you have been in there! I think it is an hour and a half; have you done</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Garratt, pawnbroker, of 22, Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. I have known Lawrence some time—on 1st May he brought one of these rings to me, and asked 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I told him it was one of three which had been stolen—he said he knew the party he had it from, and he would go and fetch him—I detained the ring, and gave it to the policeman on duty—I could not stop Lawrence; I had no one in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 17, Ann-street, Waterloo-road, in the same house as the prisoner Stevens lived. Lawrence was in the habit of calling there almost every morning—on 30th April he came about 11 o'clock—he had on two large cameo rings, one on each little finger, and also one in his hand—he said he was going into the Waterloo-road to <hi rend="italic">put it away.</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 27). I am a sergeant, of the detective force. On 1st May, about 12 o'clock, Lawrence came to Scotland-yard, and gave me some information which caused me to go to a pawnbroker's with sergeant Saunders and Lawrence to ascertain the truth of the statement—on the way there I met Stevens—he stopped to speak to Lawrence, I took him into custody, and Saunders took Lawrence—we took them to Bow-street, and I told Stevens I apprehended him on suspicion of stealing three rings from a shop in Fleet-street—he made no reply—I left Stevens at Bow-street, and went with Lawrence for the purpose of ascertaining at the Fleet-street station where the rings were stolen from; and when we were passing the prosecutor's shop, Lawrence said, "If you go in there, I think you will find that was the place the rings came from."</p>

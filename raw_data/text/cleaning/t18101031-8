On the night of the 9th of September the pigs were safe in the sty; on the next morning at six o'clock I went to the hog-sty, the pigs were gone; the staple of the pig-sty was broken, and the door forced open. On the next day I went in search of the pigs, and in Sash-court, Wilson-street, Moorfields, there I found one of the sows alive; we took the prisoner with us there. In consequence of information we went to a stable in a court in the Old Bailey, and in that stable we found the prisoner; then we took the prisoner with us to Sash-court; he told us where he lived, he pointed out the house to us, and when I got there I knew that sow to be my master's; the prisoner said he did not know any thing about it.</p>

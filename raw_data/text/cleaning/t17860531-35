My reason for attending here was, I understood that from a particular likeness to some individual, a man of a very notorious character, he might be mistaken; and I meant to identify his person, and say his name is Brown; he has gone by the name of Brown ever since I have known him, and I knew him at that period I have mentioned; I knew so much of him, as to exclude the possibility of his being a notorious bad character.</p>

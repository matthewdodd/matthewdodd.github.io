                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In November last I received instruction to apprehend the prisoner—I endeavoured to do so, but did not succeed till Friday, the 12th of April, when I went with Shaw, to No.8, Richmond-place, Lisson-grove, to the first-floor back-room—I found the door locked—I knocked and called, but nobody answered—I then called "Mrs. Turner," knowing she occupied that room—the door was unlocked at last—I saw the prisoner, and asked his name—he said it was Turner, and he was the son of Mrs. Turner—Shaw—then entered the room, and called him Cummins—he said, "My name is Turner"—he was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody—he said he had been to Bristol, and came up last Saturday.</p>

When I came home on the 10th of December my wife, who was ill in bed, told me the prisoner had begged to go out to buy a ribbon - she did not return: the next day I missed the articles stated in the indictment, and went to her mother, but the prisoner was not found till the 1st of January, and on the 2d her mother brought her to my house, with this shawl and bonnet, which are mine; the prisoner said she had pawned the coat at Mr. Aaron's, in Whitechapel, and wished to know if I would take her again - I inquired at the pawnbroker's, but the coat had been redeemed a night or two after it was pawned, and has not been found.</p>

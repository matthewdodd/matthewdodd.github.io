On the 17th of December, between two and four o'clock in the afternoon, I lost the boots from my tool-house, adjoining my dwelling-house; my yard door was on the latch, and so was the tool-house door; I missed the boots after four o'clock. I went next day to inquire if any jack-ass boys had been seen about, and found that the prisoners had been our way, selling catsup. I went to town, and found the two prisoners at the Bull's Head, Kingsland's-road; they were taken into custody.</p>

            . I am a smith; I was at the Bull's Head, in Kingsland-road; about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, Taylor, came into the house with a pair of boots, he asked me if I knew any body that would buy them; I told him I would go and see; I took them out of his hand, and went to Saunders's-gardens, which is close to the house, and offered them to Gadsden for 12s., he offered me 10s. for them; I went to Taylor, and he said I might let him have them - I did, and gave the money to Taylor, and he gave me a shilling for my trouble; he told me if Blake should come in, and ask what I sold them for, to say six shillings. In about a quarter of an hour Blake came in, and said, if he had been there at the time they should not have been sold for that money. I was quartered at the Bull's Head.</p>

I took Ingram to Gadsden's house, and he gave me the boots; we took the three to the office, and I heard both Taylor and Baker say, it was the first thing they had ever done, and that it was through distress.</p>

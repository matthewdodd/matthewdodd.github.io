               <p>I am an errand-boy to Mr. Goodson, in Change-alley; I lived with him four years; on Saturday the 13th of January, between twelve and one, I was opposite Field-lane, I saw the prisoner in company with two others, I went and stood opposite to Field-lane; I had a suspicion; I heard the prisoner whisper to the other two and the prisoner went to the cart; they were close by me; he said something to the boy, but what I could not hear; the boy immediately got upon the step of the cart; I saw the other boy put his hand in, but I did not see him take any thing out; the prisoner went and put his hand into the cart, and pulled out a scarlet cloak.</p>
               <p>What coloured cart was it? - It was a pleasure cart; it was green I think.</p>
               <p>What did he do with the cloak? - He ran across the way with it.</p>
               <p>What did you do? - I went into Messrs. Stafford's and Blundel's shop to the prosecutor, and told him that a man had stole a cloak out of the cart; the prisoner was taken in half an hour after in Field-lane; I saw him after; I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Towseland.

               <p>On Friday evening last, about ten minutes before seven, a gentleman that lives opposite alarmed me, and I went out, and saw two men, as I thought, in the very act of cutting lead upon the top of my house: the noise of the people alarming them, they desisted and went to the parapet wall of my neighbour, and laid all along in the gutter: I went up stairs with my neighbour, who said, he had had a bricklayer and labourer at work all day, and had sent to them to know why they did not leave off, I went up stairs and met the prisoner Murphy the labourer; I took him in custody, I went into the garret, and just as I got into the the garret, the prisoner Murphy stood by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140179"></xptr> a basket and some tools, just by the parapet wall, where I saw him lay down under the window; I charged him with stealing lead, he denied it; the lead weighed about twenty-six pounds, it was twenty feet, it was very narrow, it is only the edging of a gutter: the house is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Marney, Did not you say you had been robbed a great many times, and I should pay for all? - I did say to the same purport, I have been robbed a great many times.</p>

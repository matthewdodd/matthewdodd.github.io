                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live in Frith-street, Soho. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half—he owed me an account in Oct. last, and on the 14th of Oct., in the afternoon, he came to my house, and pro<lb></lb>duced this bill of exchange—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said he had drawn that bill on Mr. Breese, as the result of his quarter's account with that gentleman, and if I would give him the difference we would <hi rend="italic">square up</hi>, or something—he said Breese was one of his the employers; that he was a coach-plater, living in Hart-street, Covent-garden: that it was a genuine <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> trade bill, and would be met—it had what appeared to be Breese's acceptance on it at the time, and he was speaking of that—in consequence of what he said, I took the bill—I knew there was such a person as Breese, and that he was a respectable person—I gave the prisoner 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I cannot exactly tell what he owed me, but I believe I paid him 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the bill is for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he owed me the differ<lb></lb>ence—I think it was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I gave him—it was that or 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but the learned gentlemen are surrounding me so that I can hardly tell which; if I had a fair field I could do.</p>

Q.</hi> It is not at all like your writing, is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It does a little resemble it in the name Breese, except the E—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner about twenty years, but had not seen him for twelve years, till within the last three years—he is a master smith—during the three years we have done a little business together—I never accepted but two bills for him in my life—the last was in January, 1846—he came to me, and said, if I would oblige him by accepting a 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, he could not exactly tell what time the party would discount it, and asked me to leave the date—this is it,(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>,) and the only one in existence—there never was but one previous to this, which was one for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner destroyed that—the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was an ac<lb></lb>commodation bill—I did not owe him a shilling—I had paid him my accounts. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not an account between you at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing but a few jobs—not 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I accepted it entirely to accommodate him, as he said in three months he could take it up—I did not pay that bill—he gave me a memorandum at the time.</p>
               <p>

               <p>the 19th Jan., 1846—I objected, and did not accept another—he said he had given it to a person to give cash for it, and had lost it—I said, "I should like to see the party, give me his address"—he said he did not exactly know the address, it was somewhere about Clerkenwell—he gave me a memorandum that it was lost, which I have here.</p>

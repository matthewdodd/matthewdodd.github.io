(Produced and deposed to.) I kept it in my possession ever since; I shewed it directly to Mr. Parker; he said, it was his handkerchief; he felt and missed one.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was going across Smithfield, and they took me; they attempted to swear away my life last session *, and they said now this will do: if it is not true may God never receive my soul.</p>
               <p>* This prisoner was acquitted last session of a highway robbery, by the parties not attending; and this larceny was committed within ten minutes after his discharge from Newgate.</p>

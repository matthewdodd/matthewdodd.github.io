            . I am the wife of the last witness; I was at home; the doors and windows were closed; I have one lodger; he was at home; he came in about twenty minutes before six o'clock - the door was shut I am sure. About half-past six o'clock an alarm was given (it was not quite dark,) I ran to the door, and found it was open; the prisoner was brought back; there was day-light enough to distinguish the features of a man; he had the looking-glass, which was nailed to the wall in the front parlour just before; it cost nearly 4 l.; we have had it about three years; he was an entire stranger - I had seen it in the room in the course of the day.</p>

            . I am an oilman, and live at the corner of Smith-street. I was watching on the spot for ten minutes, seeing the prisoner and another standing outside the door, talking; the door was open; the other person went into the house, and came out three times, without any thing; and the fourth time he brought out the looking-glass, and gave it to the prisoner, who walked off with it. Fleetwood and I collared him about twelve yards off; he immediately dropped it, and it smashed to pieces; he said, if we would forgive him, he would tell who the people were that were with him.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite Hanson. I saw four of them about the door. I went to my private door, and saw one of them go in and come out again; and at last the glass was brought out, and given to Naylor. I ran and took him - his companions walked off, and he dropped it.</p>

I went into the Northampton-arms, public-house, to have a pint of beer; I drank it; and as I came out of the door, two very respectable persons asked where there was a porter - I said I would carry it for them - they told me to follow them and they would give me a parcel to carry to a coach. They went into the house; I stood at the door and they brought me the glass.</p>

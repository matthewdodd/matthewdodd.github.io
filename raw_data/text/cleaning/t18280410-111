On the 26th of March, about twenty minutes before four o'clock, my daughter Sarah Anna was standing at the door- she is two years and a half old; she had two rows of coral beads round her neck; I heard some one say, "That woman has taken the child's necklace;" I looked out, and saw the child without the beads; I did not see the prisoner.</p>

            . I was passing the prosecutor's house, and saw the child standing about two yards from the door - I saw the prisoner and another come up to her; the prisoner kissed the child, and took the necklaces - I I thought there was something wrong, and I said, "I don't think she belongs to the child;" I then saw her run; I went to her, tapped her on the shoulder, and said, "You have taken the necklace from that child;" the constable came by, and took her back; she was taken in; Mr. Gardiner searched her, but nothing was found on her; the constable then said, I must go up to the watch-house; - I said I was very sorry, I thought the woman would have given it up; I was then taken to the office to give evidence.</p>

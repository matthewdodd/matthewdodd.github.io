On the 24th of December I saw this cloak moving from my shop, but did not see the face of the person who took it; an alarm was given - I ran out, and caught sight of the prisoner about ten yards off; he was looking round - he then ran down Jewry-street, and was stopped without my losing sight of him; I saw him throw something from under his arm, which turned out to be the cloak - I laid hold of him the moment he was stopped, and the cloak was brought to the watch-house; it hung on a line just within the door; he made a great resistance, struck me, and kicked my shins - he struck my son, and injured him very much; he was unable to lift his arm for two or three days.</p>

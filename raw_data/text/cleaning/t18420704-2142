                  </hi>. I live in Bryanston-square. On Tuesday evening, the 28th of June, I was in Hyde-park about ten o'clock—as I was cross<lb></lb>ing the Park a soldier came up to me on the line between Kensington-bridge and Cumberland-gate, and accused me with interfering with him when he was with a girl—I denied any knowledge of him—I had not seen him, or any girl, or any thing of the kind—he laid hold of my coat—I tried to extricate myself from him, a tustle ensued, and I was thrown on the ground with violence—I had my watch in my waistcoat pocket, attached to a gold chain, which was round my neck—I got up, and a</p>

On Tuesday, the 28th, about twenty minutes past ten o'clock, or there—about, I was in bed in my barracks, in Portman-street, Portman-square, when Robertson came into my room—our barracks are from three to four or five hundred yards from Hyde-park—he seemed to be in a perspiration—be came up to the bed, and showed me a watch in his hand, and asked me what I thought of it—I told him I did not know what to think of it—I desired him to go to his bed, and he did—he showed it me again next morning—I observed it—it appeared to me to be a gold watch with a silver dial, and gold hands to it—I should know it again, I think—after I returned from the parade, I found Robertson confined in the black-hole—Patterson came up to the barrack-room, came up to Robertson's bed, and took the watch out of a hair cap—I said, "What are you doing there?"—he said, "I am to take care of Robertson's watch till he comes out of the black-hole"—he did this openly, so that anybody could see him—I did not ask Robertson how he came by the watch, and he did not tell me—I did not see Patterson take the watch out of the room—I saw it was him in the room—that might have been about eleven o'clock—I did not ask Robert<lb></lb>son how he came to be so hot, or where he had been, nor how he got the watch—I had never seen him with one before—the watch which Patterson took from the hair cap was the same that Robertson had shown me.</p>

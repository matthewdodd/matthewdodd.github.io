On the 7th of April, about half past one o'clock in the afternoon, John Kenton, alias Brooks, he is well known by different names, I saw him break my window with a knife, at the same time I saw him draw the three toy watches out of the hole that he had made; the hole was not large enough for him to put his hand in; I went out and took him, I took him to Worship-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the watches upon him. - A. No, I did not; there were two more in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you saw this. - A. I am sure I saw this.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the watches there soon before this. - A. I had put them there a few hours before that; I have never seen them since.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him lurking about before this happened had you. - A. No; when I took him he said he had not been near the window; he attempted to get away from me, but I held him so close I prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the value of your toy watches. - A. Seven shillings each.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Thomas Pryce Jones, a pawnbroker, in Tothill-street. On the night of the 29th of April I was opposite the shop, and saw the prisoner coming out of the passage with something under his coat as if concealing it—he went to the side door, and went in again—I met him again, and stopped him—he struck me twice, and finding him too strong I called for assistance—the shopman came, we found these things at the door which separates the public passage from the private passage, just where I saw the prisoner turn round to go in again—the coats had hung on some pegs in the passage—it was then a quarter-past nine o'clock, and business was closed—there was no entry but through the private passage where the man had got the shutters from to shut the shop up—the prisoner said he had come to look for his wife, who had come to pledge a handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. At a quarter-past nine o'clock I was going up stairs, and had not passed the place where these coats were on the pegs a minute, when I heard the coats thrown down—I ran down again, and saw the coats down at the passage door, and the prisoner was stopped by Baker—the coat had been removed about a yard from where I bad seen them safe—I picked them up.</p>

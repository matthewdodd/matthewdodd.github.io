I stooped down to pick it up, and she thrust her hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took out a little canvass bag with a shilling in it; I immediately seized her - she fastened her teeth into my hand. I called the watchman, who forced the bag out of her hand with the shilling in it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw Warner as I was calling twelve o'clock; he was quite sober. There was a great noise - I saw his hat off, he said, this women has robbed me - he was trying to get the bag out of her hand; he took it out, and gave it me. When I saw her I said,</p>
               <p>"It is you Miss Oldfield is it, you must come with me." She was very impudent, and in liquor.</p>

We went into the Queen's Head, public-house, and had a glass each; he began to be very sick, and said he would go home with me all night - I said he should not, he said if I did not give him a lodging, he would give me one. The watchman came up, and he had the purse in his hand all the while.</p>

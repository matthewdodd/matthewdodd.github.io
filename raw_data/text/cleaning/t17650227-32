I told him what we had lost; he came and let us know that he had seen some chairs in the prisoner's apartment: then we got a warrant, and took him before the sitting Alderman: there he said he had bought the chairs: we found seven chairs and a bedstead in Blue Anchor Yard, Bunhill-row, in the prisoner's lodgings, our property: we found afterwards a four post bedstead that the prisoner had sold to a broker in Bunhill-row: the prisoner always denied taking the things.</p>

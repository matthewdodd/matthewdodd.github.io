I keep a public house at Westburn-green, near Mr. Coulson's; his house was broke open on the 27th of September, at night; at about nine o'clock that night the prisoner at the bar came into my house; Mr. Coulson's gardener came in to him a little after; he was a little while in company with him; he went away at nine o'clock, and the prisoner stayed an hour and an half; he was footman to Mr. Coulson, and he had been discharged about a fortnight.</p>

I got up between seven and eight in the morning, and went into the parlour, and there I found the door open; the bar was hanging down, and the bell was in a chair near it; the shutter was open; though the key was in the lock in the inside of the door, yet the door was unlocked, and their was no signs of violence on it,</p>

            . I work at a farm house, near Mr. Coulson's; on Saturday morning, about six o'clock, I was in the fields, behind Mr. Coulson's house, and saw the prisoner walking along a path-way, in the field; he had a parcel, and there was a gown lying on the top, like this gown that has been produced; I thought he had lost his way; I asked him if he had; he said no, he knew where he was very well; he went away, and I went about my business. I never heard of the robbery till the next morning, and then I went and acquainted the family of it, and described the man, that evening he was taken up, at Valentine Townshends. There is a field behind the house, and then a lane, and then another field, where I found this man. The door of the parlour does not open in the garden where the field is, but into another that comes round the house to Westbury green; there is nothing parts the Green but pales of a yard high; from thence a person may go along this path.</p>

               <p>- Speckman I have known the prisoner some years, he lodged with me about a fortnight before he went to Mr. Coulson's. On the 30th of September search was made at my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230040"></xptr> house for some goods the prisoner had left there; he was at my house, on Saturday in the forenoon, and left a box, before he went to live with Mr. Coulson, and desired me to take care of it; on Saturday the 28th he came about ten or eleven o'clock, and brought a small bundle in his hand, it was big enough to contain all the plate; I did not see what was in the bundle. I gave him the key of the room; he went up and stayed a little, and then came down; he had no bundle when he came down. I was present when the box was opened, and the things that have been produced were all found in the prisoner's box.</p>

               <p>I found the things in the field, near the garden, about six o'clock; I thought they were the gardeners, because he was going away; he had desired me to enquire after a place for him; accordingly I removed them from there in order to have a little fun with the gardener; I put them into the field over the gate; when he came he said nothing to me about them, and I said nothing to him, but I told him I had heard of a place, and he appointed to meet me at St. James's in the afternoon, and the gardener not coming I took them to my lodgings; I have no witnesses; I never sent to any body.</p>

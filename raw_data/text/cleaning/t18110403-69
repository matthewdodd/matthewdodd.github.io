On the 15th of March I went with Mrs. Macey and another officer, went with a search warrant to Madden's house No. 6, Brackley Street, Golden Lane, we found a little girl there, the man and woman was not at home, Mrs. Macey picked out three aprons, a sheet, a pair of drawers, a pocket handkerchief, a neck handkerchief, and this she said was the bag that the clothes were in, it is not a bag now, we went up stairs and searched in the two pair of stairs room, there we found this basket under the bed, and in a box six shirts, four neck handkerchiefs, a silk handkerchief, and a pair of drawers. And at the next door a woman had got some things to wash, the woman is here, there we found two shirts, one pocket and one neck handkerchief, which the woman said she had of Mrs. Madden to wash on the 29th. I apprehended Madden and his Wife at the two blue posts Bartholomew Close, we were looking after them from that time to then, I told them what I took them in custody for, she said what do you take the man in custody for, he has done nothing, I said I could not help it, I should take them both in custody, she said I have lived with him a number of years, and have a number of children by him, he knew nothing of it, and she was not his wife. I took them both to the compter.</p>

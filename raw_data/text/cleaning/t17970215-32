               <p>Prisoner's defence. Upon the Tuesday night I had been at work till near twelve o'clock; I am a shoemaker as well as being in the guards; in the night, when I was fast asleep, Mr. Bradley came and waked me, and asked me if I knew any thing of his sister's watch; I told him, no, I did not know she had one, nor did I know that she slept in the house; I got up immediately, and we searched all over the house, and it could not be found; and then they came into my room, and found it; any body might get into the room; there is neither lock nor key to the door; I have slept there two months, and have lost things out of the room myself.</p>

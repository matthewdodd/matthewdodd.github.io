            . I go out to needle-work. On the 8th of June I was near the shop at Old Brentford; I saw the prisoner go to the shop - the door was shut; he opened it, and went in - he came out in about three minutes, with a piece of red print locked under his coat; he had nothing when he went in - he went straight up the lane, as if to go home; I told Mrs. Lawrie of it, and she sent the washerwoman, who watched him home; I could not see the pattern of the print, but it was red.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had business there; I went and knocked at the door, to see if it was settled about the hat. Witness. No, he did not knock; I was opposite, with the baby in my arms.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never stepped my foot in; I had this bundle under my arm which I have now, with some old shoes in it. Witness. I am quite certain he had nothing when he went in, and what he brought out was not this bundle - it was quite a flat bundle.</p>

            . On the evening of the 8th of June, I saw the prisoner come down as I stood at the end of the lane, which is only one house from the shop; he went towards the prosecutor's shop - I took no further notice till about three or four minutes, when he returned with something tucked under the flap of his coat - it was of a red colour, but I did not see what it was; I think it was a larger bundle than the one he has now - it looked like a piece of print.</p>

No one answered me at the door, and I went home; I had bought these shoes for a pint of beer, and I was ashamed of them as they were very bad -Mr. Lawrie came and said, "I have another summons for you, you shall not get off so;" I am as innocent as the Angels in Heaven.</p>

             had hold of him, and took one book out of his pocket. I drew back part of his coat, and saw a book stick out of his pocket. I declined taking it out of his pocket till an officer was present; then the prisoner threw it on the pavement, and the officer took it up, and gave it to Mr. Medley. We asked him if he took any more; he would not confess at first, but he did afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any promise of favour made to him?</p>
               <p>Sterling. It was told him, that it would be better for him if he would confess.</p>

            . I am clerk of the chapel; the service was on the 14th of February. I saw the prisoner coming out of one of the seats in the chapel that we had lost some books out of. I missed two books; I pursued him, and told the sentry to stop him, which he did; and searching in his bosom, he took this prayer book out, wrapped up in a handkerchief. (producing it) Then they took this out of his pocket. (Producing another prayer-book.)</p>

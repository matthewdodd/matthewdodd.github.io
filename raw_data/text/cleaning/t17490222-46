I felt something in my pocket; I turn'd about, and saw my handkerchief, part in my pocket and part out in his hand; says I, you rascal, you have picked my pocket of my handkerchief; says he, I'll stand search. There were three men followed him. Says I, I saw you give it to a man; says he, why did you not charge him with it? I took him into a shop, and shut the door, and sent for a constable. I said a considerable time; there came several people, whose pockets were pick'd to the door. I took him to the watch-house. He once made an attempt to get away; we had a struggle, and was both down together, but I, by the assistance of a porter, got him to the watch-house, and secured him.</p>

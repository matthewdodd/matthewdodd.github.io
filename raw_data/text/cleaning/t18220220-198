About five in the morning he was hunting for a light to go down into the privy, which is in the cellar; he could not find any, but went down without.

I found a bundle in the cellar containing all my property.</p>

            . I live in the same room. I was going to get up in the morning before day-light, and laid the rasp over my head to strike a light with. The prisoner knocked it down, which awoke me. I got up and asked him the time; he said half-past four; but I heard the watchman go half-past five. He said he got up to call a friend, he got a light, and lit my candle; and while he was gone down stairs I looked into my box and missed my trowsers, and my silk handkerchief, which hung on a nail. I found my hat put on the top of his bed, with Oyler's handkerchief and waistcoat. He came up again - I saw him take them and go down with them. We went and took him on the stairs with them in his hand. He said, if we would let him go he would give me my trowsers, and that they were under the cellar stairs. I found them there with Cockey's things.</p>

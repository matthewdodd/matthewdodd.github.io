On the 26th of June I was left in charge of the house—Mellish had been there about six o'clock that morning to do the horses—I left the premises at five minutes after eleven o'clock—I locked every thing up perfectly safe, as I always did, and went away—the counting-house door was locked—the parlour door was locked and the street-door, and the window were down—I left the key of the gate at Mellish's house to enable him to feed the horses—that would only enable a person to open the gate, not to get to the count. ing-house or parlour—I came back about half-past ten o'clock at night—I got a light and discovered the counting-house door was broken open—I applied to Bishop, the policeman, and on searching the counting-house found the desks all broken open, and the iron chest had been attempted, by the marks of a screw-driver which was found driven into the top, of it, bat it was not opened—I went into the stable and found a crow-bar there which was used to draw the linch-pins of Mellish's cart and was usually kept in the stable—that crow-bar was applied to the marks on the count<lb></lb>ing house door and matched exactly with it—Bishop applied it—there was a hatchet in the counting-house on one of the desks, which matched exactly with the marks on all the desks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am servant to Robert Flagg, who keeps the White Hart public-house, in Brook's-market, Holborn. On Mon<lb></lb>day afternoon, the 23rd of October, I went up to my bed-room, and saw the prisoner at my room door—he had just come out of the door as I got up to it—I asked what business he had there—he said he thought it was the water-closet, and went down stairs—I found the door, which had been locked, was broken open—I had the key—the wood which holds the lock was broken—the lid of my trunk was on a box in the room, the box was moved on a bed, and property gone out of it—I came down stairs after the prisoner, and he went out backwards—I missed a purse, a shawl, a handker<lb></lb>chief, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, and a ring, from my trunk—they are worth altogether 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found a chisel lying down by the side of the box—I found the key in the box.</p>

In consequence of hearing an alarm on the stairs I followed the prisoner, and stopped him—he said he was in search of the water-closet—he went out of the front door into a yard—I followed and brought him back—he said he was in search of a water-closet—I said, "You could not expect to find one at the top of the house; if you want one you can go below, into a large yard "—I watched him go to the water-closet—he was there about a minute—he came out of there, and went into another water-closet in the yard—he was there fire minutes, and when he came out I gave him in charge of the police—I showed the constable the privies he had been in and the shawl and handkerchief were found down there while the policeman was gone to the office—the box was found the day afterwards.</p>

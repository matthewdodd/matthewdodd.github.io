I did not then know he had stole them, but when I saw him some time after, he had them on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive they were on a chair in your room that night the prisoner lay there?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you charge him with taking them?</p>
               <p>Gilbert. I did; he told me if I would go with him he would give me them again, or pay me for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own he had taken them?</p>
               <p>Gilbert. He said he had left his own breeches in my room, but I could not find them.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did he promise to give you for them?</p>
               <p>Gilbert. The money they cost me, which was three half crowns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I left my breeches in the room instead of them; I was very much in liquor.</p>

               <p>Gilbert. I got up and went out before the prisoner.</p>

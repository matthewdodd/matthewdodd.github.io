            . I am an officer. On the 2d<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060110"></xptr>of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was turning into Goulston-street, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner - I asked what he wanted there - he said nothing - I knew he had come from the Borough, and said, "I think you have something to fence," meaning to sell - he said, No - I searched him, and found this watch in his hand, which he had behind him - he said he had found it at first, and afterwards said, "You know very well where I got it: you had better take it, and let me go- it will pay you better;" I took him to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

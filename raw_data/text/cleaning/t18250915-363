On the 19th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners and another person came into the shop, and wished to look at a silk shawl from 20 s. to 25 s.; I shewed them several, and after they had sat some time the other person went out, saying the shop was so hot, she must go out; I then shewed the prisoners some more, till my attention was called to the door to a person who inquired the price of a print; while there I looked round, and saw Jane Collier standing to hide the other, and the shawls moving on the counter; I then went back to the prisoners, and Collier said I need not give myself any farther trouble; what they saw were very pretty, and she persuaded Watson to have one; she then asked what was the lowest price; I replied 25 s.; she said she had not come out with an intention of purchasing, and had not money enough, but left 2 s., and said she would call on Saturday; I put the shawl into a bit of paper, and while they were going from the back of the shop to the door, I missed the shawl now produced; I told my employer to detain Collier, and I pursued Watson; I took her, and under her petticoats I found the shawl.</p>

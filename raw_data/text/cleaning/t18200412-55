            . I am a currier, and live in Petticoat-lane. Summers applied to me some short time before he was apprehended, he was then a stranger - a woman, named Shepherd, whom I knew, came with him; he asked if I could black him eight calf skins - I said I could; he then asked what I should charge - I said one shilling each. He told me to send my boy to Mrs. Shepherd's for them. She lived at No. 10, John-street, Kent-road. He said he was a shoemaker, and was going to make them up. I sent for them that evening, found them very large, and sent word that I must have 2 s. for doing them, I gave them to Richardson.</p>

I had seen her and Summers at my master's house that morning. About a fortnight after, the two prisoners came to my master's and brought ten pair of high-shoe legs, and another piece of leather to be blackened. My master fetched the officer.</p>

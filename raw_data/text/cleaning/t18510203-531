                  </hi>. I am eleven years old; I live with my father, William Hurlock, a hearth-rug weaver in Nottingham-place, Shoreditch. On 11th Jan., I received a bundle of linen from Mrs. Smith, tied up in a towel belonging to 22, Horningford-street—I was going to take it there—as I was going along Maria-street, the prisoner came up to me—she said, "Little boy, will you go to Huntingdon-street for me to get a basket of starched things; I will give you a penny now, and a penny when you come back"—I agreed to go—Huntingdon-street is straight across Kingsland-road, quite straight from where I left the pri<lb></lb>soner—she told me to go to the house of a person named Harris, where I should see a cow hanging out—she took my bundle out of my arms, called a little girl who was sitting on the other side of the road, and said, "Will you hold this bundle for the little boy?"—I went to Huntingdon-street—I found the sign of the "Cow," but not the name of "Harris"—I asked at the house for the clothes—they said, "There are no clothes here, go away"—I came back to where I left the prisoner—I knew the spot—I did not find her nor the bundle—the little girl was there—she had not the bundle—she said the woman took it away from her—she was a very little girl, not able to carry it, about five years old—Mr. Smith came up, and I told him—I went to the station, and described the prisoner to Mr. Smith—I saw the prisoner again at Robert-street station—I knew her directly, and have no doubt she is the person—I do not know what was in the bundle; it was in the same state as I received it.</p>

On 11th Jan., my wife sent Hurlock out—he used to go on errands for her—she takes in washing—a person came and told me that the things were stolen—I went and found the boy crying; he gave me a description of the person—next Saturday, 18th Jan., I was in Ivy-lane about half-past one o'clock, and saw the prisoner speaking to a boy who had a basket of clothes—I heard her say, "Leave me your bundle, and I will leave it at the public-house"—he said, "No," and went away—the prisoner's dress answered to the description which had been given me by Hurlock—I went and spoke to the boy—I then went and told the Prisoner to come with me—she said she would not, because I was not a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> From the description, you thought the prisoner was the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have had no conversation with the prisoner's friends but what I have had here—they asked me if I would speak for her—I did not say yesterday that if I had some money from them I would not prosecute—I did not say anything like that—I said if they had brought the things back again before I went to Worship-street, I might not have gone on with it—I have lost the shirts and things that were in the bundle—they were not mine.</p>

               <p>Recollect as near as you can when that was? - I believe it was some time in February, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The beginning or the latter end? - I cannot say, I knew of his being taken into custody, it might be about six or eight weeks before he was caught.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How long after your things were lost was it, that you got the warrant against these people, and had them taken up? - It was a good bit after, I do not know how long.</p>
               <p>What is the date of the commitment? - The 5th of June.</p>
               <p>Baker. It was in February that I bought the watch, it was a small silver watch, it was pawned for a guinea, at a pawnbroker's, Charnel-street, Grosvenor-square; the prisoner, Roger, took me to the pawnbroker's where the watch was, and I took it out of pawn, and gave him half a guinea besides, I took the watch and kept it afterwards, till I had a summons come from Litchfield-street, and I went and gave the watch to one Mansfield; the prisoner Roger was not in custody, the prisoner William was; it was some time in February that the prisoner William was taken up; I might have had the watch a fortnight, it was the latter end of February.</p>

               <p>Was the watch you delivered to Mansfield the same watch that you bought of the prisoner? - Yes; he said he had a watch on board a ship, I did not enquire, as I always took him to be a very honest man, I never saw any misbehaviour before, I never saw him wear a watch before.</p>

               <p>Might that be a month? - I do not think it was.</p>

            . What time in the morning of the 1st of February did you go to to Mrs. White's? - About half past seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was she up or in bed? - She was in bed, and in sleep I believe; I knocked at the door twice.</p>
               <p>Who lodges in the same house with her? - I do not know, they were all trades people; it was about half past seven when I went there.</p>
               <p>Where does she lodge? - No. 2, in Little Windmill-street.</p>

             came there? - About ten minutes; Mrs. White was still there; she desired me not to let him in, till she had got her clothes on; when he came in, he said, he had been up ever since five in the morning and had received a guinea of his master, and he was obliged to borrow some things of the apprentice boy to make it up.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing that passed between them that led you to think they had seen one another on this morning? - He was there before he produced the shirt about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell his wife he had not been able to pawn it? - No.</p>
               <p>She never said a word whether he should carry it or not? - Not a word, nothing passed between them that led me to apprehend that they had been together that morning before, or that the wife knew any thing of his business.</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoners. You have both been convicted upon evidence which appears to me, as it has done to a very cautious and attentive Jury, perfectly satisfactory, each of you of felony, but unquestionably your degree of guilt is extremely different; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190103"></xptr> misfortune of the younger prisoner seems to have been that of having a very abandoned and wicked father, who, instead of protecting his younger years and training him up in the paths of honesty and virtue, has been unquestionably the means of bringing his son as well as himself into the situation in which they stand; in such a situation the case of the son deserves compassion, the case of the father deserves none; and if the law had made it a capital crime, few would have deserved that sentence more; but the law has not made it a capital offence, and the punishment of the father, wicked as he is, must be short of death; but when we consider that he has been the instigator of his son to commit this crime, of which he was to be the partaker, and has afterwards sought to cover that crime, by bringing a perjured witness into Court; it appears that no punishment short of death can be too great for that offence; the offence of the son, would under the influence of the father alone, call for a milder degree of punishment than I think it will now admit of, because it was committed with the circumstances of a breach of trust, rising in the night and robbing his fellow apprentice while he was in sleep; I therefore think that less punishment than the usual one of transportation would not be adequate to the offence of the son; the sentence of the Court is, that you

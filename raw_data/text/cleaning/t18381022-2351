                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Allkins, and live in Wey-mouth-street, Marylebone—I keep, a wardrobe. On Saturday evening, the 29th of September, about eight o'clock, I was in my back parlour, the prisoner was about the shop, and I saw him run away very suspiciously out of the shop—I ran after him—I lost sight of him, but found him secreted in a doorway, with his face toward the door—I accused him of robbing me, he denied it, but I gave him in charge—this property was dropped in a street which he went down, while I pursued him, but I did not see him drop it—he had gone down another street—this property is mine—I had seen it safe about half an hour before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. A person came to the office about eight o'clock on the evening of the 1st of October; and from information I went to the house No. 5, Old Montague-street, Whitechapel, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, in company with Shelswell—we knocked at the door—it was opened by the female prisoner, who said her name was Dale—we went into the room in the lower part of the house, and the prisoner Dale was sitting by the fire—there was a cask full of straw, in the corner of the room, and on the floor were a number of bottles, and eleven tin cases containing salmon and other things—I found the articles stated in the indictment, standing on the floor, unpacked—I asked Dale if the cask and the contents belonged to him—he said no; and he was not at home when the cask was brought in the cart—he wished me to ask a person of the name of Telley, up stairs, if he was at home, who, he said, would prove that he was not at home—I went on the stairs and called to Telley—he was in bed—I asked if he knew any thing of Dale being at home—he said he know nothing about Dale or the cart either—a woman came out of Telley's room into Dale's and he said to her, "You know I was not at home when the cask came"—she said she could not say any thing about it, she did not know whether he was at home or not—Giles then said the cask had been brought there about an hour before, by a young man in a cart, and he said he would call for it again when he had</p>

               <p>put his horse and cart up—I asked her if she knew where he lived—she said no, she did not—I then asked if she knew his name—after some hesitation she said his name was Church—I then asked Dale if he knew who the man was—he said he knew him—I asked him who the man was work<lb></lb>ing for that day—he said he did not know, but he was working on the Friday for a Mr. Mephan—by the side of a cask was a hammer and chisel, by the window-ledge—Dale said they belonged to him—and there was a broken hoop in the corner of the room, which appeared to have come off the cask—there was part of the top of the cask in the room, partly burnt, and some wood was on the fire, burning, which appeared similar to this—this is one part of the top—Shelswell had taken Dale to the station-house at Spitalfields—he was gone about half an hour, and returned with Dale, as they would not take him in—just at the time the door was opened, Church came and stood by the door of the room—I asked him what his name was,—he said, "Church"—I told him I had been waiting for him some time, and asked if he knew any thing about the cask in the room—he said, what was that to me? and was rather unruly—I told him I believed it had been stolen, and asked where he brought it from—he said from Mincing-lane—he said a man had met him in Tower-street, or Tower-hill, (I do not recollect which,) and told him to bring it to this house, but I forgot to mention that—I asked Giles who unpacked the cask, before Church came in—the said, "The young man that left it took the things out, and the top was loose"—that was while Shelswell was gone with Dale to the station-house—I found a book in Dale's drawer with the name of Church in it—it is mentioned in the depositions—I showed the came property to Mr. Kilner.</p>

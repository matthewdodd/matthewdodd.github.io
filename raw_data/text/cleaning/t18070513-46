I went immediately to Bow-street for a warrant; on Monday they granted a search warrant, and the officer took up the prisoner as she was cleaning the windows on the first floor; I told the prisoner that several things had been taken from me, that I suspected her; the officer then searched her, and found two duplicates upon her; one was in her pocket, and one against her breast. She confessed the robbery, and said she had done it in order to purchase drink. I could not replace the things for twenty or thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not understand her to confess that she took any one article at one time worth forty shillings. - A. Oh, no. I then went with the officer, Anthony, to look at the articles pledged, and there I saw one of my shirts, it is marked in full length with permanent ink.</p>

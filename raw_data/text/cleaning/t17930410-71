On Saturday night about eleven o'clock, the 2d of March, I was going home quite sober; I was making water, and the woman came up to me, and kept talking over my shoulder, and put her hand into my leather breeches pocket, and she let a shilling drop, and she went off, and I followed after her, and called watch, and the man went by and took her immediately, and she had the money in her hand, she took a guinea, and five shillings in silver, it was all loose in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. She could not well put her hand into your pocket if she was behind you? - She came on one side, and one hand was over my shoulder, and the other was at my breeches pocket, the money was taken from her out of her hand by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had she ran away from you? - She ran down to Great St. Andrew's-street, exactly facing Monmouth-street, where I catched her; I had never lost sight of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more money in your pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your leather breeches tight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her take it? - Not till the one shilling dropped on the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure there was no familiarity between you? - There was none at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me all the silver that he had in his pocket, he took me up the passage, and the gold was along with the silver; or else I did not know it was there, till I was taken to the watch-house; I am an unfortunate woman, and poverty and distress obliged me to go along with him to my sad misfortune.</p>

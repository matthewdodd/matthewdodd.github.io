On the evening of the 12th of September, between nine and ten o'clock, I was in Drury-lane, and saw the prisoners together—at the moment they passed the end of Charles-street, Farrow took hold of a gentleman's pocket, lifted it up, and let it go again—I followed them on to the end of Great Queen-street, where Farrow put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and took this hand<lb></lb>kerchief from it—I could not stop the gentleman, for they both ran into Long-acre, and I was more anxious to get them than the gentleman—directly he got it he put it into his bosom—they ran down Long-acre into Mercer-street, and into Mumford-court—Farrow then went into a marine-store dealers, of the name of Taylor, at No. 1, and was in the act of putting the handkerchief into Mrs. Taylor's hand, but I seized him before he had done it, with the handkerchief in it—I passed the other prisoner in the</p>

I was in Drury-lane with Bagnall on Thursday the 12th, and observed the two prisoners following a gentleman—Bagnall drew my attention to them, and said the two prisoners going down were after that gentleman—it was in my way home, and I saw Farrow, when, he was crossing Great Queen-street, pick the gentleman's left-hand pocket of a handkerchief, which he put in his breast—they both immediately started down Long-acre, across Seven Dials—Abbott stopped at the end of Mon<lb></lb>mouth-court, and Farrow went down the court into a marine store-shop—Bagnall went in and took him—I assisted him to take charge of Abbott—he had hold of him as well.</p>

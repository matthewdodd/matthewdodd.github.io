            , On Thursday evening I was going along the Strand, I was about ten yards past Essex Street, I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran across the road, and catched hold of the prisoner, at the New Church in the Strand, the gentleman came up and said give me my snuff-box, the prisoner said he had not got it, if you will give me liberty to go over the rails of the church-yard I will look for it, they would not let him go over, they took him to Bow Street office, in the mean time we were having our hearing before the magistrate, two boys came in and produced the box.</p>

On Monday, 20th Aug., I went with Wigley and Gilford, for the purpose of observing Mr. Cohen's premises—I concealed myself in a house nearly opposite, and directed Wigley to secrete himself on Mr. Cohen's premises—about eleven o'clock, I saw the four prisoners come down the street together, and stand directly opposite where I was concealed—I knew them before—the prisoners are the persons—they were not two feet from me—they stopped some time, then went away, and all four returned in about five minutes—previous to that they were loitering</p>

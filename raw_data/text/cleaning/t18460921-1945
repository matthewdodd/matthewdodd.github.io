On the 1st of Feb. we had three lodgers, the prisoner and two other young men—the prisoner had been with us two or three months—about six o'clock in the afternoon I went into the kitchen—my bed was there—I heard a noise, went in, and saw the prisoner at my chest, with a purse in his hand—the chest had been locked, and the</p>

We live at No 3, Brent's-court, Borough—the day after this robbery was committed, the pro<lb></lb>secutrix came and searched my house—she said her and her husband were out at tea, and on her return he told her to put his coat on the chest—that she did not do it at the time, or else she should have found out the robbery then—she had left him and a little boy to mind the house, and the prisoner went out at the door as she came home—a policeman was present when she spoke to me—I do not know his number—his mother had lived</p>
               <p>four years at my house, and he had not been inside my door twice to my knowledge—I heard the prosecutrix make a very different statement at Union Hall—that is the reason I have contradicted her.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH LATCHAM. I am a Police-constable. On the 23rd of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in York and Albany-road, about a quarter of a mile from Bowden's, with this copper tied in the ticking - he said he had brought it from No. 35, Winchester-place, Pentonville, and was taking it to Compton-street, Seven-dials; that his master had bought it over night, and he was obliged to be at home by five o'clock in the morning - I detained him; he then said he was employed by a gentleman (whom he named) in Compton-street, to carry it; I went there, and they knew nothing about him- when I came back he said he had stolen it in order to be transported; I found there were only nineteen houses in Winchester-place.</p>

            . Sinnet and I got in at a window in Mr. Pitchard's house, by the help of a ladder. We took the till and about 5 s. in halfpence, and the other things mentioned in the indictment. (Mentioning cash very exactly, and how marked.) This was between two and three in the morning, about six weeks ago. I was bred just by; but I went into the shop the day before, to see which way to do it; so when we were in at the window, we went down stairs, and into the dining-room, and then the counting-house: we had a dark lanthorn. When we had done, we put the ladder in the place where we took it from. We carried the things to the prisoner's room, St. Giles's; there we shared the halfpence; we broke some of the plate, and sold some to a Jew for a guinea and a half, and a shilling; and that we broke we sold for eight shillings and three pence. I have been acquainted with Sinnet four or five years; we lived next door to one another.</p>

On the 20th of July, at eight o'clock at night, the prisoner saw me put the bay horse into the field; I shut the gate, and next morning (Saturday) it was missing. On Monday, the 30th, in consequence of information, I found it at the Rose and Crown, at Heston, in Cook's possession - the prisoner was a drover's boy, and sometimes lived at South Newington.</p>

            . I keep the Rose and Crown, at Heston. On Saturday night, the 21st of July, at eleven o'clock, the prisoner brought this gelding to my house, and asked for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060090"></xptr>quartern of corn; he had some beer and cheese, for which he paid me; he appeared fatigued, and confused - he asked if he could sleep in my stable that night; I gave him leave, and locked him in - I went at half-past five o'clock in the morning, to let him out, and noticed that the horse was in a very bad state, distressed and fatigued - I asked why he did not feed his horse over night; he said he did not know - he said that he was coming from between Daventry and Banbury, and overtook a man with three horses, who asked if he wanted a horse - he said not particularly; the man said riding was better than walking, and he then took one of them - Heston is nearly seventy miles from South Newington; he got to my house about ten o'clock on Saturday night - Gunn afterwards saw the horse, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man met me on the road, and gave me the horse.</p>

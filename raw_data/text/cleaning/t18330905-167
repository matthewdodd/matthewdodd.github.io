            . I keep a linendraper's shop, at No. 40, Upper-street, Islington - on the 11th of July the prisoner came to my shop, about eight o'clock in the evening; she said she wished to purchase a few goods, but she could not unless I could give her change for a 50l. note - I said I could give her change, but I asked where she came from; she said, from No. 14, Camden-street - I told her it was a larger amount than I liked to give change for to a stranger; she said she could get change at the grocer's just above - I then said I would give her change, and she purchased goods to the amount of 2l. 4s. or 2l. 5s.; she gave me the note, and I wrote on the back of it "Miss Turner, 14, Camden-street," which was the name and address she gave; when I gave her the change I said I would send a young man with her to see that all was right - she then said she was not going home, that she was going to the dress maker's, and the dress maker knew her - I told my young man privately to follow her, and not leave her till he had seen her home; my young man is not here - I afterwards found the prisoner was in custody - I had kept the note and given her the change; this is the note.</p>

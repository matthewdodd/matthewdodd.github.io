            . I am a Police-officer. I was in Kent-street on the 20th of August, at a quarter-past eight o'clock, and met the prisoner with this bag on his shoulder; I asked what he had there - he said leather, that he was employed by a man at Whitechapel to carry it to St. George's; I asked if he knew the man - he said No, nor where he lived; I took him to the station, and found eight pieces of wet leather.</p>

            . I made inquiries, and Mr. Patience attended, but he would not swear to the leather, and the prisoner was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not he say it must he his property, because no tanner marked like him? Witness. No; he said he could not swear to it unless he had the offal - in coming to Newgate the prisoner said he expected to get seven years for it now; he lived at a house of ill - fame, and had no regular employ.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not say I expected to get seven years - I had plenty of time to get out of the way; I was employed to carry it from Whitechapel-church to the Borough.</p>

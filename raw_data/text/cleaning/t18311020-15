On the 3rd of October, about twelve o'clock, I was in the bakehouse, and saw the prisoner in the shop; the parlour is in a passage leading from the shop to the bakehouse - he might have been there before I saw him; thinking him a customer I went to serve him - he asked for a penny worth of buttered biscuits, which I gave him: he immediately threw sixpence on the counter- I was going to give him change from the till; he said, in a hurried way, "Quick now;" I took the coppers in my hand, and from his speaking so hurried I turned round to see if my watch was on the parlour mantel-piece, and missed it; I immediately collared him, pulled him into the parlour, put my hand to his side, and felt the watch in his side pocket; I scuffled with him, and called for assistance- he got his hand into his pocket, and threw the watch to the other end of the parlour; my neighbours observed me, and went for a Policeman - one who was passing came in, and I gave him in charge; he denied having seen the watch, or knowing any thing about it - it was laying on the floor at that time; I gave 4l. for it about two years ago, but it was considered worth 6l. 10s.</p>

I generally get up at five o'clock in the morning, my room faces the street on the first floor. Mitchell sleeps in the room over me. At five o'clock on Wednesday morning last, I was getting up, it was dark, if the morning had been fine there would have been a little light, so that I could have seen a person in the street, and have known him. I had no candle - I heard a terrible wrenching at the door or shop window, I looked over the curtain and saw a person with a white apron on, apparently wrenching the door open. Some men were going past, he went away, and came again five or six times. Every time he came I still saw him at work and heard the wrenching. I called up Mitchell - we both dressed, went down to the private door, and opened it softly, and found the shop door open. I called "Come out!" repeatedly, and at last I heard somebody move - I again said "Come out!" the prisoner came out - I collared him, gave him to Mitchell, and fetched a watchman. We found a crow-bar in the shop - I examined the door, found it had been wrenched open, and very much splintered.</p>

I examined the shop, after giving the prisoner in charge, and found two pair of shoes taken off the nails where they were at half-past nine o'clock the night before.

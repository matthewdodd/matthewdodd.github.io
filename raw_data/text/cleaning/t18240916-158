I missed my seals and ring from my watch, I followed, and cried Stop thief! three men followed him from the corner and ran after him; there was some communication between them, but I could not see what it was. I pursued him through several streets, and at last secured him. I have not found the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was stopped by another person in Chamber-street - Witness. He was stopped by another person, but we were all close together. He made great resistance at first, and endeavoured to get away. I should have lost him, and been worn out with struggling if a patrol had not come up. I am certain he is the same person.</p>

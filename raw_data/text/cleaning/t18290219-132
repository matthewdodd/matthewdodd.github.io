               <p>CONNOR's Defence. I had a bad hand, and my handkerchief was wrapped round it; I did not try to get away - I knew my innocence; on going to Bow-street, I took my hand out of the handcuff, and said "I am innocent;" Herring was not with me - he was merely passing by as a stranger.</p>

               <p>in Devonshire-street, Queen-square, in the parish of St. George the Martyr—he is my uncle—on Monday, the 13th of March, I was left in charge of his premises—there were some watches in a side-board drawer in the front parlour—I do not know how many—there was a gold and a silver one, and others—the drawer was not locked—I saw them safe about ten o'clock on Monday morning—I was not out of the house that morning; but I was not in that room—I missed the watches a little past two o'clock the same day—I have seen two of them since—there were five lost altogether—this now produced is a gold one that was in the drawer—it is Mr. Shearer's—it is worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think.</p>

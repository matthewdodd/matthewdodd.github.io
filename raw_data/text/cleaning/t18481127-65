                  </hi>. I live at 13, Adams-row, Hampstead-road, and am a shoemaker, in partnership with another. On Sunday morning, 21st Oct., I locked the shop door, and went to bod, at one o'clock, leaving a quantity of boots, which had been hanging outside, on the floor—I was disturbed about two o'clock by a sudden noise—as I thought some one had burst the door open, I got up—I did not go down stairs—not hearing anything more, I went to bed again—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I was called up by a policeman, went down, and found the shop door lying in the shop, broken off the hinges, and part of the door-post also, and the bolt and lock both broken—I then sent for one of my men, Alfred Prince—I went to bed again, after making up the door, and left my man sitting at the door till eight o'clock next morning—I then examined my stock, and missed twelve pairs of Wellington boots fourteen pairs of bluehers, one pair of nailed boots, twenty-four pairs of children's shoes, and six pairs of children's boots—they were safe</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Coyne, of 11, Fitzroy-row, New-road. The prisoner was a lodger of mine—on Sunday morning, 21st Oct., I saw him, between eleven and twelve o'clock, at my own door, with a pair of girl's boots, which he said would fit my little girl—I said I had no girl of my own, but my lodger, Connell, had—I took them to fit the girl, but they would not fit her, and I returned them to the prisoner—he brought another pair of boots, which he said would fit my boy—he said he would let me have them for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had no mere than half-a-crown, which I gave him—my boy wore them—on the following Monday a man named Cooper came to me, and asked me for the boots, and I gave them to him, and he gave them to a policeman, who was in the passage—I saw the policeman with the girl's boots; I know they were the same—when I returned them I took them into Cooper's room—he took some salt, put it on the bottom, rubbed them very hard, and stained the leather—when I saw them again they were so stained—there was a number on them; I think it was "3," but am not quite certain—these produced are the same, and these are the boy's boots (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>).</p>

P.," on the bottom, is a private mark which I made myself—this other pair are not in a saleable condition, and were never sold out of my master's shop—we never sold a pair without punching them for the laces—I cannot say when I had seen this particular pair before—this other pair are boy's nailed boots—we only received four pairs of these on the Saturday, at mid-day, and they were lost on the Sunday, I had not sold a pair—they then had no holes, and were not in a saleable state—they have since been pierced with a kind of small awl, or something of that sort, not in a proper way.</p>

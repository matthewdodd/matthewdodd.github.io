            . I live at No. 115, Maid-lane, in the Borough; at present I am out of place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you on the 27th of November last - A. I left my place on the Monday, I do not know what day of the month it was; I left my place between four and five, I took my lodgings that very evening in Maid lane in the Borough; I had lived at the City coffee house, Mr. Readers, a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left Mr. Readers, you received your wages - A. Yes; I received seven pound eleven shillings and two-pence; I went to the doctor's to pay my bill, in Queen-street, between six and seven; I went to pay the chandler shop woman and the washer, woman what I owed; we got talking, it was near ten o'clock when I came away. They told me at my lodgings if I was not home at ten o'clock I could not be let in; I intended to go to Long Acre to Mrs. Haggerston's, the George, to try to get a bed; on my going there, on the other side of Temple bar, I met with the prisoner, she was going as if to Covent Garden; I said to her, young woman, will you be so good as to tell me of a lodging. I dare say when I met her it was half after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been from ten o'clock at the time you left your washerwoman till half after eleven o'clock - A. I had been no where, but kept straight on from Little St. Thomas the Apostle, where my washerwoman lived. I told the prisoner I would give her any thing if she would take me to a good house, as I was a stranger; she took me up a court, and when I came up to a public house she asked me to give her something to drink; I gave her a glass of rum, and after that she said she was damnably hungry; I said I was going to have a pint of porter and some bread and cheese, she was welcome to have part; she did take part of it; after that she took me to Ship-yard, to the Old Rose hotel; I asked the landlady if I could have a bed; she said yes, and took me up stairs to see the room; the prisoner said she would go up with me, she would be a protection for me; the landlady took me into the room; I asked her what it was for the bed, she replied three shillings; I gave her a dollar and she gave me two shillings; the prisoner said she would stop with me if it was agreeable, she was destitute of a bed; I said to her, as you are a servant like myself I have no objection, if you are quite clean you shall sleep with me; she said she was quite clean. I gave consent for her to sleep with me. In the course of conversation, as we were sitting down, I said I do not think you are a servant; she said, what do you think I am; I said I did not know; then she told me that she was an unfortunate woman; I said cannot you reform and become a servant, it is better than going in the streets; she replied, thank God, I have found a friend at last, and she burst out a crying. I set for some time, and then said, there is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety nine just persons; I told her I was no scholar, I had heard so. Before I went to bed I counted my money, I had a two pound bank note, and two shillings in silver, and six pennyworth of halfpence, a pocket handkerchief, a snuff box, and two bills that I had been and paid; I put it into my pocket; the prisoner was present; she saw my note on the table, and the two shillings in my hands; in about two minutes afterward she said, my dear, you seem fatigued, you had better go to bed; I undressed myself and went to bed; I left my pockets all of a lump with my clothes on the chair by the side of the bed. I said, before I got into bed, which side will you sleep on; she said, you sleep on the further side, next the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that was on the other side to where the chair was - A. Yes. We had a candle on the hob in the fire place, close to the chair; I went into bed; I sat up on the bed; she was sitting in the room; I heard the pockets chink.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the curtains drawn - A. Yes, almost close together. When I heard the pocket chink I put the curtains of oneside, I saw her hand in my pocket; I saw the prisoner take the note out in her hand; I said you have robbed me, you have got the note out of my pocket; I told her if she would give me the note I would make no disturbance in the house; she said, blast you, search me; she took her cap and shook her hair about; I said I did not understand searching her; I said do not think that I am afraid of you, for I will go down to the landlady directly; I run down with my garment on and fetched her up stairs; I told her the woman up stairs had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the landlady here - A. No. They said at Bow-street they did not want any body. The landlady told Collins she had got my money; she denied it; she told them to search her; the landlady searched the bed and every where and could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the landlady search her person - A. She did not, and I was afraid to touch her for fear she should give me a thumping; I said I would have the watchman in if she did not give me the note; the watchman came up stairs, he said now my good woman, give this girl her note; Collins said to the watchman, search me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchman search her - A. He did not; I told him to search her, the landlady said I had not the modesty of a woman; to tell him to search her; I told the watchman to keep her safe till I got my clothes on, I would follow him, and at the watchhouse I told them to take charge of her; they wanted to turn her out and me; I told her if they did turn her out it should be the worse for them; they then took her into a back room and told me they searched her, they could not find any thing upon her. I did not see her searched, I went back to the room and searched, and found nothing there. I took the prisoner before the magistrate the next day, and told him the same thing that I do now. At the office she said she would give me a pound note, and make up the rest when she could, if I would not prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Q.Young woman, you said you left Mr. Reader, whom you had lived with a twelvemonth - A. Yes; I was a house maid; my mistress died while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say you had been to the washerwoman and to the chandler's shop had you drank any thing with them - A. No; I had not tasted any thing but at my dinner at Mr. Reader's, except my tea, until I met with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was about half past eleven o'clock on Tuesday night when this woman overtook me between Temple bar and Chancery-lane, she tapped me on the shoulder, she said, it is a cold night, will you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060019"></xptr>have something to drink, I feel for your situation; I said thanky, ma'am; she said, can you inform me where I can get a lodging; I said I cannot get you a place but at a house that receives company; she said she did not mind what place it was, if she could get clean sheets; she said would not I have some refreshment first; she took me up a place to a public house, I said I would have a glass of gin; she said no, I should have a glass of rum; she heard a parcel of men singing in the tap-room, she said that it was a long while ago that she heard singing; she had a pot of beer warmed it, and put some ginger in it; I drank none of it. She asked me if I could smoke, I said no; we left there; she paid for the liquor and the bread and cheese. We went to the Old Rose; when we got up, stairs she told me she would get me a character if I would reform; I said I must go, she told me it was rather late then, it was near one o'clock in the morning, there was nobody about; I should get no good; it was rather cold, I got into bed, then she asked for her pockets. I gave them to her, then she said I had robbed her of a two pound note; I said, you are wellcome to search me; she went to the door and called the landlady up, she and the landlady searched me, then she sent for the watchman. I was sent to Clare-market-watchhouse and searched; they were going to turn me out, they saw she was intoxicated. She swore that she saw me take it out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. She says that you drank this pot of beer - A It was only a pint; I had no ginger in it; it was only warmed by the fire; and fourpenny worth of bread and cheese.</p>
               <p>Q.She says that when the landlady came up she and you searched her - A. She never was searched, her stockings were never taken off.</p>
               <p>Q.Who keeps the Rose tavern - A. I do not know; I never was there before.</p>

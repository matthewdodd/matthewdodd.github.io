On the 11th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I just left the shop to breakfast in the back room; the two prisoners came in and asked for a penny Jew's harp; I said I had none; they went away and returned in about a minute, and asked if I could tell where to buy one; I said,</p>
               <p>"Go about your business." In consequence of something my wife said, I got up, and missed part of a crimping engine off the counter, which was there ten minutes before. I went after them, but lost sight of them, and returned for my hat. I then went to an old iron shop in Widegate-alley, and found them in about five minutes, in the act of selling it. Fuller keeps the shop. I went in and laid hold of them - I had great difficulty in holding them - Solomon got away, but was stopped.</p>

            . I have the care of a house belonging to Mr. Turner, of Great Ealing. On the 17th of May I was at work in the garden, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned myself round, and saw the prisoner running; I pursued, and saw a woman pick up my breeches by the hedge,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260008"></xptr>the prisoner was secured soon after. I am certain he is the man. I saw the things under his arm.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was coming out of the garden, and heard the dog making a noise - I then heard the privy door shut; the prisoner jumped out of the prosecutor's window, I caught hold of him, and asked what business he had there? he said he had been looking for work, and that his mate was in the privy. He broke from me; they followed him, calling Stop thief! I lost sight of him, as he ran through a hedge. I met a woman, she pointed him out - we ran up a lane, came up, and surrounded him; I am certain he is the man. The house had not been left open - he had climbed up a pear-tree which grows round the house, to get in at the window.</p>

            . I was in my father's garden, and heard the cry of Stop thief! from Mr. Sellier's field, saw the prisoner jump over the fence into my father's garden, and fall on his knees; he jumped up again, and rushed through the hedge into Nashburn's garden. When he got near the hedge, I saw him draw something light from under his jacket. Norris pointed him out to me; he ran against her, and almost knocked her down.</p>

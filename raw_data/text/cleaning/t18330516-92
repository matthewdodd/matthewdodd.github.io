On the 19th of April, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, this hat was on a peg at the door up a step - they must come up a step to get it - I was standing in the shop and heard a slight noise which caused me to turn my head, I saw the prisoner Cushion take the hat from the peg, and carry it off - I followed him, and saw him deliver it to Goodwin about six yards off - I went to the young man behind me, and we seized them both - Goodwin had the hat and dropped it; I delivered it to the constable - Cushion said he did not take it - Goodwin said somebody had dropped it, and he picked it up - I am sure he received it from Cushion.</p>

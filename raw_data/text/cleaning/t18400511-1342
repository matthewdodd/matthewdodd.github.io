                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Hill, a cabinet maker. On the 12th of April, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Aldgate near the church—I saw the prisoner following two gentlemen—I watched him—I was on the opposite side of the way at first—I saw Mr. Read, with a lady, and a young gentleman, going towards Whitechapel church—the prisoner left following the two gentleman, and followed Mr. Read—I ran over the way, thinking he was going to pick his pocket—he put his hand into Mr. Read's pocket, and took out his handkerchief—I took hold of him by the back of his neck, and said to Mr. Read, "You have lost your handkerchief"—he felt, and said he had—I saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief away—I gave him to Mr. Read, and went and picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Read—a lot of <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-men from the stand at Aldgate came up and struck me and the prosecutor—they knocked my hat off, and</p>

               <p>rescued the prisoner away—I did not leave go of him till I was com<lb></lb>pelled—he ran down a court, and the policeman took him into custody—he did not get far away—I am positive he is the person.</p>

             . I rose up directly, and I cried out I had lost my watch, and some of them must have it; and I desired to have it: they said they had not got it, and did not know who had; they said they would call in their husbands; they opened the door, and in came two men and licked me very severely: who they were I cannot tell. I got away, and called the watch; there were no watchmen where I was robbed. I got the watch, but when I came back there was no person there, and there was a lock on the outside of the door. I got assistance , and took these three girls that were in the room with me when I lost my watch. On Monday night Sampson and another man came to me to make up the affair; they were at the Cock and Woolpack in Finch-lane.</p>

The prosecutor complained he had lost his watch, and got me to assist him; some people came and wanted to make it up;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160028"></xptr> after that we got together at this Woolpack. Sampson was there , and he spoke to somebody to go to fetch the property where it was. From his so speaking I suspected he had the watch . I talked of searching him; upon that he put his left hand into his pocket, or breeches, and I saw him take the watch out, and drop it in the room; this is the same watch he dropt at that time. (The watch is deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

We lost a great many snuffers, and amongst others we lost the two pairs in question; but we cannot say when they were taken. The prisoner had left our employment about three weeks, and went to live with Mr. Malsing. On the 2d of November, Mr. Malsing called on us with one pair of snuffers and tray, stating, that two pair had been offered to him for sale by

            . I knew the snuffers to be our property, in consequence of our private mark being on them. I sent for a constable, and in the course of the evening the prisoner was taken. Next morning Mr. Malsing called on me, and I wished him to attend at Guildhall in the course of the day. He had then found the other pair of snuffers in his warehouse.</p>

He had brought these two pairs of snuffers and stands, and had given them to my foreman to sell for him. When I got to the warehouse, the foreman shewed them to me. On Thursday the 2nd of November, Webbe asked me to let him have two shillings in advance of his week's wages. I gave him five shillings and sixpence, and he gave me one of the pairs of snuffers. I put them in my pocket, and took an opportunity of taking them to Mr. Burbridge's; in consequence of which he was apprehended. He had denied all knowledge of the second pair, but I found the other pair in my ware-house.</p>

               <p>a veil, a pair of braces, and a lot of coins—I picked them up, and put them in my pocket—I then came up as far as St. George's church in the Borough, and went into a public-house to have half a pint of coffee—I there saw Donovan—I sat down and got rather intoxicated—he wanted to see me home as I could not take myself home, and about nine o'clock, he took me into a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I was taken by the policemen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Donovan's Defence.</hi> I was coming home from my aunt's at Deptford at past twelve o'clock—I met Lambert, and said, I was very dry—he went into the public-house with me to have some half-and-half—the policeman was inside, and he said we might have given him some of it—we treated him with a glass of rum, and went home—when I got up in the morning, I was going for an errand to Whitechapel for my father, and met Lambert and Foster in a public-house—he treated me with some coffee there—we all three of us stopped there, got rather intoxicated, and I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to see Lambert home, and two constables came and took us into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Foster's Defence.</hi> On Thursday evening, about ten o'clock, I went into the King's Arms public-house in Kent-street, kept by Mr. Clark—I remained there till half-past three o'clock in the morning—I then came out, and went to the public-house where sergeant Featherton says he saw me at four o'clock—the doors were not open till a few minutes after four o'clock—there were some scavengers and several working men waiting there to get something to drink—I went in and staid there till half-past five o'clock, when Lambert and Donovan came in, and asked me to have something to drink—we had something, and soon after Lambert asked me if I would get him a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to see him home—I got him one, and we rode as far as Unicorn-square, where Lambert's sister lives—he went in there, and came out again while Donovan and I were waiting outside—he said, "I shall not stop at home"—I told him he had better, as he was very <hi rend="italic">fresh,</hi> and he would only get drinking, and if he had a shilling or two to take care of them—nothing would persuade him, and while we were talking, the policeman came up, and said they were his prisoners—they did not offer to take me, but took the other two—I walked four or five hundred yards along with them, and while they were searching Lambert and Donovan, I went into a public-house and had a glass of gin—I then went home to my landlady—I told her that Lambert and Jones were taken up while I was talking to them at their door, and I thought they would come and take me, so I would save them the trouble, and go and give myself up—I had a cup of coffee, and pulled off my coat, for I had been to the station-house several times before, and they knew I was rather a roughish customer—I went and gave my<lb></lb>self up—I have written several times to the landlord of the public-house in which I was until half-past three o'clock, but he will not come, because he is afraid of being fined for having his house open—if you will give me time to subpoena him, I could make him come and speak the truth—I do not mean to say I was not in the prisoner's company, but I am as innocent of the charge as a child unborn—I wish to ask Woodhouse whether he did not go and inquire where I was at the time the robbery was committed—he promised me he would.</p>

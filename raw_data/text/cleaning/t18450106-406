                  </hi>. I live at Peckhara, in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. On the 21st of Dec. I had this waistcoat, and other things, safe in my bedroom—I left my house a few minutes after nine o'clock that morning—the house was secure—the front door was on the latch, which opened with a key—it was not locked—I went out at the back door—I returned at nine in the evening—I then found a writing-desk in the par<lb></lb>lour, broken open, and two pairs of snuffers appeared to have been used in breaking it open—the papers which had been in the desk were lying about—I went up stairs, and missed out of the drawer the coats and other articles stated—the house must have been opened with a key—these are the articles I missed—I can swear to them—most of them have the names on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to the prosecutor's house at four o'clock that afternoon, to shut it up—I went in at the back door with a key which opened it—I then shut the house up—everything appeared to be right at that time—I am quite sure I shut the house up again—the windows were shut, and the doors all fastened—about eight o'clock I received some in<lb></lb>formation from master Samuel, the prosecutor's son—I went to the house, and found the front door open, the desk broken, and the coats and other things gone. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM HUMPHREYS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 47.) I was on duty about eight o'clock that evening, and met the prisoner, about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's, carrying a large bundle, coming in a direction from the prosecutor's—I asked him where he was going with the bundle—he</p>

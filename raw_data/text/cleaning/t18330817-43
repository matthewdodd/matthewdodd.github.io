On the 30th of May the prisoner came in with another young man - he asked for a pair of shoes - I had been sitting on a chair in the shop, on which I left my silk handkerchief - when the prisoner came in he sat down on that chair, and I gave him some shoes; I did not observe him take the handkerchief, but I missed it as soon as he was gone - he had tried on several pairs, but went away with the other man without buying; I missed my handkerchief, and pursued the prisoner - I caught him, but not the other man - I took the prisoner to the station-house - I did not call for any assistance, till they were crossing Church-street - they then separated; the other man ran down Booth-street, and the prisoner went down Church-street - I took him and said, "You have taken my handkerchief;" before I came up with him, he hastened his pace and went as fast as he could - he was taken to the station-house, but nothing was found on him - he had not money to pay for the shoes.</p>

I remember their coming in, I got the other a chair, he would not sit in that; the prisoner sat down in the chair where the handkerchief was - as soon as they were gone I missed the handkerchief - I heard the prisoner say when he was going before Mr. Twyford, that he would not stand about half-a-crown, but let him go, and we should have the handkerchief back - I am sure he said that; I will swear it - the prisoner said in the police office, that he would not tell against his companion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How was it possible I could give you the handkerchief back, if it was not at my possession? A. I don't know any more than that you said so.</p>

            's barge, I found the rope concealed in the cabin; it was new rope, and cost me ten pence a pound; he had got one piece in use for his barge, for what they call a hawser; the prisoner was not on board the barge, I met him at Bromley; I asked him where his barge was; he told me at Bromley-lock; there was another man on board who absconded: afterwards the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How do they generally navigate these barges? - A. Generally two men.</p>
               <p>Q.Bromley-lock is lower down the river than your part? - A. Yes, it is the entrance from Old Ford into the Thames.</p>

               <p>Q. The man that you found on board had the care of the barge? - A. He was standing there then; he let me go into the cabin; I asked him how the rope got there; he said, his master brought it there; when I returned, in about two hours afterwards, he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have never seen him since? - A. No, he went away directly; I had the prisoner apprehended in an hour after I found the rope.</p>

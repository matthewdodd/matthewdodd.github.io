                  </hi>. I am a shopman to Charles John Brooks, a linen-draper, in Duke-street, Manchester-square, in the parish of St. Marylebone—the prisoner was also a shopman—he was discharged from Mr. Brooks service on the 1st of February—on the 21st of January 1 gave Miss Husband a cheque to get changed for me—I have the cheque, here it is, for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I told her to get six £5 notes for the cheque—in the evening of that day I called on her, and re<lb></lb>ceived six £5 notes—I put them in a purse, and put them in a red-pocket<lb></lb>book which I put in my box—I locked my box, and put the key in my pocket—the last time I went to the box and saw the money safe, was on Thursday night, the 4th of February—there were five £5 and £10 notes, and two sovereigns in the pocket-book—I put the book and its contents back into the box, and locked it—I saw the prisoner on Saturday even<lb></lb>ing, the 6th of February, about nine o'clock, when he came to fetch his portmanteau away from my employer—it was in the bed-room he had slept in, which joins mine—he went up stairs to teach his portmanteau</p>

               <p>down, and remained in the shop till we had closed—I went out with him and two others about ten o'clock, to a place, to have a glass of ale, and then I left him with another person, and did not see him afterwards—on the Sunday morning, about eight o'clock, I discovered my box had been broken open, and the pocket-book, containing the property described, missing—I saw the prisoner on the Wednesday after, between half-past six and a quarter to seven o'clock, going to Drury-lane theatre—I went up to him directly, and asked him if he was not ashamed of what he had been doing, and then he asked me what for—I immediately asked him, "How is my box?"—he wanted to speak to me, but I would not hear what he had to say till I got him before an officer—?I took him out of the theatre to a public-house, (I believe called the Albion,) and then gave him in charge of an officer—he was taken to the police-station and searched, and the property the con<lb></lb>stable has now in his possession was found on him—we took him before a Magistrate.</p>

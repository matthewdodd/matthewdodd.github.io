On Monday evening, the 3rd of Aug., about nine o'clock, I was walking in Waterloo-road, and near the Victoria Theatre the officer spoke to me, and, in consequence of what he said, I felt in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which I had had safe about a quarter of an hour before—I have not seen it since.</p>

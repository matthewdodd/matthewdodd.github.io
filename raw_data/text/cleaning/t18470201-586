They will be found, they were put away by my sister; they were pawned by my sister"—I said, "Which sister?"—he pointed to the cell where Goddard was, and said, "The one that is here"—(I believe Goddard is married)—he said, "One watch was pawned in Westminster-bridge-road, another in the New-cut, and the ring and chain in the Strand; the necklace I pawned myself, in Barbican, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

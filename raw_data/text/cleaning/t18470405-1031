                  </hi> On 1st April I got into an omnibus, at Hungerford-market, with my sister—the two prisoners got in before it started—I sat at the top of the omnibus, at the left hand corner—my sister sat on the seat that run down the side opposite to me—Lawrence sat next to my sister, and Sultz sat opposite to Lawrence, and next to me—as we were going along I felt something at my bag—which was in my lap—I felt Sultz, who was next to me, touching my bag—he had a clock on, but I dis<lb></lb>tinctly felt him several times, and I moved the bag—Sultz saw me, and I saw him touch the toe of his companion—that excited my suspicion, and I watched them both—I saw Lawrence doing something at the side of my sister, with his right hand crossed before him—Sultz was then watching What Lawrence was about, very anxiously indeed—Sultz did not touch me again, he sat wrapped up in his cloak—I saw he was watching Lawrence, and he appeared to wish to attract my attention from Lawrence—I then saw Lawrence draw his hand from my sister's side, and distinctly put something into his left hand waistcoat pocket—I then said to my sister, "Lend me some money"—I did not wish to be precipitate—my sister did not do it imme<lb></lb>diately, and I asked her again to give me her purse—she pulled it put of her pocket, and I saw immediately that her sovereign was gone—I saw that the purse was empty—I knew she had a sovereign in that purse as I saw it before we got into the omnibus—I saw the rings were quite at the bottom of the purse I immediately turned to Lawrence and said, "Sir, you have abstracted a sovereign from my sister's purse, out of her pocket"—he denied it—I said "Yes, and you put it into your left hand waistcoat pocket; I saw you do it"—he said it was a mistake, I must make a mistake; he had two or three sove<lb></lb>reigns of his own—I immediately turned to Sultz, and said, "Yes, sir, and you attempted to rob my bag"—he denied it, and was very impudent indeed—I was very hasty, and applied to some gentleman to have the omnibus stopped—the prisoners were at last taken to the station house, and given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>—On 1st April, I accompanied my sister into the omnibus at Hungerford-market—I sat at the top, in the corner, and my sister on the other side—the prisoners came in—Lawrence sat next to me, and Sultz sat opposite to him—when we got to Regent-street, my sister asked me to lend her some money—I had one sovereign in a purse in my pocket, on the side next to Lawrence—I took no notice of what my sister said—she said again in a quick way, "Give me your purse"—I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled out my purse—I saw the two rings of it to<lb></lb> gether,</p>

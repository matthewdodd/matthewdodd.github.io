            . On Monday the second of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I came home from the India-house, and was told I had been robbed by the prisoner at the bar. I went and looked thro' the keyhole, and saw the sheets and blanket were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Pullen. I did, she had lived in our neighbourhood some years. By looking about, we found the sheets hid under two salmon tubs. The prisoner's husband told me afterwards where my blanket was. I found it accordingly; it was in a cellar, joining to her cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she in your house?</p>
               <p>Pullen. I suppose she has got a false key. [The goods produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a lodger in your house?</p>
               <p>Pullen. No; she confessed before justice Welch to the taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. What room where they taken from?</p>
               <p>Pullen. From a room that I let out ready furnished.</p>
               <p>A Woman. I live in Mr. Pullen's house, I saw the prisoner come out at his door with a blanket and sheets under her arm, the bed was facing the door. I went and looked through the key-hole, and saw the blanket and sheets were gone off the bed. I asked the prisoner for them, she denied taking them, and called me names. When Mr. Pullen came home, I told him of it, after that, the sheets were found in her cellar, and she confessed before the justice she stole them, and the blanket too.</p>

            . I am captain of an India-man, and live in Hackney-fields. I was in Bishopsgate-street, going home, and saw Mr. Lane by the church; Brown was holding his arm; he appeared to be shaking her off; they went on before me, and about Liverpool-street she left him abruptly, and turned towards me; Gordon met her, and they got into close conversation, within two minutes of her leaving Mr. Lane; Brown was taken to the watch-house; Gordon was brought in, and I recognized her as the same woman - the three notes were found on her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She had left Lane two minutes before Gordon joined her? A. Yes; I saw them join each<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140030"></xptr>other; Gordon had been standing by the church; I did not see her near Mr. Lane; I had dined with my sister, and was quite sober.</p>

Brown was brought to the watch-house, and in a few minutes a girl came in to inquire for her; the girl was questioned - an officer went out, who brought in Gordon in three or four minutes; she resisted violently on being searched; I got hold of her left hand, and she threw her right hand behind her, in which she said was a napkin, and, on the spot where she was, Lock picked up the three 5l. notes, which Mr. Lane identified; Brown had not been in that part of the watch-house.</p>

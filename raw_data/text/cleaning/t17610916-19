            . I am wife to the prosecutor. The prisoner came into my shop on the 29th of Aug. and asked for a half penny-worth of yellow silk: I had some ribbons in the window, he began to cheapen some; I turned my head a little on one side, in order to reach a paper of silk, and saw him putting a piece of ribbon in his pocket: I said, it is my ribbon, he immediately laid it down. Presently after I missed another piece, I told him I missed another piece, he ran away; and I followed him, and called out, stop thief, and he ran and called stop thief too: he ran down a gate-way, and my husband and a neighbour pursued and took him. I was with him before a magistrate on the Monday morning, he was charged with taking the piece of ribbon, but he denied it.</p>

            . I live in Three Horseshoe-court, Long-lane: I saw the prisoner running along with his left-hand in his pocket, it was an inside pocket. He pulled out a piece of ribbon at th e corner of my house, and threw it against a cart-wheel, and it bounded and fell in the channel: I went and took it up, [She takes it in her hand ] Here is my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home from work: I called in at that gentlewoman's shop, I was not there a moment, there was another man there: the man that was in the shop went out; I was a little in liquor; she said I had taken a piece of ribbon; I said, what do you mean by that? and took up my half-penny, and went out; they apprehended me, and swore I stole a piece of ribbon out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Allen. Was there any other person in the shop at the time?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Allen. No, there was none but the prisoner at the bar; I had told the prisoner, he had got a piece of ribbon just before the other person came in; then I rung for my husband, and called my servant in; then he snatched up his half-penny, and run down Charter-house-street, and up Long lane; there he was taken.</p>

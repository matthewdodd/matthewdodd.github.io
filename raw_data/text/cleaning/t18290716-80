            . I am a watchman. I was sent for and searched the prosecutor - there was only a farthing found on him; I took the prisoner in Union-street, Hackney-road, about half-past two o'clock on the Sunday morning; I went up and said, "Burrett, I want you;" he said, "For what?" I said, "They will tell you at the watch-house;" he refused to go till some one gave charge of him - I told him at the watch-house what it was for; he had no money.</p>

I went to have a pint of porter, there were three or four in the box sky-larking - a pipe was thrown at me, and I got up to see who it was; the prosecutor awoke up and treated me - it was near twelve o'clock; we were turned out there and went to Mr. Kingsbury's, and had two pots of ale and half a pint of gin.</p>

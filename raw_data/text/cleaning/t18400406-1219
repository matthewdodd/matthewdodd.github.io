               <p>collector of the rates of St. James's-square—the square and the ornaments on the east, north, and west sides of it, are vested in certain trustees, by an act of parliament—Earl de Grey is one of the trustees, and there are more than one other. On Saturday afternoon, the 28th of March, I went into the square, and observed that the lead had been stripped off the roof of the summer-house there—I had seen it safe the day before—it bad been placed on the summer-house by Messrs. Knight, by my direction, and I paid for it out of the funds furnished by the trustees—I have since seen the lead fitted to the place—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these two pieces I particularly know as having some paint attached to them, as there is to the other parts of the building—it had been nailed down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Knight, of York-street. In 1837 I laid the lead on the summer-house, in St. James's-square—on the 30th of March I went to that summer-house, and this lead was pro<lb></lb>duced to me—I compared it with the place from whence lead had been taken, and in my judgment it had been taken from there—it tallied in all respects.</p>

About a quarter-past nine o'clock, on Friday evening, the 27th of March, I met the prisoners in Tot<lb></lb>hill-street—they were together, but Griffiths was rather before Walker, and was carrying a bundle—I stopped him—he said he had got some lead, which he brought across the park—I called to Walker to stop—he had got some lead—I said I would take him to the station-house—he struck me with this piece, and kept brandishing it at me, and said I should not take him—another officer came up, and we took him to the station-house—Griffiths got away—as Walker was going to the station-house he threw down some lead, and at the station-house I took some more from his jacket pocket, rolled up—I found a knife on Walker, which appeared to have been cutting lead.</p>

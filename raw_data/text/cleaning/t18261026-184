            . I am a constable. On the 15th of September, about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, I was sent for by Mr. Carr, of Banner-street, to remove the prosecutor and a friend of his, who were rather refractory; Howard was perfectly sober, but his friend had been drinking; I got them into the street, but Howard's friend did not like to go to the watch-house, and was rather troublesome; as we were going down to the watch-house, in Bunhill-row, the prisoner Russell came suddenly in front of us - he put his head against the prosecutor, and drew something from his fob; he put both his hands behind him, as if to give it to some one; the prosecutor called out, "I am robbed of my watch;" I collared Russell, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. What! do you mean to say he drew the watch? A. I mean to say he drew something; the prosecutor was perfectly sensible, and had assisted me in taking his friend to the watch-house, who was a little refractory; I had never seen either of the prisoners before; I did not see the watch in Russell's hands - I had seen the seals hanging out before, and suspected he had taken the watch; the prosecutor's friend was close by, and he took the other prisoner - I am positive it was not the friend who put his head against the prosecutor - it was Russell. The watch was found on the ground, between the two prisoners.</p>

            . I live with a relation. I happened to be there, and saw the people at a distance from me - I had before that seen the two prisoners in company; I think they came out of the Rose and Crown public-house, but I did not see them come out. When I got up to this party I saw Nelson making some little altercation, about not wishing to go to the watch-house. The prosecutor said,"I have lost my watch" - I saw the watch being passed from Russell to King - it dropped between them, but which had hold of it I cannot say; it was in the act of being passed; King was in the act of receiving it, when he was seized by the collar by the prosecutor - they then scuffled across the road, and some people said, "Let him go - a baker has got your watch;" King them got away, and ran down Chequr-alley; I ran after him, and some other persons - he went into the Salmon and Ball public-house, into the privy, and shut the door; the prosecutor's friend came up, forced open the door, and found him behind it; there was an old woman in the privy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say the prosecutor laid hold of King? A. Yes; Smee was then gone with Russell to the watch-house; I did not see the watch in Russell's hand, but I saw it passing - it was quite daylight.</p>

            . I am a gentleman. Myself and Mr. Nelson were at this public-house, and he was rather out of humour; the officer was sent for, who took us into the street; I was perfectly sober, and had my watch. - When we got into Bunhill-row I felt my watch taken from me; somebody put his head into my breast, but I cannot say who, and my hands were held up. I collared King, but by the persuasion of the mob I let him go - he was pursued, and retaken; I called out that I had lost my watch - it was found in the possession of a baker.</p>

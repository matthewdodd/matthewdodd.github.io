On the night of the 31st of December, on my way home, I met the prisoner Chapman - I went with her to a house, and then I saw Eliza Smith, who asked me to stand treat; I gave her 6d. to go for some gin: when I went in I took my watch out, and looked at it - it was then eleven o'clock; when Eliza Smith returned with the gin, I was sitting by the fire side, and Chapman opposite to me - Eliza Smith sat down by my side, and was very fondling of me, and felt about my person with her hand; presently after that: she asked for another treat of gin, and I complied with it - I gave her half a crown; she went out, and I observed that she was gone a long time; Chapman then went out, and they both came in together - I asked for my change, and they would not give it me; I got up, and said it was time to be going - I had hold of my watch-key, which had a small piece of twine to it, and it had been cut off from my watch; I said,"Out of this house I won't go, till I get my watch:" they poured out the most disgusting language upon me, but I was determined to stand it out - I said, "Whatever be the consequence, I will see through it;" they then cried out Police! when the officer came - I said I had lost my watch - he took them in charge; I had not been to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not this your signature to these words - "When I went to bed my watch-fob was cut off?" A. Yes, but I never said so - I never went to bed at all; I think this was read over to me.</p>
               <p>Chapman. Q. Did I come near to your person? A. No; it was a double-cased hunting-watch, "No. 722, Kent, maker."</p>

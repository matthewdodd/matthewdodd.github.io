               <p>As I was going to Oxford, to a man that owed me two guineas, I met with a man on Hanmore-Heath, about ten o'clock at night (I thought to have lain at a house near there, but the people were gone to bed ) who told me if I would go with him to Norwood Green, he had some friends lived there, where we might lie. We went there, but there was nobody. He gave me some brandy to drink, and I was a little in liquor. I went into Mr. Priest's barn to lie, but he said he would get me a better lodging than that; so he went into Mrs. Briscoe's house, and I along with him. I had been there all day, and had gone out, but the people were walking about. Then he said, if I did not take something away he would kill me; so I continued there three days. He went out, as he said, being hungry, to get some victuals, and at that time they came and took me.</p>

               <p>Goodwin. Davis has worked for us many years. He did at this time. He was a lost-man, to look after the white goods that came in and fort them. I took him up, and in consequence of this, I found goods at several pawnbrokers. I found a remnant of shaloon at Mr. Marshalls's; and at Mr. Andrews's I found two remnants of scarlet hair shag, two remnants of Pompadour cloth, and a remnant of orange coloured shaloon; at

These were our property. I suppose Davis stole them, because his wife, through the assistance of the girl, had disposed of them. I have inquired Andrews's character, and find it a very good one.

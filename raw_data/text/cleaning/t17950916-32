I cannot read, but it is my spoon, if there was no mark on it, I could swear to it, I have had it many years; it was picked up by a young lad; it was lost from my own cup on the table, in the back room; I was drinking tea when the man came in; two men came into my shop; I <rs id="t17950916-32-viclabel175" type="occupation">keep a bit of a shop</rs>

There was a woman drinking tea with me at the time, she was in my room, he told her he had got some washing for her, and she went out with him, to shew him her place, so when she went out with him I called out to her and said, you are wrong, for the man has stole my spoon; then I locked my house up and followed them, and the woman also followed them, and I followed them till other people stopped them, that was half a mile from my house, and the officer came up directly, this man broke the spoon before he was stopped; I did not see him, I see him put his hand into his pocket, but other persons see him break it and throw it away.</p>

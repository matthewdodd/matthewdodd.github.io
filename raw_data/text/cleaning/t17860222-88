               <p>On Tuesday the 7th of February, at seven at night, I went to the <placeName id="t17860222-88-crimeloc458">George and Gate, in Gracechurch-street</placeName>

(The box produced, and the contents enumerated.) I put them in my box between eleven and twelve, before I left my place, and I examined it after it was found, and every thing was right, nothing was missing; as soon as the prisoner was brought in, and knew me, he begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>I am the coachman; I brought the lady from Croydon; this is the box I put in the boot; the prisoner was brought into the house by How the constable.</p>

               <p>I look after the stages, as they come in; the coachman says, do not leave my coach, for I have got a box; I was asked by somebody, where the Camberwell coach was? I said it was the third coach off; I turned about, and saw the prisoner with two others; and I saw the prisoner take the box out of the boot of the Croydon coach, and him and another were carrying it away; I cried out, stop thief!</p>
               <p>Was he out of your sight? - Yes, my Lord, but I am sure he is the man; I saw his face by the light of the Apothecary's shop.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the matter; but being running, the constable laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>

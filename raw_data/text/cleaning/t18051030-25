             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What way of life have you been in? - A. A mail-coach extra guard; I lived at Oxford; I was guard from Oxford to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the parcel that was brought to your house? - A. Yes; there were combs, brooches, and thimbles.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of thimbles? - A. Apparently to me they were silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Dobbs was the coachman who was tried and convicted at Oxford? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Dobbs about it? - A. I told him to take the things away because I thought he had not come honestly by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards, by the desire of Dobbs, take these things to any body in London? - A. I brought these things to London, in consequence of a direction that I received from Dobbs, to one Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Walker live? - A. On Snow-hill; he is a barber.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring them all? - A. No, a part first, and afterwards I brought the remainder.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Walker, recollect, if you can, what passed between you? - 
               <persName id="t18051030-25-person345">A. </persName>
            There was not much passed between him and me; I was shaved at his house; I shewed him the brooches and the combs that I brought; there was a man or two in the shop; I asked him if he would buy them, he looked at them. and he and I bargained for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what quantity you brought with you at that time? - A. Two dozen of combs, and twenty-eight brooches; they appeared to me to be silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any agreement? - A. Yes; they were sold to him for 4 l. 16 s. and 4 l. I received of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been acquainted with him previous to this time? - A. I had been shaved at his house; I was no particular acquaintance of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know what situation of life you were in; had he any reason to suppose you were a dealer in these articles? - A. No; he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300027"></xptr>I was a mail-coach guard; I had been there in my mail-coach waistcoat, and I believe this coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, then, the second time you came to him, tell me what the bargain was for - what did you produce then? - A. Three dozen and a half of watch-seals; they appeared to me to be gold, but whether they were or not, I did not know; and five dozen and a half of thimbles, or six dozen; he purchased them from me, he said he would give me 18 l. with the other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell the seals as gold or brass? - A. I did not sell them to him either as gold or brass; there were ten rings and some breast-brooches, I cannot say how many; the rings and brooches were what they call jeweller's gold; a dozen patch-boxes, silver, I believe, six silver nutmeg-graters, four of them larger than ordinary, and two a size or two less, and six silver toothpick-cases.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you for all these goods? - A. Chester said they were paltry goods, and Walker said, 18 l. was the most he could give; he gave me 13 l. in part of the 18 l. I never had the rest.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18051030-25-person346">Q. </persName>
            You said something about a man of the name of Chester - look round and tell me which is Chester? - A. That is Chester (pointing to him); Chester was in company with him; they followed me through St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and Chester said, 18 l. was the outside value of the seals and thimbles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Chester say any thing else? - A. No, he said nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the things and called again in two or three days to receive the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you see Walker afterwards? - A. I never saw Walker afterwards; I went three or four days afterwards, when I saw Chester.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not see Chester when you made this bargain? - A. No; not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw Walker he told you he could give you no more than 18 l. for them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And Chester made answer that was the full value of them? - A. Yes, for the seals and thimbles.</p>
               <p>Q. Chester was not present when Walker first received the things? - A. No; he was afterwards, when Walker said he would give 18 l. for them, Chester said, that was the value of these things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Walker was a hair-dresser - he could not be a judge of these things? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Walker before the first time that you went there with the combs? - A. Yes; I had been shaved there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Walker before Price did? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that a fit of honesty struck you when Dobbs offered you the things; you said to him, you did not like to have any thing to do with them, you would like to know whether they were come honestly by, but you made no enquiry afterwards? - A. They laid at my house five or six weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you came to London and offered to sell these things? - A. I came according to Dobbs's order.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you came to Walker's in the way you have described? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say a word about this till you were in custody? - A. I resigned myself up.</p>
               <p>Q. You resigned yourself up, like other great men - you have been in custody, have not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say a word about it till you resigned yourself up into custody? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told the same story that you have been telling to-day? - A. I told the Magistrate before I went to gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in gaol? - A. Nine or ten weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you told the Magistrate? - A. after I saw Walker's name in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when you saw Walker's name in the paper, and it was blown, you thought it would be your turn next? - A. I saw Dobbs at the office that night, and he persuaded me to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of that you went to a Magistrate, finding it in the paper and it was all blown - did not you expect to be taken up? - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Q. When you came to the prisoner, Walker, you first shewed him the combs and the brooches, these you left with him at that time - you did not see Chester? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time you left the things (the seals and boxes) Chester was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was a woman there, and a man of the name of Price there? - A. Price was there the first time, and I believe he was the second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Chester was not there the first time when you delivered the things; the second time Chester was not there - when was the first time you saw Chester there? - A. I had offered them to Walker in the morning, we had a pot of beer at Walker's house; it might be an hour after I shewed the goods that Chester came into Walker's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then when he came into Walker's house? - A. No conversation then, no more than we had a pot of beer, and we all drank; Chester went out, and Walker went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out first? - A. I cannot say which; Walker had the things in his possession then, but whether he took them out with him I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When Walker went out, did he take the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300028"></xptr>things with him or not? - A. To the best of my knowledge he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Chester go with him? - A. I do not think that Chester went with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Chester came in after you had offered the things - the question is, whether they both went out together? - A. I cannot say; I called at Walker's house in the evening for the money; he was not at home, and Chester and Walker came after me in the evening as I was going through Bartholomew's hospital to the Post Office, Walker halloaed out to me, and we went into a public-house and had a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, Chester, Walker, and you? - A. Yes; Chester then said, 18 l. was the full value of the seals and the thimbles.</p>
               <p>Q. Walker bid no more than 18 l.? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And Chester said 18 l. was the full value of the seals and thimbles? - A. Yes; that is all that passed while Chester was in my company.</p>

               <p>Walker's defence. I have but little defence to make. It has been said that I am a hair-dresser by trade, consequently I could be no judge of these articles; there are some of the articles that are used in my profession which were amongst the articles that were brought to me by Wakelin; he brought them to me, he said, in consequence of my having so good a knowledge of Mr. Price; I had never seen Wakelin but once before in my life, that was at my shop to be shaved; I had no knowledge of him till he was brought in by Price; the goods which I sold for him was only some very trifling articles, for which I paid him together with the money that Chester brought me; Chester brought me five and six pounds at a time, and as much as thirteen pounds the last time; I paid him in the presence of Chester, and the money that Chester brought first of all I locked up to give the guard when he came again. When he came, I gave my wife the key, and she brought the sum down, making thirteen pounds, in the presence of Chester and two other persons; I paid it to the guard in the same state as Chester paid it me; I have nothing further to add than I never bought any of the articles.</p>
               <p>Chester. (To Wise.) Q. Whether he saw any money pass from me to Walker respecting these trinkets? - A. I saw six pounds pass from your hands to Walker.</p>

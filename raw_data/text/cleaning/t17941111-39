               <p>Q. Did you see him with Carter, another watchman? - Yes, Carter was there; then we took him to the watch-house and left him there, and went back to the chapel to see what possibly was done, we found the door was broke open, the lock was broke so that we could make no use of it that night; accordingly when we went, one man picked up some bits of plate, then we searched all round the galleries, and below stairs to see if there was any body there, and there was nobody, then we went in this room, and we found this first door which leads to the sexton's room broke open; then we came into the sexton's office, and there were all the vails, as they are called, laying distributed about, and some pieces of plate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have told the gentlemen of the jury every thing that you said before the magistrate? - As nearly as I can recollect; I would not say a word neither backwards, nor forwards if I knew it.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you say before the magistrate no? - I have witness that you said so. Upon your oath, I will have an answer to my question? - At the juctice's, sir! no, every man answered, yes; I said myself, Yes; upon my oath I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked by the justice likewise, whether you saw him come out of the chapel? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say directly that you did? - I did, directly; and justice Conant set it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you say it directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hesitate at all? - No, I made no hesitation at all.</p>

               <p>Q. How many yards do you think the prisoner was from you when you first saw him? - About thirty or forty yards, I fancy; it is impossible to tell exactly when a man is in a slurry.</p>
               <p>Q. He was running from you? - He was; and the other men turned back; I positively swear he is the man that came out.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I have seen him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he used to give you broken bones? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he discontinued that? - He hath been out of his shop these two years; he used to give it to me the same as my master now gives me a bit of fish. A poor man is very glad of that.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 24th of August between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I apprehended Amos at a house in Colvill-court, Charlotte-street, and asked her for the duplicates of the things she had pawned that day; she said she had none, but would give me some of things she had pawned on a former occasion. She was the only person in the room, and in the table drawer I found two caps, and under the bed, concealed behind a box, were a gown, a spencer, and a handkerchief. I then searched her person, and from under her stays, after great resistance, I found a pocket concealed, containing three duplicates, and then found another duplicate in the drawer. Wood claimed the things in pawn. Next morning I took Jones in Church-street, St. Giles's; she said she was at Amos's when she brought some things, but she knew nothing of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Clark'a-cottages, Devonshire-place, Lambeth. About three weeks ago I was in the Queen's Arms, public-house, Kennington-lane—I had been out on business, and was a little tipsy—the prisoner was in the room when I went in, but he was not with me—he asked me for something, and he was taking some bits of bread off the table—I threw down a penny, and said, "You had better get half a pint of porter'—he went out and brought in some gin and water—I said I did not want any, if I did I could pay for it myself—I took some of it—another man came in, and he and the prisoner sat on each side of me—I recollect nothing more till I got home—I was undressing and missed my watch—I went and gave information to the police—I saw the prisoner the next day—I was quite sober then—I asked him to go and have something to drink—when I got him into a public-house I laid, "It is you that has got my watch and no one else"—he said, "By G—, I have not got it—I had it, and I am sorry for it, and I gave it to Augustus May"—(that is one that they have not taken)—I had a letter sent me, but I do not know who wrote it—there was a duplicate in it—I took that to the pawnbrokers and got the watch.</p>

I took the prisoner on Saturday, the 22nd of Nov.—I asked him if he could tell me where Augustus May was—he said, "I suppose you want to know about the old man's watch?"—I said I did—he said, "I have not got it now; Augustus May has got it"—I said, "How do you know that?"—he said, "I have seen the duplicate"—I said, "Then he can't have got it"—he said it was a lie—he swore he would not tell me where it was pawned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the toll collectors at the Middlesex end of Waterloo-bridge. I was on duty on the 11th of Nov. at night, about five minutes before twelve o'clock, the prisoner came up to me—he appeared to have been drinking—he sat in the toll-house on a chair just within the door way—I knew him before—I count over my money every hour—I counted the money I had received during the last hour—it was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I put it with other money I had received in the course of the day—the total receipts amounted to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put the canvas bag of money in the drawer—I did not fasten the bag or lock the drawer—there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> just coming up at the time, and I was obliged to run out—the driver was driving on without paying, and very nearly knocked the hat off my head—I got into a dispute, which detained me five or six minutes—on my return the prisoner rose from his seat, shook hands with me, and bid me good night, and went away—a person named Carr was, standing outside the toll-house—in consequence of what he said I counted over my money again—I missed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in half-crowns, shillings, sixpences, and fourpenny pieces—there had been a man and woman in the toll-house before the prisoner came in—they were there three or four minutes—I had not left them alone at all—I am employed by the Company of proprietors of Waterloo-bridge to account to them for the receipts—I have paid them the whole amount of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that if any loss is sustained it will be mine—Carr picked up a fourpenny-piece off the floor of the toll-house between where the prisoner had sat and the drawer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am private watchman of the precinct of the Savoy, and live in New-church-court, Strand—I went to the toll-house a little after twelve o'clock on the morning of the 12th of Nov.—Walton was on duty as collector there—I saw the prisoner sitting on a chair in the toll-house—soon after a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> attempted to evade the toll—Walton came out to take it—I was standing at the toll-house, and heard the jink of silver—I turned round to the door, and saw the prisoner with the drawer open, and the canvas bag in his hand—he said, "This is what I have been looking for," or "looking at"—I said, "I sup<lb></lb>pose it is all right?"—he replaced it—he dropped the bag into the drawer, and shut the drawer—when Walton came up he bid him good night—I told Walton what I had seen—after the prisoner went away, Walton counted the money, and while he was doing that, I picked a fourpenny-piece off the floor, and gave it to him—I was called from the toll-house to the gate, and took the toll while he counted the money—the fourpenny-piece laid exactly between the chair where the prisoner sat and the drawer.</p>

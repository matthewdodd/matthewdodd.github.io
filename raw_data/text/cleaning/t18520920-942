                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hurley, a cow-keeper, of Spitalfields, and am about twenty years of age. I know the three prisoners—on Monday, 16th Aug., I was in company with Mulloney and Collins—I knew Collins before, but not Mulloney—there was a third person with them—I do not know his name—he is not here—I played at skittles that evening</p>

               <p>with Collins and Mulloney at the Buffalo, in Skinner-street—I lost 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that evening—four of us played the first game, and I played Mulloney after that—we played two and two the first game, and afterwards I played Mulloney—he won the money of me—that was all the money I had with me—I parted with them about 9 o'clock—Collins proposed our meeting again on the Thursday night, but I could not go before the Friday night—Mulloney bad betted that if we met on Thursday night I would not knock the skittles down in five throws for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he betted with me, and we were to meet on the Thursday, but I could not go—on the Friday evening, about 8 o'clock, I was passing by Bisbopsgate Church, and fell in with Mulloney and Collins, and a friend of theirs, the same man who had been with us on the Monday evening—we went to Long-alley, to the Dolphin public-house—Collins went in first, to see whether we could have the ground—he came out, and said they would not let him have the ball to play with—we then went up higher, to another public-house, where the ground was shut up, and we could not get in—then we went up to the Skinners' Arms, in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate, and bad a game, all four of us, for a glass of brandy and water—I and the strange man beat—Mulloney paid for the brandy and water—then Mulloney and I played for half a crown—the potman held the stakes—I won that, and Mulloney paid me, at least the potman handed over the stakes to me—Collins was gone away then—he said to us, "Wait ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I will go up to my uncle's and borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and back you to play Mulloney"—we were in the skittle-ground, playing, when he came back—we then left the Skinners' Arms, and went to a public-house in Acorn-street, but there was no skittle-ground there, and we all came back again to the Skinners' Arms—we were in the taproom, and had a pot of half and half—Mulloney paid for it; and shortly afterwards Ridgeley came in—I had never seen him before—he talked like a countryman, and wanted to throw weights along with Collins, half a hundredweight—Collins said, "Come, let us get him out into the skittle-ground"—we went into the skittle-ground, and they wanted it to themselves private; but so many people came in, that we came out again, and went into the Sun Tavern—it was then nearly 10 o'clock—Ridgeley ordered a glass of brandy going in, and said we wanted the skittle-ground to ourselves—Collins played a game first with Ridgeley, and gave him two <hi rend="italic">chalks</hi> out of three—there are three chalks to a game—the one who gets all the skittles down in the least number of throws gets a chalk—while one had to get three chalks, the other only had to get one—Collins beat, and then he persuaded me to play Ridgeley—I commenced playing with him for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the game Collins won was for a glass of brandy; and then Collins and Mulloney both betted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on me—they betted the same as I did, that I would win with Ridgeley, but Ridgeley won—after that Collins persuaded me to play him for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he would back me for the same—I paid my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Collins held the stakes—I did not see him pay the money over, but I put mine into Collins' hands, and he said he had got it all right—then Collins persuaded me to play for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said he would back me for the same—Ridgeley won it—I paid my 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Collins, who held the stakes, and they made believe to pay their bets into his hand—I do not know whether they did or not—I saw no money paid over to Ridgeley—Collins and Mulloney both persuaded me to play with Ridgeley for another 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they said I could beat him—Collins persuaded me to give him a chalk—that was after Ridgeley had beat me twice—they backed me that game even with the chalk against me—I had given him a chalk all along—Collins said, "Bet him the same again; you will beat him the next time"—I deposited my 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Collins—I won that game, and</p>

               <p>got my 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—then we played for another pound, in the same way—the others betted just the same—I lost that game—Collins persuaded me to play him for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Ridgeley giving me a chalk, and they would back me with the same—I agreed to that—they each betted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Collins held the stakes—I deposited my 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him—the game was played—Ridgeley won—Collins then said I had only given him one sovereign—I said I had, for I had only got one farthing about me—(I had no more money)—I searched my pockets, to satisfy him, and said I had given him the whole of the stakes—afterward he said, "Yes; I have got it all right"—I saw no more of my two sovereigns—they did not propose to play any more when I had satisfied them I had no more money—they wanted to go—we were going out; but there was an officer in front of the door, and another behind it—I had not sent for them—I afterwards found that there had been a policeman on the ground some time—they were all three taken into custody, and I followed them to the station-house—as we were going, I saw Ridgeley swing his hand out, and heard some<lb></lb>thing like money <hi rend="italic">jink</hi>—we all stopped—a policeman put down his light, and I picked up a coin, and gave it to Towsey—the landlord then picked up another one like it, near the same place—I put it into my pocket, and next morning gave it to Towsey, at the ansion-house—these medals (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are what I picked up—they were not in this state then; they were brighter, and looked like gold then—on the previous Monday, when I was with Collins and Mulloney, Mulloney said he was a silversmith, and lived in Bishopsgate-street, and Collins said he knew he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Sun public house, Bishopsgate-street. On Friday evening, 20th Aug., about half-past 10 o'clock, the pro<lb></lb>secutor and prisoners came there—they went towards the skittle ground; when they got to the taproom door they asked for a light, and the gas in the ground was lighted up for them—they made the remark that they had got a <hi rend="italic">mug</hi>, and they were to send them some beer out—I cannot say who said it—Barker followed the potman in, and the prisoners stopped to make that remark—I expect that a <hi rend="italic">"mug</hi>" means a fool, but I do not know—there were several parties in the taproom, and one or two were going into the ground at the same time—I was five or six yards off them, and they could not see me—Ridgeley said to me, "Bring in a glass of brandy and water, Governor," and I sent it in—I knew him, he had been at my place playing at skittles about a week before—I had never seen Barker there before—I called Ward, a policeman, who was passing, and told him what I had heard; he was in plain clothes, he went in and stood by the skittle ground door, which is all woodwork—he could hear plainly what was going on, but could not see—he stood outside the door, it opens inwards—I went into the ground when the officer was there, and they asked for another glass of brandy and water—the skittle ground is glazed and boarded up—when I took the brandy and water in, Collins was saying to Mulloney, "Give me my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back again, I won't bet."—Ridgeley and Barker were playing—the play was over about 12—they were going away, and were stopped by Finnis in front of the bar, and taken to the station—I went after them—at the corner of Sun-street, I heard something resembling money, and they all stopped—I asked a policeman for his light, we looked, and Barker picked up a counterfeit medal resembling a sovereign, like those produced, but much brighter, like a new sovereign—I thought it was a sovereign at first.</p>

On the night of 20th August, I took Collins at the Sun—I took him to the station, searched him, and found three sixpences, a halfpenny, and this counterfeit coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is not a bad sovereign, but it resembles a sovereign—it was brighter than it is now—I found Ridgeley and Barker at the station—I heard Ridgeley say to Barker, "What more do you want than your money?"—he made no reply to that—I have no reason to believe that Barker had had bis money back at that time—Mulloney was there; the sergeant asked him his address; he said he lived at 33, Church-street, Shoreditch; that did not prove to be his real address—I found it was 17, Pepper-street, Southwark—that is not near Church-street, it is two miles from it.</p>

I saw the prisoners in custody—I heard money fall, turned my light on, and found a counterfeit sovereign lying by the side of the sink grating—I saw Ridgeley's hand thrown out at the time it fell, and it lay about a foot from the edge of the pavement, near the sink—Barker picked it up, and gave it to Towsey, who gave it to me; I produce it—it bad the appearance of a sovereign, and was very bright.</p>

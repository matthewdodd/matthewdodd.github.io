               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; he came to me on the 24th of February, he is a bookbinder; I have known him three years, he lodged in the back garret with me two nights; I took him out of charity, to keep him out of the streets; he told me he was going to a place on the Monday; he slept in my room on the 24th and 25th, not in the same bed with me, we put some boxes up, and two pillows for him to sleep on. I put the watch under my head; in the morning, about five o'clock, he awakened me and asked me the way to the privy; I told him; he went down stairs and did not return; I went to sleep after that, I awoke about seven o'clock, I missed my watch and my velveteen jacket that was laying on my bed. On Monday the 6th of March I saw the prisoner in St. Martin's watchhouse, I asked him where my property was; he told me that he had lent the watch to Mr. Jones, a publican in Tower street for twenty eight shillings; the jacket he had sold in Rosemary lane for four shillings and six pence; but he could not exactly tell me the place. I saw the watch on the 6th of March, but the jacket I have never seen again.</p>

            . I keep the Hussar's Head in Tower street. The prisoner came to my house for a lodging; I cannot exactly tell the time, it was four or five days before the 6th of March; he had a lodging for two or three nights; before he went away he said he had a watch in pawn, and as he owed me two or three nights lodging, and for a little porter besides, he said if I would go along with him and take the watch out of pawn, he would sell it to a jew for two pounds. I went with him to the pawnbroker by Well close-square; I redeemed it; I gave twenty eight shillings and some odd pence; I went with him to a jew in Rosemary-lane to sell the watch; the jew said he would give no more than a guinea and a half for the watch; the twenty eight shillings that I paid for the watch, and the odd halfpence, and two or three shillings he owed me for the lodging and beer, I thought I might as well keep the watch as let the jew have it. I kept the watch with his consent. Nettleton, the officer, has the watch.</p>
               <p>- NETTLETON. On Monday morning I went with the prosecutor to St. Martin's watchhouse; I asked the prisoner what he had done with his watch; he told me he left it at Mr. Jones's for twenty eight shillings, which he owed Mr. Jones; the jacket he said he had sold in Rosemary-lane for four shillings and six pence. Green and I went to Mr. Jones; he produced the watch directly; I have had the watch ever since.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in St. Martin's-le-grand. On the 25th of August I bought some paper of the prisoner at 4 d. per lb.

            . On the 28th of August Mr. Rivington gave the prisoner into my charge. I asked him if he knew anything of the paper he sold to Younghusband? he directly said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have sold some to Younghusband, a cheesemonger, in St. Martin's-le-Grand," but Turner, who is in the prosecutor's warehouse, authorized him to take it out to sell, but that he, the prisoner, received part of the money he sold it for. I found some books at his house which the prosecutors would not exactly swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say Turner ordered him to sell it - A. Yes, he said he received a regular quantum of the money.</p>

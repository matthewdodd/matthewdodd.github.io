               <p>Q. Did you about three years ago, in the summer, go to Margate - A. Yes; I there met with the prisoner; he said he was a dragoon; I took him for an officer. He visited at our house; my mother sanctioned it. He continued at Margate three months while I and my mother were there. He paid me a great deal of attention.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of May last, did the prisoner call<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010046"></xptr>upon you - A. I think it was in April; I saw him in Margate. I saw him three times before he made a proposal of marriage; he came to my room in the Haymarket; I then lived with my aunt. He then proposed marriage; he knew I was of age, and in possession of my fortune. He said, it was very fortunate that he should come just at the time I was of age; he wished the marriage to take place the next day. I said, I wished to consult my uncle and aunt; he said, what signified my uncle and aunt, if I did not marry him he would put an end to his exestance. I consented to marry him; the marriage took place the next Sunday, at St. Martin's church. On the Sunday proceeding the Saturday we were married, he proposed my going with him to the Bank, and taking out two hundred pounds; I said, I thought an hundred was sufficient. After the marriage we went to Barnet, and from thence to Holy-head, and then to Ireland; he quarrelled, and left me. He came over here; I came to London afterwards. He left me in Ireland without any money.</p>

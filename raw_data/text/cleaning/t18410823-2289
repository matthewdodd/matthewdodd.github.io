On the 21st of August, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in the Trafalgar-road, at Greenwich—I saw the prisoner go into a stable. belonging to Mr. Pershouse—he had nothing with him then—he was in about a quarter of an hour—he then came out with a sack on his back—he shut the door, and was going away—he got two or three yards off with the sack, when I took him by the shoulder and said I should take him to Mr. Pershouse—he said, "For God's sake don't take me, for the sake of my character; I will give you all the money I have got, which is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—when I seized him, he dropped the sack.</p>

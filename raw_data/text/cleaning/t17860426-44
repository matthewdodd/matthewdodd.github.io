               <p>There is no communication between the coal-hole and the house? - No; there are windows, but they join together.</p>

               <p>Were there any things lost out of the house? - Out of the parlour; the things mentioned in the indictment; the things were advertised; a servant came down to me, and I came up to London, and found some of my things at Mr. Wilmot's office on the 28th, and the three prisoners were in custody, but how they came in custody I do not know.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of February, some things were brought to me, between seven and eight in the morning, in a bag, as nigh as I can guess; I keep a sale shop in Shoreditch, No. 40; they were offered for sale; when they brought them, I was in bed, and the stockings were quite wet; the three prisoners were all in the shop when I came down stairs; I am sure these are the three men; I asked them what they wanted, and the prisoners Smith and Embleton said they each of them wanted a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner Eades say any thing? - No, not at that time; I was uneasy at their being there, and I requested them to go away; they shewed some reluctance; then Smith told Eades they would go to the Star and Garter, and wait for his coming; Eades said he would come presently: then I asked Eades what he would have for the things; he said they were his property; he asked half a guinea for them; I offered him nine shillings; he said, you may have them; I suspected the man, and went to Mr. Allen, and took him into custody;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260115"></xptr> when the officer came, I gave charge of him; and the prisoner Eades said, he met two men coming across Newington Fields, and that these two men followed him, and gave them to him to sell; that is all that I know. Allen and me went to look for the other men at the Star and Garter, and we found them there; the prisoners are the men; then Mr. Allen took charge of Eades and the things; Eades said he was coming along in Newington Fields, and he met two men, and he picked them up; that two men were hustling for them, and he hustled with them, and got a cut over his forehead; the other men said they knew nothing of him; Eades said after, that Smith gave him the things to sell; Smith confessed, and he was not examined by the Justice.</p>

               <p>What did he say? - He said the things were given him to sell by Smith; he did not say any thing about Embleton.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any body but Smith having any thing to do with the things? - No; I then went to the public house, and took the other men.</p>
               <p>When you first went there, and took the two men, what did either of them say? - Embleton said he knew nothing at all about them; he went in to buy a pair of shoes; Smith did not deny but what he gave them to him to sell, and said he found them in a ditch.</p>
               <p>Did Smith say that Embleton was with him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Embleton deny any knowledge of the things? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of February, my youngest child brought up a bag, containing some clothes in it; I went down, and my wife had given charge of one man; I saw nobody when I came down; they were at the next door, at Mr. Allen's; I saw the prisoner Eades in custody at Mr. Allen's; I asked him how he came by these goods; he said that a brewer's servant, (that was Smith) who was at the Star and Garter, gave them to him to sell; I asked him where the brewer's servant was; he said he was gone to get a pint of beer at the Star and Garter; then I said to Mr. Allen, you had better apprehend the other two men, and the brewer's servant; he said there were two men with him, but it was the brewer's servant that gave it to him.</p>
               <p>After your wife and Allen went away to look after the two men, did any thing pass between Eades and you? - No; he said he was innocent; I was present at the examination of all three of them; the officer told Mr.

               <p>Did Smith and Embleton say any thing? - No, nothing; but they were very loth to go away from the premises.</p>
               <p>When you offered the nine shillings, and agreed for that, it was with a view to get the officer? - Yes; I did not mean to buy them; I would not wish to buy them under twelve or fourteen shillings at a fair price; I would not wish to buy them cheaper.</p>

My Lord, that prisoner, Embleton, was at our house the evening before; our's is a public house; there was him and another; I cannot tell who the other was; I do not know that it was either of the prisoners; I knew him again when I saw him; he had a pint of beer; I said, gentlemen, how far are you going this dark cold night; and he said, Madam, we are going to town; he paid me for the pint of beer; it was about eight in the evening; they staid half an hour at our house; I saw or heard no more of them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a witness for Smith; he lodged at my house about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Have you any husband? - Yes; he is a watch finisher.</p>
               <p>What character does he bear? - He always bore an exceeding good character, a hard working, sober, honest man; he was taken up either the 22d or 23d; I remember his being taken up; that was on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was the Thursday? - I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>How long was it after he was taken up? - He was taken up on the Monday as I was told; I did not hear it till the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>When had you seen him last before you heard he was taken up? - I saw him the 22d.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was that? - It was on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the Monday before the Thursday, or the Monday week? - The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260117"></xptr> Monday week before I heard he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Was it in February or in March that you heard he was taken up? - In February.</p>
               <p>You heard it was in February, was it the last Thursday in February? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>And you had seen him the Monday before that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it the Monday before that, or the Monday week before that? - The Monday week before that.</p>
               <p>Then you had not seen him for ten days before you heard he was taken up? - Yes, I had.</p>

               <p>How so? - Then it must be the Monday before I heard it, and not the Monday week.</p>
               <p>How long had he been taken up before you heard it? - Two or three days.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the Thursday you heard it? - Yes; I think it was, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Where was it you last saw him? - He was at my house the last time I saw him; he left my house about six in the morning; the last time I saw him, I think it was on a Monday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Eades. I do not know I have any witnesses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Embleton. I have a person that can testify, that I was bad in my bed for five days; and I have persons to appear for my character.</p>

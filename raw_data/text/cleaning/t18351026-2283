                  </hi>. I am a builder and plumber. The prisoner Easton, was in my employ as a journeyman, for two years, and worked for me once before—I did not know of this loss—I found some lead at the station-house—one of the picecs I can identify as mine, from its peculiar shape and the manner of its being cut—Easton had no right to sell lead—it was</p>

               <p>new lead—a piece had been cut out of it for a particular purpose—on the evening before his apprehension, he was directed to cut out some pieces of lead which were going into the country, and I believe this to be the remnant of a sheet which he had cut.</p>

On Satuday, the 26th of September, I was on duty in Southwark-bridge-road, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner Easton carrying a roll of lead on his shoulder—he passed me, coming in a direction from his master's house; after passing me some distance, he turned into Red-Cross-Street, and there I lost sight of him—it was at seven o'clock in morining—I did not see him any more till I came to the pri<lb></lb>soner Anderson's shop, which is a marine-store-shop, in Red-cross-street—I there saw Anderson handing the roll of lead out of a scale, to a boy who was carrying it into his back permises—it appeared the same roll that Easton had been carrying—the boy carried it into a back shed at Anderson's—I could not tell whether he spoke to the boy, for Easton was turning road to come out of the shop—I did not see any lead in Anderson's front shop—I asked Easton, Just against the door, what he had done with the lead—he said it was all right, he had only left it there—he had come out without any nails, and was going back to fetch them—I asked who he worked for—he said, for Mr. Howe, of Southwark-bridge-road—Anderson was on the other side of the counter—I said, "Anderson, bring that lead forward"—he said, "I know nothing about it, it was only left here"—I took themn both to the station-house—I asked Anderson how it came in the seale—he said that Easton put it in by accident, when he brought it into the shop—I did not then notice whether there were any weights in the scale—I took them both to the station-house, and returned—the lead was weighed at the sta<lb></lb>tion-house,</p>

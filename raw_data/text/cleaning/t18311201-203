            . I am the wife of James Saunders. On the morning of Saturday, the 12th of November, I observed the prisoner walking by the door several times, and while I was measuring some coals I saw him come out of a little room at the back of the shop; he went up to the counter, and asked for 1d. worth of apples - I went, and asked what he did in my room; he strongly denied it, and said he came in for 1d. worth of apples - I closed the door, and took hold of him - he gave me a blow on the face, got from me, and tried to get over the railings of the cellar; I seized him again - I sent one of my children for an officer; the watch had been under a glass in the room - I found it in the cellar, and I suppose while he was over the cellar he dropped it; this is it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did not the person you served the coals to jump over the rails? A. I did not see that - my attention was taken up with you; I suspected you might be acquainted - I thought he pushed by me to lay his cloth down, that I might not observe the prisoner - the prisoner was never out of my sight, nor a yard from me; his hand was cut with the glass of the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop for 1d. worth of apples - I know nothing of the watch.</p>

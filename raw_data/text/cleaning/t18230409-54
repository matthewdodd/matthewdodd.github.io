            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Calvert, who have premises in the Ward of Dowgate. On Saturday, the 8th of March, between five and six o'clock, Mr. Church called on me, saying, some boys were taking some lead off an empty house, in <placeName id="t18230409-54-crimeloc290">Red Bull Yard</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230409-54-crimeloc290" type="placeName" value="Red Bull Yard"></interp>

I saw Means cutting away the lead from the gutters in front of the house, and a little boy with him. We went down, and got into the house by the staircase window, and found the sink cut away. I went up stairs, and found the house a complete wreck; the tiles and partitions all torn away; the gutters taken away; the edge of the lead was quite bright; the pipes too were cut away, and gone. There was a window open at the back part of the premises. I found the prisoners down in a place where Mr. Calvert's empty butts were; we took them to the watch-house. On Means we found two steels, two flints and two matches, and a small piece of lead in his pocket, fresh cut - but nothing on the other. I asked what they had done with the lead they had cut away. Sharboard said I should find five pieces down by the cellar flap. We found about 3/4 of a cwt. there. There has been about a ton stolen in all. Sharboard said, they had lived in the house four days, and had had a fire there, made of wood torn from the wainscot. They said they had sold it to a man over the water, at Chain-gate. I have known Sharboard a long time, and believe he has a good character before.</p>

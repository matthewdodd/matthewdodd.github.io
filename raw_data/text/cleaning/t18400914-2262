                  </hi>. I live at No. 61, Upper Seymour-street, Portman-square, in the parish of St. Marylebone. The prisoner Bugler was my butler and footman in June last, and had been in my service some time—early in this year I had a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note—my banker's book was enclosed in this paper, sealed up, and I placed the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the fold of the paper—I cannot remember when it was—it was probably four or five months from this time—the note was quite concealed from any body but myself—a person lifting the parcel up had an opportunity of seeing the note without breaking the seal—I wrote on the cover the number of the note—it is here in pencil—I put it into a drawer in my bed-room, which is over the back room—I keep waste paper and articles of no value in that drawer—I called it a litter drawer—it was not locked—on the 13th of July I had occasion to look for my banker's book—I had often looked at the parcel, but not opened it, but I had satisfied myself that the note was there about a fortnight or three weeks before the 13th of July—on the 13th of July I opened the parcel, and found the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was gone—I made a commu<lb></lb>nication to the Bank of England—I had written the letter "M" on the note—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it corresponds with the number on the envelope, and has my initial "M" on it—Mrs. Martin is in the habit of seeing a great many female acquaintances on Sunday, and did so on the 28th of June—at the time of receiving the ladies it was Bugler's duty to be in the hall or library adjoining from two till six o'clock—his duty was in the lower part of the house—he could have no duty to perform which would require him to go into my bed-room at that time—if my slippers had been in my bed-room, it was the duty of the housemaid to fetch them down, not his—I went out on Sunday, the 28th of June, be<lb></lb>tween two and three o'clock, to take a walk, and was gone between two and three hours.</p>

               <p>these flaps—I am perfectly certain the note was safe about a fortnight previous to the 28th of June—I had but one male servant—Bugler's business was not confined to the cellar—there was no limit to the work he had to do—I never directed him not to fetch my slippers down—I should have been rather surprised to have seen him in the bed-room—it is part of the duty of the female servants to put the room to rights—I am in the habit of leaving my slippers in the bed-room when I dress—I entertained a good opinion of Bugler's honesty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the housemaids in the prosecutor's ser<lb></lb>vice. In June last, Bugler was the footman—Bathgate used to come to the house to see him—I came into the service on the 9th of April, the last time, and within about six weeks I saw Bathgate coming to visit Bugler—he used to come two or three times a week—he did not come for two months before Bugler was taken into custody—mistress was in the habit of seeing visitors on Sunday—I recollect the last Sunday in June, (the 28th,) very well—master went out about two o'clock—the other housemaid went out at the same time as master, and the cook was out all the morning—Bugler and I were the only servants in the house—mistress was at home—two or three visitors came in between two and three o'clock—I had occasion to go up stairs to my master's bed-room—it was not particularly in my care—the other housemaid has the care of it as well, but Bugler had nothing to do with it—I went up to make the bed about five minutes after master was gone out—the bed-room is over the back drawing-room—I made the bed and came down—I brought down the slippers, and put them in the library—I went up stairs almost directly afterwards with a jug of water, and saw Bugler coming down on the upper stairs, between the bed-room and drawing-room—he bad no business at all up those stairs at that time—I said, "Where the deuce have you been, Bugler?"—he said, "For the slippers"—I told him I had brought them down—he was in a tremble, I recollect, and when he came down into the dining-room I asked him what was the matter with him, as he appeared very ill—he said he was ill, and asked me to fetch him some spirits, but I did not—he stopped in the dining-room a very short time, and then went down stairs—from the dining-room window I can see the area steps—after he had gone down I was at the dining-room window, and saw Bugler let Bathgate out—up to that time I did not know that Bathgate was in the house—I had not let him in—I saw him come out of the area—Bugler let him out at the area gate with the key—he unlocked it—they spoke to one another before they parted—Bugler came back to me in the dining-room, and said, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a stable-keeper, and live in Ely-mews, Ely-place, Holborn. I have known Bathgate since 1822—I saw him in June last at my place—I cannot tell about what time in the month it was—it must have been, I think, the latter end—he came to me, and said he should want me in the course of two or three days—I asked what for—he told me he wanted me to take a note to the Bank of England, to get change for a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note—I asked him whether it was a just, honest note—he said yes, it was—nothing was said about where it was—two or three days after<lb></lb>wards he came to the stable, and showed me a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he asked me whether I would go and get it changed—he said nothing as to where he got it—I Was before the Magistrate about this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—I cannot read without my glasses—he did not say any thing when he brought it, or before he brought it, as to where it came from, or was to come from.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say any thing about a drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said there was a drawer up stairs, where there was a 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—that was three or four days before I saw the note—it was not the first time he came to me, I believe it was the second—it was before he brought it—he said it was to be got at, that he could take and get it in five or ten minutes' notice—he came and showed me the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note three or four days afterwards—when he brought it he said he wanted me to get change for it at the Bank of England—I told him no, I would have nothing to do with it, I had been in town thirty-two years—he said, "You are an old fool, and will never do yourself any good"—he went away—in an hour and a half I saw him again—he brought a bit of a note for me to take to a man in Barbican, to get the change of a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, where he had bought a Macintosh coat—I went to the house, and saw the man there, and gave him the note—he looked at me, and sent a boy with me with the change, instead of giving it to me—the boy did not give</p>

               <p>Bathgate the change in my presence—I found Bathgate in the mews, and called him out of the stable, but did not see the boy speak to him—I did not see the boy go away—after that Bathgate asked me how I was getting on—I said, very poorly, and things were very bad with me; and he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going with the note—he went up stairs at my place—I had a box there, which I gave him, as he said he wanted a box—I did not see him take it away, or put any thing into it—I then went a public-house, and when I returned Bathgate was gone, and the box also—this is the box—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I kept the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note about a week, and changed it at Spiller's—I think I saw him write my name on it—I have changed notes there before—(<hi rend="italic">looking at</hi> No. 1313)—I see "Gardner, Ely-mews," written on this, and "4—7—40, J.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and clothier, and live at No. 3, Barbican. Bathgate came to my shop for a Macintosh about ten weeks back, or near eleven weeks—it was about a quarter to twelve o'clock—he gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">.</hi> note—I gave it to Israel Cohen, who is in my service, to go to the Bank to get change—after I had sent him I told Bathgate that I had sent him to the Bank—he then seemed to be in a hurry to get to a conveyance in Holborn—he said he was going to Holborn, he must get there by twelve o'clock, there was a conveyance left there three times a week, and he wanted to send two parcels into the country—he went away without the change, saying he would call again in the afternoon for it—he did not call, but in about an hour after Gardner came, and produced a written order—I sent Cohen with him with the change.</p>

I am inspector of the G division of police—I was called to Mr. Martin's house on the 14th of August, and in consequence of information which I had received I desired them to bring Bugler into the library, in the presence of Mr. Martin and the two housemaids—I told him there had been a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note stolen, and I had traced the party who had stolen it, and that the party was in the habit of coming to see him at Mr. Martin's house—he seemed very much confused, and said he was innocent, and knew nothing about it—I took him into custody, and searched him, but found nothing relating to the robbery—on Sunday, the 16th of August, I went to Four Oaks, near Birmingham, to a house in which Bathgate lived with his family—I found him there, and ap<lb></lb>prehended him on the stairs—I told him I wanted him for a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note stolen from Mr. Martin's house, 61, Upper Seymour-street, Portman-square—he said he did not steal it, nor change it, nor did he know who did steal it, but he would tell roe who he got it from—he men<lb></lb>tioned to me the name of the person from whom he said he had got it—he said he was to have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for changing the note, that the person owed him some money, and was to make him a present of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he got very drunk, and lost 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he took the person back 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the remainder—I searched his house, and found the trunk I have produced, also a watch and some Irish cloth—he said he had bought the Irish cloth in London a few days before he left, and took his watch out of pawn in London previous to going into Warwickshire—I brought him to London, and as I was taking him from the House of Correction to Marylebone office, he told me he would take me to the spot where the money was, if the Magistrate would make a wit<lb></lb>ness of him, but he did not want to be discharged till he took me to the spot where the money was hid, or he would write to his wife, or she should come up on Saturday with the money—I told him I could make no pro<lb></lb>mise, I should acquaint the solicitor of it, and likewise the Magistrate, which I did, and I was sent down to his house last Sunday, the 12th of September—he had told me about this on Wednesday, the 7th, after he had been examined three times—when I got down to the place I found his wife there, and watched her—I observed her go into the garden, and saw her in the hen-house scratching the earth just about the hen-house—I went to her. and stooped, and she was lifting this</p>

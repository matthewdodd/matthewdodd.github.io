               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, on the morning that this gentleman took hold of me, I had been to a man that employs me; and coming over some waste ground I found these three quart pots, two were standing up and one laying down; I put one in one pocket, and the other in the other, and the third in my apron, and should have carried them home but I could not read.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 10th of December, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I left my shop, was absent about five minutes, I rent the lower part of the house, of Oates; he lives in it. I had pulled the door to after me; I do not know whether it was fast, or not. As I was returning, when I passed my window, I saw a person standing with one foot on the door cill, and the other in my shop, with his left arm extended, so as to take something out of the window; there was another man with him at the time. I passed them to see if they would go away; they went away together. The tallest man had something under his coat; I pursued them about forty yards, and secured Leary, the other ran away. I called out watch, and Furze-man came up, and I gave him in charge. Three cruets, and a frame, were found under his coat; they were mine, and were in my window when I went out.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. I took charge of the prisoner Leary, and found three cruets and a frame on him. The next day Pierrepoint pointed Sullivan out to me, and I took him.</p>

The prisoner and his wife lived in the same house—I remember seeing the prisoner in his room in bed, in August last—his wife got the dinner ready, and afterwards called to him—he told her to get it ready and she did, and when it was ready he told her to bring it into the room and he would eat it in bed—she did so—he was eating his dinner, and there was some words between them—she wanted him to get up to dinner, and he would not—he rose up the knife to strike her—she rose her hand up to save her face, and received the knife in her wrist—he was eating his dinner with the knife in his hand—it was a very small cut, but it bled very severely, just on the wrist—he struck her more than once there, but not with the knife—she afterwards left the room and went into the other room—he got out of bed, followed her, and struck her over the eye, which gave her a black eye, and cut her eyebrow—he struck her with his fist—she was sitting down when he struck her, and she fell off the chair from the blow, into the corner of the room—he put one of his hands on her mouth, took her by the hair of her head with the other hand, raised her head up by the hair, and knocked it down against the floor—he was two or three minutes beating her on the floor, and kneeling on her stomach—she screamed dreadfully before he put his hand on her mouth—he had his hand round her throat—I do not know whether he was pressing or pinching it, but I saw his hands round her throat—she screamed dread fully before that, but that prevented her calling out—she got up and made towards the window to open it, and broke a pane of glass—he then took hold of her round her waist, threw her down in the corner of the room, and</p>

               <p>to her, and she threw up blood—that was not five minutes after he was gone—she could hardly speak to me when she threw the blood up—she showed roe marks on her body—all her flesh was blue from kicking and pinching—both her legs, and near her ribs, and her shoulders—she appeared to be very bad—while they were in the room together, I heard her say to him, before she said, "Bad luck, &amp;c.," that he had put his five fingers in her throat, and knelt on her chest, and had done her up for ever—she said that to him—the next day, which was the day she died, she sent me out for a half quartern of wine in the afternoon, and told me to put a little drop of hot water to it, which I did, and gave it to her, but she could not swallow it—she then appeared very ill, and threw up blood again when I gave her the drink—she asked me if I would bring the Priest to her—I said I could not, I had two children ill with the measles, and could not go—one of her lodgers came in, and she cried out again," Fetch me the clergyman"—she said she was dying, and she could not swallow—she told me she got the injuries from her husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Addington and Gibson, surgeons. I saw Mrs. Hennessey on the Monday before she died—that was the first time I recollect seeing her—she complained of great pain in the chest and difficulty in breathing—she appeared to be suffering in that way—she pointed to just below the right breast—I examined her—there appeared an extensive inflammation in the chest—I desired her to go home and go to bed,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180121"></xptr>
               <p>and I said would mention it to one of the principals, and either Mr. Gibson or myself would attend to her—I mentioned it to Mr. Gibson, and then went to her, and bled her to about fourteen ounces, and administered the usual remedies to abate the inflammation—she appeared to be very ill—I saw her next morning—she said she was in less pain than the day before—the bleeding would account for that—she appeared still very ill, and died in the evening—I was present at the opening of the body—I saw the chest examined—it bore every appearance of a high state of inflammation—the whole contents of the chest were more or less inflamed, and the right side more particularly—both right and left were inflamed—on removing the integuments there was the mark of an old contusion, and some effused blood in the cellular membrane of the throat, extravasated blood—that might be caused by external blows or injury of some sort—kneeling on the chest would be likely to create inflammation there—that would be highly probable—I do not think that inflammation was connected with pressure on the throat—I think the inflammation of the chest caused her death—there was also a broken rib—it appeared to me to have been broken before, a new structure had grown up, and been again broken before the union was perfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the fractured rib produce the inflammation in the chest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot exactly say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Holborn. I at tended Mrs. Hennessey for influenza about three weeks before her death, from which she had perfectly recovered before her death—I saw her on the 15th, and found her suffering from inflammation of the chest and throat—I observed a blackness about the right eye—it had been cut—there was the remains of a wound just above it—it appeared to have been inflicted about a week previous—I gave her advice and some medicine—on the Thursday after her death I examined the body—on examining superficially the parts of the body I found no marks of violence about the head, but on dissecting the scalp from the brain, there was extravasated blood between the scalp and the brain—I should ascribe that to some external violence received, and from the appearance of some spots, they were of different dates—on dissecting the integuments from the chest there was some extravasated blood on the right side of the throat, and likewise some on the chest—on examining the chest I found that the fifth rib was fractured about two inches distant from its union with the cartilage—on opening the chest, the lining of the membrane on the right side was in a state of inflammation—the lungs were likewise inflamed, and of a darker colour than they should be—the air tubes leading from the lungs were in a state of inflammation, which appeared to spread along the whole of the their ramifications till it terminated at the corner of the mouth—those appearances were quite sufficient to account for the death of the woman—there were no marks of violence on the body, except those I have mentioned on the eye and eyebrow—on dissecting the integuments there were marks of violence on the right side,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180122"></xptr>
               <p>a little behind the seat of fracture, behind the fractured rib—I think kneeling on the chest would most likely break the rib in the way in which we found it broken, but I think there must be some blow to account for the extravasated blood—I attribute her death to inflammation within the chest and throat—I have heard the witnesses examined—I think the account they have given quite sufficient to account for the mischief I found, but I hardly think the fractured rib sufficient to produce the whole of the inflammation I found in the chest—I think blows might produce the inflammation—I have heard that several blows were given in the side, but that would not sufficiently account for the appearances I saw—it is a thing we do not meet with, to find such extensive inflammation arising from a single fracture of one rib.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person thrown down on the ground, struck with a fist in the side, and violence of that kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If that had been the case, I should have found marks externally of such violence—I do not think they would wholly disappear after eight or nine days—I ascribe her death to inflammation within the chest and throat—I think the fractured rib caused inflammation on the right side, because the inflammation round the seat of fracture was more intense than in other parts—I attribute the inflammation of the lungs to other causes, such as cold—she had perfectly recovered from influenza—I am not acquainted with any other natural cause to account for the inflammation—she appeared tolerably well in other respects, when I attended her for the influenza—the throwing up of blood would proceed from a ruptured vessel—it is not a common thing to proceed from external violence, and I do not think it is what we should look for—I hardly think that being knocked down and knelt, on or thrown violently down on the floor, would of itself be sufficient to rupture a vessel.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not the adhesion of the lungs to the pleura convince you that she was a person with great tendency to some disease of that kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It pointed out to me that there was a great disposition to inflammation—the existence of this adhesion, I think proved that she had had inflammation before, and therefore she might have a disposition to it again—I do not know that affections of the pleura have been very common lately—they are not uncommon certainly.</p>

I cannot recollect what quantity - I delivered some of the same paper to the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you hear Mr. Taylor say, if I gave up the account of the paper, he would not prosecute me? A. Yes; I think it was before your wife - he said he would not proceed against you.</p>

            . I am an officer, and produce the papers which were delivered to me at Hatton-garden, by Turner, Gower, and the other witness.</p>
               <p>MR. TAYLOR. I know these papers - part of them are my writing, and part my clerks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was in the New prison, Mr. Taylor said, if he got his papers back he would be out of the way, and not prosecute me - he has discharged two clerks for dishonesty.</p>

               <p>MR. TAYLOR. There was a written paper sent me to sign, agreeing not to prosecute, but I declined signing it; I said I would make no compromise - I said, perhaps, if I got all my papers back, I would not. I have discharged two clerks for dishonesty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, On the 5th of July I left the office at dinner-time, and two officers came to search my apartment, saying, Mr. Taylor suspected I had taken some papers - I was taken to the office, and discharged next day; the Magistrate desired him to return me some papers which were taken from my lodging; but I left them for Mr. Taylor to look over - and left a note, saying he might look them over, and take what he thought proper. I left them there several days, then went and took the rest away, and sold it for waste-paper; I heard no more for some time, when he sent word that he was determined to prosecute me, unless I gave an account of what I had taken away; this was on the 7th or 8th of August. I had applied to him for 2l. 8s., which appears to have excited some vindictive feelings against me. On the 21st of August he sent me a note, stating that he wished to see me or my wife, and on the 23d I was again taken - the paper produced is precisely the same as was delivered to me at Hatton-garden - Mr. Taylor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130077"></xptr>called on me in the New prison, and assured me he would be out of the way; his words were, "If you will give me up that green book, I will not prosecute; but if not, I will do all I can to transport you." He has discharged some clerks, and it is hard I am to bear the blame of all that is lost - I was allowed only 15s. a week, and had a difficulty to get that. I had some papers to copy at home.</p>
               <p>MR. TAYLOR. The papers desired by the Magistrate to be returned were not these - this is a subsequent transaction.</p>

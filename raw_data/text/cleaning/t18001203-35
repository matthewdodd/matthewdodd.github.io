               <p>Q. What did your mistress do? - A. My mis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030024"></xptr>tress told the headborough, as there was nothing found upon him, to let him go, and he was let go in the evening there was a report that a man had been taken out of this cellar in Badger-court, and taken to the office in Worship-street; I said, I would go and see if it was the man that had stolen the shirt; when I went in, the officers asked me if I could swear to my mistress's property, if I saw it; I told them, if I saw my mistress's mark upon it, I would swear to it; John Ray said that he had found a shirt on him; it was a new-made shirt, quite new.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Was there any mark upon it? - A. Yes; it was No. 8; the selling price was eight shillings, which was put upon it, that I might know what to sell it for when my mistress was out of the way; I swore to the property, and that was all I did.</p>
               <p>SARAH SMITH sworn. - Upon the 21st of November, on a Friday, between eleven and twelve at noon, I heard the alarm of stop thief up the court I lived in, and they said they would search my house; I opened my door to come down stairs to see what was the matter, and the prisoner was upon the stairs; he seemed to be very much frightened, indeed, and he offered me a shilling to let him come into my room; I went out to him, and said, I suppose you are the man that the alarm of stop thief is about, and he said, he was; I went down stairs to tell them where the man was, and the headborough took him down stairs; that is all I have got to say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him near a cellar any where? - A. No; there is a cellar-door in the passage.</p>

             sworn - (Produces the shirt) I belong to Worship-street office; Upon Friday, the 21st of November, about six in the evening, the prisoner was brought to the office, and given into my custody, on suspicion of stealing a new shirt; I asked them if they had searched the prisoner; they said no, they had not; I began to search him in the office, and he seemed to be rather unwilling, and got his back up against the wall; I rubbed him down, and I found something very bulky behind; he said he had got nothing, he was a Dutchman, and wore large breeches; I unbuttoned his breeches, and took this shirt out, (produces it); it has never been washed; there is a figure of eight upon it; on searching him in a different places, I found a watch that had been concealed. (Produces the watch).</p>

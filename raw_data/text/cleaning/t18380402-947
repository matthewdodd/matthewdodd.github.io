                  </hi>. I met with the prisoner on the 20th of February, at the Saracen's Head, Snowhill—I had come by coach the day before from Yorkshire—I had been out to leek for a lodging, and had come to the Saracen's Head—the prisoner followed me in in the course of about two mi<lb></lb>nutes—I was reading the paper—a young woman was there, who was going to Brignal, Yorkshire, and she was conversing with the guard of the coach she was going with—I said I knew Brignal perfectly well—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "Yes, and I know it perfectly well, I have been there often"—I said, "Indeed! I was not aware I had one of my own countrymen so near me"—he said, "Yes, I am a Yorkshireman"—we got into conversa<lb></lb>tion, and conversed about half an hour—at last he said, would I have a walk—I said I had no objection—I went out with him, down Newcastle-street and Farringdon-street, till we came near the Fleet Prison—he then said, "What do you say to a glass of ale?"—I said I had no objection—crossed the street, and went into a public-house on the contrary side of the street, and had a pint of half-and-half, which I paid for—in the course of a few minutes, an old gentleman came in, with a drab top-coat on, and a stick; and he said, in the course of conversation, that he had been having a trial with a brother in town here, and he had won the day—he pulled out a lot of notes—as near as I could judge I took them to be about 200£10 notes—I said to him, "Sir, you will excuse the liberty I am about to take, but I should advise you to keep your money rather more secret, and not hand it out in public company"—he said, "I am not at all afraid, it is my own; it is what I earned at the trial, and I have a right to it"—I said nothing against that, but I said, "You are not, perhaps, aware what kind of com<lb></lb>pany you may be in"—he said, oh, he was not at all afraid—I said, "I have no occasion, if you have not"—he said he thought he had met with two friends, would we partake of a glass along with him—I said I had no objection, but he must ask the one on my right, the prisoner, who was a perfect stranger to me—I never saw him before in my life—he said, "Well, what you think proper"—accordingly I said, "Well, I have no objection; if you think proper, I will have a glass of whiskey and water," which we all three partook of—in the course of a short time the other man said again, "Well, I am so glad I have met with two friends"—I said, "You don't know whether they will be friends or not, probably"—"Well," he said, "you appear to be friends, you guarded me against being robbed"—I said, "Yes, I should always wish to do that, because I have heard speak of rob<lb></lb>beries in London, though I never was here before, but for a day or two"—he then said, would we go along with him to the Zoological Grardens—I said yes, I did not mind, I should much like to see them—he said he had got a ticket in his pocket, which would admit as many as he thought proper to take—he took it out, and it was half torn in two—he said, "I should much like to see them myself, and if you think proper to go with me I shall be most happy," or some such language—we conversed about something else, I cannot exactly say what just now—he repeated the terms over again that he had met with two friends, and he was so exceedingly glad, and he would treat us to the theatre—nothing had passed about my money then—he had handed his out, but said nothing about mine</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020035"></xptr>
               <p>—when he said he would treat us to the theatre, I said I did not wish to infringe on his property in that way; if he had got it easily, we would pay each for ourselves—he would not hear of anything of the king, but would treat us—it was fixed that we should go the day after to the theatre—he then said he should like to have a walk, and we went through Farringdon-market, and from one street to another—being a stranger, I did not take particular notice of the names of the streets—we went from one street to another, and so on, till we came to Water-lane—the prisoner went into several houses there, to see, as he said, if there was a fire in the parlour—he came out of several of them again, and said there was no fire—at last, he went into a house, and came out, saying, "There is no fire here, but the landlord will put one in if we go"—accordingly we went in—he then asked if we had any objection to go without a fire—I said, "Not the least"—he asked the old gentleman, and he said he had not the least objection—he went to the counter, and said he would treat us again—we had another glass of whiskey each, which was brought in to us—while the man was lighting the fire, the old gentleman said, "I don't much like whiskey, I will have a glass of gin-and-water," which he had, and paid for the whole of the three—in the course of a few minutes he pulled out his notes again—I again cautioned him about it—he said, "Well, I will take your advice; I will have them placed in my fob, or home secure pocket"—I said, "Yes, do so"—he said, "Have you got any paper in your pocket?"—I said, "I don't know"—I began to feel, when the prisoner brought out a piece of brown paper, and gave it to the old gentleman—he wrapped up the notes, and asked me if I would place them in his fob—I said, "Yes, with pleasure," and I did so—in the course of a few minutes, he said, "Well, as you are a stranger as well as myself, I should advise you to have yours placed in a secure pocket"—accordingly, pulled out my purse, and placed ten sovereigns and a half on the table—the prisoner placed his hand on them, placed them out, and said, "There is ten sovereigns and a half, I think"—I said, "Yes, I am aware of it"—he said he would wrap them up for me, and place them in my pocket—I thought he was doing so—I stood up, and pulled up my waistcoat, for him to place them into my fob, as I thought, and sat down again—in the course of a minute or two, the old man said he must go to the door—he went out, and the prisoner said, "Well, I don't know what our old friend is doing; I will go and see, and bring him back"—accordingly he went, and staid a few minutes—I thought to myself, it was time I should see what they were both doing—I went out, but could see neither of them—I again returned, went into the parlour, and thought to myself, I will see what I have got in my fob now—I put my finger into my fob, and brought out this piece of paper, and looking into it, found five farthings and two halfpence, in place of my ten sovereigns and a half.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Saracen's Head. I remember the prosecutor coming there on the 19th of February, by the York coach—he slept at our house, and went out next morning—he came in again, and the prisoner followed him in—I had seen the prisoner before, but did not know him—he had merely come in and looked round, as many people do to see if persons have come by coach, and I thought he did so—when he followed the prosecutor in he asked for a glass of ale, and had the taken off—he sat down, and joined in conversation with the prosecutor about Yorkshire, but what they said I do not know—they went out toge<lb></lb>ther—about two o'clock the prosecutor returned, and said this man had robbed him.</p>

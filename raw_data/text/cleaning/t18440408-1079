                  </hi>. I live in Long-buildings, Blue Anchor-alley. I was in Playhouse-yard, with Perkins and my brother, between one o'clock and half-past one in the morning, and saw the prosecutor—he was drunk, joining in conversation with us—the prisoner came up in ten minutes, seized him by the collar, and accused him of calling for half-a-pint of gin, and not paying for it—the prosecutor said, "You must be mistaken"—the prisoner stepped back, drew a chisel from his left sleeve, and struck him in the eye—the second blow knocked his hat off—the prosecutor had his arm up to guard his eye, and he struck him over his arm, and cut his arm right up from the shoulder to the wrist—I was rather frightened—I could distinctly see the chisel glitter—after striking him the third time, he put the chisel up his sleeve again—I noticed a great deal of bleeding—the prisoner came up to us, and said, "Do not have any thing to do with him, young men, for he is a b----rogue"—they were both strangers to me—I had seen the prisoner before, but never spoke to him—when he was walking away from us, he said, he had got that with him which would level fifty such b----s—Perkins was going after the prisoner—I persuaded him not, for fear he should meet with any injury—I went with the prosecutor to the hospital.</p>

On the 25th of Feb., between one and two in the morning, I saw the prisoner draw a chisel from his left arm, and strike the prosecutor on the eye, and immediately the blood spirted from his eye and arm—I saw him bleeding most profusely—my brother was standing by talking to the prosecutor—he wished to take the man into custody—I said, "John, do not do so, you will get served the same"—he said, it was a shame to see a man served in that manner, he would go—Coglin followed him—I went to the prosecutor, and saw his arm with a gash in it, and he pointed to his eye—he called police and murder—I took him to Dr. Lyne's, and he persuaded us to take him to the hospital—I took him—the prisoner remained with my bro<lb></lb>ther, and Coglin followed me—on returning, we gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's-hospital On the 25th of Feb., Coventry was brought to the hospital bleeding, from a wound on the right side of the cheek, about an inch long, and of consider<lb></lb>able depth, and from one, on the inner side of the left arm, between four and five inches long, it went nearly down to the bone—they were certainly severe wounds—I saw nothing on the eye, the wound on the cheek was about an inch below the eye—a chisel would have produced the wounds—the one on the arm was a clean cut wound—I should think it would require a good deal of force to make that—he was in the hospital, I think, about a fortnight—that was quite necessary—he bled freely, but not profusely—I stitched up the wound in the arm—I simply applied cold wet lint to the other wound, without stitching it—the danger of such a wound, would depend very much on the constitution of the person, and treatment afterwards—it would depend a good deal on, whether it would produce erysipelas, or go off in a natural way and heal by the first intention—he was healthy, and it went on very favourably.</p>

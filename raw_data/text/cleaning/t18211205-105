I thought I knew her, but did not. She said she was very much in distress, I said she might have a glass of beer or spirits if she liked; she went into a liquor-shop, and had some. I threw down the money for it and walked out; she followed me, and said she would not let me go unless I gave her something. I could not get rid of her, she caught hold of my arm pulled me across the street and kept me there, I could not get from her, I tried to push her away, and gave her 1 s. to go; she caught hold of me again, and in an instant ran away. I missed my watch, which was safe just before. I pursued her to the corner of Titchborne-street, and she came out of a liquor shop - I charged her with having my watch - she was taken, and it was found at her feet, as she was going to the watch-house, in the quadrant of the new street - I had not been there before. She was drunk - I do not think she knew what she did.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you gave her liquor to make her more so - A. I did not know she was drunk till after she came out of the shop. I think she shammed drunkenness.</p>

He attended at the watch-house, and at Bow-street, he gave his name Edward Cordley, and he answered to that name. I saw Smith take the handkerchief out of Mr. Cordley's pocket, and throw it to the other man - I had seen the corner of the handkerchief hanging out of his pocket before. I took hold of Smith, and put him into a ham shop - the other ran away with the handkerchief, and in the ham shop, Smith rushed at me with his fist, and knocked me out of the shop - he run down Oxendon-street, the watchman secured him in a dust-hole, in a court, which had no thoroughfare. He had knocked me down on the pavement, and nearly broken my ribs. I knew him before.</p>

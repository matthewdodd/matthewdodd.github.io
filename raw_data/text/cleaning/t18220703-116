I assist in my father's business. On Saturday morning, the 25th of May, these candles were missed from the manufactory; the prisoner Valentine was a stranger; I was in town on the afternoon of that day, and being informed of the loss, went to Bow-street, and then to Mr. Stevens's, where I found three pounds of wax candles. I then went to Bradshaw's house, Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road, and found the rest. We missed eleven dozen and a half in all. Bradshaw said he had bought them of Valentine. I went and got an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Bradshaw produced them immediately - A. Yes. I saw one paper behind the counter, and the rest in the parlour; he said he bought them of a person who was sitting in the parlour; but I saw nobody there - I did not go in; there is a way out of the parlour without coming through the shop; he deals in rags and fat. I attended before the Justice. Bradshaw offered to give every assistance he could, and bring witnesses to prove his case. Francis-street is a respectable street.</p>

I missed eight dozen and a half of wax short threes, and two dozen and a half of wax short fours, and six pounds of wax long fours; they were kept in the tying-up room. An iron-bar had been forced away to get in. I acquainted my father. I found the candles at the office, and knew them. We never sell goods at the manufactory; the town house is in Berwick-street.</p>

I had seen the property safe at ten o'clock at night. I found five pounds of them at Stevens's, in Tottenham-court-road, and, in consequence of what he told me, I went to Bow-street; and from there to Bradshaw's, with an officer; it appeared like a rag and bottle shop.

I asked him if he could refer me to anybody who knew him; he said he could, and asked me what made me put so many questions to him; I said I was looking for a person, and he seemed to answer the description - and asked if he would walk to a person who would give an account of him. As he was not willing to go, I asked if he would walk with me to Francis-street, and that would satisfy my suspicious; he came out to go, and went with me through Queen-square, and going through the passage into Southampton-street, he asked if I was an officer.

I told him to be cautious what he said; he told me that he was in Rhodes's-fields, where they were making hay, and two men came up to him heavily laden, and said they had some goods to dispose of, if he would buy them, as they were in want of money; he found they were candles - they asked 5 l. for them; he offered them 2 l., and gave it them; that they said they had brought them from Northampton.</p>

            . I am a wax and tallow-chandler, and live in Orange-street, Red Lion-square. I have known Bradshaw six years. On Saturday morning he brought me some wax candles in a paper, and said he had an offer from a person who he knew very well, in the service of gentlemen in the neighbourhood, to sell him some candles. I told him they were very old and stale. I consulted my uncle, and told him he ought not to give more than 2 s., for I would only give him 2 s. 2 d.</p>

            . On the 25th of May, I was at Bradshaw's house; he said he had some candles which he was going to take down to Mr. Pain, and asked me to accompany him. I saw them put into a basket to be carried there - this was about twelve o'clock; a heavy storm had come on before, which I supposed detained him; he was going to sell them to Pain, as he said he supposed the maker would give the best price.</p>
               <p>- STEVENS. Part of the candles were found at my shop; I had bought them of

             an hour or two before. I gave 2 s. a pound, and 2 s. 4 d. for long pieces. I did not observe Mr. Pain's name on it, till Mr. Pain shewed it to me.</p>

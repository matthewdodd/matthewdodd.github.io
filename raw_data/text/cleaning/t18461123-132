                  </hi>. I live in Berkshire, and keep a grocer's shop. On the 17th of Nov. I came from Peterborough to the station at Euston-square—I got there at a quarter past eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—he held up his finger, and said, "Where do you want to go?"—I said, "To Padding-ton station"—he said, "Come with me, and I will show you"—we went a long way, and were talking about how we got our living—he said he got his living in this way, and to pay him for his trouble I took out a shilling and a four-penny piece and gave it him—he seemed dissatisfied, and I said, "Come into a public-house, and I will give you something to drink"—we did so, and then</p>

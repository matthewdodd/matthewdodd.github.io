I was have been robbed of five half-crowns and several shilling"—I insisted that the lace should be searched—I said, "Have you got a light?"—he said "No, I will go next door, and get one"—he stood and held me a light, and I put on my clothes—during this time I found the purse, one half-crown and five single shil<lb></lb>lings in it—the bed was searched, and four half-crowns, six shillings, and one sixpence were found in a woman's pocket, under the pillow—the man was searched in my presence, and half-a-crown, one shilling and a sixpence were found—after I gave them in charge and we were going out of the door, the woman stuck me a violent blow in the mouth, and said, "Take that, you b----r"</p>

            . I am a constable of Aldersgate-ward. On the 12th of October, about half-past two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoners on Fish-street-hill; they attempted to pick the pocket of a gentleman, who was crossing East-cheap; Harley had the gentleman's coat flap in his hand, and two fingers of his right hand in his pocket; I crossed over, to have a better view; they left him, and went up <placeName id="t18271025-234-crimeloc1353">Cannon-street</placeName>

               <p>HARLEY's Defence. He says he saw me take the handkerchief in Cannon-street; it is very odd he could not tell the gentleman - instead of which he follows us, and seizes me; he said I was his prisoner - I asked for what; he would not tell me; I certainly got from him, and he struck me.</p>
               <p>WHITTLE's Defence. I saw a mob, went up, and one of the gentlemen said, "Take him - he is one of the party."</p>

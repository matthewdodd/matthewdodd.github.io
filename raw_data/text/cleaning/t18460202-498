I am landlord of the King's Head, at Clapton—about a week or ten days previous to the 23rd of Dec. last, the prisoner came to my house—I cannot speak positively to the day—I knew him before—he came for a bottle of brandy for Mrs. Tate, as he had done before—I gave it him, it came to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me this check for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in payment—I gave him the change—he paid me for the bottle of brandy out of the check—I stated to him that there was a bottle or two bottles owing for by Mrs. Tate—he asked me who fetched it—I told him Mrs. Tate's son—he said the son had deceived his mother—I wished him to name it to Mrs. Tate, to see if it was cor<lb></lb>rect—he said he would be sure and do so—I kept the check till the 23rd of Dec., when I paid it away to Mr. Rafferty, the collector to Truman and Han<lb></lb>bury's, my brewers—I saw the prisoner taken in custody on the 5th of Jan., by French the officer, at his own house—he was not taken for this check, but for another which I cashed for him—I told him the check I had cashed for him that day week had been returned to me as a forgery—he said it was given him either by Mr. Timson or Mrs. Tate—I said I had been to Mrs. Tate, and she</p>

I shall not accept of anything of the kind unless you tell me for what reason you give it me, or from whence it comes"—he made no answer—he sat some time—Mr. Timson had a glass of gin-and-water, and the prisoner partook of it—they talked of one thing and another for about half an hour or better, till Mr. Timson seemed quite fatigued—he asked Mr. Timson to spend Christmas with him, he could provide him a nice bed and plenty of everything—Mr. Timson said his health was not fit for that, he could never come—the prisoner had some gin-and-water and a glass of wine also, which I gave him—I left the room for a short time, to prepare Mr. Timson's bed—I came back in about five minutes, and Mr. Timson then had three sovereigns in his hand—he opened his hand and said, "I have got three sovereigns"—I said, "Indeed, have you?"—the prisoner jumped up out of the chair and said, "Good night, God bless you! take it, it is yours"—he said, "I will not keep it unless you tell me where you got it, or from whence it came"—he jumped up, opened the door, and went away saying, "I have got a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and a man waiting"—that was all I heard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I first became acquainted with Mr. William Timson on the 24th of Dec, 1844, and was employed by him as a messenger; he was at that time on a visit to Mrs. Tate, his daughter; it was limited to a week, but Mr. Timson, for purposes which will appear presently, was seized with an attack of epilepsy, and was unable to return home; it was then he employed Mr. Garratt, of Hackney, who will certify that his illness was mostly caused by excessive drink, as he has many times told me, and Mr. Allen will state the quantity of drink consumed by him; when Mr. Timson found his money nearly exhausted he employed me to write from two to three hundred letters ten, twenty, forty, and forty-five a day, to many gentlemen, and many to Mr. Henry Thomas Timson, who, he informed me, from time to time, transmitted him checks varying from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he employed me to cash them; I have done so many times, but, having a severe injury on the head, I am unable to recollect the dates—he received, on the strength of the letters I wrote from his dictation, nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and a copy of one letter, in his own handwriting, was in possession of the police, together with other letters, and a copy of cer<lb></lb>tain bankruptcy proceedings to the amount of upwards of 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020052"></xptr>
               <p>many times told me Mr. Henry Thomas Timson would be glad to get hold of; after thirteen weeks' residence at Clapton he returned to Blackheath, leaving every tradesman in debt; he afterwards returned, and lodged first at Mr. Alby's, the ironmonger's, who will speak as to the state of Mr. Timson while there; he had not been there a week before I cashed him a check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Mr. Hubble's; he afterwards moved to Mr. Dawes', the post-master's, whose brother William I will call, and who received instructions from Mr. Timson to deliver to him any letters addressed to Charles Marlow, Esq., it being agreed to distinguish such letters from my own from private friends; in the course of a few days he got me to write sixty letters without any signature, as he said he would sign them himself, and which I posted, directed to dif<lb></lb>ferent gentlemen; he wished me to write again; I refused when I found he dictated such infamous falsehoods for the purpose of exciting commiseration; he subsequently sent about for another person to write for him; he wished me to wait on the gentlemen personally; I did so, and among them I may mention Mr. Alderman Moon, with whose son I had an interview; I have a list of thirty-four persons whom I waited on, but every one of them, except two or three, expressed the greatest disgust at his conduct, and said he was an accomplished old swindler; I told him the result of my applications, and he wrote another letter to Mr. Timson for money, which I do not think was attended to, as, after a sufficient time for an answer, he said his cousin ought to do something for him, as the money in his cousin's hands ought to be his, for his father had robbed him of 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and he said, if he did not send him something, he would get out of him what he could; he afterwards left Upper Clapton, indebted to almost every one; the two medical gentlemen, and even my wife and myself, were not paid. On the 10th of Nov. I received a communication from him, enclosing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check, desiring me to pay his bill which was due to Mr. Hubble; I did so, and if Mr. Hubble or the soli<lb></lb>citor for the prosecution would take the trouble to examine and compare time, place, and circumstances, I should be exonerated altogether; I beg the check produced may be compared with the begging letters in the hands of the police; I assert that every time I cashed checks it has been by the order of Mr. Timson or Mrs. Tate; although Mrs. Tate says she never gave me a check to pay bills—I have highly respectable persons to prove she re<lb></lb>ceived a check of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Henry Thomas Timson, and I can produce the grocer's errand-boy, Charles Spinks, to prove that since Christmas last he has delivered to me two letters from Mrs. Tate at my own house, and Mrs. Clark will state that I went out for the purpose of waiting on Mrs. Tate by her orders; I had the check from her to pay for the brandy; I have a wife and four children, and I too sincerely doat on them to run the risk of punish<lb></lb>ment and separation from them for the paltry consideration of a few pounds; I have been an unconscious tool in the hands of artful and designing persons, and I solemnly declare my innocence; Mr. William Timson says he left Upper Clapton because of my bad character, that he was frightened of being appre<lb></lb>hended in consequence of my delivering these letters, and yet he afterwards gives me a recommendation; then again he says I left directly after giving him the money, the evening I called on him at Blackheath, and the servant says I stopped for half an hour, and she did not see what kind of recom<lb></lb>mendation it was; it was no recommendation to the Brighton Railway Company.</p>

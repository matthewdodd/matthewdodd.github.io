                  </hi> I am servant to Mr. Bransby William Powys, a solicitor, in Guildford-street. About seven o'clock, on the evening of the 18th of March, the prisoner knocked at the door—I answered it—he asked for a pair of trowsers to be repaired, and not knowing him, I asked where he came from—he said, "From Mr. Wilson's"—I asked him to come on the mat, while I went up to my master, leaving him there—I came down soon after—he was gone, and I missed two coats from the passage—I ran turned the comer of Everett-street, and saw him running with the coats, which he dropped after I called, "Stop thief"—he was stopped, and brought back—these are the two coats—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they were safe when the prisoner came—one of them belongs to Mr. Edward Hoare, who lives in the house, and the other to my master.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What was I dressed in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The same clothes you have now—I can swear to your waistcoat and handkerchief—when you were brought back I was lying down, fainting—I can swear to you because I saw you running with the coats, and you dropped them, and you were brought back—the coats were in the house then, because I picked them up when you dropped them.</p>

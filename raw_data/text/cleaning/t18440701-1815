                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-police-constable, No.</hi> 130.) I was going along Blomfield-street about two o'clock on Friday morning, the 28th of June, and saw the prisoner in a livery-stable yard, against the large gates belonging, I believe, to a person named Fox—I heard him first trying the gate—I asked who was there—no one answered—I looked through the side gate, through some railings, and saw the prisoner retreating back to the side of the wall—I saw him go up some steps on to the roof of the stable, on to the top of the roof at. the side, and along the top of it—he then threw something from his hands into the burial-ground of the Catholic-chapel—when he got to the end there, he jumped down, and I lost sight of him—I am sure he is the man—I afterwards found him in the privy of the area of No. 16, at the back of Finsbury-circus—that was between three and four, about an hour and a quarter after I had seen him going over the roofs—he said he had been asleep there—I did not go to where I saw him throw something—Mason, another officer, was there.</p>

I was on duty in Well-street on the 18th of September, about twenty minutes past three o'clock in the morning—there was an unfinished house, with a hoard before it, next door to Mr. Hannay, the dispensing chemist's, adjoining the premises of Messrs. Williams and Sowerby—they employ a private watchman—I heard a</p>

I am a watchman employed by Williams and Sowerby, I went on watch—on the night of the 17th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, I went into the dwelling-house in Well-street, where they live—I staid there until eleven, then came out, and went into the unfinished house—there was a hoard round it—I went and saw all round the bottom part as far as I could with the light—I got in by undoing the padlock of the door in the hoard—I looked round, saw nobody there, went out, and locked the door after me—I sat myself down, and fell asleep—I was awoke by the policeman—I rang the porters up, and got a light from a man that keeps a coffee-stall at the end of the street—the policeman went away for another—he came back again—I had been up into the first floor, looked round, and could see nothing—I got up by the ladder to the middle window—one ladder was placed at the middle window and one at the end, inside the hoard—while I was gone to get the candle, Harden took the ladders away—when the policeman came back I went up again, and on going in at the middle window I saw the two prisoners standing at the corner window—I afterwards saw the bundle that the policeman found—I cannot tell how they got into the unfinished house—I never saw them till I collared them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with John Williams and Joseph Sowerby; their premises are in the parish of St. Marylebone. I know the unfinished house that adjoins the back of our premises, Nos. 61 and 62, Oxford-street—by getting over the hoarding outside, a person could get to our shop by means of a ladder which reached up to the leads on the top of the shop from the yard of the unfinished house—on the morning of the 18th of Sept. the policeman awoke me—when I got up the prisoners were in custody in the unfinished house—I found gold and silver to the amount of 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in this handkerchief in the unfinished house, on the first floor—there was a ladder at the back—from that first floor a person could get on the top of the leads of the Oxford-street premises, and get into the shop by means of a sky-light, which they opened—there was no fastening to it; it opens by means of a hinge, and is kept open by its own weight—I should think it is twenty feet above the floor of the shop—this rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and a ladder was placed there—it was taken from the sky-light, part on the leads, and part hanging into the shop—it was not fastened above at that time—a person holding by that rope, if fastened above, could get into the shop—one person on the leads must have held it while the other got down—a person could get back by fetching a large pair of steps from the shop in Ox<lb></lb>ford-street, and bringing it under the sky-light, where I found it on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 18th—the steps had not been left there the night before—I examined the cashier's desk in the shop; it was locked, and apparently safe, but my attention was afterwards drawn to a small board at the side of the</p>

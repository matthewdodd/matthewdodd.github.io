               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before the constable brought him in? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Johnson. On the 21st of July, at half after three, I was standing at my plying place, at Bread-street, next to Cheapside, and I saw the two prisoners at the end of Bread-street, in company with another, and knowing of Delser, having had him in custody before, I directly went up to the top of the street, and crossed the way, and kept them in my sight till they came against Mr. Mountsey's shop or warehouse, in Cheapside, a little below Bow-lane, they passed backwards and forward three or four times, at last, I see Delser go into Mr. Mountsey's shop, he was in not above half a minute; Barber, while he was in, placed himself next towards Cheapside, a little from the door facing, and the other on the other side, then Brown came out with this bundle, in this manner, before him, I directly crossed the way, and before I got over, he gave it to Barber, and went to the third man, I was on the other side of the way. He gave it to Barber before I crossed the way, I followed Barber for fear I should lose the property, I overtook him at the corner turning round in Queen-street, Cheapside; I took him by the collar, and asked him where he was going? he said a man had given him the bundle to carry for sixpence, I told him he must go back again to the warehouse, and deliver it there, I brought him back to Mr. Mountsey's shop, when I got to the door, the lad met me, he did not know he had been robbed; I told him I got some property here, he said it belongs to my master, seeing the red mark on the wrapper. I took him to the counter before Mr. Mountsey came down stairs, told the lad that his master must come down to the counter. I delivered the goods into Mr. Mountsey's and Porthouse's hands; I put my mark on it, and sealed it. This is the seal I put on it, and my name on the outside wrapper besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has brought it here? - Mr. Mountsey.</p>

            How did you get the other prisoner? - A little time after I had him for picking of pockets, I had him one day this last week in Newgate, I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170141"></xptr>him very well, I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property, I tied it up before I went to dinner, that might be about three o'clock within a few minutes, and left it on the counter of the shop, it is muslin, nineteen quantities, one hundred yards altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them, not as if you was to sell them, but as if you wanted to purchase them? - Thirty pounds, here is the shop mark or back piece in letters, different letters, they were marked by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not sold that bundle you are sure? - No, I tied them up.</p>

            When these goods were brought back to you, were they in the same wrapper as when you left them on the counter? - Yes, they were.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you seen them before the prisoner was brought in? - Half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the shop? - No, my master was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I see him go in, and see him bring them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them at all in any manner removed from the place in which they were? - I did not. I knew not the place where they lay till I was told.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. In the mean time that this selony was done, I was at home at my master's, he is in the yard, I fancy, to speak to my character, he was there all the day.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnson. At that time that they were about the house did you see them talking together? - I did. I see them talking together all the way into Bread-street, and when they passed backward and forward, and locked in at the door, they all three talked together.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the door open or shut? - It stood open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barber. I was catching from Mr. - , a painter and glazier, and as I was coming along Cheapside, a man tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I would take this bundle to Queen-street, to the wine vaults there, and he would give me sixpence, and I took it, being glad to earn the sixpence, as it was in my road.</p>

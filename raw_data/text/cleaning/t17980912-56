             sworn. - I work in Mr. Garton's shop: On the 2d of August, between four and five, the two prisoners came into my master's shop, and asked the price of some cotton stockings; they would not suit them; they saw some silk gloves, and asked the price of them; they would not do; Lawrence said, she wanted a little flannel, about 1s. 6d. a yard; she took the shopman to the window next Lawrence-lane, to look at the flannel; in the mean time I happened to turn my head, and saw Smith put some silk stockings under her bonnet upon her head; I thought it was time for me to jump from my frame; I tapped her on the shoulder, and said, madam, what have you got in your bonnet? she said, nothing at all; I said, I know better than that, I took her bonnet off her head, and there were four pair of silk stockings, I laid them upon the counter separate from the rest, but desired the shopman to call my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that they were your master's property? - A. I saw her take them off the counter, I saw them brought in that morning by the trimmer, there were fifteen pair of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Smith asked to look at some stockings and gloves? - A. I did not pay attention which asked that.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be Smith for any thing you know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Lawrence asked for flannel? - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Hope and Anchor public-house, Waterloo-street, Hammersmith. I went out with my beer on the evening of the 12th of November, and saw Ledgerwood about one hundred and fifty yards from Mr. White's, with a tub on his shoulder - I had known him before as a rush basket-maker; he passed my master's door, and was going the same way with me - I had my lantern, and walked on alongside of him about twelve or sixteen yards; there was a little mud and siush in the road and he went right through it; I said, "Halloo there, you will get into it presently!" he said, "Don't say nothing" -I still kept on by the side of him to the bottom of the lane, but as I was going to turn to the left I saw a young man -I put down my beer, and went to him; Ledgerwood went on - I then heard the tub fall; I thought he had thrown it down and gone away - I went to see, and he was alongside of the tub; I said to him, "What, can't you carry it?" he said it was so heavy; as I was turning away to go to the young man, who lives at the Windsor Castle public-house, some one down the lane called out Canter, or some such name, and Ledgerwood answered; the other one then said,"Where are you?" and Ledgerwood said, "Here I am-come on" - I believe this to be the tub.</p>

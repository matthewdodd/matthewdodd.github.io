A man came from Mr. Masters's in Holborn next day, and asked if we had not been robbed. I went to Mr. Masters's, who is a pawnbroker in Holborn, there I found these four aprons, and one linen table cloth.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) My husband's things were all sold. I was present when they were examined before the justice. Price there confessed that he took the things; he said he sold my husband's coat and shoes to a Jew; he said Bedwell was with him; she said that she met him in Holborn, and he gave the things to her; he said he got in over the door.</p>
               <p>- Brooks. I am a pawnbroker. Bedwell brought these things to pledge on the 4th of July; I scrupled their being her own; she said she would fetch her sister to satisfy me that they were her own. She did not come again.</p>

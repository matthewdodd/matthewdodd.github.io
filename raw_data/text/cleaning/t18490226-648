                  </hi> am one of the presidents of the London District Post-office. On Saturday, 17th Feb., I caused a letter to be written and addressed, "Miss Davis, at Mrs. Clark's, Ponder's-end"—I put into it a half-sovereign, a fourpenny-piece, and a shilling's worth of postage-stamps, all which I marked in Coles' presence—I sealed it and gave it to Peak with instructions—the prisoner is a letter-carrier at Ponder's-end, Enfield—on the Monday following I went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Mrs. Clark's, at Ponder's-end, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of what was told me there, I went in the direction in which I expected to meet the prisoner—I met him a little before nine o'clock in the morning—I stopped him and asked whether he was the postman—he said, "Yes"—I told him I was Mr. Sculthorpe, of the Post-office, and asked him whether he had a letter that morning addressed to Miss Davis, at Mrs. Clark's, Ponder's-end—he said no, he had not seen such a letter—Pesk, the officer, then came up and joined us, and I said to the prisoner, "Let me see what money you have got in your pocket"—he put his hand into his pocket and brought out seven or eight shillings—I noticed that my money was not there—after looking at it I said, "You have more money than this about you"—he then put his hand into his pocket, began to <hi rend="italic">fumble</hi> about, and I said to Peak, "Search him"—Peak then drew his hand from his pocket, and in his band I saw my half-sovereign and fourpenny-piece—I said, "This is my money"—he said, "That it is not, it is mine; I received it at three o'clock yesterday, in Oxford-street"—he was then taken to the post-office at Ponder's-end, and I there asked him whether he had any postage-stamps about him—he said no, he had not—I ordered Peak <hi rend="italic">to</hi> make a farther search, and he took from one of his pockets the twelve identical stamps I had enclosed in the letter—I said, "These are my stamps"—he said, "That they are not; I took them from a young woman in Thomas-street, Oxford-street, yesterday"—Peak took this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him in my presence—there are five marks of mine on it, and it is a portion of what I enclosed the money and stamps in on the Saturday—the money and stamps are the same which I enclosed—every stamp is marked—Ponder's-end is in the prisoner's district—supposing a letter for Ponder's-end to be put in at Waltham-cross on the Sunday evening, it would be forwarded on the Monday morning by the mail<lb></lb>bag</p>

               <p>WALTER BARNDEN. I live at No. 25, Brick-lane. On the 4th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was going from Fleet-market to Blackfriars-bridge; I had a crown, five half-crowns, and three shillings in my purse; I was sober - the prisoner came up to me in <placeName id="t18261207-52-crimeloc309">Bridge-street, near Earl-street</placeName>

I did not know what I was about; I had been most of my time in the country - when I collared the prisoner, some others caught hold of me behind, and said, "What do you want with him, he has not got your money; that man has got it, who is running away;" he got from me, and ran down Earl-street; I hallooed Stop thief! and he was secured before I lost sight of him; I have not found my money; he said, at Guildhall, if I would not come against him, he would get all my money back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you expect to win or lose? A. I did not know what I was doing; I laid no wager.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and the prisoner was running down Earl-street, pursued by a number of people; he was secured, and the prosecutor gave the statement he has now, as he went to the Compter; I heard him say something to the prosecutor to the effect he has stated, but, being in conversation with another officer, I did not attend to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I would decide a wager; I asked what it was, and said, "Well, I will hold it, just to decide the wager;" he gave me the money, and told me to give it to the winner, which I did - he turned round, and said I had got his money.</p>

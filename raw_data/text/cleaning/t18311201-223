On the 19th of November I missed five watch-cases, which should have been in Taylor's hands, to be worked on in my shop; I asked Taylor, in Evans' presence, what had become of them - he told me they were not properly sprung, that the bowls were loose, and they were returned to Mr. Allen, from whom they had been received; I went to Allen, and not finding them, I returned - I told Taylor they were not at Allen's, and asked what had become of them; he then said he had given them to Evans to take home to his wife at dinner time, to instruct her to give them to Allen - Evans said he took them home, and was surprised his wife had not delivered them; I then went to Evans' house - they were not found there: I then had the prisoners taken into custody, and, in my presence, was found on Evans, two duplicates; I went to the pawnbroker's, and found one case, which I knew, and have since seen two others in the hands of Mr. Moss, which are mine; my wife also gave me two duplicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Taylor is the person in whose custody they should be? A. Yes; he is my foreman - it was his duty to examine the eases: I send them back if not perfect - workmen do not take work home without permission at any time; I had seen them in Taylor's possession - he keeps them in a box in the shop, of which he has the key, and at night the boxes are put into the iron chest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROE. Q.Have you a large shop? A. No - I had only the prisoners at that time in my employ; Evans is a finisher of movements, and had nothing to do with cases; he has had work home to finish.</p>

               <p>Court. Was the flooring all finished? - All but a little of the garret.</p>
               <p>The house then by your account was not finished fit for habitation? - No, my Lord, it wanted painting and glazing; there has been a great deal of lead taken from the houses all along the street, so they put me in to take care.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's counsel. You saw a shovel near this house that had been at your chamberdoor? - Yes, I saw the shovel there half an hour after they were taken.</p>

               <p>Court. At the first moment you saw them, where they in the situation of men easing themselves, or unbuttoning their breeches, or any thing of that sort? - I saw nothing of that, they were standing up when I first saw them; Fuller said he was easing himself; Fuller made a sort of snatch back, and I pulled him forward.</p>
               <p>But did he attempt to get away? - No.</p>
               <p>At the time you took them did you observe any things beside them at the wall? - No, not at that time, I found the shovel, two sacks and a crow, a yard off; I found the prisoners about fifteen yards back, there was an opening to the fields, they might have got away.</p>

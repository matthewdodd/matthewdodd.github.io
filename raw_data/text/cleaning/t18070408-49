               <p>Q. Was he there when you first went into his service. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of March were you unwell at any time in that month. - A. I was very ill the latter part of last March; I was taken ill the middle of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in the house. - A. He is a married man, he lodged at the Plough in Crown street, near Soho-square; I lived in the house with my young masters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you was ill the prisoner at the bar coming to you about any thing belonging to your master. - A. Yes, it was a Sunday morning we got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Got what. - A. A bottle of brandy, I cannot recollect the day of the month; I got up that morning very ill indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come in the morning. - A. Betwixt six and seven o'clock, he came to my master's house, he said to me he wanted some brandy; accordingly I had a key that would undo this desk in the accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he before that day know that you had a key of that desk. - A. Yes; after he said he wanted some bandy, I unlocked the desk, and took out the key of the brandy cellar; the prisoner took a stone bottle from the warehouse; we opened the brandy cellar and filled the bottle with three gallons of brandy. The prisoner took it up stairs, and went home with it to his lodgings. We put the key in the desk again and locked the desk up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the key from that you opened the desk. - A. That key I found in the bottom drawer in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you found that key. - A. About three weeks after I lived with Mr. Bramwell.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to ask you to get some brandy, how did he know that you had the key. - A. He knew before that I had the key, we had used it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of your masters at home that day. - A. Yes, both my young masters, but they were not up.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he took it home to his lodgings. - A. He told me so; I received one pound two and six-pence, as my share for the last brandy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I suppose sir, not one word of the story that you have been telling to day, did you tell your master till you were found out. - A. Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. I have the misfortune to speak low; I suppose not one word that you have told to day, did you tell your master till you were found out, and threatened to be prosecuted. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You stole a key three weeks after you had been with your master, you found your way to the cellar where you stole frequently; and now you hope to be believed by the jury. - A. I should wish to speak nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You know by speaking the truth you keep yourself from being tried. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you shall be hanged. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Three months you have been in your master's service, and according to your own account you have been robbing him all the time. - A. Not all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a house at Cambridge. - A. Me and my wife left it; there was a captain hired me and my wife, and we went and lived with him.</p>

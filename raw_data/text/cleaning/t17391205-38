L. the Letters standing cross each other, and a Dot on the near Shoulder. They were found on Monday, in the Possession of one Simmonds , a Butcher, in Smithfield: Five of them were kill'd, and four I saw alive, with my Pitchmark on them: I know they are mine. Simmonds told us he bought them of the Prisoner, and when we took him up, he offer'd to make us any manner of Satisfaction. I ask'd him if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173912050018"></xptr> had nobody with him, to help him to get the Sheep out of the Ground? He told us, no; he had no body but himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Life if he and his Son did not at first say the Sheep were lost on Sunday Night?</p>
               <p>Life. My Son will give an Account that he saw them, and told them on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You have said they were lost on Saturday Night.</p>
               <p>Life. No - we follow'd them on Monday Morning to Smithfield, and there we found them. The Prisoner lives about half a Mile from the Ground where these Sheep were kept: He looks after Sheep there.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Life. On Sunday Morning I told 53 Sheep in the Field: On Monday Morning Nine were missing: I follow'd the Marks of their Feet Half a Mile into the the Road, and concluding they were gone to Smithfiels, I went thither, and found Mr. Simmonds killing one of them: I knew it, and asked him, if he had any of them alive? He said yes, and shew'd me four mark'd R.L. the Letters across, and a Dot on the near Shoulder: I found likewise five of the Skins there; all of them had the same Marks: I could discover by the Skins, that there were five Ews and four Wedthers. Simmonds told me he bought them all of the Prisoner; upon which I went to his House, and charg'd him with having sold our Sheep, and he offer'd to make any Satisfaction that my Father-in-Law desired. He did not say he took the Sheep, but when I ask'd him if he had any one with him when they were taken, he said no, there was no body but himself, and he said he had sold them to Simmonds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he measur'd the Mark of the Man's Foot in the Field.</p>
               <p>Stevenson . I did so: And as I brought the Prisoner along, I measur'd his Foot: The Prisoner's Foot was a little longer than the Mark in the Ground; but the Ground being slippery, his Foot might draw back.</p>

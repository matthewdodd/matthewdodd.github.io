                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Holt, of Mabb's-place, Fetter-lane, in the parish of St. Dunstan; he is a green-grocer an fruiterer. The prisoner, Mary Starkie, came into my service the latter end of May—the other prisoner is her mother—I knew her at the time to be her mother—she came to my house once—I only saw her there once—I attend Far<lb></lb>ringdon-market to sell my goods, and so does my husband—at the time Mary Starrkie was with us, I had 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Which I had earned and saved up—there were two sovereigns, four half-soverigns, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sixpences, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in shil<lb></lb>lings—It was chiefly in silver—I kept it in a box under my bed, locked up—the prisoner left me on the 12th as I missed it on the 19th—I did not miss any thing till after she went—I went to get 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay a bill, and the money</p>

               <p>was all gone—I missed it all at once—three weeks before she came to me, the money was all safe—I did not look at it from that time till nearly a week after she left—I had no other servant while she was with me—the box was not broken—It had been opened by a false key—I had the charge of the box alone, not my husband—a brooch that was in the box was also gone—I missed six half-crowns, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in farthings and six sixpences, out of a drawer—two of them were new ones—It was all I was worth—I missed the money out of the box, on the 19th—I missed the property from the drawer, at her last examination—the money in the drawer was there three weeks after she came into my service—I missed a pillow-case about the same time as the money from the drawer—I had seen it safe when I saw the money—I had seen it safe about a month before I missed it—I missed a pair of women's boots, a silk handkerchief, a child's pina<lb></lb>fore and cap—I had kept them down stairs in the drawers, which were open—I had not missed any of the linen articles before I lost the money—I missed the "Pilgrim's Progress" with my children's ages in it—I saw the book and the brooch again, at the examination at Guildhall, in Au<lb></lb>gust—I had not seen the book for two months after she had been with me—about three weeks before she left me, she told me she had been mar<lb></lb>ried a month before she came to me—I did not give her warning, but she gave me a week's warning, saying her husband wanted her at home, and she went home to her mother when she left me—she was living at her mother's—I went there a week after she left me—my sister keeps the house they lived in—I was often at my sister's, but never saw the rooms they occupied—I found the book I had missed on the mother's premises—w en I missed the money on the Sunday, I went with the officer and looked about the place, and under the bed I found a handkerchief, a pillow-case, and cap, and my book—this was the Sunday after she left—I found my brooch in a little box on the table, in the front room, and the book also—the prisoners were in the Compter at that time—they had been taken up on the Wednesday—at the second hearing, when I went home, I heard something, and went over to Mrs. Graham, who gave me a key.</p>

I was applied to, to apprehend the prisoners on the 19th of August—I went and appre<lb></lb>hended them between mine and ten o'clock at night, at No. 1, Brackley-street, Golden-lane—the daughter was in the garret of the front room, and her sweetheart was on the bed—the mother was not at home at that time; she came home, and I took her the same night, between ten and eleven o'clock—I found the brooch on the table in the front garret, which is a sitting-room—next day I went and found the book on the same table, and the pillow-case on a pillow in the bed; and under the bed a pinafore, cap, a pair of boots, and handkerchief—they rented the front and back garrets—t e bed was in the back room—I found nothing else which has been claimed—I found a good deal of other property, five new gowns, three gown-pieces unmade, one on the premises, and two at a dressmaker's, two remnants of calico, and ten napkins—I found under the tiles, out of the window, a pillow-case marked W., four towels, a table-cloth marked F., two shawls, two children's frocks, two lengths of muslin for window cur<lb></lb>tains, three cotton aprons, two petticoats, five children's shirts, a length of flannel, a black veil, four lengths of lace, three handkerchiefs, several caps, a bonnet, and other things—the gowns appeared all nearly the same size, to fit the prisoner Mary—some of them appeared to fit the elder prisoner—I have had the articles I found in my possession ever since.</p>

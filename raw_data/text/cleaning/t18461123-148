                  </hi>. I live in Little Queen-street, Holborn. On the 23rd of Nov., about twelve o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Gray's Inn-lane—the prisoners accosted me—they all three took hold <hi rend="italic">of</hi> me at once—one of them took hold of my watch, and took it out by main force—my watch-guard broke—I have got the remainder of it in my pocket now—I called "Police," and held Dixon and Franklin till the policeman came—I am sure of them—Boyd ran away, but not out of my sight—I can swear she is one of the three who accosted me—they said nothing to me.</p>

On the 1st of May, at a quarter-past ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner pass my beat with these fan-lights on his shoulder, near Bainbridge-street - I followed, and told him to put them down; I asked him where he got them - he said at his master's, and he was going to Ely-place, Holborn - I wanted him to tell me where his master lived; he put them down, and ran away; I pursued, and took him, without losing sight of him.</p>

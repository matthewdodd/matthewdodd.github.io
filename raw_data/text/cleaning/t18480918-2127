My friend William Chubb went down last week to spend a month with his father, who is a Magistrate, and solicitor to the Corporation of Malmsbury, and he wrote to me on Thursday, inviting me down, and requesting me to fix the day. Previous to my receiving his letter the events which I wrote of to John, occurred. On Friday evening 1 was informed that the secretary of the Felon-club was arrested, and I knew immediately that my turn was next; I accordingly resolved not to return home till late, and to start for Malmsbury next night. I spent the night in bidding farewell to some quiet English friends, who abominate Chartism, and where I was obliged to act the hypocrite, which I am pretty well used to now; and after midnight I made for home, reconnoitering cautiously as! went along. As I drew near to my own street, I perceived a figure watching me sideways, I strove to avoid him, but he walked up to me, it was a friend; he gave me a sign to keep quiet, and we proceeded quickly in another direction, when he told me he had discovered, through a friend is the police, that there was a warrant out for me, and that there were two policemen, in plain clothes, waiting opposite my own door, he and another friend had posted themselves at either end of the street, outside the police, so as to prevent my falling into their hands at either side; it was, however a very narrow escape; for the, police had noticed their movements. I went with my friends to the private residence of one of the foreign ambassadors, where I supped, slept, and breakfasted next morning; not with his excelled, however, for he was not in town; but with his landlord, a <hi rend="italic">jolly old brick</hi> who seemed quite pleased with the mystery. I was introduced to his wife and daughter, as a Mr. Robinson, and I was near getting into a little hobble by forgetting my new name" (<hi rend="italic">an erasure was here made</hi>) "I scratch this out for fear of this letter being opened. When I went out I learnt that two of my friends went to my lodging, and burned or carried away every paper that had any allusion to political matters before four o'clock on Saturday; they were scarce gone when the police arrived, and carried away everything they could find, and among the rest Wm. Chubb's letter, which gave them a club to my intended route, and of course compels me to forego all my connections and wander somewhere where I have no friends; I am now an outlaw, and there's no use in <hi rend="italic">bilking</hi> the question, my neck is in danger if I am canght—however, I am in excellent spirits, and the only thing in the world that frees me is the bad opinion that will be formed of me by Wm. Chubb and a few other English friends, whose good opinion I valued. However, my consciences is quite at rest: I calculated the risk before I entered upon this business, and I am content to abide the consequences. I must write very little to and-you for a while, and that little will come to you with the London post-mark As long as I am silent you may be sure I am safe, as I will write the moment I am arrested, if I am so unfortunate. My friends are all astonished that am so little uneasy, but I only laugh at them; it is, however, most strange for it has always happened with me that even trifling misfortunes have preyes upon my spirits; but this utter wreck of my prospects has produced a kind to reckless levity, that seems almost unnatural. I have met with the greates. kindness from parties from whom I could not have expected it, but it is only in adversity that you can know who arc your friends. Whenever an of you)."</p>

Mullins, Brewster, Dowling, Bezer, myself, Fay, Thompson, Donovan, Lynch, Fuzzon, Warry, Allnutt, Ferdinando, Raymond, and others—a report was given in by the new delegates the same as before—(there had tan a resolution passed at Cartwright's, on July 30th, that four more should be added to the Ulterior Committee, to make it nine)—I do not think I saw this paper there—I might have done so—Bezer gave in his return of fighting men as fifty—he came from our district, Cartwright's—I cannot say what number the others returned—it was taken down either in pencil or ink—the Irish Felon Society was held in our locality, and the Star Society—there was also a club called the Davis' Club, the Emmett Brigade, and the Tom Paine's locality, and various others—there were delegates from each of those localities at the meetings I have mentioned—there was a jealousy that there were not enough Irish on the Ulterior Committee, and four more were added—they were Thompson, Lynch, Fay, and Donovan—there was a discussion on the propriety of sending a person to some part of Limerick or Cork, to ascertain how they were getting on—I do not know who proposed it it was not adopted—the reason stated was because it was not likely they could get any true intelligence of the state of the country—a proposition was made by the prisoner that there should be a demonstration on Sunday, 6th Aug., at two o'clock, of Chartists and Confederates, on Primrose-hill, to ascertain the strength and numbers of the people—it was lost by a majority of five—a resolution was carried to the effect that every delegate should return to his locality, and ascertain how the members were for regularity of preparation, and ready to be called out at an hour's notice—I do not know that that was a substitute for the Primrose-hill meeting—it was after that had been disposed of—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Cartwright's on Friday, Aug. 4th, at eight o'clock—Mullins stated he had seen Mr. Kydd that day, 1st Aug., and that Mr. Kydd had said, if the people came out for physical force, he would not be backward in heading them; but that he, Kydd, had entered on the executive as a moral-force man, and had taken the office only on that ground—that was what</p>

               <p>Mullins remarked on Kyiid's statement to him—that was received with a degree of belief—Kycid was one of the executive of the council of the Chartists, of the convention that sat in John-street—I know out Cripplcgate-street district was in communication with the executive in John-street—we next met at Cartwright's on Friday evening, 4th Aug—there were thirty-two present—Mr. Payne was in the chair—Rose, Brewester Gurney, (his first appearance,) Mullins, Bassett, (his second appearance' Cuffey, Donovan, Lynch, Dowling, myself, Thompson, and others—the committee had met previously at three, before the whole body—the prisoner was present in the evening, but I will not say he was present at the committee—the committee sat half an hour or an hour, before the rest of the body joined them, and there was a discussion about what scarfs were to be worn as a sign of officership—a red scarf was mentioned; and it was deter<lb></lb>mined that they should have red scarfs—I was present, and Brewster also a report was given in that evening by the new delegates of the number of men, the same as before—I should tell you that the committee who were sitting, Payne, Rose, Brewster, Mullins, and Bassett, had some converse I tion about a circular that Mr. Kydd had received, stating that they were desirous of knowing how far the committee of delegates then sitting in London were disposed to send a delegate to Manchester—it was decided to do so—Mr. Lacey's name was mentioned, and Bassett was deputed to want upon him, and Rose gave Bassett money that Lacey might go on the following morning (Saturday)—a resolution was passed that evening, to the effect that the delegates should submit to the determination of the ulterior committee, whatever it was—the thirty-two were then present—a resolution was passed that the delegates should call on the members in their localities to meet at half-past two on the following Sunday, the 6th, at their localities, and to prevent if possible the members attending the meeting on Kenningtion' common; to wait there till their delegates returned from Ken<lb></lb>nington-commes—there was a meeting advertised to take place at Kennington-common that day, called by Mr. Dwaine—to the best of my belief it was to be at three o'clock—each delegate, in his particular district, was to have his members—their place of meeting, to keep them from going, till the delegates retuned from the Dispatch Coffee-house—it being an unlawful meeting, many of the members would be brought in contact with the police, and they were desirous I of preventing it—there was a resolution passed that we should meet on the following Sunday at the Dispatch Coffee-house—there was also another resolution passed for every delegate to select four men, to appoint then as telegraphs on the Sunday, and to station them from Fleet-street to Ken-nington-common—the delegates were to be at the Dispatch Coffee-house, and thus communicate with the persons at Kennington-common—I attended the meeting on the Sunday—there were from twenty-five to thirty persoss present—I do not recollect that the prisoner was present—the arrangement was carried out of having men placed between the Despatch Coffee-house and the Common—I was appointed as one of the lookers-on, to see that!" the telegraphs should be stationed—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Dennis's Coffee-house on the Monday evening—I attended it-there were about thirty present—it began at eight—the prisoner was there—Ritchie and Cuffey, and the whole nine of the ulterior committee were there and others, amounting to thirty—that night the ulterior committee resignes—on account of the reports in the papers of the arrest of Smith O'Brien in Ireland, and Mullins explained that he had no confidence in the other ✗ who were selected on the committee, that he had not seen their plans—he</p>

               <p>alluded to the four new Irishmen that had been added—one or two of the other made the same statement—there—was a fresh election—Messrs. Rose, Mullins, Brewster, Payne, and Bassett were elected, and were called the ulterior committee—a resolution was passed that there should be a president, and that the one who had the lowest post on the committee was to retire when the pre-sidcntcame in—this was a visionary president—he was not named—there was some remark made by persons present that he was somebody and nobody—he was somebody to be talked about, and nothing more—a resolution was then passed that the sum of three-farthings should be levied on every member of evey locality for the purpose of paying this president, to supply him with a salary—no time was specified for the payment—every delegate was to make the statement to the members in his locality—a letter was read by Mr. Payne, which I can only explain in this way, as he read it, that trade, was very good, and we should soon have a good order—he stated that the letter came from Mr. Lacey, who had been sent to Manchester—there was some degree of satisfaction expressed by many of the delegates present—they were glad to hear Lacey was going on well—a resolution was passed that they should meet on Wednesday, Aug. 9th, at the Lord Denman beer-shop, in Suffolk-street, Blackfriar's-road—Messrs. Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Doffling, myself, Gurrney, Donovan, Bassett, and others, twenty-eight in all, were present—reports were given in by the new delegates of the feeling of their localities, and the number of fighting men, and the state of preparation they were in—I do not think anything was said about ball-cartridges, or anything of that sort; merely about preparation—Payne was in the chair, but Mullins acted as chief speaker—he was vice-chairman, and sat at the other end of the table—he called on all the delegates to declare their allegi-ance and determination to abide by the decision of the committee for the good of the people—they did not swear, but some declared solemnly, and some said they were determined to risk their lives, and abide by the deci-sion of the committee—Payne read another letter from Lacey, stating that all was going on well, that he was still at Manchester or some other part of the country, and there was a question asked how long he was to con-tinue there, and Payne said he was to remain there as long as necessary—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Perry's coffee-house, Church-street, Bethnal-green, or Shoreditch, on the following Friday, 11th, at eight o'clock—I went, but found no meeting—I was informed that the police had been to Rose's bouse, and had seized his papers, and that all was up—I then went borne—I heard on the following Sunday that there was to be a meeting on the following Monday night, 14th, at the Orange Tree beer-shop, Orange-street, Red Lion-square—I attended it, and I was asked why I was not at the other two meetings that bad taken place since Wednesday—I found, I should say, twenty-five there—I have not got their names, but I think I can tell them—there was Cuffey, Brewster, Payne, Mullins, Gurney, Fay, Ritchie, Scurry, myself and others—Dowling was not there, at least I did not see him there—wumey asked me how it was I did not go to the meeting at Perry's coffee house—I said I did go, and there was none held—he said there was, and then he told me where it was held—Payne was in the chair at the Orange Tree, but Mullins was the spokesman, and he was chief spokesman on all occasions—he called on us to give a return of the number of ball-cartridges that each delegate and his members had prepared—each delegate gave in his return of half-cartridges that he had prepared, and also what the members of his parti-cular district had prepared—I did not take any note of the number—I think it was somewhere about 500 or 600—there was a return given in of the number</p>

               <p>of fighting men—Mullins stated that there were nearly 5000 fighting men of the Chartists alone—a return was also given in from the Confederates—I can not remember the number of them for a certainty, but I think it was something bordering upon the same number—it was a considerable number—✗ said the time was near at hand—he said, "Gentlemen, the next business is that I want every delegate to select four or six men, or more, as many as the can select iron; his locality"—there was a question asked what they were for-J do not know by whom—Cuffy answered, "To fire houses, railway premises trains, or anything"—I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> not put anything down at the meeting—I was obliged to be cautious not to put any thing down—Mullias looked up at the gas which goes along the ceiling, and said "If I look up at the gas, you will at know what I mean"—I was asked how many men 1 thought I could select and I said two, and the other delegates right round gave in a return also—it was said they were to be men who could be depended on, who would do any-thing and everything—in the course of the evening there was a propositives made and carried, to send a deputation of two persons to have an interview with some of the North-Western Railway engineers, and ascertain what then feelings were, and whether they were willing <hi rend="italic">to come</hi> over and assist the Chartists—Ritchie and Scurry were proposed and unanimously carried the purpose—I was not aware till that evening that there had been a def-erence between the engineers and the company—it was mentioned then because it was requested to know what they were going for—is. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was voted to defray their expenses for refreshment—they left forthwith on lie: mission—they were not present when the other resolutions were passed-! did not see any more of them that evening—there was a resolution passed that we should meet at half-past seven at the Lord Denman on the following Tues-day evening—I went—Payne, Brewster, Mullins, Cuffey, Dowling, Allnutt, Fey Gurney, Lacey, Ritchie, Ferdinando, and others, in all about forty, were there-Lacey was there when I got there—he entered into conversation with several of us, and told us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester, and I think he said Liverpool, but am not certain, were up and were doing, or would be doing that night, and he had been watched all day by the police, and as he was coming out of his street-door, a boy came up and told him that he was watched by the police—I had never seen Lacey before, I had only heard of him—he said he had been to Birmingham and Manchester, and other places, but I do not re-member for a certainty what those places were, and he had also been watched for two hours, and he gave the police the <hi rend="italic">double</hi>, and had reached the place safety—about three quarters of an hour after that, there was a distributee colours by Brewster—they were twisted plaited ribbons, and were gives a the delegates so that they might be recognised as the leaders of the people—Brewster stated so—they were to be put on the left arm—they were three colours, red, white, and some other—I received one—Mullins was prcsent as their distribution, and after that some of the committee came in—they were not-all present, at least I did not see them, but one or two of them spoke, are told Lacey they had better retire and consult—the room up-stairs was ✗ pied by a <hi rend="italic">sing-song</hi>, and we had the lower room—Lacey said, "If yes will wait a while I will go and see at a neighbour's coffee-house, whether we cannot have a room"—he went out, returned, and said "All right, or some such word-, and the committee <hi rend="italic">went</hi> out with him—I did not go—they were gone about three quarters of an hour, or it might have been an hour—the delegates remained till they returned—they went away, to consult to gather-when they retured, Cuffey said, "Now, Mr. Chairman, you has better give the; instructions as quick as possible"—Mullins was acting-as</p>

               <p>chairman—Laccy went with them when they went out—I did not see him return with them, and was surprised at it—Cuffey was secretary; I was informed he was chosen secretary by the committee—Mullins said, "Gentle-men, as you are aware, the committee have retired, and come to certain reso-lutions and decisions; they have directed me to give you the following instructions; and as our friend, Mr. Lacey, has informed us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester are up, and will be doing to-night, and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement, therefore, gentlemen, to-morrow night you must come out to fight and strike the blow; and it is necessary, gentlemen, that you should speak out honestly and boldly, for there must be no flinching in the matter"—Cuffey stood by the fireplace, and said, "You had better put it round, Mr. Chairman, to every one present; let them answer, 'Yes' or 'No'"—Mullins on that appealed to a delegate sitting by me, and said, "Will you come out to fight?"—he said, "Yes"—he said to me," Will you?" and I said, "Yes"—then he said, "Will you?" addressing each in turn, one by one, round the room, till he came to Mr. Ferdenando, who made a bit of a speech, and explained his reasons that he could not conscien-tiously say "Yes" to coming out—he objected, he was not agreeable; in fact, he said, "No"—he gave his reason, and then said, "No," and sat down—there was one more of the same opinion—I do not know his name—he was companion delegate, I understood, to Allnutt, who sat by his side—with the exception of those two, the answer from the rest was, "Yes"—after that Mullins said, "Gentlemen, you must understand we shall take up four posi<lb></lb>tions: Clerkenwell-green will be taken by Mr. Brewster; the Tower Hamlets will be taken by Mr. Payne;" and the Seven Dials, and the Broadway, Westminster, were the other two positions—Basset and Mullins were to take those two—I do not know which was to take each—Mullins said, after giving the instructions in that manner, "Gentlemen," every delegate must assemble the members of his locality, for them to communicate to their locality at eight o'clock precisely"—it was to be the next night—there was a question asked by a delegate, I do not know who, how they were to get there with their pikes and poles?—Mullins said, "I can only say they must get them there the best way they can," (some of the poles were ten feet long), "and at twenty minates past nine, to a second, every delegate must be with his men at their respective positions"—the delegates were to come armed—Mullins proposed, and it was carried unanimously, that Ritchie was to superintend and direct those men that were to be selected for the purpose of firing houses, railway premises, trains, or anything—Ritchie undertook it—the Orange Tree was to be the place of meeting—a question was asked, how Ritchie was to know these men, and some person said, "I propose the password to be, 'Frost and Mitchell'"—Allnutt proposed the word "Justice"—it was put, and carried unanimously; so that when these men entered the room Ritchie might ask them, "What do you want? who do you want?" and they would make reply, "Justice;" and then he would know them—Mullins said to Payne, "Just take a list of the number of men;" and he put them down; but he made a mistake, and there was some little confusion with the delegates—he went round the room again, and the number was reckoned forty-six—he applied to the person who sat next to me first, and then to me, and I said, "Two," but I could only depend on one—he went round to every delegate, and in that way forty-six was made up—Gurney was there at the time, and when—I said I could select two, he said, "Oh, nonsense, you can select more than that, half a dozen, I know" I Was rather put out at his taking on himself to judge upon it; in fact, there Was but one man that I could depend on for the purpose—Gurney</p>

               <p>was one of the wardens before I was elected on the council—each warden has 100 men under him, according to the rules of the Society—after the number of men was taken, the last words Mullins uttered were, "May the bitterest curse of God hang on the soul of that man that shall betray any one of us"—it was such a colour as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that was to be tied round the arm—nothing more took place that I remember—I came away—the prisoner was there that night, and sat nearly opposite me—I attended a meeting on the following day, 15th—it had been arranged on the Tuesday evening at the Lord Denman, that our locality, the Finsbury, City, and Clerkenwell loca<lb></lb>lities, were to meet Brewster at twelve o'clock, at the Crispin, in Milton-street, Cripplegate, to receive the delegates from each locality—I went, but did not arrive till a quarter to one—I found Brewster, Gill, Gurney, and I believe Fay, and others, eight or nine altogether—I have not made a note—Brewster said it was his intention to attack the Artillery-ground, and, if possible, to take it, and he should have to fight b——y hard, and that we should know by four o'clock in the afternoon whether the Government had received any intimation of what was going on—there was another person with him at the time; in fact, it was the man who told me at Perry's coffee-shop that there was no meeting there, and that it was all up with Rose—Brewster pointed to this person, and said, "Wait on me at Clerkenwcil-green when you are all there"—Brewster said, "Don't be afraid because you do not see the signals for a little while; you might not see the signals for half an hour, but wait a bit"—it had been arranged at the Orange Tree that there were to be bonfires—the men who were selected, were spoken to on that same evening, for I spoke to my men—Brewster also said, "Ritchie swears, so help his God, he will shost the first person dead that flinches from his duty."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What object had you in persuading those two men to join you in this. firing expedition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a resolution come to at the meeting to select, four men each, and I did not know any more, except those two men—one man was disposed, and Abel, when I left him, did not seem disposed, and I never took any further notice of him—I felt bound to carry out the resolution of the delegates, or I could not have led them to feel I was discharging my duty—the other man I spoke to was not a delegate—I did not want to entrap him into this—I spoke to him on the subject, and left it to his own option—was doubtful whether he would do it, and although he told me he would go to the Orange Tree I did not believe him, and he did not go—I did not use any effort to persuade him to join in firing the houses—I told him what it was for, and said, "Consider it"—I did not endeavour to entrap the men; it was just to carry out the resolution—if he had fulfilled the resolution, it would certainly have entrapped him; but unless I had spoken to him I should not have fulfilled that which was expected of me—I did not feel bound</p>

               <p>to carry out the resolution to the extent required, but merely just to speak to the men—it was never my intention to get them to do such a thing—if they had consented to fire houses I should not have dissuaded them; but it was not my intention they should do it, for all that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first begin to communicate this affair to the Govern<lb></lb>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Soon after 10th April—the Secret Committee sat the very next day after I attended the first meeting—that was on 20th July—I was not in communication with the Government before that—I first put myself in com<lb></lb>munication with these parties very soon after 10th April, very soon after I joined the Chartists—I communicated every movement that I knew of, from time to time; they knew everything—I saw something illegal in the council when I first joined them—I knew that there was a rising; that was before I put myself in communication with the Government—the parties with whom I communicated did not persuade me to continue among the delegates—they did not tell me not to do so; I did it of my own accord—I saw them, often, I did not see them regularly once a week—I do not know what has become of the man I wanted to fire the houses—I went to none but the two, I never spoke to a soul besides—I did not tell him anything about firing railways—I said it was for firing houses and premises—there was not a word said about killing the police on that occasion—if I bad received orders from the delegates to get any one to kill the police, I should not have considered myself bound to carry them out; I merely did what I was desired, with reference to firing houses; I merely spoke to him—I never said they were not to consider whether there were people in the houses—this is the only occasion on which I have got people to fire houses; the only occasion on which I was asked to go—if I had been asked on other occasions I should have done so—I should not have fired any houses—I only heard the men talk about a Republic once—Dowling was present then—when Payne spoke of destroying the power of the Queen I said nothing, I was not on the Committee, and was surprised that they allowed me to be present—Rose spoke about assassinating the police—I was in communication with the police then—I offered no remarks on the subject, as I had no right to be there while they were sitting—it was business which ought to have been transacted by the committee alone—as delegate ought to have been present—I was present on one or two other occasions—they generally met before the general body of delegates, and before the delegates left they consulted together—that was the meeting where they produced plans, and talked about barricades—it did not occur to me that it was a curious thing that such important things should be communicated at a meeting at which I had no right to be present—nothing was said about my presence—there is no doubt there were many propositions made that were not made known to the general body of the delegates—I saw a plan; to the best of my knowledge this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on my solemn oath the word "fighting men" was used—the very first night Mullins asked us to give in out returns of the number of fighting men, those were his words—it was proposed, I think, by Donovan, to send a delegate over to Limerick or Cork to know how things were, in consequence of the difficulty of getting in<lb></lb>formation at the time the excitement was going on—I do not remember Dublin being mentioned—I never heard of any communication between the delegates and the people of Cork or Limerick—when Mullins said, "May the bitterest curse of God hang on the soul of the first man who betrays any one of us," I did not think he meant me, because he did not know I was in communication—I have been a carpenter for the last ten years—I was a bed-pillar carver before that—I have made more by carpententry</p>

I heard him say it was necessary for each man to prepare himself for the <hi rend="italic">crests</hi> that was coming, and it was necessary for each man to make a small sacrifice to aid the Committee of Progress in their under<lb></lb>takings, and they would judge by the exertions they made whether they were prepared or not—at a meeting there on Tuesday, 15th Aug., between thirty and forty Chartists and Confederates were present—at one time there were forty—it was staled that they were waiting for delegates from the Committee of Progress—on Wednesday, 16th Aug., about eight o'clock, I went to the Chartist meeting-house in Praed-street—about twenty of the Emmenet Brigade were assembled—it was said that they were waiting for orders; they did not say for what, but it was generally understood for an outbreak—I went from thence to Breaden's, I got there about half-past eight or a quarters to nine, and found thirty or forty persons of the same class—Mullins came in and a man named Smith clapped him on the shoulder, and said, "My boy, I was afraid you were taken"—he said, "No, they only take me with my life'—he retired, and a man named Cruickshank came in and placed a musket on the table—I had seen him there once or twice before—I do not know what branch he was a member of—there were two pistols, and several pikes and pike—heads, in the room—I heard the question put whether they were pre<lb></lb>pared, and whether they had got their <hi rend="italic">toothpicks</hi>, which was the name they gave them—Mullins and others retired into another room—when they came back I was sitting in the angle of the room, and saw Mullins look into the room, and withdraw out of my sight—Smith said to me, but I cannot swear whether it was in Mullin's presence, that they were to be in readiness to meet their leader at Crown-street Soho-square, and the Seven Dials, at ten o'clock—the leader's name was not mentioned—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which I was informed—had brought Mullins, drove up to the door, and he went away in it—I believe there was a question asked how they were to take their arms—the answers in the best way they could—I went to Crown-street, Soho, walked down to the bottom, and recognied about thirty persons whom I had seen in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—this paper of hieroglyphics (<hi rend="italic">No</hi>. 11) is not my writing, but it is an exact copy of the original, which I wrote—I wrote it without any reference to the Charter—I and the prisoner agreed to hold a correspondence in hieroglyphics, and I gave this cipher to the prisoner for that purpose, as a short-hand means of correspondence—there was no use made of it at all with respect to the Charter—I gave it him without any soli<lb></lb>citation on his part—my letters had been opened by the Post-office, and this was a plan I thought of, to write—it was more as a pastime, or a little amuse<lb></lb>ment—I am not a Chartist, and I do not believe the prisoner is—I gave him the paper for no other purpose than my own private correspondence.</p>

I have known Dowling about fifteen months—I am a member of the Repeal club of which he was the secretary—that club never appointed a delegate to the Chartists—I was a member of the Davis Club—the rules of that club were settled by two eminent lawyers, Sir Colman O'Loughlin and Sir Robert Holmes, and revised by Mr. Anstey, M. P. for Youghal, who was a member of the club—that club was dissolved for the purpose of being incorporated with the Irish League on the motion of Dowling—I can swear that body was for moral force—Dowling introduced a resolution approving of the principles of the Irish League—that club was bound to legal agitation.</p>

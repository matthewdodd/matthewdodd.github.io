                  </hi>. I live in Cornhill, and am a woollen-draper. On the afternoon of the 24th of October, I was in the counting-house, at the back of my shop, and saw the prisoner going out of the shop door with five yards and a half of woollen cloth under his arm—it had been on a shelf—I went and overtook him in Lombard-street, with it under his arm—I asked where he was going—he said a gentleman told him to carry it to the West-end—I am sure he is the person who was carrying it out of the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The witness asked how many coats I was going to make out of the cloth—he did not ask where I was going—the gentleman was close behind. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, I did; and he said he was going to take it to the West-end, that a gentleman told him to go into the shop and take it—it is the shop of Mr. Henry Lister Thornhill, and another.</p>

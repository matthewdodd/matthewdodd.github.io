                  </hi>. I am a yard-man and book-keeper to the East India Dock Company, at the Crutched Friar's tea-warehouse. On the morning of the 27th of July I observed the prisoner Hill in the yard, about eighteen or twenty minutes before nine o'clock—he sat on the iron cannon as the clock was striking nine—about an hour after, he came into the yard the second time, and apparently went up to the counting-house box—he went within about two yards of it, then turned short round to the right, and went in the direction of the tea-chests—they were laid there with a cloth over them—he moved the cloth, and looked, and put his hand into his pocket—there were six of these chests—there were marks on them—by his removing this cloth, it enabled him to see the marks—he was not a stranger there—when a gentleman gave him a chest to clear, he had business there, to take it away—he had been employed there at times, but was not that morning—he left the yard after that—I did not see either of the other prisoners till Sealey came with the order for the teas, about a quarter before one o'clock—Sealey said, "I want six chests for Airey, in Shoreditch," and he handed this paper to me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Crutched Friars, 6, 2382, Airey and Co., Shoreditch, cleared yesterday"—that corresponded with the marks on the chests—he had a kind of wine truck, be longing to Harrison, George-yard, Aldgate—I had known him as a labourer—I read the paper, "Airey, Shoreditch"—he said, "Yes, and they are going to the Swan-inn, Whitechapel"—he went away with them when they were loaded in the truck—there was no covering over them—they were only tied with a bit of cord—this was a yard belonging to the East India Dock Company.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known Hill as a carman coming to the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ever since the East India Dock Company has been in possession of the yard—sometimes once, some times twice a-week—he knew me perfectly well—he remained two or three minutes, when he came at nine o'clock, I was in the yard, at my station—there was other tea on the left-hand side along with the six—if it is a lowering morning, I do not uncover the teas—if fine, I do sometimes before nine o'clock—this was rather a fine morning—the pri soner moved the cloth on one side—I did not say any thing to him—I thought nothing of it—I merely noticed it—I have not got myself into any trouble, that I am aware of, for letting the tea go—I have had nobody complain of me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What security have you that the person who brought you this ticket was the person to whom you ought to deliver the teas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When a war rant is written off by the clerks in the counting-house, and the No. 1 paper comes over, it goes to the little box that he was going to, then they are signed with the initials of the officer, and then sent to the different offices, where they are written off, and then when they apply to me, I deliver them—that ticket was like those that are generally brought, and knowing the person who comes—not any person who produces a ticket with the number of the chests would get it, unless I knew them—there was only the officer sitting in the box, and myself in my proper place—the officer might have left the box—I do not know.</p>

               <p>Hill a little after one o'clock in the afternoon, on the 27th of July, talking with Sealey, about two doors from where the teas were stolen, under the French-horn gate-way, that is near the warehouse; and a quarter of an hour afterwards I observed Sealey and Reeves dragging a truck, with six chests of tea on it—the truck had got out of my sight, when I saw Hill running with his coat buttoned, as hard as he could run—the teas had gone up Jewry-street—he turned down John-street, as if to meet it if it turned round—I observed the chests particularly—I took one of the numbers as they passed by—I spoke to Mr. Moule, and in consequence of what he said, I ran off towards Whitechapel—when I got to the Swan Inn, I saw Sealey with six new cords—I asked him what had become of the tea he was dragging along Crutched Friars—he said, "I don't know, they sent me for the cords, and the teas have vanished"—I asked him who employed him—he said they were total strangers to him—I am quite certain I saw him and Hill talking before, and then saw him and Reeves dragging the truck—I know that Sealey and Hill were acquainted—I asked Sealey where was the document by which he got the teas—he pulled out the document produced—I went with him to the corner of the Minories, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Peter Palmer, living at No. 13, Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, about a mile and a quarter from Crutched Friars; his place of business is in Haydon-square. On the 27th of July I was there—any body going up John-street would come to Haydon-square—Hill had lent my master a cloth—on this 27th of July, Hill came to Haydon-square about ten minutes past two o'clock in a hurry, and said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>, I want that tilt"—I told him I could not well let him have it then, as I was afraid it might rain—he said he wanted it directly, as he had some furniture to move—upon that I let him have the tilt, and he went off with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the latest hour of clearing teas in the after noon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are various times, according to the different companies—the latest time in Haydon-square, Minories, is not later than twenty minutes past two o'clock—Hill had been in the habit of clearing teas—to the best of my knowledge it was his own tilt—he had lent it to my employer—my master is a little master-carman—I was not cramming the tilt down between some chests to make them steady—it was borrowed to cover over some chests of teas, and in going along from Cutler-street, some of them shook forwards, and some of the tilt shook into the hollow place—Hill did not object to that, that I know of—I cannot positively say whether it had struck two o'clock—if a man had been in the neighbourhood of Jewry-street,</p>

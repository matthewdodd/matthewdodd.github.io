On Friday the 14th of June, I was going out on an errand; I locked the door, and took the key in my hand, it was about half-past eleven o'clock- I did not go out; I sat down below, and when I returned up, I saw the prisoner in my room; he came out, and I stopped him, and told him he had been robbing me; he said, "There is no harm done my good lady;" he ran down, and I ran after him, and cried, stop thief, till he was taken by a policeman, who is here - I saw one of my drawers had had its contents turned out upon the bed, and another drawer wide open, as far as it would balance; I missed one spoon when I returned to the room, it is worth about 1s. 6d.; I had seen it safe the same morning; this is it; it is my husband's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She collared me, and took me into the room, and when she found the things were wrong in the room, she called out - I was knocking at the door when she came up. Witness. No, sir, he was in the room coming out - I suppose, he was three yards inside the room; I did not see him doing anything; I did collar him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How had the door been opened? A. By a picklock key I suppose - we found four keys when we went back into the room where the prisoner had been searched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time did you find them? A. Directly I returned from the Lord Mayor; within an hour.</p>

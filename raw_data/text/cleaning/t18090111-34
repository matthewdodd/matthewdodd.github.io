On the day laid in the indictment I was in the housekeeper's room with the prisoner; the hall bell rang; Mrs. Megan, the housekeeper, went and opened the door, and left the door open; she returned through the room where I was sitting into the adjoining room, and said a poor girl has left her basket here; on my hearing a poor girl was at the door, I ran to the door in great haste, saying, if she is a poor girl I will give her something. At my coming to the door I was much surprised to find instead of a poor girl a friend of Mrs. Megan's of the name of Fitzgerald; I then said, oh dear, Mrs. Fitzgerald, if it is you, why did you ring, you need not be afraid of me, you had seen me this day week; this was in the evening between six and seven. Mrs. Fitzgerald came in with me immediately into the housekeeper's room; the prisoner then met us without a basket, and we all came into the sitting room together, and sat down for a minute or two; on coming into the housekeeper's room, the bed room door exactly opposite was wide open; the basket stood full of something in her bed room; it was a mat basket; after sitting a minute or two, struck with suspicion, I got up, saying I should go and see whether a dress was ready for my mistress, but in reality run down stairs and called Burrows, a man servant. I went to my master and made him acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the basket ever before that time - A. No, certainly never.</p>

             said, I placed myself on the stairs, about six yards from the door; I saw Mrs. Megan coming out of the housekeeper's sitting room; she opened the street door, and stood with it in her hand; Mrs. Fitzgerald came out of the same room with a basket, and went towards the street door; I stopped her about a yard from the door in the hall. After I had taken the basket from Fitzgerald Mrs. Megan wished to take it into her own room; I refused; and took it up stairs to my master in the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mrs. Megan - A. She went into the sitting room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing taken out of the basket before you took it up to your master - A. Mrs. Megan took a paper parcel from the top. I opened the basket by my master's order; I found in it a china bowl and cover, a china dish or bowl, and a china chocolate cup, a blue and white mug, and a hand lanthorn; I left them there. Mrs. Megan was sent for into the dining room; I saw her go in; I saw nothing more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is the housekeeper's room on the same floor with the hall, and near the door - A. Yes; and the housekeeper's bed room is near her sitting room.</p>

             gave you - she came to you on that day - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any directions given that Burrows should be placed any where - A I immediately gave directions for Burrows to be placed in a direction to to observe both doors, to 
               <persName id="t18090111-34-person423">
                  Eliza

            .</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of these directions did Burrows bring that basket to you with these articles - A. He did. Burrows took out the articles; at the top of the basket was a bed tick; immediately after that there were the china, with paper put inside of them, and wrapped round with paper on the out; upon their being produced, Mrs. Adams said I will immediately swear to their being my property; the first thing I ordered was for the street door to be locked; then I sent for the prisoner to come up; I then asked her what she meaned by presuming to carry them things out of my house; she said, oh, they are some little things of my own. I then pointed to the things which stood upon the harpsichord, I said do you mean to tell me that these are your property; she said oh no, certainly not, sir, I put them in by mistake for things of my own; I believe, I then made use of a strong expression - do you know there are things in that basket for which you may be hanged; she said, oh no, she hoped not; I then said, you were to have left me in two or three days, I now tell you you shall not stay half an hour in my house. I then told her to take what necessaries she wanted for the night, and to leave my house immediately and to give up the keys; she then went down stairs. I almost immediately ran down to her in the housekeeper's room, there I found Mrs. Fitzgerald. I asked Mrs. Fitzgerald, in the presence of the prisoner, how she could presume to take any thing out of my house; she said she did not know they were mine. Mrs. Megan had told her they were her's, and desired her to take them home. I then said I could not contradict the assertion, as I had never seen her face before; I desired her immediately to walk out of my house; she immediately left my house, and the prisoner in about half an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you make any application to have her taken up - A. In the course of the next day; we looked about us, and she was taken to Marlborough street and committed. I have had the care of the things ever since.</p>
               <p>COURT. You told us you asked Fitzgerald how she could presume to take any thing out of your house, her answer was she did not know that they belonged to you - I want to know whether Megan said any thing - A No, I think not.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

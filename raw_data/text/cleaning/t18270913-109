I was at a public-house in Fleet-market; I left my horse and cart at the door, and went into the house; the prisoner came in while I was there - I had seen her twice before: we drank together. She then got up into the cart with me, and she drove the cart away - she took me up Holborn-hill, to the Wheatsheaf, public-house, and gave me something to drink- she then took me to a bad house; I recollect going up stairs, and sitting on a bed; I was very sick, and she took hold of my head, and said, "My dear, I will hold your head;" she then got her hand into my pocket - I said,"Don't rob me;" she said No, but she took out my money and my watch, by force. I then got on the bed, and the lady of the house came up, and called the patrol; she said she should be searched. I found some of my money on the drawers in the morning, but I lost 45s.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Ann's parish. I went to the house between seven and eight o'clock, on the 20th of August - I found the prosecutor very tipsy: I asked the prisoner if she had any property to give it to me - she would not, because she said she did not know what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130083"></xptr>I was. I then searched her, and took from her a watch and some money - I had been on duty before, and saw her and the prosecutor going along in the cart: I followed them, and told the woman of the house that the cart must go to the Green-yard, if the man did not come and take it away.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Pheasant-buildings, Gray's Inn-lane. The prisoner and the prosecutor came there, and had a room in my mistress' house; the prisoner called me, and said her friend was very sick and ill, and asked me to get a little brandy for him, and she gave me half-a-crown; my mistress then said she should not go away without the prosecutor, and sent me for the patrol, and insisted on her being searched. The watch was found in her possession - she said she was going home to his wife.</p>

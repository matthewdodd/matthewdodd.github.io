On the 28th of November I was going on board, and met the prisoner in Ratcliff-highway; she asked where I was going, and said I had better go with her; I did so; there was a bed in the room; she asked if I had any money; I said I had a sovereign, but no change, and, if she would take my word, I would pay in the morning, and stop with her; my sovereign was in my tobacco-pouch; I shewed it to her, and in five minutes she put her hand into my pocket; I took hold of her hand - she got out the tobacco-pouch, my spectacles, and silk handkerchief - the handkerchief fell on the floor; there was another girl in the house, who flew to her assistance; the prisoner told her to take the tobacco-pouch, and be off: the prisoner held me the while. I then got my spectacles from her by force, and called the watchman, who came and took her.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to the house where Julia Sweeney and the prisoner live as I heard the prosecutor and prisoner calling Watch! at half-past two o'clock in the morning. I asked the prosecutor what was the matter; he said he had lost his sovereign, and that the prisoner had given it to another woman, who had run away with it. I found only 6d. on the prisoner; after she was in custody, she called to me, and confessed that she had taken it, and gave it to the other girl, who ran away.</p>

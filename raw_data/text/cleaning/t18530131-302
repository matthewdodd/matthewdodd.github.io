                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, at No. 89, Watling-street, in the parish of St. John the Evangelist. On 7th Jan. I left my warehouse soon after 5 o'clock, leaving L'Estrange, my clerk and warehouseman, there—I got to the warehouse next morning at about 10 or 20 minutes past 9 o'clock, and found sergeant Shephard there—I received a communication from him in consequence of which I immediately looked to my warehouse, and found the stock and drawers in great confusion—my stock consists principally of silk goods—I missed about 200 pieces of silk, amounting to 2,000 handkerchiefs, partly printed, and of the value of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—L'Estrange had been taken away in custody before I arrived; I had not given him into custody, neither would I have done so if I had been present—he is still in my employ—two or three days previous to the robbery, the prisoner Taylor came into my warehouse, and said be wanted a few dozens of silk handkerchiefs—that not being a trade expression, caused me to look at him particularly—I told him I was not the right man to apply to, my transactions were large—he said he was going to Australia, and wished to take out a few dozens with him—supposing he was a countryman, and really disposed to speculate, I said I would endeavour to find him a lot—I made a lot up of twenty pieces of India corahs, and said, "You shall have those for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the lowest"—he said, "Very well; I will come again, and let you know in half an hour"—he never came back; that was the last I saw of him till he was taken into custody—these twenty pieces of corahs remained on the same spot, and were among those stolen.</p>

On 11th Jan., Mrs. Bennett; who I work for, came to my house with the prisoner Taylor, who took seven new white silk pocket handkerchiefs from his pocket, two were hemmed, and five were not—Mrs. Bennett said to me, "Carter, will you go and pledge for me these handkerchiefs?" and told me her Harry, meaning Taylor, had made her a present of them—I have heard her call him by that name before, he has been up and down to my room with her—she said she felt annoyed that he had taken them to his mother's to be hemmed, could not the work herself, and Taylor said his youngest sister had hemmed the two, because I remarked their being hemmed—I pledged three of them at Mr. Avant's, in Fleet-street, two at Mr. Tunstall't, sod two at Mr. Fleming's, in Farringdon-street—Mrs. Bennett said I was not to pledge them all at one place, because she wanted to get them back again—I gave Taylor the tickets and the money, which was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in my own room—on Sunday 16th, Taylor brought some clothes to my room, and said he was leaving his lodgings—on 17th Jan., at a quarter before 8 o'clock, he came running up my stairs quickly, and said, "Oh Carter, it is getting too warm for me, I think tome one it after me"—he had some breakfast, and the policemen came into my room and took him away.</p>

Well, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more than that, if you will tell the truth"—I said I had nothing to tell, for I did not know—I know nothing of the other property that has been stolen; these are the only articles I have pledged—nothing was said by Mr. Wilkinson when he offered me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, about my giving evidence in this Court or before the Magistrate.</p>

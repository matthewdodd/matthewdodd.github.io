I went up towards the court, and they walked on, still looking back, and when I came to the court, I pushed Hunter's kitchen door, and found it open - I shut it, and followed them towards Fetter-lane, and by Crane-court, I met Davis - they had just turned down Fetter-lane. I sent him down the lane, and I went up Fleur-de-lis-court to meet them, and caught Craft as he was running - Davis laid hold of Williams.

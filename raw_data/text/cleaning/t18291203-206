               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. What distance was Philips from Lee? A. He was talking to him for some time; he was walking sometimes, and then he stood and talked to him.</p>
               <p>JAMES FOGG. I am a Thames Police-constable. I had had some conversation with Mr. Stewart, and went to the shop; I saw Lee and another boy walking backwards and forwards, and Phillips working in the shop, and now and then he came to the door and spoke to Lee - I told my brother to go one way, and I would go the other; in a few minutes I saw Lee come along with this kettle - I caught him; I did not see who he got it from - he said a boy had given it, him. and had ran away; I took him to the Ship, and asked if Phillips was the boy - he said No;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030074"></xptr>he afterwards told his sister at the office, that Phillips gave it him, while he put his coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say Phillips gave it him to take to a person? A. No; there is no window to the shop - it is a half sash, and the door was closed; he could see what Phillips was doing when he stopped - he spoke to him two or three times.</p>

            . This is my kettle; Phillips was in my employ - I had seen it in the morning when I went out; when I came back, the place, where it had stood was vacant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen that kettle in the morning? A. I saw the shelf full; I do not know that I I had seen this - if one had been sold, I should have been told of it; I have, I suppose, a hundred kettles - they are all marked.</p>
               <p>Phillips' Defence. I was not at work; I never work after six o'clock at night; it was a quarter-past six - I went up for my jacket; I put it on, and called my mate Dick - while I was calling him the gentleman came in, and said, "Who gave this boy a kettle;" I said, "What kettle?" he said, "You gave the boy a kettle;" I said No, and he put on the handcuffs, and took me to the watch-house - if I had robbed my master, it was easy to escape.</p>

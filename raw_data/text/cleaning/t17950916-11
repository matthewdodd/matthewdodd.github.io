On the 6th of September I slept out of my house on purpose to detect the thieves that were robbing me, it was Saturday night; I got up in the morning at five o'clock, and watched my house at Temple Bar, to see who came out and who went in; I see the prisoner at the bar put his head out of the front garret window, and he was waving a stick out of the window; there were some chaps lurking about, but I could not tell whether it was for him or no, they were two or three people, but they went away; about a quarter of an hour after he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock might that be? -About a quarter before seven; he brings this stick in his hand. (Produced) and ran across the way as hard as he could run, up Ship-yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160039"></xptr>Q. Do you think he see you? - No, I ran as hard as I could up shire-lane, the house that he went in at has two doors, he went into one door and I went into the other, it is a hair dresser's, Davenports, in Shire-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an open thoroughfare, where people pass? - No, they goin to be dressed at the hair dresser's; I was in the same house as soon as he was; I takes these two sticks from him (produced) and I said to the man of the house, I suppose as he is bringing these sticks here, you have got some more of my property here; Mr. Davenport says directly, I have got some things here that he has left; he produces some of these things, which being my property I took them, and sent for a constable, and gave the prisoner in charge of a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the things that Mr. Davenport produced? - Five sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they your sticks? - Yes; Mr. Davenport kept them in his possession, I kept only these that I took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them to be your property? - I see him bring them out of my house; I see them before in my house, one stick I had in my hand about a day or two before, which was planted to be taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. You will venture to swear to one of these sticks? - Yes, there is an umbrella which he sold for five shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Which of the sticks is it you swear to? - The long one.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two or three shops in the neighbourhood that deal in these sort of things? - Yes, but that stick is one of ten thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that it is frequently done in your trade that an apprentice carries a stick out in his hand of a Sunday? - Not without it is his own; he may have a stick for asking for.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you was this boy's master, and ought to be the guardian of his morals, did you ever tell his friends? - Yes, numbers of times; I told his friends frequently how he had been robbing me, and they never brought him to ask my pardon nor any thing. I have catched him breaking open my drawers with pick lock keys.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a hair dresser? - Yes. This lad recommended to me by a person of the name of Beech, about eight months ago, about nine weeks ago he began first to leave a stick; he used to come in and say, Mr. Davenport, I will leave this stick (as customers often will leave their sticks) he used to come of a Sunday morning to be dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he leave the sticks? -Sometimes in the shop and sometimes in the window, and then he would call again in the course of that day; sometimes he would leave them a day.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the prosecutor came to your house, had you any thing left there? - There were five, one left the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all five left in your shop? - Yes, at different times, and he had not taken them away. Here is an umbrella, which it may be about a month ago, I asked him if he would get me a second hand umbrella, if he could get me one cheep I would buy it of him, as he was a customer. About a week after he brought an umbrella, and said, here is an umbrella that cost me, at prime cost, six shillings; and I made him a small tail and gave him five shillings for it. Here is a whip which was left on Saturday morning with one of the sticks, and taken away again on Saturday evening; and on Tuesday, after he was committed, it was put down the area of my house, and I found it there, and took it down to Mr. Moore directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160040"></xptr>Q. Had you no suspicion? You knew he lived at the stick shop? - I knew he was in the stick line. He left some cards for me to give to my customers, if any body wanted any thing in his line. He brought a stick at a time and left it, which, as a customer, I could not refuse.</p>
               <p>Q. To Moore. Is that a lawn umbrella? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a ground ratan, a stick with a sword covered with horse hair,&amp;c.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know all these to be your's? - The umbrella I will swear to it from ten thousand, because of the make of it; if it was put among ten thousand I would pick it out.</p>
               <p>Q. You sell a great many umbrellas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that this was not sold? - Yes, I will venture to swear this was stole, because we missed it from the shop, and nobody was in the shop but my wife and I, August the 16th. I here is this piece of white leather to it, which none but the man that made this puts in. This is the very one that I missed, because there was none that was so marked in the shop but this one, there were ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever made any other like it? - Yes, I have. This is the whip I had made a very little time before this was stole, there were a dozen of them, and I missed one; I know it is my whip by the mounting of it, we get them up ourselves. This old crutch stick I have seen number of times in my warehouse; I don't know what induced him to take that old thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Have you any custom in your shop to allow your apprentice and foreman to fell after working hours? - I certainly gave the prisoner privilege to sell my goods, but not to pocket my money; I allowed him that privilege one week but he made a bad use of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him five per Cent. for for selling? - I did for one week only; it may be six or eight months ago; I put an end to it that very week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his characters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the service of John Tosswill and hit brother, who are in partnership as tanners and hair-merchants, in the Neckinger-road, in the Borough, in the parish of Bermondsey. On Thursday, the 20th of January, the prisoner Dudgeon came to our premises—I was then at work by the side of the horse-hair factory—he asked who the curlers of the horse-hair were—I did not satisfy him—he said he was in the line, and had come to seek employment—he walked round the place, and had an opportunity of seeing the premises—I did not give him employment—I secured the premises about nine o'clock on Friday night—the prosecutors' house does not join the shed—there are tan-pits, a warehouse, the room where the horse-hair is kept, and other outbuildings—the front of the house faces Neckinger-road—it is surrounded by a brick wall, with iron palisades—Horney-lane runs up from Neckinger-road, and the wall goes round that lane, and surrounds the warehouse with the iron fence, and from the iron fence it is all wall—there is a doorway, which is kept locked—it is one continued fence, inclosing the house and the shed within it—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct description of it—at five in the evening I secured the warehouse where the horse-hair was, and took the key home with me as usual—I came to the premises at eight next morning, and found the house-hair-warehouse door broken open—the lock had been wrenched—I went in and found three bags of horse-hair gone—it had beep in bacon wrapper bags, which contained about 3 1/2 cwt. of foreign horse-hair, worth 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—it was un manufactured, and is never sold in that state—it</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-sorter in the prosecutors' employ—I sorted a quantity of hard foreign hair a short time before Christmas, at my masters'—there was hair and dirt, and buffalo tails among it—it was these bagged up in five bags, called bacon wrappers, and put in a corner of the workshop, of which the foreman keeps the keys—it was in an un manu<lb></lb>factured state, not saleable for the purposes of trade—it was in a raw state (I saw the bag some time after Christmas) master would not sell it in the state it was in—it had two or three processes to go through—I have seen some hair in the possession of Hornsby, and really believe it is the hair taken from masters'—it is the same in every description—it is foreign un<lb></lb>manufactured hair, and has buffalo tails in it—there is about 3 1/2 cwt. of it, some black and some grey, and sorted, which was the case with what we lost—I think it is my masters' hair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the N division of police. On Thursday the 27th of January, I went to the premises of Turfrey, and made inquiry of him about the horse hair—he gave me information and I went to Gallivan's premises, and there found the hair in question, which I have in my possession—I produce part of it, there was 3cwt. 2qrs. 5lbs. of it, bags and all—after I got it the prisoner Platt was brought to the station—I told him the charge—he said he had bought a little horse hair—I asked him what he called a little—he said there might be 2cwt. or 3cwt—Le did not know who he bought it of—he had given a fair price for it, and sent for a paper.</p>

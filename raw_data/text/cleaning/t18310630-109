               <p>JAMES WILMOTT. I live in Ropemaker-street, Moorfields, and have been a <rs id="t18310630-109-viclabel587" type="occupation">gentleman's coachman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18310630-109-victim839 t18310630-109-viclabel587"></join>, but am out of employ - I lived fifteen months with Mr. Brown, in France. On the 20th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night I was coming from a friend's on Addlehill - I was sober; I went into Fleet-street, for a walk - I had left my friends about ten o'clock; I met the prisoner in Fleet-street - she came up and asked if I had any objection to go with her; I went with her to <placeName id="t18310630-109-crimeloc588">No. 5, Crown-court, Fleet-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310630-109-crimeloc588" type="placeName" value="No. 5, Crown-court, Fleet-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Were they not on the same bed with you? A. Yes; I was sitting on the bed-side - neither of them took off her gown; I did not promise them the half-sovereign for any thing - I had given the other 1s., and took out my purse to give it her; I am not married.</p>
               <p>MARK ADAMS. I am a watchman. On the 20th of June I was on duty in Crown-court; this is a common brothel - I was called in by the landlord, about twelve o'clock, who said a gentleman up stairs accused a woman of robbing him - I went up; the prosecutor appeared to be sober, he said he had been robbed of half a sovereign, and accused the prisoner of it; there was another female in the room - he had half a crown in his hand out of the purse, and said the half-sovereign was taken out of the purse and gone, that he had found the half-crown and purse on the bed; the women undressed, in my presence, to satisfy me - the other had 1s., which he said he had given her; I said he had better give her into custody, and leave it to the decision of the night officer, which they all agreed to - I took them there and left them there.</p>
               <p>JAMES CHICKELDAY. I was the night-officer. The prisoner and another were brought to the watch-house -Wilmott charged the prisoner with robbing him of a halfsovereign; I took her back and searched her, but could not find it - he made no charge against the other; she said to the other girl, "Oh, what a bother this is about this half-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300071"></xptr>sovereign, you may as well tell," or something to that purpose - the girl said, "I know nothing whatever about it, you know I don't:" I had not done searching her before she (the prisoner,) said again, "Oh, if you go to the house you will find the half-sovereign under the mattress;" I went immediately, and on turning up the bed, on the mattress, I found the half-sovereign, which I have had ever since - the prisoner did not claim it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This conversation was in the presence of Mary Madden? A. Yes; she said, "If you know where it is, give it up to him;" and afterwards the prisoner told where it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is impossible that man could see my hand more than the other, we were so near together.</p>

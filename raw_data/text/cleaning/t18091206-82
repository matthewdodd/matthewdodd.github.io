               <p>Q.You are the same person as gave evidence here in September sessions last of being ill treated by Sullivan and Fitzgerald - A. The same.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the then prosecutrix - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether on the 16th of September last you were at the Green Man public house, at Poplar, at all - A. Never. I have been there, but not on that day, nor on the night of the 16th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the 16th of September the day on which you were ill-treated by Sullivan and Fitzgerald - A. I believe it was the Saturday evening, but I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all see Sullivan and Fitzgerald at that public house on the Saturday - A. To my knowledge I never saw him in my life; I never saw him at that public house that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar at that public house in your life - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. About eleven o'clock on that night were you drunk or sober - A. I was as sober as I am now, and I had not so much as I have had to day; in the morning I drank part of a glass of gin, and part of a pot of beer; I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. During the course of the day, till at night you met with Sullivan and Fitzgerald had you been in company with Sullivan and Fitzgerald, or in a public house with them - A. No, not in company with them at all; I did not know them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Now previous to the ill-treatment that you have sworn to did you ever put your arm round the neck of Sullivan - A. No; I never saw him either at the Green Man public house at Poplar; or any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time receive any offer of money of three shillings and six-pence of him in any way whatever - A. No, not of Sullivan, nor any body else; I never had seen him before the ill-treatment, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he ask to sleep with you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advise Sullivan to have another pot of beer - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. When did you see the prisoner after the ill-treatment you received - A. In my own house, on the Sunday morning next, after I received the ill-treatment on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you, and what - A. He said he was very sorry to see I had been so ill-treated; he begged me to make it up, for a trifling sum of money would do me more good than going through the law; I told him I could do nothing in it. I would go to the magistrate; then he followed me up to Shadwell to Mrs. Jackson's, the public house, where we retired; he offered me six guineas, or some money; there were six guineas in it, and he would make another pound when I got home, or another guinea, I do not knew which, for me not to appear against Sullivan and Fitzgerald. They told me I was to go away and not to appear against Sullivan and Fitzgerald.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body present at the time this conversation took place - A. Yes, Mr. Vallas; he was present when Haggerty offered me this money.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner, where you present at any time when the prisoner had any conversation with her - A. Yes; I was in a public house at Shadwell, kept by one Jackson, I was sitting in one of then back rooms; Mrs. Walter and Haggerty came into the same room; Mrs Walter sat down by the side of me; Haggerty held some money in his hand, he said he would give her provided she would make it up with Sullivan and Fitzgerald. It was on Monday the 18th of September.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe what the money was - A. I saw some notes, and some gold on the notes; the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, said it was to the amount of six guineas; and he would give her that and another after he got home, if she would make it up with Sullivan and Fitzgerald. The woman asked me what she had better do in it.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the woman going then - A.She was in waiting to go to the public office, Shadwell; Sullivan and Fitzgerald had not had their hearing then.</p>

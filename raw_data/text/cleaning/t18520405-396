                  </hi>. I live in Acacia-road, St. John's-wood, and am a cow<lb></lb>keeper. On Monday night, 23rd Feb., about 20 minutes past 7 o'clock, I was in the Edgeware-road, about half a mile beyond the fourth mile stone—I passed a man with a white coat and a cap on—I believe the prisoner is the man, but I cannot swear to him; his face was towards the hedge—he walked after me about seventy or eighty yards—I think he was not more than a yard from me—I thought he was going to speak, and looked round—he put his right hand down before him, looked rather towards the hedge, walked on much faster, and passed me—I came on towards London—when I got within about forty or fifty yards of the third mile stone, I heard some one walking behind me quite close to me, and when he came close to me he fired—I think, by the sound of the feet, the person must have been within a yard of me at the time—the flash came round my face, and I was struck just behind the ear with the shots—I think there were at least twenty shots fired into my head—there were three or four taken out of my ear—I bled a good deal—I was stunned, and staggered into the road—I then ran about thirty yards towards London, and I saw some person coming towards me, and I looked up the road and saw a man in a white coat about seventy or eighty yards from me—I did not see any other person between him and me—I told the person I met that I was shot, and said there was the man up the road—I do not recollect that he made me any answer, but he kept on; I thought he might be going after the man, but I did not see anything more of him—I went as fast as I could to Kilburn, to Mr. Deacon's, a friend's house there, and he went with me to a doctor—as I was going I met a policeman—I told him the particu<lb></lb>lars, and I believe he went to see for the man—I was examined by the surgeon</p>

I took the prisoner into custody at Newport Pagnell, in consequence of a description I had received from inspector Chambers, I went on horseback, and at two or three places on the road I heard of such a man, but did not see him till I got to Newport Pagnell, which is fifty-one miles from London—I was stopping in the street to make inquiry and saw the prisoner coming down the town—I turned into a public-house yard, and stood in the gateway till he came up—I then stopped him, and said, "Where do you come from?"—he said, "From Melton Mowbray"—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "Charles Williams"—I said, "I am an officer, and you must consider yourself in my custody"—I took him into the public-house, and told him I apprehended him for shooting a gentleman at Kilburn—he said several times, "Oh, you must make a mistake"—I said, "Whether it is a mistake or not, I shall take you back to London"—I said to him, "You lived in this neighbourhood once, did not you?"—he said, "Yes, I did; I lived at the Rev. Mr. Townsend's"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him this pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was loaded with powder and shot; and I found on him a paper containing shot, and a paper containing powder and percussion caps, a penny, a comb, a glove, and an old handkerchief—I brought him to London by the railway—I went to Mr. Veale's house, and saw the surgeon extract this shot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his ear—I should say it is the same kind of shot that the prisoner had on him—I think it is a No. 5 shot—I was at Bushey on the previous Friday to this, and I fancy I saw the prisoner then; I will not be positive.</p>

On Monday, 23rd Feb., about half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, brought a pistol, and asked me to unscrew the barrel of it—I did so, and gave it him again—he commenced cleaning it, and in cleaning the nipple, he broke a worsted needle in it—he said, "I have b—it now"—I told him I could unscrew the nipple, and I did so, and cleaned it—he stayed at my place till between 5 and 6—I asked him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for cleaning it—he said, "Not now, I have been out of place, I will give it you when I come this way again"—he gave the name of Herrington—I asked him how he came to buy the pistol, as he had been out of place—he said he had had it by him a long time—I fired the pistol off with powder only—this is the same pistol—I heard, the same evening, of Mr. Veale having been shot, and I described the prisoner to a policeman.</p>

On Thursday, 26th Feb., I was on duty at Portland-town station-house, and saw the prisoner brought there in custody—I sent the sergeant that brought him, to see for Mr. Veale, and while he was gone the prisoner spoke to me—I was writing at a desk—I did not ask him any question, he spoke himself—he said, "Is the gentleman dead that I shot?"—that was the first observation he made—I said, "He is not"—he then said, "If I had stopped in the country I should have done as I ought to have done, but my brothers and sisters were in London, in good service; it is horse racing that has ruined me"—I asked him if he had not lived with Mr. Townsend, of Newport Pagnell—he said he had, and he after<lb></lb>wards</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Manchester-terrace, Kil<lb></lb>burn. On Monday evening, 23rd Feb., Mr. Veale was brought to my surgery at a few minutes before 8 o'clock—he was bleeding considerably from several wounds in the neck, which were evidently the result of shot—I extracted one shot; I did not extract any more, because he said he was a patient of Mr. Roberts, of the Finchley-road, and I advised him to get home and see him: they were deeply seated, and I did not think it right to interfere at that time—I have compared the shot I extracted with the others, and I believe them to be the same—I found a small portion of paper in Mr. Veale's coat collar, which is charred, and is evidently a portion of the loading of some fire arms—the wounds were such as would be produced by shot fired from a pistol—the wounds themselves were not serious—he was in a good state of health, as far as I could judge; it was the first time I had ever seen him—I extracted one shot from the back of the neck, and the others were in the immediate vicinity—I did not probe them at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you tell at all, at that time, whether any of the other shots could produce danger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is almost impossible to say; erysipelas might have followed—a shot is not fatal in the same way as a bullet is, neces<lb></lb>sarily—supposing any of these shots had reached the brain it must have been attended with fatal consequences—they were quite on the lower part of the head, not on the forehead at all—there were several open bleeding wound.</p>

               <p>some one coming up the path—I then took over the hedge and made off, for fear of being detected; a person passed; I then made off for the gentleman again, but he was got out of sight; I then returned to Bushey, and re<lb></lb>mained there all night; next morning I started and went through Watford, and made no stoppage till I came to Newport, and then I was taken—I have not anything more to say."</p>

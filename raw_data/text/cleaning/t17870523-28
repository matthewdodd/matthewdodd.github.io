               <p>The prisoner said, he had been to see a person in the King's Bench, and he found it on Black-friars-bridge; he kicked it before him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went home with an acquaintance of mine on the Sunday evening that this money was lost; I saw something on Blackfriars-bridge, and I kicked it and picked it up; and when I came into the Temple, I looked at it, and it was fifteen guineas and a half and a shilling; I kept it till it was advertised, for I thought a guinea or something that might be paid for advertizing, would be of more service to me than keeping all the money, and I looked into the papers at night; I spent a guinea and a half, and paid a debt and some trifles.</p>
               <p>Mr. WADMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is a <rs id="t17870523-28-deflabel147" type="occupation">journeyman carpenter</rs>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What way of business are you in? - I am a journeyman taylor.</p>
               <p>I believe you took some pains to keep out of the way? - I never did, I will tell you the truth, Mr. and Mrs. Wren asked me; says they, the gentleman would be glad if I would appear along with them at the trial; says I, I never was at a Court; I should be glad not to appear in any thing that I know nothing at all about; then the man he made some very rash words, and he said, if it cost him five guineas, he would have me; then I said, if I am compelled to come, I must come.</p>
               <p>I ask you whether you did not take pains to prevent being served with a subpoena, and keep your wife out of the way too? - Upon my oath, as that man said, he would have me if it cost five guineas; I did keep away in the course of the day; I did not come home to my dinner.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you keep your self and your wife out of the way, in order that you might not be subpoened? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear of any legacy the prisoner had left him? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to prisoner. You say that you was on Black-friars-bridge on the Sunday evening, and found this money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you mentioned to any body between that and the Tuesday when you was taken, any thing of this good fortune? - No, because it might be taken away again; on the Tuesday and not before, I converted one of those guineas into silver.</p>

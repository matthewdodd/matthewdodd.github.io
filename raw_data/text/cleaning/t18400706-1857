On the morning of the 19th of June I was alarmed, about I quarter before three o'clock—on getting up I saw the prisoner Warren in the centre of my outer-room—(my house consists of two rooms)—before I could get to open the parlour door he sprung upon a table, and got through an air-hole—I had been there about half-past eleven o'clock—the air-hole was then secure, and fastened by a catch, and I then found it open—there was nothing displaced in the room but a clothes bag, which the night before I had left suspended from a cupboard-door, was placed in the centre of the room—when Warren sprung out I gave an alarm—I am sure Warren is the man I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bennett's-yard, next door but one to the prosecutor; the house between us is unoccupied; I am a lamp-lighter. On the morning of the 19th of June I was returning home—I heard a noise, and stopped—the prisoner Warren stepped out of the unoccupied building—I was about to lay hold of him when he drew back, shut the door, and fastened it—I took my own key out, and went into my own place—I went to the back and saw Warren escaping into Tufton-street—he had his trowsers and shirt on—I then went to Tufton-street, and saw the two prisoners together—they saw me, and ran—I called "Police," and they separated—Collins turned a turning—I followed Williams till I lost sight of him, but a policeman ran on till another officer took him—neither of the prisoners had shoes or stockings on—after I lost sight of Williams I came back to see what became of Collins, and they were bring<lb></lb>ing him back from a place where he had scaled over a wall.</p>

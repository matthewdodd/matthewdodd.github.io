               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I must trust to your kind indulgence a few minutes. I lived with my late employers five years, during which period I served them with the utmost integrity. I was informed, a fortnight before I left them, by the senior partner, that they had no further occasion for me: the reason was,

             intended to collect my department himself; Mr. Hale handsomely saying, it was on that account he parted with me. I did all I could to induce every one of my friends to continue their favours to my late employers, which they promised me the would, on my account. The day after I quitted their service, (as appears by that letter), I informed them that I was going to Northumberland, there to try my friends to assist me to balance my accounts. I now solemnly declare I never intended to rob or defraud my employers. I assure you, my not being able to balance my accompts was owing to my expences being considerably more than I had, or could charge them. Mr. Wiggens can testify for my conduct: when I was at Northumberland he promised me that Mr. Hale, and the rest of the gentlemen, would accede to my balancing my accounts. When I arrived there I was left in the accompting-house, in an unlocked room, and at that time Mr. Wiggens went, and returned with an officer. I hope you will excuse me, and I will trust to your just decision.</p>

             BOYES. On the evening of the 23th of December about a quarter past six I saw some person creeping under the wall of <placeName id="t18110109-11-crimeloc67">St. Botolph's wharf</placeName>

               <p>Q. There were some hair upon Fresh wharf - A. Yes, there were, and no where else on the Quays besides; it was about fifty yards from Fresh wharf where I stopped the prisoner, he was coming from Fresh wharf Mr. Mallough came and recognized the prisoner having been at Fresh wharf a night or two before. Mr. Mallough fetched an officer, I delivered the prisoner and the hair to the officer. I went and examined a bale on Fresh wharf, it was cut and a quantity of hair taken out.</p>

            . I am a constable, I took the prisoner in custody from the last witness, and this hair.</p>
               <p>MR. MALLOUGH. I believe it is my hair, it was laying on the wharf to be loaded; I had such hair as that and there were no other any where about; the prisoner said he found it; I am sure he is the same man I had seen him there before</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence: I went to the Quay to see a shipmate of mine and turning back I got that on the Quay, I took it up in my arms and coming along a man asked me what I had got, I told him I believed it was hair, I threw it down.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. William Wain wright, in Flaudyer-street, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. I remember the prisoner Atkinson coming to my master's house with a letter a short time before this happened—I recognised him, as having lived with me in a former situation—I had some conversation with him, and desired him to call again—he called a week or two after, and I asked him down into the pantry, which is on the basement story—he had a dirty shirt on, and a dirty cravat—I asked him about his clothes—he represented himself as rather in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183605090155"></xptr>
               <p>distress, owing to his wife's death—I gave him a shirt, a cravat, and stock<lb></lb>ings, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had no lodging, and I allowed him to asleep in my room that night—my bed is up stairs—he went away early in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I was to inquire for a place for him—he came again next night, about half past nine o'clock, and proposed to sleep there again—he had seen the plate the night before, in a drawer in a pantry—when he came the second night, I said I was afraid, if I should take him up-stairs, and master or any of the ladies came out of the drawing room, he would be seen—he said, if I had a bed down in the pantry, like old Keet, where we used to live, it would be very well—I said I would make him a temporary bed in the pan<lb></lb>try; which I did, and locked him in the pantry—I hung a pair of breeches on a chair, to keep a draught away from him—I took the principal part of the plate up stairs to bed with me—I got up about half past six o'clock, and found the pantry door broken open, and the cupboard door also, and he was gone—the chain of the hall door was down—I missed all the articles named in the indictment—they were all in the house the night before—I was the first person up in the morning—the prisoner never returned to me—I had information exactly a week afterwards, and went for an officer—we went to the place, and took him into custody—I told him he had acted in a most shameful manner towards me—he pleaded drunkenness until he got to the station-house—he affected to be drunk, and not to understand me at all—in consequence of information, I afterwards went to the Horse-Shoe, Titchborn-street, and there found Williams—I never saw him before—I asked him if he knew Atkinson—he said, "yes"—I said, "Will you come out?"—he said, "Are you the servant?"—I said, "No"—I had a reason for denying that—he asked me to come into the tap room, which I did and sat down with him—I began to question him how he thought Atkin<lb></lb>son would get on—he said, oh, he thought he would get on very well, if he had a counsel—he said, if his friends would come forwards together, he would draw up the brief himself, as he was good scholar, and that would be no expense; and he tole me that the property was deposited with Lord King's coachman, in a box in a stable, in St. James's-square—that At<lb></lb>kinson had told him so three or four times; and after talking, he wanted me to go there—he called Atkinson a b—y fool, because he had directed him to go to an old clothes shop, and buy a pair of old trowsers, and get the breeches off, as they were the only things they could convict him on; but instead off that, he went and got drunk with a woman named Kennedy, and spent all his money, and went and slept with her—I asked Williams if he thought I should get into trouble about it—he said, "No, you will not; if any body gets into a trouble about it, it shall myself, as I disposed of part of the property for him"—I asked him what he disposed of—he said, a toast rack, umbrella, pair of gaiters, shoes, decanters, and several other little things, and also a pair of boots, that (Atkinson's) had in his pocket, and one of the boots was stolen out of his (Atkinson) pocket while he went to sleep at a public-house in Air-street—I agreed to meet Williams next day at a public-house in Titchbourn-street, but he did not come—I went to his lodging in Cas<lb></lb>tle-street, and went with him to a coffee-shop—he said if I would come in there while he had his breakfast, he would tell me all about it—I went in, but he told me nothing particular more than before—talking about counsel, and how the money was to be raised, which was by subscriptions among their friends—he said about £2 would do it—we went from there to the public-house in Titchbourn-street, and I asked him there where the things</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went with a warrants to No. 9, William-street, Lambeth, and found Wilson and Morgan living there—I made inquiry about them—they are unfortunate women—I searched the room where they were, and found three glass cruets in the front parlour, and three plated deserts knives in the back kitchen—a man named Goddard was in the house, but neither of the male prisoners—I asked the females how they became possessed of the things, they said they were given to them by Atkinson, who was in custody—Atkinson had given me that as his lodging, when he was taken into custody—before I found the property, I asked Wilson and Morgan if they had seen any pro<lb></lb>perty, and they said, "No"—I first asked, if they knew Atkinson, they said Yes, he had lodged there two or three nights only—I asked if they saw any property of any description about him, they said, no, and that all he spent in the house was three half crowns—both denied having seen any property—I searched and found the things I have said, and then they said Atkinson gave them to them—I apprehended Williams at the Horse shoe in Titchbourn-street, and told him I took him on suspicion of being concerned in some property stolen from Mr. Wainwright, he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to Adamson's in the Haymarket, who pro<lb></lb>duced an umbrella, and said he bought it of him—he said, "if you had mentioned Atkinson's name to me, instead of Wainwright's, I could have told you about that"—he said Atkinson came to him and told him he had about £200 or £3400 worth of property, and he thought he could tell him where the might dispose of it.</p>

These shoes are my own, and were in the pantry that night, and were gone next morning—the decanters I know by a rivet having been broken—the cruets I know by their general ap<lb></lb>pearance—the toast-rack I can swear to, and these are the breeches I hung on the chair.</p>

Q.</hi> How long had you been in Mr. Wainwright's ser<lb></lb>vice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nine months—I can swear to the knives, decanters, and every thing—about £60 of property was lost altogether—I am quite sure I did not give the breeches to him.</p>

               <p>Williams Defence. The things were given to me by Atkinson—I have known him nearly two years—I had been at his house, and seen such things, and believed he had such things—I was not aware that they were stolen—as to the policeman saying I knew where to sell them—I never</p>

               <p>said so—I had not been in London long—I have been abroad, and had not seen Atkinson for six months, when I saw him at Astley's Theatre, and he asked me to go and drink with him, which I did—the following day he asked me to go and take these things our of pawn, which I did—I told the prosecutors where the umbrella and toast-rack were—had I know they were stolen, I should not have done so—the two duplicates, it is said, I borrowed six pence on—It was only sixpence—I kept them with an under<lb></lb>standing I was to return them when I saw him again—a letter came to inform me he was in custody—I was asked by the policeman, going down the Haymarket, why should I think Atkinson was possessed of a toast<lb></lb>rack—I said, why I had seen such things at his house—he is a house<lb></lb>keeper and I even stated where he lived before I went abroad—this person came forward at the pawnbroker's and asked if I had taken a toast-rack out—he said, "yes, "and immediately returned to sell it—I stated that Atkinson was a housekeeper at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Morgan's Defence</hi>. I have been an unfortunate girl on the town—I never saw Atkinson till some time after Easter, when I met him a little before nine o'clock at night—he certainly gave my landlady the articles, saying his wife was dead, and he had given up housekeeping, and if the knives and cruets were of any service to her, she was welcome to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house as the two female prisoners—Wilson is the landlady—I was at Astley's Theatre with them some time before they were taken up on this charge—after coming out of the theatre we went to Proctor's Hotel, and the two male prisoners came in—we were drinking at the bar—they spoke to the two women—I was requested to wait for a moment—I followed them our, and, between the door and the bottom of the bridge, I saw Atkinson give something to them, which was three cruets and the knives—he said he had been a married man in the country, had had these things left to him, and, if she would accept them, she was welcome to them—Wilson received them—I am convicted she did not know they were stolen.</p>

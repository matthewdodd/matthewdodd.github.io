The gateway of the Castle and Faulcon in Aldersgate-street would not admit of the waggon's coming in; it was so high loaded, we were forced to take some of the things off in the street.

I never saw him in my life before, and he called for a pint of beer, desiring me not to let the basket go away till he came. He went away, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, and took it away. I saw him pull the direction off in my house, but did not observe who it was directed to. There was a cloth over the top of it. I laid my hand upon it, and felt something that I thought was leather.</p>

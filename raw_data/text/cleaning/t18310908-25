Bank note, and a guard-chain from round my neck; my watch was not attached to it - it was made of silk, and had gold beads fixed to it; they took a snuff box, eight sovereigns, and sixteen or seventeen shillings, from my right-hand trousers pocket - I had accidentally torn one corner of the 10l. note off, but cannot say at which end; I folded the torn part in the rest, and had the whole note - my hat was also taken off; this did not last more than three or four minutes, I should think - I had drank a little rum-and-water after supper, but was perfectly sober; I called Murder! and Police! a person immediately put his hand before my mouth, and I could not halloo - they tore my coat with pulling my hands from holding my pocket; they dispersed when they had got my money - it happened near the Bishopsgate-street end of Rose-lane; I am certain Field is the man who held my left arm - I do not know Meeking; I have seen none of the property except the chain - no blows were struck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you always sworn that Field held your arm? A. I swore he was one of the party that held me; I do not know that I mentioned my arm - I swore to him at the first examination; I gave the name of

               <p>Q. Did you not sit yourself down on the step of a door instead of going home? A. I did not, except at the time they robbed me; it happened about half-past one o'clock - I had dined at my lodging, in Wormwood-street, at five, and had a glass of warm rum-and-water, and perhaps a glass of porter; I left home at half-past nine - I am not well acquainted with town; I went to call on a Mr. Ross, who was ill - he lives near Finsbury-square;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080029"></xptr>I did not know his house - I was directed to a baker, who showed it to me; I cannot remember whether I drank any thing there - I swear I did not drink a bottle of wine there; I do not think I took any thing - I left about half-past eleven o'clock, and was going to a Mr. McDonald, in the Commercial-road, but could not find his house; I then returned directly home - I went to a tavern in Fenchurch-street before I went to Mr. Ross, and may have had two glasses of rum-and-water there: I could swear it was not three - I only paid 1s. there: I was at no other public-house - I drank nothing at Mr. Ross to the best of my recollection, and am sure I had no wine; I did not state at the office that I was intoxicated - I denied that I was; I swear I was not on the step of a door, except when these people were holding me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure it was to two men he gave the halfpence? A.

            . I received this chain from Moller.</p>

               <p>DUNCAN GOLLAN. This is the guard I had on my neck- I was not on the steps till they forced me down against the wall - I was leaning backwards, not standing straight- the chain was taken from me after the pocket-book- I was kept at that time with my head back against the door; my hat was taken off before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear that just previous to the chain being taken, you had not your elbows on your knees, and your hands on your face? A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Meeking's Defence. I got up on Sunday morning between four and five o'clock, and picked up this chain at the corner of Catherine Wheel-alley, all over dirt - I did not think it of any value, and in the afternoon I asked the witness if she would have it, and I tore it of my neck.</p>

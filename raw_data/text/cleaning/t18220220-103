I then missed it from my coat pocket; it was safe when I was in the Haymarket.

            . I am a carman. I was in Jermyn-street, and saw the prisoner and another young man, following Mr. Wilson for twenty yards - then one of them took a yellow handkerchief out of Mr. Wilson's pocket. I ran across the road, and pointed the prisoner out to Wilson, and the other went off - they were close together, in company.</p>

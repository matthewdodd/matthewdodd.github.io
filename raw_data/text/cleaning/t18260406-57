            . I am Brice's nephew - he had been ill at my house for a fortnight. I went to his house on Saturday afternoon, the 4th of March, between two and three o'clock; every thing was safe then - I locked it up, and brought him the key. Next morning, about eight, I received information, and in the afternoon I went to the house - I found every thing in confusion, the drawers open, and property gone. I had seen a great coat and copper pot there on Saturday.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Edmonton. I was with Sawyer in Mr. Smith's meads at Edmonton, and found a white petticoat and bolster in the hedge, about nine o'clock; I watched, and about eleven saw the prisoner Wilson go down to where they were; Bailey was about five yards behind him; they came away, and Wilson had something under his arm; they ran hard - I pursued for a mile, calling Stop thief! I secured Bailey, and under his smock-frock found a pillow-case, containing a black silk cloak, and several things; I locked him up, and returned to Sawyer, who was holding Wilson on the ground - he had six china plates and three basins in a bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You found these things - what prevented their finding them? A. When I first saw the prisoners they were about fifty yards from the place, and they went strait up to where the bolster and petticoat lay.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did any body run from the cry of Stop thief! besides them? A. Only a gentleman, who pursued them. They started as hard as they could when they saw me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hallam, of Charterhouse-street. On the 5th of Nov., about a quarter past three o'clock, the prisoner and his brother came to my house—I knew his brother, but not him—I had them down into my kitchen, and gave them some bread and cheese—I went into my back-kitchen, and left them—they staid some time, then went away, taking the rest of the bread and cheese with them—my daughter had set the spoons, glasses, and other things, on a tray, and put them up stairs—the prisoner walked up after her—my daughter then went again, and called out that the spoons were gone—they were fellow spoons to this one which I produce, and no one else was in the house who went up the kitchen-stairs—the spoons hare not been found.</p>

About half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th of November, the prisoner and his brother called on me at the brew-house where I work—I took them over the tap, and gave them some bread and cheese and beer—I then went to them again, and the prisoner had two spoons in his hand—he said he had got two spoons, and if they were silver he could get over while Monday—the spoons were something similar to this</p>

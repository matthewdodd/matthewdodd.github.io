The prisoner came to our house about the beginning of August last—my husband was out—he asked for James Irwin—I told him my husband's name was William—I said his father's name was James, but he had been dead some time—he told me there was a little money in France for us—I told him a little further respecting my husband's family, and sent for my husband—when he came, he gave him the same statement—he said he had come from his employer—he did not name Mr. Fleury's name—I heard him afterwards name Mr. Fleury as a person in Paris—he said it was 3000 francs, for a debt owing to my husband in France—the debt was more than that, but ray husband was to sell him the debt for that—he came again in September, when my husband was out, and said there was a little more to do before the money could be got; that the two affidavits signed before, must be signed again, saying that he was the only heir, and by the law of this country entitled to the property—he came again in March, when my husband was out—I said my husband was going to write to Mr. Fleury—on the 6th of March, the day before the prisoner came, we had received a letter—on my saying my husband was going to write to Mr. Fleury, I also said he intended to give the agreement to a friend who was going to France, to take what steps he thought proper with Mr. Fleury—he said he hoped my husband would not do such a thing as that; it would be a great dishonour to Mr. Fleury's character—he then said Mr. Fleury had written to him, three weeks back, stating he would pay my husband interest from the 1st of October last, and he said he hoped Mr. Irwin would not write till he called again, which would be on the Thursday or Saturday week following—he did not call again at our house at any time—he said nothing about the letter he had written to us before.</p>

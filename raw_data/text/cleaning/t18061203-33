It was near three parts full; he gave the hat to the prisoner Cook; I saw Cook put an handkerchief over it, and put it down by the ticket-writers desk.

            . Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an extra weigher belonging to the customs. - A. I am. White has been employed as a glut weigher, Cook I have seen employed marking the chests before they are put in the scale. On the 17th of November, between the hours of eleven and two, I saw the prisoners Cook and White take up tea repeatedly from off the chest, and off the scale. I saw them go to a place where there is a hole in the wall near to the ground. After that I had some reason to suppose there was something there that should not be. I passed the hole, I looked in, and saw the bag. I immediately turned back to my brother weigher, I told him of it, and that I had every reason to suppose it was tea. In the course of a few minutes I took the property from the hole in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the bag contained. - A. I did not open the bag immediately; I took it, I put it under the the landing writer's box; I put a man over it to watch it, and desired him not to let it go during the time it was there; in about ten minutes I took it away from there; I went to the custom-house with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners White or Cook. - A. Cook was there, and he came to me more than once or twice before I had taken it away from the landing writer's box, he desired me to give him up the bag. He asked me if I would not deliver him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030035"></xptr> up the property? I told him no, by no means, I should not deliver him up the property; there were several more came to me; they appeared to be coopers and labouring men. (Shepherd I believe was present, I do not recollect his coming, he might.) They wanted to take the bag away by force: then just as I was going to take the tea away, White came and asked me if I meaned to take the property away? I told him I did; he told me it was very foolish of me, he thought I might deliver it up, or part of it. I told him no; I made all possible haste I could to Globe-yard with the bag of tea. I there put the bag in my locker, and I delivered the key to

               <p>Q. Did you see White, Cook, or Shepherd, after that. - A. Yes; I immediately returned to my station on the wharf, and then I saw both the prisoners, White and Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Not Shepherd. - A. He might be present, but I did not observe him. White came to me, and asked me what I had done with the property, and whether I had taken it to Globe-yard? I told him I had taken care of it; it was immaterial what I had done with it. He said he had some reason to think that I had concealed the property, and not delivered it up. He told me then, if I did not deliver part of the property up to him, he certainly would see that I had taken it to Globe-yard. He said he did not know who would wait there all day, unless they could have a little tea for themselves. On the day after the prisoner Cook abused me in a most shameful manner; he threatened to murder me for taking the property; he d - d me, and asked me what I had done with the bag. I told him it was immaterial what I had done with the bag, I had taken care of it. I asked him what he wanted with the bag; he then told me that he wanted it for the same purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What purpose. - A. To put in tea, I should suppose. He then told me he should be able to alight of me some time or other, and he would certainly murder me.</p>

               <p>Q. You yourself are an inferior custom-house officer. - A. I am an extra weigher.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not at the time this was going on a superior officer on the spot, to whom you might have applied, and ended the dispute in a moment. - A. There was a gentleman in the box at the time, I knew he was there; he is a superior officer, his name is Darnley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not his duty to attend to these chests of tea. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not other superior officers as well as himself. - A. I do not know that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the box where he was for the purpose of watching the tea to the place where you saw the tea taken away. - About fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Within the found of your voice if you had called to him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have gone to him in the space of half a minute. - A. Yes, but I did not.</p>
               <p>COOK. Q. I was marking the chests of tea; I would wish to ask him whether I put the bag in the hole, or if he saw me put it in. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. He was with White at the same time. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Cook. He says I threatened his life. There were four superior officers, and six cart followers; did any one hear me besides yourself; they all stood as close as we three stand now; if I ever said it they must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Bolton. As he put the chests of tea into the scale he immediately wished to throw the chest from him upon my toes; but he said he should wish to handle me otherways.</p>

               <p>Q. I do not know whether you saw the three prisoners at the bar do any thing. - A. I did not hardly notice them. I was present when White came and made a demand of the property to Bolton. He asked him what he had done with the bag he had taken away. I heard White use very rash words.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by very rash words. - A. He was saying how he would use him if he did not produce the bag, or let him know where it was gone to. Bolton turned himself round, and goes up the gateway where the company's goods goes up, next to the office of the company. As Bolton went up that way, White sent Young up Darkhouse-lane to see what way he turned; when he got into Thames-street, he desired Young to ran as fast as he could, and see where Bolton turned for. With that he dropped the small weights that he had in his hand, and he ran himself the way that Bolton went.</p>

               <p>Court. He did not say that he had made a seizure of it. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>

               <p>Shepherd's Defence. On Monday the 17th of November, there were many chests that came up much broken, we often put up an adze, or any thing in the place that is broken, and after that part is repaired we put the top on again.</p>
               <p>Cook's Defence. I have been in the habit of finding employ upon that wharf, ever since the first erecting of it; and for the last fleet of ships that came home, I have been in the habit of marking the boxes; I believe we had four coopers employed on that day, and the foreman of the coopers was there every half hour, (there were two ships that we were at work at there), he hurried me very fast; I believe there might be about forty seven load of tea, we did twenty three on that day, which is a very great day's work; and four officers stood as near as that I might touch them. The chests run in general pretty good, some of them were broken, we had chests leading from the scaleboard three high; and the hole is over these chests, of the other side, so that if we had taken tea to this hole, we must have jumped over these chests; and there were four general land officers. Mr. Lock the excise landing writer, and Mr. Bentick ticket writer, stood out side of the box, where it is said I laid my hat down with the tea, if I had done it, one or other must have seen it.</p>
               <p>White said nothing in his defence.</p>

            . Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are one of the landing writers of the customs. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 17th of November, were you superintending the East India company's chests of tea. - A. From twelve till three, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the three prisoners at the bar, Shepherd being engaged as cooper, White as weigher, and Cook as a marker. - A. I remember Cook and White, but Shepherd's person I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember of hearing on Tuesday, of some tea being found, on the day before that was charged to the prisoners having stolen it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday you was there from twelve to three, how near were you stationed to the scale that was attended by Cook and White. - A. I suppose about the distance of a yard and a half, not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had been there before you. - A. Mr. Vine, and at twelve o'clock I relieved him.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were you attending from twelve to three. - A. To secure the revenue I had to take the weights from the scale.</p>
               <p>Q. To take the amount of so many chests as were put in the scale at one time, and then you enter it in the book; because upon the weights that you take the duty is charged. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any chests is damaged it is the duty of the cooper to mend the chests before they are carried into the warehouse. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you was there, how was Cook and White employed. - A. Cook was employed in numbering and marking the chests. White was to weigh, and give me the drafts.</p>
               <p>Q. During the three hours that you were so employed in taking the drafts from White, did you see either of them employed in taking tea by handfulls, or by bags full, or carrying it away. - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you was there, could they have done it, without your seeing it. - A. It is imposible for me to say; the chests were piled three high; and he left me several times, he was relieved by his partner. Cook was employed in marking and numbering the chests as they went into the scale.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that done under your eye, so that he could not have gone away, and have stole tea. - A. It was, except between loads, and then he might have been out of my sight.</p>

            . Examined by Mr. Gurney. I believe you are the excise landing writer. - A. Yes; on Monday the 17th of November I was upon the wharf, superintending the landing of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. You have to take the weights for the excise duty, the same as the last witness has to secure the custom-house duty. - A. Yes, I was there from nine in the morning to three in the afternoon, I was stationed on the wharf with Mr. Darnley.</p>

               <p>Q. Cook we understand was a marker, White a weigher, and Shepherd a cooper. - A. Yes, Shepherd stood where he usually stands, at the edge of the wharf; I was about two yards and a half from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any tier of chests, that hid him from you. - A. Now and then, there was a tier of chests that hid him from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the opportunity of seeing White and Cook, from nine to three. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you whether either of them could have been employed in stealing tea from one place,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030037"></xptr> and carrying it to a place to hide it. - A. I should think not, they being before me.</p>
               <p>Court. They could not have stole tea without your observation. - A. There were times when my eyes were not always upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How near was Younghusband to you. - A. Sometimes he was almost up to me, and sometimes at different parts of the wharf.</p>

               <p>Q. He knew you was an excise officer, a land waiter. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had pointed out to you or Mr. Darnley that they were stealing of tea, should you not have taken them. - A. Certainly I should, it was my duty.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have caught them in the very act if he had told you. - A. Certainly I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in the conduct of the prisoners like that of stealing tea. - A. No, I saw them very tractable, and doing their duty.</p>

               <p>White called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

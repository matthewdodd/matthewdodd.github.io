On the 11th of October I was in town, and about eleven o'clock at night was returning home to my lodgings, at the Green Dragon, inn, Bishopsgate-street. I went into a public-house, at the corner of Dean-street, Holborn, and saw the prisoners there; they were impertinent to me; I told them not to interfere with me. I left the house and they followed. I told them to keep their distance. Opposite <placeName id="t18221023-35-crimeloc197">Chancery-lane, in Holborn</placeName>

            . I am a linen draper, and live in High-Holborn. I was coming through Great Turnstile, and saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners on the opposite side of Holborn, and from the conduct of the prisoners, I was induced to follow them. I saw Mr. Jay leave them near Brownlow-street - they followed him very closely - I saw him call a coach. He was then on the pavement; the coach drew up to the pavement - he was off the curb stone. As he got in, the prisoners went one on each side of him. Johnston took something from under his coat - she then said to Brown,</p>
               <p>"Come along." I saw her put whatever it was under her pelisse. I went up and laid hold of her. She put her fingers up to her mouth, and said,</p>
               <p>"Hush." I called the watch - she threw the pocket book from her, and was taken. Brown ran off, but was stopped by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Brown some distance off - A. No, she was at Mr. Jay's side.</p>

               <p>JOHNSTON'S Defence. I met this young woman - we went into the public-house for a glass of porter; the prosecutor sat in a box; there were five or six girls and men; he said he thought there was something superior in my appearance and behaviour, and he would give me whatever I liked to drink. I had brandy and water, and two glasses of gin, which he paid for, and we went away together, and by his desire I left him by Chancery-lane. We were going the same way as him; my attention was called by seeing several people round a coach - I went up and saw the pocket book; I picked it up; the gentleman came, and I said, if it belonged to him, to take it.</p>
               <p>BROWN'S Defence. He asked us to drink with him, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230026"></xptr>by his desire we left him. I left my friend to go home, and was crossing when the gentleman took me.</p>

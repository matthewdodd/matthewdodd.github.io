            . I live at Hammersmith. I took the scarf - the prisoner, who is my brother, just shewed it to me, and I took it off Mr. Baker's counter. A great many people were in the shop - it was about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th of May. My brother was two or three yards from the shop; he pointed it out to me, and asked me to take it. I went in and took it, came out again, found him in the same place, and gave it to him. I do not know where he took it to. Downs lives in King-street - I believe it is not far from the shop. I never had any conversation with her about it. I was taken up on the Saturday after, and told what I knew about it. My parents live at Hammersmith.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are your parents - A. Nothing. I do not know how they live. I am fourteen years old.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the scarf, put it in a basket, and went off with it - A. Yes, and gave it to him.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hammersmith. About four o'clock on Friday afternoon, the 12th of May, I was sent for to Mr. Carter's shop, and took the prisoner, Johnson, into custody, who was charged with stealing a pair of breeches. He said, of his own accord, that if I would go with him to his mother he would tell me where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170050"></xptr>he sold them and other things which he had taken. He said he sold the scarf to Mrs. Downs for 6 s. - she keeps a clothes-shop about two hundred yards from Mr. Baker's shop - I took him there about six o'clock that evening, and enquired about a pair of breeches. I afterwards put him in the cage, returned alone to Downs, and asked her if she had not bought a scarf of that boy? she paused, and then said it was sold, and if I would give her her liberty she would go and see after it. I called again, she was not returned. I called between nine and ten o'clock, and observed she had got it laid on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the boy shew it to you on the counter when you took him there - A. I do not think he did. The Magistrate blamed me for not taking it away. She said the boy told her he brought it from his mother. I did not take her into custody - she came herself to the office.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>DOWNS'S Defence. I believed the prisoner's friends to be in distress, and bought it without knowing it to have been stolen. I gave it up the moment they came for it.</p>

            . I apprehended Johnson between four and five o'clock at an apothecary's shop, and asked him if he had not taken a pair of breeches from Mr. Carter's shop door? he took me to Downs's, I asked if she had not bought a pair of breeches of the prisoner? she said Yes. Johnson's father is a tall man, about six feet high; he is well known about Hammersmith. She produced them immediately, and said he told her he brought them from his mother.</p>

I am purchaser of goods for Cooper and Batchelor, of Bond-street The prisoner came into their employ on the 13th of March, and left in October, the same year—we took stock in October, and found a deficiency of from 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; worth of goods in our general stock—on the 9th of Jan. I saw Daman, and went to a pawnbroker's—there were two rem<lb></lb>nants of silk produced—these are them—they are my master's—I have no doubt of the first length—the second I am more positive of, having only one of that particular sort in our stock; and from what we have sold, which we can trace, we miss about fourteen yards.</p>

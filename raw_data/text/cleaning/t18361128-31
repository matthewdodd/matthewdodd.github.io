                  </hi>. I came from Ramsgate on the 9th of No<lb></lb>vember, and had twenty-four packages with me—they were my own property—they were marked "S. Passenger"—when I arrived in London, they were all put into my cart, and conveyed to my own residence in St. John-street—one contained plate, and another a guitar and some linen—those two did not arrive—I missed them on the following morning—I have seen the articles since, they are all mine, and were in those two packages.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Pugh, of King-street, Snow-hill. About twenty minutes past six o'clock on the evening of the 9th of November, I saw a loaded cart come along—I saw four men go behind it, and saw them take two packages out of the cart—they carried them towards the cab rank—they went to a cab, and one of them called out, "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, life your flap" (meaning the flap of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>)—the prisoner was <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, he was the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man—I am sure of it—I knew him before, but did not know his name—he gave the name of Henry—he lifted the flap, and I called to him, and told him it was stolen property—he said it was all right—I said it was not, but I would have it right—he got up into the seat, and one of the men got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner put the smaller box at his feet, and the other was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> body—the prisoner attempted to whip the horse, and the horse <hi rend="italic">gibbed</hi>—I told him that if he would drive that I had his number, and I called on the waterman to assist me, but he would not do it—this was in Smithfield—the man that was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> jumped out and went into Long-lane, three or four yards from the spot, and staid there—the prisoner came down, and went to Long-lane, and spoke to the man who had been in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner stopped about two minutes, and then he came to me and asked what I meant to do—I said to bring the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and property to the watchhouse—"Well," says he, "Come along"—he came with me—I took it there, and gave it to Mr. George Godfrey, Inspector of the watch—I did not lose sight of the prisoner when he went and spoke to the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You think you saw Rowan behind the door? - A. I am positive I saw him, and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him you was come to take a man for felony? - A. I told him he had been taking timber, and desired him to let me in.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that three-quarters of an hour, he had time enough to have removed the timber? - A. No; there was always somebody at the door the whole of the time.(

The clothes are all my property - I have seen them before - the great coat is mine - I had the great coat four or five years, but I had not worn it above six times - the suit of clothes were made last October, I think - they are valued in the indictment at quite their full value - I should think 1s. less would be the value of them - the spoons which were lost were worth about 10s.</p>
               <p>MRS. COHEN re-examined. I think this waistcoat is worth about 5s. in the trade - the great coat is worth 20s. or 25s., the trowsers 10s. - I should not think the coat worth 20s. to buy.</p>

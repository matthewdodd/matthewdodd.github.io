                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Bunn, and live at No. 70, Brunswick-street, Hackney-road. I have not been with my husband lately. On the 7th of June I went to the Gun public-house, in Shore<lb></lb>ditch, at two o'clock in the morning—I went into the parlour, and remained there till near five—I went there to see for my husband—he drinks very much, and I expected he would be there—I came out of the parlour about five o'clock, and stood by the bar-door—the prisoner was sitting close against me, with a female and two or three men—he got up and called me by name, and asked how I was—I looked at him, and said. "Very well, thank you"—he came and took the glass that I had, and drank out of it—I felt him pull my dress, and I missed half-a-crown, two shillings, and six sixpences—they were in my pocket in a paper—I saw the paper in his hand—I pulled a piece of it off, and gave it to the landlord, and he threw it down in front of the bar—I am sure it was the paper the money was in—there was the mark of the money on the paper—I took it up—the prisoner and the others got it out of my hand and destroyed it—before they destroyed it I had ascer<lb></lb>tained that it was the paper that had had my money—I told the prisoner he had robbed me—he said, "Oh, nonsense."</p>

               <p>said, "I robbed you," and I said, "Yes, you did"—that was before the pri<lb></lb>soner robbed me—the money I lost was in my pocket, in front of my dress—my husband told me to prosecute the prisoner, and he said he would run me through with a knife if I did not prosecute—I do not believe that my husband went afterwards to the prisoner's brother, and tried to get money—my husband drinks a little, but he would not encourage robbing—I am a respectable hard-working woman—on the night after this I went to my sister's, in Hoxton, as I do when I have not what I want at home, but they will not keep my husband—I very seldom go to concerts—I have been two or three times to Grove's Concert-rooms—I never had my face blackened in my life—I have gone home shortly after the concerts have been over—I have gone home with my husband, most times—I never went with any person in place of my husband—I have never taken any one home with me—I do not help to get my living by going with other persons—I never go home with other men—my home is too respectable, through it is poor—I did not like the idea of prosecuting—I never was before a Magistrate in my life—I stopped in the public-house from two till five, by myself—I interfered with no one—I was anxious to see my husband—we have been in apartments lately, which is not like having our own house—the people in the house will not allow my husband, as he gets tipsy, to come home at all hours in the night—it is not at all agreeable, and I objected to it—I do not like any one to make a disturbance—I went to the public-house because my husband gets in there with bad company, treating them with drink; and I was anxious to see whether he was there or not—I was at home the night before, and the night after—I slept at home in my own bed—I had been out in the evening, but I came home about one or two o'clock—I did not go out at all the night after that—I do not often go out—my usual time of going to bed is eleven, if I have work to do I sit up till twelve.</p>

               <p>saw the print of the money—I had brought the money from home—I had received a parcel from home, which I do every week; and I received a half-sovereign in the parcel, from my mother—she sends me half-a-sovereign a week, which is very little—if I want more I can have it—I will swear my mother sent me the half-sovereign—I had changed it in the day—I do not know where I changed it—my mother lives at St. Alban's—the money came by the coach—there was some pork, and some bread, and a great many other things in the parcel.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Had he been out of your service before you made the charge? A. He was in my employ up to the Tuesday night, when I discovered he had received Wood's money - I had not dismissed him from my service before - I did not ask the prisoner to come into my service - he had met me in the street some months previous, and asked me if I could give him a situation; I said, I was full, and had no place for him, and while I laid ill, one of my clerks engaged him - I did not know that he was in the service of Abrahams, another attorney - he came to me; he did not tell me that he was in Abrahams' service, and must give him a week's notice before he could leave - he called on me on a Saturday evening, and wanted to know what salary I would give him, and I told him - I took him without a character.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe in the course of his employment you have trusted him with considerable sums of money? A. To the amount of about 20l. at a time - I always found him act faithfully - I should not think I have trusted him with 30l. or 40l. - I have sent him out to get cheques cashed; he has gone to my tradesmen I believe, and got the amount for cheques; I cannot say that I was in the habit of giving him cheques - he may have had 35l. at a time - Fuller had not complained to me of neglecting his business, for unfortunately almost immediately after I became employed for him, I was confined to the house very much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170077"></xptr>through an accident - I should say his business was got through in the Insolvent Court with the usual quickness; he never complained to me, for I think I saw him but twice; I never received such a message from him by one of my clerks - I never knew he was dissatisfied - I was to pay the prisoner 1l. 5s. a week; he attended from nine o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock in the evening in the vacation, and from nine to nine in term; out of which he was allowed two hours for dinner; he did not work beyond those hours in the office certainly, never for me, to my knowledge; I have never paid him for any extra work he has done; I never paid him two shillings for two extra hours; not for engrossing a schedule of James Cooper to my recollection; I will positively swear I never did, nor ever for any extra work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you allow him to retain for his own use, sums received from clients? A. I believe he said he kept back two shillings one week, for sums he said he had paid to the crier of the prison.</p>

               <p>Re-examined. I did not say when he entered my service "My hours are so and so - I never require my clerk to attend beyond that hour, or if I do I pay him for it."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever promise the prisoner to give him something extra, in consequence of his staying one hour at dinner instead of two? A. I swear most positively he took on several occasions three hours instead of two, and came back drunk, and I threatened to discharge him; I never promised to make it up to him for staying only one hour - I did not promise him five shillings for every case he brought to my office; nothing of the kind; nor did he ever get a case while he was with me - I owe him two days' wages now, which is the Monday and Tuesday - I have subpoened Fuller here; he has come up from Harwich - I have not given him an undertaking to pay him something for coming up to give evidence; he was not up here to find the bill, and I wrote to him that his recognizance would be estreated.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You employed Mr. Norton as your attorney? A. I did; I saw him about twice - I generally saw the prisoner - I gave him the 2l. for the expense of getting through the court; I did not take any acknowledgment from him - it was not for the express purpose of employing counsel; I did not tell him to go himself and get counsel for me; I told him I expected Mr. Norton would do my business and find counsel - I had an agreement with Mr. Norton to do my business for a certain sum; I said I expected Mr. Norton to find counsel for that amount - Drew gave me an undertaking; it was given me by Drew about the time I paid him the money; this is it (producing it); I received this from him in consequence of paying him the 2l.; I took the undertaking, thinking he was doing it for Mr. Norton; I never told him not to pay the money over to Mr. Norton; I never said such a word - I certainly complained of Mr. Norton's neglecting my business, because I could get nothing done - I was delayed, and kept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you not tell the prisoner not to give the money to Norton, for he had neglected you, and you would not employ him any longer? A. No, I did not; the money was paid when I first had the dealing - when I told Drew to bring the books, and I would have nothing more to do with Mr. Norton, was five or six weeks after I had paid the money; I did not complain of him at the time I paid the money - counsel was to be employed in case there was opposition - it was to be done for the amount I agreed with Mr. Norton for - it was part of the original agreement with Norton to supply me with counsel for the whole sum I was to pay him; it was not to be a specific charge afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was £5. the sum you were to pay Norton? A. That was the agreement; I understood from Mr. Norton, that he had declined coming to see me because he understood I had not advanced any money, and I sent him word that I had given his clerk £2.; the prisoner did not deny it - after Mr. Norton found the money had been kept back by the prisoner, he acted for me, and did my business as well as he could.</p>
               <p>MR. ARNOLD. Q. You mean distinctly to say, he was to employ counsel and every other thing for £5.? A. Yes; that was the agreement - I have not been heard before the court - I have been in prison since the 9th of July - this money being kept back, has thrown me back a month.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you paid that money you had been heard before the court? A.

            . I believe it is a custom for attorneys clerks to treat prisoners in the prison, when they go to solicit business - he had no demand on me whatever, on the score of treating prisoners; I never authorised him to treat persons with a view to get their business - I never allowed him to deduct in a case, what he spent in treating - he was only my clerk, and was sent by me to the prison for particular reasons - I know in the insolvent court, prisoners are treated, but not by me - it never was done, and that I can swear.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being called on for his defence, made a long and unconnected address to the court, the substance of which was as follows:- That by an order of the Insolvent Debtor's Court, the attorneys were bound to register the names of their clerks in the books of that court, which the prosecutor not having done, the prisoner could not be considered as his clerk. That the prosecutor was in his debt for having treated different inmates of the prison; also 5s. for every insolvent case that he obtained, and for having worked over hours. That he did not conceive he was bound to pay the 17s. 6d. over to the prosecutor, inasmuch as it was given to him to pay into court. That the 2l. was paid him for the express purpose of employing counsel if requisite, and being himself answerable for the money, he did not think it right to give it over to the prosecutor, and that he had incurred a greater expense in obtaining business in the prison, the prosecutor having got into great disrepute there, through neglecting his client's business, and there was now an indictment against him for perjury.</p>

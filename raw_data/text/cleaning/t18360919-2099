I am a carman, and drive for my brother occasionally, and am watch-inspector of the ward of Bread-street on the 25th of August I was in a cart in Aldgate, land saw the prosecutrix—I was coming down Aldgate, turning out of the Minories—Mrs. Spink was going towards Whitechapel—I saw the prisoners all surround her at the corner of Jewry-street, Aldgate—all four of them, and another one who is no in custody—I observed the two women and Draker, and Prendergast got before, and prevented Mrs. Spink from going on, in fact obstructed the way altogether, so that she could not get on at all—I watched the women for some time, and saw their hands drop from Mrs. Spink's dress—I saw her dress fall when they took their hands away—it shewed her white petticoat when her dress was up—she had on a black silk gown—it was as if the hand had been in<lb></lb>troduced under the black dress, as if the dress had been lifted up—I saw the white, and the black drop over it—I got down out of the cart, went to Mrs. Spink, and asked if she had lost anything—on searching her pocket, she said, her purse, containing three sovereigns and some silver—I asked her to stock till I returned—I went to the corner of Houndsditch, and saw Patrick, a policeman, and beckoned to him—I ran, and he followed me down Mitre-street—I had quite lost sight of the prisoners—I turned into Leadenhall-street, and ran pretty fast—I turned down St. Mary-axe, and saw them all five turn out of the court leading out of Burry-street, (I think,)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turner and live at No.24, Red lion-street, Kings<lb></lb>land-road. I have been acquainted with Prendergast between two and three years—I considered he was living on his means—he had asked me if I knew of any public-house to suit him—he always bore a very respectable character to my knowledge—it considered so.</p>

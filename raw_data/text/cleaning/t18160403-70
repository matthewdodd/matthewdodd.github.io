These things were lost on Thursday last, about half past three in the afternoon, one of the servants informed me that he had detected a man taking some of the plate off the side-board. I went in and saw this stand removed from the place where it stood, and a brown silk handkerchief which I had never seen before, spread upon a plate-warmer, at the end of the side-board, one corner of the handkerchief was turned up over the casters, and the three were spread out. The prisoner insisted that this handkerchief was not his property; and said he came to enquire for a gentleman; but I don't recollect the name that was on a letter which he produced, directed to Pope's Alley, Threadneedle-street.</p>

            -house, Albemarle-street. In the servants room about my business, I heard a bustling of the glasses on the side-board in the dining room, and saw the prisoner in the act of putting a handkerchief over a set of cruets, which usually stood on the side board, but which were removed to the plate warmer. He immediately went out of the room, and I followed him. He left the handkerchief; I can't tell whether he saw or heard me; I raught him just at the green swing doors, which open into the street; there are three pair of doors, and I caught him at the second. I took him into the committee room, and my fellow servant went for Mr. Brooks.</p>

               <p>SANUEL PLANK. He said be slept at the Dover Castle, it St. James's-street the night before; but I found there was no such house as the Dover Castle in St. James's-street.</p>

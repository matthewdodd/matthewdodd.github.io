               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went and searched the waggon? A. Yes, and put the shilling and the bill into the bag; I saw there were currants in it - the waggon was brought to our door in the morning, and I directed two officers to go to the half-way house, to watch it, and see if any thing was taken out - I went to Hammersmith afterwards, and helped to unload the waggon; when it is loaded other persons can get to it, if the waggoner lets them. Hale has been in our service nineteen years.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040093"></xptr>the 23d of October, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was desired by Mr. Wood to go to the half-way house at Kensington, and watch their waggon; I took another officer with me - we went across the park - when I got to the half-way house I waited some time; it was a very wet morning, and when the waggon was coming up to the house with Hale, I went out and crossed the road, to watch the actions of Hale, and Marks, who was the ostler there; I saw Marks go out and speak to Hale for a minute or so, then Hale went up stairs into the ostler's room -Marks went to the tail of the waggon, and took out this bag - I can swear this is the bag; I put my name on it: I hailed the other officer, and followed Marks - when he got to the top of the stairs, into his room, I was at the bottom; I went up, and this bag laid between him and Hale; the two men stood amazed - I said, "Halloo! have I made a mistake, or are they currants?" neither of them said a word, and I handcuffed them: I left them in charge of the other officer, and went to the prosecutors'.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was not Hale who took the bag out? A. No, Marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Then Hale, who had gone with the waggon, had gone up stairs? A. Yes; Marks had had some conversation with him, but I could not hear what; Marks did not say, "God knows what is in it, for I don't;" I did not say it was a bag of stolen currants.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after you saw them conversing together, did you see Marks taking the bag out? A. Not two minutes.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. I received this bag from Bolton; I cut it open, and found this shilling and this washing-bill in this lump of currants - there were 43lbs. of currants.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. This is the bill and the shilling which I put in; these currants are of exactly the same description as ours.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any parcels to send any where that day? A. Yes, to Mr. Archer, two hogsheads of sugar and 15 cwt. of refined goods; the other parcels I spoke of were in the body of the waggon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had Hale lived with you? A. Nineteen years, and had gone that road every fortnight; nothing is more likely than that persons on that road must have known he was our servant.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Where did you find the other parcels? A. When I found the prisoners handcuffed together; I went on to Mr. Archer's, and took out the two hogsheads of sugar; I found Hale's smock-frock in the waggon - one of these bags of sugar was in one sleeve of it, and the other in the other; and this bag of currants in the body of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Did not Marks say, in your presence, that he did not know what was in it? A. I do not think he spoke till he was going out, and then he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

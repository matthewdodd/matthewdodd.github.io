               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. You did not see them before you missed your handkerchief? A. No; Prighe came back willingly; the gentleman gently laid hold of his arm; I cannot say whether Prighe said I or we, when he asked about remuneration; I had seen them together for a minute and a half before I went up; they were in conversation - they walked leisurely - I said to them both, "You have robbed me," and took hold of Cherry, as he was nearest - Prighe turned and walked off- the street was very thin of people - Cherry made a shew of fight to the officer, and resisted - the officer knocked him down - they both resisted, and wanted a coach, saying, they would not be exposed in the street. Prighe said he was an innocent man, and it would injure his character.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I was coming up Ludgate-hill and saw a crowd; Mr. Lund had the prisoners in custody, and was just entering a shop door; Prighe denied the charge; I found the handkerchief in Cherry's bosom, between his waistcoat and shirt - they did not like to go through the street with their hands tied together - they did not resist till I tied them together.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>CHERRY'S Defence. The handkerchief being found in my possession may confirm the prosecutor's statement, but my fellow prisoner I never saw till he came with the prosecutor, and was accused of being concerned with me. I picked up the handkerchief, which two women observed, and told the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>PRIGHE's Defence. I am a respectable young man, and my father was a citizen - I have always lived respectable. I had been to Mr. Barnard's printing-office, in Playhouse-yard - I stood at the picture shop, at the corner of St.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220024"></xptr>Martin's-court, for twenty minutes, then crossed the Old Bailey; I was dressed respectably, though he says it was shabby; he told the Alderman he came after me himself; I was not in company with a soul all day; when the gentleman came after me he said, somebody wished to speak to me - I went back with him - he accused me of the robbery, and I said, on a proof of your being mistaken, what reparation do you suppose you can give for the injury of my character. I insisted on going into a shop to be searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUND. Prighe was certainly not dressed so respectably as he is now, but be was tolerably well dressed.</p>

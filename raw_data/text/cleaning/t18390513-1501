                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and lire in Oxford-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone. I occupy the whole house—the prisoner was my shopman for five weeks—on Thursday, the 28th of March, I missed one £100 bank-note from my cash-box—I gave him into custody on the Mon<lb></lb>day fortnight afterwards—I had received, on the 19th of February, four £100 notes, and three £50 notes from the Bank of England—my cash-box was in my desk at the end of the shop—I believe I left the keys in that desk, when I was attending the counter—I missed two £100 notes on Saturday the 30th, the day after Good Friday—after searching for them, the prisoner came and searched a drawer, and said, "Here is one;" and delivered me a £100 note, No. 98, 046—No. 93, 045 was still mining—after I had traced it, he was charged with taking it, by the gentleman who was brought to the shop—I did not charge him with it myself—he denied taking any thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Benjamin Warwick, a goldsmith in Regent-street. On Saturday morning, the 30th of March, the prisoner came to the shop, between nine and ten o'clock, and wished to look at some watches—I shewed him some—he selected one, and a gold guard, and a brigade chain—they came to 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 183. all together—he produced a silver watch, for which we allowed, I think, 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid me with a £100 note—I sent it out for change by Mr. Warwick's son, who is quite a youth—he was not absent more than five minutes—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Marlborough-street Office. I went to Mr. Davies's shop on Monday, the 15th of March—the prisoner was pointed out to me, and the prosecutor said, "That is the person"—he immediately said to me, "They accuse me of stealing this £100 note"—I said, "Yes, they do; but it remains to be proved whether you are innocent or guilty"—he said, "Come up stairs, and search my trunks with me, Will you?"—I followed him—he unlocked one trunk, I began to make search—the prisoner sat by me, and when I had nearly searched the first</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and carry on business in Lincoln's Inn<lb></lb>fields, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields—I occupy the ground floor for offices—my servant sleeps on the premises, and takes care of the house—I let the other part out in chambers. On the 7th of September last, the prisoner Thomas Chapple was acting as porter to my establishment, and his wife Sophia was the laundress—they slept on the premises, and had the charge of them when the gentlemen had left—the front room on the ground floor I occupy as my own private room—that communicates with the back room, which is the office, by means of double doors—one of them is covered with red cloth—there is a side door also from my room leading to the passage—that is within the hall doors—as you go in there are the hall doors then, a side door on the left hand to go into my private room, and then there are double doors from my room into the back room or office—it is usual to keep the hall door fast during the day, because the street door is generally open during office hours—the hall doors are fastened by a spring lock, which cannot be opened on the outside without a key—it is generally opened by means of a pulley in the office—my side door it secured by a spring lock that cannot be opened from without except by a key—no one can get to my office by the side door, unless they have a key or it is opened from within—there are two keys of the spring lock which is on the side door—one of them I kept myself, and the other was kept by Thomas Chapple, with strict orders not to admit any one but himself and his wife, to clean the room—I did not allow even the clerks in my business to go in there—on Saturday, the 7th of September I went up-stairs to dinner be<lb></lb>tween twenty minutes to five and five o'clock—I should rather incline to think it was about ten minutes to five o'clock—I dined in my drawing-room, which is the room over the ground floor—before I went up I bolted the double doors leading from my room to the office, according to my usual practice—I went out at my side door and drew the door to after me, which fastened it so that it could not be got at but by means of a key—Thomas Chapple waited on me at dinner till about half-past five—I staid up-stairs altogether about an hour and a quarter—I came down about ten minutes or a quarter past six o'clock—I took the key of my room out of my waist-coat pocket, put it in the lock, drew back the lock as usual, and went in—immediately on entering, my attention was called to the door of my iron safe, which was standing wide open—I have a writing table in the middle of the room—I passed by that on one side, and saw several keys, some of which I have since understood to be skeleton keys, lying on a bundle of papers on the writing table, and a small piece of iron—I found the keys of that iron sale lying on the carpet opposite another iron safe, which had not been opened—one of the drawers of ray iron safe was lying on the carpet empty—when I left the room the drawer of the iron safe contained three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, twelve table-spoons, two gravy spoons, and a soup ladle, and an old-fashioned gold watch with a double case—they were all gone—I had usually kept the keys of my iron safe in one of the drawers of my writing table, which was locked up—when I saw the iron safe open I went round the writing table on the other side, and saw the drawer where my keys were kept was open, I missed from that drawer a canvass bag containing seven 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and five sovereigns screwed up together, and some loose sovereigns—I also missed a gold seal, three or four mourning rings, and a small watch</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060236"></xptr>
               <p>chain, which were all together in a piece of paper in the same drawer—I missed from another drawer in the same table an old pair of black trowsers, an old coat which was lying loose in the room, and a blue bag which I think was on one of the iron safes—I gave an alarm, and the servant came up—I found that Thomas Chapple was not at home—he returned in about half-an-hour—I told him what had happened—he accompanied me to the station-house at Bow-street, and the inspector returned with us—I had not at that time any suspicion of Thomas Chapple, and on my speaking to him about the robbery, he men<lb></lb>tioned several names of persons whom he suspected—he mentioned my clerk Widdows, and a young man named Roberts, who had called at the office that morning—I mentioned to the officer what I had heard from the prisoner, and in accordance with his advice the lodging of Widdows was searched, but nothing found—in consequence of what Thomas Chapple said to me, I gave him directions to watch Widdows, at the suggestion of the officer, and on the Monday evening, about ten o'clock, he came to me, and said he had been down to Widdows—f think he said he had followed him, and watched him home—I at last entertained very strong suspicion against Thomas Chapple, and on the 13th I gave him into custody—Pocock, the officer, had found 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, under a stone in the wash-house, and also on Thomas Chappell a receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which made 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think it was on the Thursday before the robbery that Thomas Chapple had said he had no money, and I gave him a sovereign to pay for beating carpets and other things—when he was given into custody I told him to tell me what he knew about the robbery—he cried, and said he could not say any thing without criminating others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector at the station-house at Bow-street. On Saturday, the 7th of September, I accompanied Mr. Porter to his chambers in Lincoln's Inn-fields—I first examined his hall-door, the side-door, and the door leading from the front room to the office, to ascertain, if I could, by what means the robbery had been effected—there were marks of violence on the red door leading from the front room to the office, but the door had not been opened—there had been an attempt, which appeared to have been made with a small crow-bar—there was no mark on the outer door—MR. Porter and Thomas Chapple accom<lb></lb>panied me in my examination—I looked on the carpet in the private room to see if there was any thing lying about, and my attention was directed to that part near the door leading to the office, and there was no key lying on the carpet, I believe—I observed, in the presence of Thomas Chapple, that I could not tell how they got in, as the door had not been opened—I was then near the side-door leading to the passage, and Thomas Chapple stooped down, as though he would pick up something, and he produced this skeleton key—(<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—he said, "Oh, this is the key that opened the door"—I am quite sure it was not on the ground where he ap<lb></lb>peared to pick it up from, before he made that observation—the key has been filed, and it is broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Thomas Chapple and his wife, and assisted in the business of the house at Mr. Porter's. Thomas Chapple had two children—on the Thursday before the robbery I was in the kitchen down stairs with the children, and saw one of the children at one of the dresser drawers which Thomas Chapple used for keeping his papers in—the child picked a key out of the drawer—it was like one of the keys produced—Thomas Chapple was in the kitchen at the time, the child produced the key to him, and he said, "Put down that key"—the child put it back in the drawer—on the next day I went to the drawer myself to look for a bit of sealing wax, and I saw the key then in the drawer—I took it in my hand and looked at it, as it looked such a curious key, I had never seen one like it before—Thomas Chapple was then in the kitchen—I asked him what key that was—he said it belonged to Mr. Lee, up-stairs (a gentle<lb></lb>man who had been a tenant of the chambers up-stairs, but who had left more than two years)—he said it was a little padlock key that had belonged to Mr. Lee—on the afternoon the robbery took place I was looking in that drawer for something, I forget what, and the key was not there then—I took every thing out of the drawer—on that afternoon I was in the front kitchen—there are two kitchen windows, and I could from thence see any body passing out of the doorway at Mr. Porter's—I saw the prisoner Charles King (whom I had seen once before) about half-past five o'clock, as near as I can recollect, coming down from the steps out of the passage—there are railings before the house, and the window gave me a command of the railings—he had a blue bag under his left arm—he went away very quickly—I saw him come down the steps—I could not see whether he had been inside the house, but while I was in the kitchen I heard footsteps in Mr. Porter's private room before I saw him—I had seen him once before in Lincoln's Inn-fields—I do not know exactly the day, nor how long before the robbery—I did not know his name at that time—I had been out walking with Thomas Chapple, and was going in when I saw King, and he whistled, at which Thomas Chapple nodded his head—that was all that passed—after this robbery I was taken to the prison by Mr. Collier, the officer, to see if I knew any person—I saw Charles King there, and selected him from a good many others—on Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing, the day of the robbery, Thomas Chapple said he bad no money, but he should have some by and by, and I thought he was going to take one of the gentleman's books for some money—he said, could I lend him him half-a-crown—I said, "No," and I did not think Mrs. Chapple had any—he said, "Oh nonsense, Mr. Porter gave her a half-sovereign yesterday"—MRS. Chapple was present at the time—he put his band down her bosom, and took half-a-crown from her—she was tipsy at the time (she was in the habit of getting tipsy)—Thomas Chapple then went out—I think it was about half-past twelve or one o'clock—he staid out about three hours—when he came back I told him his face was very red—I do not know whether he had been drinking, but his face was very red indeed—I remember Mr. Porter's dinner time that day, and the alarm of the robbery, and I saw the state of the room—in the course of the same evening, after the robbery, the prisoner told me he was going to Dublin on the following Friday—on the Sunday evening as I was sitting in the kitchen with him he said he had some money under ground, and he</p>

I said, "No"—he said, "Charles King"—I did not know him by the name of Charles King at that time—Chapple walked home with me—we went through Regent-street—he said he had had a letter from Dublin from his sister—he said he had written to his sister to send him some money to pay for a solicitor for his brother Charles—he did not say whether the letter he had received was an answer to his or not—as we were going up Regent-street we met Sophia Cox, with some other wo<lb></lb>man—Chapple called Cox aside, he spoke to her, and gave her the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday the 7th of September last my parents were living in Drummond-street, St. Pancras, and I was with them—I was then in the employ of William Wilks, a beer-shop keeper, in Harford-street, Fitzroy Market—I know Charles Chapple, the brother of Thomas Chap<lb></lb>pie, and I know Charles King. On the 7th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, or a little after, Charles Chapple and Charles King came into Mr. Wilks's—Chapple had a blue bag with him—they first came into the public parlour, and then went with Mr. Wilks into a private room, where Chapple pulled out of the bag a pair of trowsers and an old coat—I was not in that room, but the door was open—he asked Mr. Wilks to pur<lb></lb>chase them—Wilks asked what he wanted for them—Chapple said, "What will you give?"—he said, "I will give half-a-crown for them," and Chapple said, "You shall have them, and as you bid so well, I have some<lb></lb>else for you"—Chapple then put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out what appeared to be a paper parcel, but what it contained I could not say—it was not very large—he could hold it in his hand, and his hand was shut—it was such a parcel as might have contained notes, and I heard the word "notes" mentioned, but who by I cannot say—Wilks told them to go and sit down, and he would see what he could do for them—he said he would go out and fetch some person, but he did not say who, nor what for—he then took off his apron and went out—he was gone three-quarters of an hour, and came back with two persons—Charles Chapple and Charles King were a that time in the public parlour, and they asked me to drink, Chapple addressed himself to me and said, "Our long talked of job is come off at last"—Charles King said, "Yes, to the tune of two or three hundred"—this was in the public parlour—Charles Chapple then said he should be a gentleman for a little while, he had got enough to keep him for two or three winters.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were either of the two persons who came back with Wilks known to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were not particularly known—I had seen one of them before once or twice—I know a person named <hi rend="italic">Deaf Harry</hi>—he was in the parlour, but he was not one that came with Wilks—the conversation that I have related took place while Wilks was gone—when Wilks came back he beckoned to Charles Chapple and Charles King—they went into the private parlour with Wilks, and the two persons who returned with him, <hi rend="italic">Deaf Harry,</hi> and another whom I do not know—the door was shut—they re<lb></lb>mained in the private parlour I should say about three-quarters of an hour, then came into the public parlour again, and Charles Chapple called for half-a-gallon of ale, which he paid for—I heard Charles King say to Charles Chapple, "Well, we have got two hundred and eighty," but whether he meant money for the notes or what, I do not know—Charles Chapple said it was <hi rend="italic">Tom's</hi> job, but Thomas Chapple was not there—Charles Chapple told me in Charles King's presence that he had been down to Mr. Porter's, in Lincoln's Inn-fields that afternoon with Charles King—that he had done the robbery, and Charles King stood outside—during the evening Sophia Chapple, or Cox, came in with Henry Cox, with whom she was living—she walked towards Charles Chapple, who put his hand into his pocket, pulled out some gold, and gave it her—she then went away and left Henry Cox behind her—they then remained playing</p>

               <p>at cards till about twelve o'clock—Henry Cox went away a very little while before the rest—I heard Charles Cox say he should like to go to Boulogne, and Charles King said "Yes, I should like to have a little journey into the country"—on Monday, the 9th of September, Charles Chapple, Henry Cox, and two or three other persons came into our beef shop about half-past two or three o'clock—they said they were going to dinner, and when they had been there about half-an-hour Sophia Cox came and called them to dinner—they all went away together—about half past seven o'clock there was a <hi rend="italic">sing-song</hi> at our house—Charles Chapple, Charles King, Henry Cox, and a tallish young man, whose name I do not know, came there—they stopped till about half-part ten o'clock, when some person came and called Charles Chapple and Charles King out, and they went out—I had occasion to go out to get some tobacco, and when I came back I saw the person, outside who I believe was Thomas Chapple—they were all in conversation together outside—he said, "You had better take those things off, it will look very bad—besides it will get us transported for Mr. Porter's robbery"—both Charles Chapple and Charles King had watch-guards on, and they were the things that the person desired them to take off—on that Monday before the <hi rend="italic">sing-song</hi> I met Henry Cox in Totten<lb></lb>ham-court-road about half-past eleven o'clock—he had another person with him, and Cox said to me, "I suppose you have heard of <hi rend="italic">Charley's</hi> job?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "It is a good one"—I did not make any answer—he said, "I suppose they will make it all right with you?"—I made no answer—he said, "Mind you don't <hi rend="italic">split,</hi> or if you do, look out."</p>

                  </hi>. In September last I lived in Little Cumming-street, Pentonville. On Thursday or Friday morning, the 13th or 14th of Septem<lb></lb>ber, Charles King came to my house between eight and nine o'clock—I had a lodger named Lewis, who was an acquaintance of Charles King—I was at that time confined to my house with a broken bone—I remained in the room while Charles King and Lewis were breakfasting—they entered into conversation, and I heard Charles King, say to Lewis, "There is a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">chaunt</hi> for that job at Porter's, in Lincoln's Inn-fields"—I also heard, from a question that Lewis put to King, that they had sold some plate at Child's, in Goswell-street-road—I did not hear any more particular con<lb></lb>versation about that—King came again on the Saturday morning, and said he did not know what he should do or where he should go to—Lewis advised him to go to Boulogne—King said he had to meet Chapple in the Dials, to arrange where to go to—I will not be exact about the Chris<lb></lb>tian name he used, but it was Chapple—King left my house then—I saw him again on the following Tuesday, at this end of London-bridge; but on Monday, the 16th of September, a twopenny post letter came to Lewis, by the last post in the evening—Lewis asked me to read it to him—it was from Charles Chapple to Lewis—I read it to Lewis, and afterwards burned it—in consequence of what I observed in that letter, I went, for the purpose of apprehending Charles Chapple and Charles King on the Tuesday—on my arrival at London-bridge I saw Charles Chapple and Charles King—(I did not know Chapple at that time)—they were together—I do not know whether they came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—they bad carpet bags, and were both dressed in Macintoshes—my lodger, Lewis, was with them—I gave in<lb></lb>formation to the policeman on duty, but they escaped—there is no doubt but Lewis told them I was there.</p>

               <p>I called on her again, and went to fetch something for her—I think that was on the 22nd of September—Thomas Chapple came in, and be and Sophia Cox both looked very much confuted—she said to him, "Will you have any thing to drink?"—he said, "Yes"—I went and got sixpenny-worth of gin—when I came in with it, Sophia Cox told me to go over to her father's to fetch her brother George—I went, and he came back with me—he went in, and I met Sophia Cox at the door—the did not seem to wish for my company, and I wished her good night—I saw that Henry Cox was in the room as I went away—from that time I did not hear any thing more about the robbery till Thomas Chapple was taken into custody, which was on the Friday after—after that Sophia Cox told me she had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money—that Henry Cox had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that Charles Chapple and Charles King were gone to Dublin because they were fright<lb></lb>ened for fear they should be taken up—I was taken up about three weeks or a month after, when I was in Sophia Cox's apartment—Henry Cox was with me—I sent to my parents, and expressed a desire to say what I knew about the matter—while in custody I was in the same place where Sophia Cox was—when we were remanded, she told me not to say any thing, and she would give me two sovereigns—the said she hoped her fa<lb></lb>ther would get off, for Charles Chapple's money was hid on Mr. Semple's wharf—(I think he is a timber-merchant, I am not certain)—her father's name is Charles Chapple—he is the prisoner—the Charles Chapple I have been speaking of, is the son, who is not here—Sophia Cox said she wished they, (the policemen) had not taken the coat, as that was the coat that Charles Chapple had on when he did the robbery—she is not the wife of Henry Cox—she told me so—when I was in custody, and was brought up, Henry Cox used to tell me not to say any thing, and I should be sure to get off—Henry Cox and Sophia Cox were in bed together one morning when I was there, and a strange man came in—Henry Cox said to that man, "MRS. King has got Charles King's money, and I should like to go and take it from her, for I dare say it is somewhere about the house."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Nelson-place, New-road, and am a plumber. I knew Mr. James of Little Cumming-street—I was there on the 12th or 13th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon—I went into the front parlour to wait for James, and after I had waited a little time, Lewis, who lodged there, (I do not know his Christian, name,) I think it is William,) and Charles King came in—Charles King produced a watch and asked Lewis to wind it up for him—Lewis asked him what he had given for it—King said he had taken it out of pledge for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a pound, and he would have kept the gold watch, but Chapple made him sell it with the plate—I was looking through the parlour window, and thinking the conversation rather strange, I paid more attention than I should have done—Lewis asked King what were the amounts of the notes—King said, "Tens and hundreds," and that they had received between 200 and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I then turned round and said, "Gentlemen, you have got a good booty or prize, where did they come from?"—Charles King said, "From the lawyer's in the fields"—they did not stop above five or six minutes—James was at that time ill in bed—when the others were gone, he came down, and I told him the moment he came down—on the Tues<lb></lb>day following James came to me, and in consequence of what he told me, I went with him to London-bridge, to apprehend Charles King—I know the hotel at the foot of the bridge—after waiting some time I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drive to the foot of London-bridge, and just at the moment I saw King and another young man close to the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> but I cannot say that I saw them get out of it—there is a way out of the hotel which leads to the water-side, and I lost sight of them—I afterwards went with Mr. James to Mr. Porter's to tell what I knew.</p>

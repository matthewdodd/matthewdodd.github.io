               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was going through a passage I saw a roll of something lie on the ground; a man came along; I asked him who it belonged to; I asked him to take it up to some house, and find an owner for it; he said he would have nothing to do with it, I then tried to lift it up myself, I found it was too heavy, I tied my cloak round it to take care of it, till I found an owner; I got it up; it fell down, I could not carry it; I dare say I tried to carry it ten or a dozen times, till I got to a corner of an alley, and there I left it, in the presence of six or eight men; I desired them to take care of it; I would not have any thing more to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hill.) Did she observe you following of her - how came she to know you again? A. I was standing in the mob along with the rest, I saw her again in Wood-street; she then asked if I had any demands on her.</p>

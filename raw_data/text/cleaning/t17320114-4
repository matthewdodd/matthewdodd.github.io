            . The Books lay on my Counter, and between 5 and 6 in the Evening as my Spouse was in the back Part of the Shop, she saw a Man go out, upon which she called me, and I miss'd the Books. Next Morning I sent my Servant among the Booksellers to desire them to stop such Books if offer'd to Sale. About Noon, the same Day, Mr. King came to my Shop, saying such Books were stopt. I went to his Mother's Shop in Fore-street, and there I found one Dowles , who said he had the Books of three Men, who were at the Swan and Hoop Alehouse. Mr. King, and I and Dowles went thither, and found them. A scuffle ensued. They endeavour'd to break from us. The Prisoner stabb'd me in the Shoulder with a Penknife. I call'd for Assistance, and up came A Gentleman Soldier , and wrestled with him. The two others got off, Dowles follow'd them.</p>

The Prisoner and two more sent for me to an Alehouse, the Prisoner gave me the Books, and bid me make the most of them, for they were in haste.

I met an old Ship-mate and another, and we went to drink at the Black Bull in Petticoat-Lane ; Dowle came to us, and my Ship-mate said he had some Books to sell, but they were at his Lodgings over the way. Dowle went with him thither, and fetch'd the Books, and then we went together to the Swan and Hoop by Moorfields , where he left us , and went to sell the Books; he staid above half an Hour, and then came with Mr. Noon and Mr. King. My Ship mate and the other ran out, and Dowle after them, and then a Soldier knock'd me down. I ow'd Money, and was afraid of an Arrest, which made me struggle to get off.

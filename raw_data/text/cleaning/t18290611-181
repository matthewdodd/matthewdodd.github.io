On Monday, the 13th of April, in consequence of something we heard, I went to his dwelling-house in Long's-buildings about one o'clock in the day; I found him in bed - I saw a number of japanned and tin wares about, and questioned him about them; he said he had purchased some at stalls in the street, and some of persons who brought them about - Attfield, who was with me, opened a door, where we found a number of articles, and among the rest was a patent kitchen raise; it is a particular kind of dish-cover, which Mr. Howard has got the patent for - I said, "You did not purchase this, this is our manufacture;" he said, "No, Groom gave me that," meaning one of our workmen - a number of these articles were found in a box; he requested several times to see Mr. Howard - I left the officer with him, while I went to see for Mr. Howard; here is an oil bottle, which is marked with the initials of one of our customers, who lives in Lincoln's Inn-fields - we keep it full of oil for them; I know of no order ever being given to Groom to dispose of any of these articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Are you any partner there? A. No. I am only clerk; this oil bottle and raise I can speak more particularly to; two or three persons, of the name of Groom, work in that establishment, and he did not say which it was - there are many articles here which I know, but I cannot point them out as not having been sold.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodgings to make the search; I found him in bed - I told him his master suspected he had been robbing him, and asked whether he had any property, and whether he would allow us to search; as we had no warrant - he said he had no objection; I searched the room all over, and found one hundred and five different articles, the greater part of which were in a box on the left-hand side, closely packed up in paper - there were some things hanging about the room, some over the mantel-piece, some in a cupboard, and some in a drawer; I saw his wife go in great haste towards a dresser drawer at the further end of the room, and take hold of something - I said I thought she had something there she should not have; I took hold of her hand, and found several duplicates, which I produce - I found several other duplicates in the drawer, thirteen in all; they all relate to articles of this description - while I was searching, I heard Mr. Quincey say, "He is gone out;" I looked, and missed the prisoner - I ran down stairs, and saw him running up the court; before he got into Whitecross-street I overtook him and brought him back - he said he was only going to Mr. Howard's; I then sent for Garton- I heard the prisoner say he was very sorry for what he had done in taking these things from his master; that at Christmas last there were a number of articles packed up to be sent to a customer, and he took them out of that parcel; when he was before the Magistrate he acknowledged he had taken them, but at different times - when we first went in, his wife said they had bought some of people who sit in the streets, and some of persons who go about hawking them.</p>

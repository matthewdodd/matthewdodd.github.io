                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live in Tenter-street, Spital-fields. On Friday afternoon, the 23rd of February, the three prisoners came to my house, and engaged a room on the ground floor—Elizabeth Leonard said she would come in the afternoon and take it, as she was waiting for a person from the London Dock—she said she must come in that night—I asked her for a deposit—she said, "I cannot leave any deposit at present, till I hear from my friend in the Dock, who leaves at four o'clock"—she did not come again till nine o'clock at night, she then said, "I am come at last, the rain kept me back"—the two male prisoners were with her—they had a porter with them, who brought some baskets of wadding, and put it into the room—they all went out again about a quarter after nine o'clock—Lofthouse and the woman came back—Thomas Leonard had stopped at the place—the woman said it was a very wet night which was the reason she had moved her goods so late—she said she would make my room glitter with china and beautiful furniture, which she was going to bring on Monday morning—I went with her and Lofthouse to a public-house, and they gave me some porter, and then went away—next morning (Saturday) I heard a knock at the door, and found Lofthouse and Thomas Leonard—Lofthouse unlocked the room and went in, and was there an hour and a half—I then heard the door go, and he was gone—on the Sunday the officers came to my house, and took away the cotton, which the prisoners had brought there.</p>

On Sunday, the 25th of February, I went to Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, and saw Elisabeth Leonard, in a room at No. 104 or No. 106—there were two other women with her—I heard her say to one of them, "If you will give me a shilling, I will take you and give you a dozen of wadding, but you must be very careful, and wrap them up in your apron, so that they shall not be seen"—the door was ajar—this was before they knew I was there—I went in, and took her into custody—the woman answered her, "Take and tell where the waddings are deposited, and clear my husband, for I How he is innocent"—that woman is below now, her name is Bowers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth Leonard</hi>.

The wadding was brought into my pre<lb></lb>mises in baskets, such as these—I did not know what it was when it first came—I thought it was crockery—the porter, who was with them, carried the baskets away—they all three went away together, the first time, with the baskets, after emptying them; and then Lofthouse, and the female prisoner, came a second time, with the baskets again—Thomas Leoanrd was not with them then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and draper, at 44, Tottenham-court-road, in the parish of St. Pancras; it is my dwelling-house. On Friday, 17th Jan., I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock—I was the last person up, and I secured the house myself—I double-locked the street-door, and left the key in the lock, put up a chain across, and bolted the bottom bolt—in the passage there is a door leading into the shop—I locked it, and had the key upstairs with me—I went into the shop; the goods were all safe on the shelves, and this coat was on the block—I was disturbed between three and four o'clock in the morning, came down, found the street-door shut to, but unlocked; the chain was down, and the bolt drawn back; the door was latched—the door leading from the passage to the shop had been broken open—I saw a quantity of cloth in the passage, packed up, apparently ready to take away; and in my presence a jemmy was found in the kitchen under the water-butt—the cloth had been on the shelves the night before—on looking up the kitchen-chimney, Moran was found with my coat on.</p>

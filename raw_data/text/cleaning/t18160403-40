I told the watchman he had presented a pistol to me, and wanted to rob me. An altercation took place, and a gentleman threw up a sash, and said, take them both into custody. I was then seized by two watchmen, and taken to the watchhouse, and the prisoner the same. The prisoner was searched, and I was searched likewise. While I was being searched, a watchman brought a pistol in, and another brought a paper of powder, which he said the prisoner threw out of his pocket. I said to the constable of the night, that I wished to send for a friend, with whom I had been spending the evening; he came, and I was liberated to appear the next morning, which I did.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Cheapside. I heard a noise, and shortly after a cry of watch! murder! When I came up to the place, I found the prosecutor and the prisoner upon the ground, and when they got up, each charged the other. Mr. George charged the prisoner with wanting to rob him; and the prisoner charged the gentleman with wanting to rob and murder him. A gentleman opened a window, and said, take them both to the watchhouse. Three other watchmen had come to my assistance. We took them to the watchhouse; in going along, the prisoner dropped the bowl of a pewter spoon from his pocket; I also saw him drop a piece of paper, which was afterwards discovered to contain gunpowder; I did not pick it up, because I had hold of the prisoner. When they got to the watchhouse, they were both searched, but nothing found. I then went back to the place where they had been lying, and found a pistol, which I brought to the watchhouse, and gave to the constable of the night; it was loaded.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030033"></xptr>Prisoner. Were you the first that came up?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What was cried first?</p>

               <p>Witness. To the best of my recollection watch! was cried first.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When you came up, what hold had the gentleman of me?</p>

               <p>Witness. He held you fast by the collar.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What did I say to you when you first came?</p>

               <p>Witness. You said, the gentleman wanted to murder you or rob you.</p>

               <p>COURT. Which gave the first charge?</p>

               <p>Witness. The prisoner; he had hold of the prosecutor also.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me drop any thing; did you see the bowl of the spoon fall?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Had you hold of me?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes; I on one side, and another watchman on another.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. And how was there a possibility of my having the use of my hands, in the custody of two watchman?</p>

               <p>Witness. We had only a hold of your collar.</p>

               <p>GEORGE TAYLOR. Another watchman, corroborated the account of the last witness, and picked up the powder.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What did the gentleman say when he came to the watchhouse?</p>

               <p>Witness. He said that if you would acknowledge your fault, as there was a God above, he would say no more about it; but if not, he would persist in the Law. The prisoner then wanted the gentleman to go side with him; but the gentleman said he would not, and whatever he had to say, he must say before faces, or he would not hear it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not the gentleman say, that he could not say whether it was a pistol or not?</p>

               <p>Witness. No; he distinctly said it was a pistol. When the prisoner was searched, a thimble was found upon him, and he exclaimed, a very pretty pistol indeed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Fore-street, in the morning, about one o'clock, to go to Old-street to sleep, and this gentleman came up, and asked me the way to Angel-street; I told him it was to the right of Wood-street, and I would conduct him to it. Just as I got into the dark place, the gentleman demanded my money or my life, and came close to me; I struck his hand, from which the pistol immediately fell, and he caught hold of my collar; I called out murder, and the watchman came up, and I gave charge of him. A gentleman from a sash said, take them both, and three watchman came up, and we were both taken to the watchhouse, and searched, and I had neither pistol or powder, nor had the gentleman who is my prosecutor; he sent for his friend, and was liberated, and they took charge of me; I was sent to Giltspur-street Compter, and afterwards sent here for trial.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

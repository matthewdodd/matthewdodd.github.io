            . I am a tailor, and live in Whitechapel. On the 27th of May, I was near the west end of Lombard-street, at a quarter past nine o'clock - I saw the prisoner, as I was walking in front of the Mansion-house, with two others, all on a sudden make a start - I instantly followed them - I saw the prisoner take from the pocket of Mr. Bailey a handkerchief - I crossed over and tapped Bailey on the shoulder, and the prisoner ran away - I followed and collared him - he commenced a violent attack on me- gave me a blow in the right eye, and knocked me down - I got up, over took him, and laid hold of him - he knocked me down again - I got hold of him - he turned round and became more violent than before - I called "Murder," and brought a City officer to my assistance - I saw the handkerchief picked up, and am certain I saw the prisoner take that handkerchief from Bailey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You struck me two or three times. Witness. I did not.</p>

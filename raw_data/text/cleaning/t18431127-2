                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Samuel Levy Samuels, and James Ingle, Little Aliff-street, Goodman's-fields. In Feb. last the prisoner called at our warehouse, and told me he came from Mr. Nathan, of Ratcliff-highway, and wanted four umbrellas at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, for Nathan, and Mr. Nathan would send the money in the morning—I knew Mr. Nathan, and gave him the umbrellas, believing Nathan had sent him for them—whether my em<lb></lb>ployers knew Nathan I cannot say—they had never done business with him—I had never seen the prisoner in his employ—I omitted to send for the money—the prisoner came again in Aug. for two umbrellas, similar to those he had before—Mr. Ingle asked if I had applied for the money—I said, no—the prisoner said Mr. Nathan was surprised we had not sent for it—I told him I would send for the money for the six together to-morrow morning—he waited a quarter of an hour as the umbrellas were not ready, and then went away with them—I sent for the money next morning.</p>

I have known Mr. Nathan some years as a neighbour—we knew him to be a respectable tradesman—on the 29th of Sept, the prisoner came to our shop, and said Mr. Nathan had sent him for three pairs of large sized men's boots—I asked if he was living with Mr. Nathan—he said, yes, he had lived with him for the last six months—he said he would return in five minutes with the shoes or money—I asked if he meant Mr. Nathan, of Rat<lb></lb>cliff-highway—he said, "Yes"—I let him have the shoes—he said those that fitted he would bring the money for, and if they did not fit he would bring them back in five minutes—he never brought them.</p>

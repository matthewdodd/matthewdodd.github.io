               <p>on Saturday night, 13th July, I was in Little Earl-street, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running very fast in a direction from where the robbery took place—I stepped him—a gentleman came up, and said he had assaulted two young women at the bottom of the street, but he did not know whether he had robbed them or not—the prisoner said he was not the party, but the gentleman was—I took him to the station, and searched him—he fell on his knees and begged for mercy—the gentleman said he did not wish to press the charge of assaulting him (he had assaulted him also)—just as we were going to let him go, the two females came in, and directly said, "That is the man that robbed us"—I observed that his little finger was bleeding.</p>

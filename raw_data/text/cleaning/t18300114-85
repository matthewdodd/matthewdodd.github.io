            . I live in Titchfield-street. I went to a raffle on the 7th of December, and had a cloak, which I put over a bedstead up - it was in a poor person's room; the bed was turned up - I saw the made prisoner there; this is my cloak - I partly made it myself, and know my own work; the woman was not there - the man returned a little before eleven o'clock, and that excited my suspicion.</p>
               <p>Charles Bevan. Q. Did you not borrow it? A. No, I bought it and paid for it.</p>

            . I saw this witness at the raffle, and put the cloak over the bed, at half-past nine o'clock; the male prisoner came, took the cloak, and wrapped it up - I said, "What are you going to do with that?" he said, "Nothing, but keep it clean, and out of harm;" he afterwards pulled his coat off, and put that by the side of the bed - he went away about eleven o'clock, and put the coat under his arm; I did not see him take the cloak with him.</p>

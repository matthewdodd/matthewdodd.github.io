The prisoner approached the waggon on the off side; I am sure the prisoner is the person; a person going by seeing me with a heavy load on my back, said is that your fellow servant on the off side of the waggon, he spoke softly; I immediately said no; I threw my load off my back at the door of No. 7; I saw the prisoner taking the truss off the waggon; I immediately pursued him. It is a truss of blue and white woollen cloth for aprons. I followed the prisoner, and never lost sight of him until he got into Gutter-lane; I stopped the prisoner. This is the truss.</p>

               <p>Q. On the prisoner's way to Newgate, had you any conversation with him - A. Yes; I neither threatened him or promissed him any thing; he met a man that looked like a smith. I asked him if he was a smith; he said, he had been. I told him it would have been better for him to have been working at his trade than doing what he had done; he said, he did not know, it hurt his hands; he should have only seven pennyworth; I understood seven years transportation.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

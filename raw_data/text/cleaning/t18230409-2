On the 20th of November, I was in Whitechapel - the prisoner accosted me, and I went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18230409-2-crimeloc7">Chapel-street, Commercial-road</placeName>

Soon after I got into the house I was taken sick; she was with me at the time. She left the room, and I suspected I was robbed, and missed 129 l. odd; it consisted of a 100 l., a 20 l., and a 5 l. Bank notes, and the rest in gold and silver. It was in my right hand breeches pocket. I raised an alarm - this was about eight o'clock at night. A man named Archer offered to assist me - he led me round several streets, but did not find her. I knew the numbers and dates of the notes, and stopped them next morning - they were 100 l., 19,834, 11th of October; 20 l., 3948, 24th of October, 1822. I do not know the number of the 5 l. note.</p>

            . I keep the King and Queen, public-house, in Chapel-street. On the 20th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner - I served Archer with two pints of beer; a man named Griffiths came in after him, and asked for a man in a fustian jacket; I called Archer out to him - they spoke together, and then went away again - the prisoner was behind him. Griffiths called Archer out, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come along, it's all right" - they all went out together. I had frequently seen the prisoner in their company - Archer was tried here afterwards. M'Kinnon has since shewn me the house he went to - I know the prisoner lived there at that time.</p>

            . I am a slopseller, and live in Cable-street. A girl of the same size and appearance as the prisoner, came into my shop on the 20th of November, about nine o'clock at night, with Griffiths, who produced a 100 l., a 20 l., and a 5 l. note, and asked me what notes they were, I told him - there was a name on the back of the 100 l. note, but it was blotted; the name of the signing clerk was Tarquer or some such name. He said if I would change the others he would lay out 5 l. in clothes, I refused, and they left. I followed them, and lost them in Rosemary-lane. I mentioned it to Plunkett.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Durnford Capel, junior, of No. 5, Mary-place, in the parish of All Saints, Poplar. The prisoner was employed by me as needle woman, and sometimes as servant—I left her in charge of the house for five months, while we were out of town—she had been in my house shortly before I discovered this loss—on Friday, the 23rd of Dec.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301020030"></xptr>
               <p>I had occasion to look over the plate, and missed six table forks, five table and three tea spoons, from a drawer in my wardrobe, which is generally unlocked while I am at home, but when I was absent from home it was locked—I had not left the prisoner in the house by herself for many months—she had been there on the Tuesday preceding—I gave information to a policeman.</p>

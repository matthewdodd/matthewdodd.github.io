On the 20th of June the prisoner came into our house and called for a pint of cyder, he was then in the tap-house, I went down into the cellar, he went into the kitchen and complained he was cold. I had another customer came and called for a pint of bear, I went and drew it. I know my candlesticks were standing on the mantlepiece when he went into the kitchen. When he was gone I missed my candlesticks. After this a market woman who uses my house was telling me that Mr. Clare, at the Coach and Horses in the King's road, had been robbed of a gown and apron, and that the man upon being searched had a pair of brass candlesticks found upon him. She described the man, I went to the constable's house where she directed me, and saw both the prisoner, whom I knew again, and cry candlesticks. Produced in court and deposed to.</p>

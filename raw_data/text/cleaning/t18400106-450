                  </hi>I live in Somerset-street, Portman-square. A distraint was put into my house for rent, in September last, by Mr. Gingell—the prisoner was the man in possession—after the first day or two I found him at my drawers, rifling them—I thought it was an act he had not any business to do, and I remonstrated with him—I did not miss any thing at that time—I afterwards paid the rent, and after I paid it, I missed a variety of books, two gold rings, a silk pocket-handkerchief, and other things—I applied for a warrant, and went to search the prisoner's lodg<lb></lb>ing, and found some books and other things at Mr. Gingell's house in Barrett's-court—the prisoner resided with him, but had absconded—I went a second time—he was not there—I found a variety of articles, which are here—Roche and Pitt went with me.</p>

On the 24th of September I accompanied the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodgings, at Gingell's house, in Barrett's-court—I knew they were his lodgings, from his having been a policeman—there was some property found at Gingell's house by Roche,</p>

I went to the prisoner's apart<lb></lb>ments, accompanied by the prosecutor, on the night of the 24th of Sep<lb></lb>tember—I found the prisoner's wife (I knew her to be his wife) in the apartment—I found these six books and other things in a drawer—I went there the next day again, and saw the wife again, and found these prints and other things—I had never seen the prisoner go in and out of the apartment—I went into the country after him—I took him in Baldwin's<lb></lb>gardens, Gray's Inn-lane, on the night of the 17th of December—I laid, "I want you, for felony"—he said, "You won't have me"—I said, "I shall have you"—he <hi rend="italic">up</hi>with his left hand, and struck me in the face—I laid hold of his two arms, and said, "You are my prisoner, you won't go"—he bent down his head, and bit my right hand—I said, "I won't let you go"—he said, "You must"—there was a crowd round it—he tripped me up to throw me down—I called for assistance—I said, "I want him, for robbery"—a gentleman in a cloak said, "He is a policeman, we must assist him"—while struggling, the prisoner got his hand to his right-hand pocket, but I seized it—I was determined to bind his arms—I handcuffed him, by assistance, and put my hand to his right-hand coat pocket, and found this dagger in it—I found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on him, and a bunch of keys—they are not used for picking locks of drawers, that I am aware of—I succeeded in securing the prisoner—when I took this out of his pocket I said, "This is what you meant for me, is it not? "—he said, "You know more of it than I do"—in the way up Holborn he said, "What is against me? "—I said, "A case of felony; I do not want you to put any question to me, if you have any thing to say say it to the Magistrate."</p>

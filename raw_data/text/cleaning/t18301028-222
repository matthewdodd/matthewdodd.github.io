I let the bed to the prosecutor - I never saw the prisoner before; the prosecutor was not a bit drunk - he is mistaken in saying that he was; I let him the bed for 1s. 6d. - the girl was with him; they said they were husband and wife, and were benighted - she got up first, and then he got up and said he had lost his watch; I said he could not lose the woman, because I had got the key, but she had got into the yard - I stood at my door, and caught her going out of my neighbour's house; I said, "You have robbed the person you brought here as your husband" - she said she had not; I took her - she said, "If you will let me go, I will give you the watch."</p>

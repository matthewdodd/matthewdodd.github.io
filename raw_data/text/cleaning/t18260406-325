               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me the snuff-box? A. Yes; I think I did, and you gave it to the waiter, and she returned it; I did not fall asleep in the interim - I got a little drowsy - I was not asleep when you left the room; I saw you go - I made no remark to the waiter about your leaving the room; I waited some time expecting you to return; I never said to the waiter, it would be all right if you had got it; she did not tell me you had it; I went two or three days afterwards to know if you had returned the box, and the answer was you had not called.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did not you put your box into the prisoner's hands? A. Yes; he took it for the purpose of handing it to the waiter, and she went out; I did not afterwards express myself satisfied that it had not been stolen; I had seen him five or six times before, but I did not see him again till Saturday last - I was very angry about it.</p>

            . I live at the King's-arms, Phillip-lane. I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner there; I was called, and the snuff-box was given me to get some snuff; I did not like to go, as it was wet, and I gave it to our young man to go; when I came back, the prisoner took the box, as I supposed, to pass it to Mr. Lake; the prisoner came a day or two afterwards, and I asked him if he took the box, he said he did; I said, it was not a gentlemanly sort of action; he said I might make myself comfortable, as he would return it; he staid at the house about three hours, and had something to drink to the amount of 3s.; but he went away and did not pay - the money belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your return, did you see the prosecutor? A. Yes; he was not asleep - he told me to give the twopence to the man for fetching the snuff; he was sitting down, but I could not get at him, and I gave the box to the prisoner, but I did not see him put it into his pocket; I ran up as far as Wood-street after the prisoner, and asked him for the money; he said he would not pay.</p>

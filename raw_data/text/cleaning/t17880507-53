               <p>Was he there at Lady-day? - Yes, Sir, and after, because when the things were missed, the lodgers were warned out of the house, and he was there before that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You lodged in this house? - Yes, and had a considerable time.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes, I am; and this plate I received from the woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was not till the 8th of April you say? - Not till the 8th.</p>
               <p>The person with whom you transacted this business you say was the woman? - I forgot to mention, when I laid down the money on the counter, the man took some, if not all the money.</p>
               <p>Whether he gave it to the lady or no, you do not know? - I do not know what he did with it.</p>
               <p>Your conversation was with the lady? - I did not hear him speak above two or three words.</p>
               <p>Certainly your attention was chiefly directed to the lady? - Where they are in company, and it is referred to the other person, certainly my attention must be refered to them both.</p>
               <p>Was not your attention particularly directed to the woman? - At first it was, because she took the plate out.</p>
               <p>She asked you whether you sold plate? - No, she did not, she asked me, whether I bought plate.</p>
               <p>How long was this woman there? - They might be there four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Is your shop an open shop, or is it divided into boxes? - Part of the shop is divided into boxes, and part of it is open; we had just lighted candles; it is much darkened; it was just dark.</p>
               <p>The woman I take it stood forward? - They both stood even with the counter.</p>
               <p>Was this in the part where the boxes were? - No, it was not; it was in an open part of the shop.</p>

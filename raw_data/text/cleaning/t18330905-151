No, but the bottles had a mark, which my servant put on in my presence; I knew them to be mine - there is nothing here but the towel, it is marked Woods, 1830 - the prisoner was so drunk as not to know what he did - the basket was in the room in which he had been working just before; I had been in the room, and ordered him to quit the house - I did not see the wine nor the towel in his basket then - his own labourer and a carpenter were at work in the same room - I don't know whether his own man could see the basket, for he was intoxicated also - I don't know whether the prisoner brought a towel there on the Tuesday before.</p>

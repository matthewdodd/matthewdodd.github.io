On Tuesday, the 25th of February, I delivered a work-box belonging to my daughter, and various parcels, containing linen, books, and other things, to James Wood, in. Lothbury, to take to Plaistow—they were the property of my brother—I am not living with my husband, he is in Wales—this is the box and other articles which I deliver<lb></lb>ed to Wood (<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 286.) On the 26th of February I was in Stratford, and saw the prisoners coming towards town—Ruffett had a bundle under his, arm, apparently in the shape of a box—I sus<lb></lb>pected and watched them—they went into Mr. Lamb's, in the Broad<lb></lb>way, Stratford, and came out in about a quarter of an hour, without the bundle—I immediately went up to them, and asked what they had done with the box they had had in their possession—they both said they had left it at Mr. Lamb's, who had advanced 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, and that they had found it in the New-road, going from Barking, a fortnight before—I asked if they had made inquiries about it—they said they had inquired all round Plaistow, and could find no owner for it—I took them back to Mr. Lamb's, found the box there, and took them into custody, on Walker was found a duplicate of some muslin and pillow-cases, pledged at Mr. Bressy's—I have not got the duplicate here, I gave it up after the second examination, but I have a receipt which they gave me for it—I got Walker to sign it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller at Stratford. The prisoners came to my house on Wednesday, February 26th, between one and two o'clock—they brought a work-box, and on asking them where they got it from, they said they found it on the New-road, leading to Barking, that a coach was on before, and they thought the box had dropped from that—I asked how long they had had it in their possession—they said nearly a fortnight—I asked if their friends knew they had found it—they said yes, and said they had been all over Plaistow to different parties to try to find out the owner for the box, but could not—I said I should not buy it of them, I thought I knew the party it belonged to—I said if they would call on Friday night, or the Saturday, after I had made necessary inquiries, I would tell them more on the subject—when they brought the box they wanted me to purchase it—I am sure they asked me to buy it—it was tied up with string, in brown paper, very carefully as if it was packed.</p>

On 20th June I saw a shadow of some one in the hall, and found one half of the inner-hall door open, and heard the front-door shut—I saw some one running across the road, and sent two boys after him—I do not know who the person was—I missed my master's coat, which was hanging up in the hall half an hour before—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am page to Mr. Sumner. On the morning of 20th June, I went out for two or three minutes, leaving the front door a little open—three or four minutes after that I saw the prisoner running in the road, with my master's coat on his back—I ran after him—he then ran faster—I missed him for a minute or two, and then saw him come out of the garden of Woodstock-cottage, without the coat—I stopped him, asked him what be had done with the coat—he said he knew nothing about it—I gave him into custody—we went back to the same garden, and found this coat on the grass—it is my master's.</p>

             . Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Andus. In Swan-Yard in the Strand . I miss'd the Things mention'd in the Indictment. On Monday there was an Advertisement, that the Things were stopp'd at one Mr Morris's, Headborough in Field-Lane . When I came there I found the Things. I know nothing of the Prisoner . [The Things were produced in Court , and Mr Andus swore to them as his Things.]</p>
               <p>Q. to Eliz. Sprigg. Are you a Lodger at Mr Andus's ?</p>
               <p>Sprigg . No, Sir, I was there as a Visitor .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any Thing?</p>
               <p>Sprigg. The Cloak and the Bonnet, they are mine.</p>

             , Constable. What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morris. The Prisoner at the Bar I had got a Warrant for, concerning some Scales and Things that were lost in the New Market. At almost twelve o'Clock on Sunday , the 28th of June there were three or four People came running, and said, there was the Man that you have a Warrant against. He was soon to sell the scarlet Cloak in our Neighbourhood; and they said they watch'd him into a Twopenny House in Chick-Lane. So I went directly and found him there. He had the Tea-Chest and Tablecloth before him. The Bonnet he had sold. There were three or four Women with him. I told him he might stay to drink out his Gin. He would have thrown the Bundle from him, but I prevented him. I told him I would take Care of the Bundle. I said you must go along with me, I have got a Warrant against you, so I had him before Justice Poulson; where he own'd he had sold the Cloak in Field-Lane for 2 s. He said it was near the Gullyhole , and I went there and found it; and the Woman brought it before the Justice.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he found this Bundle near Holborn-bars , and he open'd it, and pull'd the Cloak out, and offered it to every one as he came along; and some bid him 1 s. and when he came to this Woman in Field-Lane she gave him 2 s. for it. <rs id="t17470715-2-verdict9" type="verdictDescription">

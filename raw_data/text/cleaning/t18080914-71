I am just turned of thirteen; I saw Mr. Smith bring the trunk into my father's house into the bar; he asked my aunt if he might leave it there, and if it would be in the way; she said he might take it into the kitchen, and as they were going along I called to Mr. Smith to take it up into the club room, but he took it into the kitchen, sat it on the table and left it there, and said he would call for it in about two hours; a little before eight o'clock the prisoner and Mr. Lenty came in; they called for a pint of ale; my father served them; they sat drinking there till about twenty minutes past eight o'clock; Mr. Griffiths went out; before he returned I went up stairs to my aunt and remained there about ten minutes; my aunt and me both came down together and went into the kitchen and the trunk was gone; we asked Mr. Lenty and the prisoner, he had returned then, who had taken the trunk; they said three men had been in and had taken it away; I immediately informed my father and asked whether three men had been there.</p>

               <p>Q. On Sunday evening, the 24th. of July, was you with the prisoner - A. I was; it was mere accident; I met him at the corner of the court; I have known him some time; he asked me very kindly if I would accept of a glass of ale; we went back to the Three Tuns; it must be near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you sit in - A. I had been in the tap room; the room that we went in afterwards was the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any trunk there - A. Mr. Davis, who keeps the house, pointed out the trunk to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the trunk - A. It was in a separate box from where we were sitting, on a table.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner and you stay there - A. We drank three pints of ale, and the second pint Mr. Davis joined us.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you was there did the prisoner go out a short time - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the prisoner did not go out at all to your knowledge - A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. During the time you were sitting there, did any persons go into the kitchen - A. When we went in there was a person sitting where the trunk was, drinking a pint of porter, there were a great many people in the tap room, and a great many in the parlour, and there were a great many went out and in while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the trunk being missed - A. No; I do not remember any thing about the trunk being missed, I mentioned it first of all to Mr. Davis, and the prisoner mentioned it as we was going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the time that you told Mr. Davis of it had you observed any person come into the kitchen - A. There had been some, how many I cannot say, there were two or three that come in two or three times, I believe there were three came in at one time, they were sitting at the extremity of the same table where the box was.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you were there with the prisoner, do you think that it was possible for him to take the trunk away without your knowledge - A. It was not possible without being perceived.</p>
               <p>COURT. He could not take it away, you know, he did not go out you have said.</p>
               <p>JURY. Were you perfectly sober at the time - A. I was not perfectly sober, I had taken part of two sixpenny worths of brandy and and water some porter before I went in with the prisoner. I was a little forward.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you never saw any body take the trunk - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>JURY. I think you said before, that you told the landlord that you saw somebody take the trunk - A. I never understood that any body mentioned it to the landlord.</p>
               <p>COURT. The question was, whether you told him any person or number of persons took the trunk - did you or did you not tell the landlord that any number of persons took the trunk - A. I did tell him, to the best of my recollection, that two or three people came in and took the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Your answer to the very question before was, you said you never saw any body take the trunk - how came the landlord to point out the trunk to you and the prisoner - A. When we came in the landlord came home, and when we went in the kitchen he said we have got a trunk brought here.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went out you told him you saw three people take the trunk - A. There w then a man sitting drinking a pint of porter; there was one, two, or three, I am not certain which; I ld almost swear three; I told Mr. Davis, as we were going home, that three men took the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the sister came down stairs - A. I do not know, I do not recollect her going up nor coming down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the daughter going up - A. No, nor coming down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect their asking you about the trunk - A. No, they did not ask me about the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. You can be positive about that - A. They did not, but I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. If three men took it, how did they carry it out - A. One man took it out, and laid it across his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop him - A. ad no authority, I did not know it was right to stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there in the tap-room - A. Four or five.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober. - A. Yes. I mean to say that I had something to drink, but I was no ways disguised in liquor; I was walking with a friend, close by his side. The prisoner said something to me, but what I cannot say. She then turned instantly round to me, catched me round the waist, and as soon as she let go of me I suspected that she had robbed me; I put my hand in my pocket, I found my money was gone; I instantly said you have robbed me. I took the rest of my money out of my pocket, to see if it was gone; I found the money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How much. - A. Five half guineas, two seven shilling pieces, three shillings, two sixpences, one was a bad sixpence, a three-penny piece, and three pennyworth of halfpence, and a bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all in a purse. - A. No, they were not; the gold was in one pocket, and the halfpence in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to take from both pockets. - A. She did. I immediately laid hold of her and charged her with robbing of me; I catched hold of her hands, because I thought she would make away with it. The constable, when I called watch, he catched hold of the other hand; we took her to the watchhouse; I asked her whether she had robbed me, the said she had not; they took the pocket from her side and found the half guineas, the seven shilling pieces, the three pennyworth of halfpence, and the bill in the pocket; she said it was hers.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not picked her up at all - A. I will be upon my oath I had not; I do not recollect changing a word with her till I charged her with the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you felt her hand in your pocket, and so strong was the impression, that you put your hand into your pocket immediately. - A. I did put my hand into my pocket immediately.</p>

            . I am a patrol of the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On this gentleman coming down Holborn, I heard a cry of Watch, I made way over to him as fast as I could; he said the girl had robbed him of upwards of seven pounds; he gave her in my charge. I took her by one hand and the gentleman by the other. When we came to Red-lion-street she was unwilling to go any further; she attempted to put her hand into her pocket, I heard the money rattle, I supposed she wanted to throw the money away. I took her hand out of her pocket, the constable of the night searched her at the watchhouse; the constable found the money in her pocket, she pulled off her pocket herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he described the money before. - A. He described that it was upwards of seven pounds, all in half guineas and seven shilling pieces; he could not tell exactly what it was till he had looked over his pockets.</p>

            . Q. You were constable of the night. - A. Yes; this money (producing it) I took out of the woman's pocket, five half guineas, two seven shilling pieces, and a bill for two pounds odd, two sixpences, a three-penny piece, and three pennyworth of half pence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my bill, it is a bill of parcels for two hams I bought on that day, I can swear to it; likewise one shilling; the three penny piece I had in my pocket near a twelvemonth; all the money I know very well. I can swear to a remarkable piece, with RB upon it, and likewise a bent half guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday night I met this gentleman and another gentleman, he asked me if I could take him home to my lodgings, I told him I could not; after possession was accomplished I asked him to make me a compliment, he said he had no money, but he would see me the evening following, and then he would make me a compliment; I was greatly surprised at his not offering me a compliment; as I went from him I saw a piece of paper laying on the ground, I picked it up at the top of the street, he came up to me and said he had lost his money; I told him I had no money of his, he said he had no money; he said I had, and if I did not give it up he would take me to the watchhouse; I told him I was willing to go, for what money I had I would shew to the constable of the night. I pulled off my pocket, and gave it to the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Jury. We would wish to ask him whether his friend was with him the whole of the time. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>How was the shop secured? - The shop is nineteen feet from the ground, it is open in front, there is no door to it, it stands upon a wall in a yard, which is fastened with gates.</p>
               <p>Then any body that gets into the yard may get into the shop? - Yes, there is a lower shop in which we keep deals, and there is a step-ladder which goes from the lower shop through a place left open in the cieling into the upper shop; my master's house stands in the yard.</p>
               <p>After they are in the yard, they can go into the shop without opening either door or window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you miss your tools? - The next morning; my tool-chest was broke open and some of my tools gone, I found a window on that side the shop that looks into the garden open, and a pane of glass broke.</p>
               <p>Was it a sash? - No, a casement.</p>
               <p>Where did it look into? - Into a Mr. Salter's garden.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether that window was shut down when you left the shop? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the pane of glass was not broke before? - Yes, I am; I saw the impression of a ladder's foot on the ground under the window; I desired the people the garden belonged to, to let me examine it, which they did; I traced a man's foot to a wall eight or nine feet high on the further side of the garden, it is a wall that runs between two gardens, on the other side of that wall I traced the foot again across the garden to another wall next the street, which is about ten feet high on the inside, and about six on the outside, there I found the ladder lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>What length is the ladder? - Seventeen feet four inches; on the inside of the wall next the street, there was an impression of a man's foot six inches deep where he had jumped over, it was wet weather and the ground was soft, and that foot I traced to the work shop and back again; I suspected the prisoner, and enquired where he worked, but I could not learn; on the 20th of May, I went to Mr. Childs's, where the prisoner lodged, and there I found part of my property, I found a plane and square at the building where the prisoner was at work at Knightsbridge; I got a constable and took the prisoner into custody, he said he had bought the tools.</p>

               <p>And afterwards that he hoped to convict him, and get the 40 l. reward? - Yes.</p>

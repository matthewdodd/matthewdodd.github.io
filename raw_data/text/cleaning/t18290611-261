               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not let me the house for 50l. a year, on an agreement for fourteen years? A. You were to have an agreement, if you laid out 100l., but were not to have it till you did that; I have no security for the rent whatever - I sent to the person, he referred to, but they have not come forward; I am sorry to say a respectable tradesman has deceived me; he has not fitted up either of the houses, he has destroyed every thing, and took every thing away - every thing was in proper order when he took the houses.</p>

            . I am an assistant to Mr. Underhill, a glass-cutter; he purchases a great many old materials, having a great many houses - I went to No. 31, Cow-cross the beginning of April; I think it was for four doors, which my master had purchased - I saw the prisoner; I said, I had come for the four cupboard doors - I went afterwards, and brought away a glass front and two sashes; the prisoner delivered them to me, and I gave him the money - I gave 24s. for the front; I had seen him when he came to ask my master if he wanted to purchase some old things from a house he was repairing, and which he had got the lease of; my master did not buy any lead of him, that I know of - the rooms were not repaired; there was no front to the shop - it was a tripe-shop apparently; I believe that front came from came from one of the shops - it was brought into the passage, and not replaced with another; some of the doors are here, this is the best of them - I do not know what it is worth, it may be worth 4s.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner at Somers'-town, the day he absconded from the shop; I think it was the latter part of April - I found him in a little back room, and coming along I asked him what he had done with the fixtures of the two houses; he said the shop front he had sent to Vauxhall to be glazed, and the doors he had never seen.</p>
               <p>MRS. MORRIS. These are my doors and sashes; he said he was going to keep a tripe-shop - he was to make a shed and other things; it will coat me more than 100l. to replace the articles that are gone - he was to live in one of the houses; there were no repairs going on.</p>

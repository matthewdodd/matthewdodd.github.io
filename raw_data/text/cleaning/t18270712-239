            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 2d of May, between four and five o'clock, I and Fowler were in <placeName id="t18270712-239-crimeloc1308">Whitechapel</placeName>

Fowler secured another, and called Stop thief! the other was then taken.</p>

            . I was with Keys, and saw the three prisoners walking behind the prosecutor; they made several attempts - we followed them, and concealed our red waistcoats as well as we could; just opposite Aldgate church Barnett went on, then turned, and met the prosecutor; the other two were just behind - they closed altogether, and I saw them hustle Mr. Elkin; I saw Moses put his coat up, and then put something into his own breast - we both ran across the road, and Moses dropped the pocket-book, which Keys took up, and secured him: I took Barnett, and called Stop thief! after Isaacs, who was taken in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it true that Barnett did not touch the prosecutor? A. I saw him touch him - he closed upon him; my brother officer was with me, but might not see it.</p>
               <p>ALFRED BENJAMIN ELKIN. I was near Aldgate church, and had a pocket-book in my left side pocket; I did not observe any of the prisoners near me. The officers produced my book; I did not know it was taken.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM RILEY. I was at Aldgate, heard a cry of Stop thief! and took Isaacs.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>ISAACS' Defence. I was coming from the Borough, and Riley took me.</p>
               <p>MOSES' Defence. There was a mob - I got off the pavement, and the officer took hold of me and said,"Drop it;" I said, "What do you mean?" he took this book up.</p>
               <p>BARNETT'S Defence. I turned to look at the clock, and he took hold of me.</p>

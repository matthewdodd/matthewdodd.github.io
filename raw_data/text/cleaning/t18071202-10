On the 16th of November, about half past seven o'clock, I was sitting in the parlour at the back of the shop, a boy that shuts up our shop came to enquire whether he should shut up the shop; hearing a noise I went into the shop. On getting up I observed James Anderson in the middle of the shop;

Yes, I was in the parlour with her, I had seen this spencer and part of a pelisse hanging up in the shop not many minutes before. I followed my sister upon hearing the noise; Cost said the prisoner was robbing the shop; our boy was coming in to shut up the shop, he only lives over the way; he saw him through the window before he came in.

            . Last Monday fortnight, I was going to shut up Miss Heim's shop; I found the shop door half open; I saw the prisoner on the left hand of me, in the shop, as I was at the door, he had got a spencer in his left hand, and part of a pelisse in his right hand; he heard me make a noise with the latch of the door; he chucked the spencer, and part of the pelisse on the ground, he left the other half unhooked; he came to the door, and asked me to let him out; I pushed him in, and shut the door. Miss Heims came in the shop, then he downed upon his knees, and asked them to forgive him; they sent for a constable, he was taken in custody. I did not see him go into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any remarks upon the panes of the window in the shop. - A. Yes, there was a piece cut out of the window, big enough for his hand to go through.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have got in the shop by the door to have got hold of this spencer. - A. Yes, they were in the middle of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. But by putting his hand into this pane of glass, could be reach the door to unlatch it. - A. No, it was not near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found the door a-jar when you went in. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GREGORY. I searched the prisoner at the watchhouse; I found nothing about him; I went the next morning early, I examined the windows, I found a pane of glass taken out; there were nothing but some ribbons near it; by what the ladies informed me, there was nothing taken out. I said to the prisoner you little rogue, how came you to have cut the window in the manner you have done; he replied, another did that; he said he was a poor lad, he <rs id="t18071202-10-deflabel63" type="occupation">swept chimneys</rs>

I have got the spencer and the pelisse.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Can you take upon you to say, before you heard the noise of your boy coming in, whether your shop door was shut too. - A. It had been shut too the whole of the evening; there had nobody been in before for half an hour; we always shut our shop door; the shop woman had not left the shop five minutes.</p>

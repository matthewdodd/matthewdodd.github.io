This lard was taken from Fishmongers's-hall wharf, under the hall—on the 17th of March, I saw the prisoner coming out of the side door of the wharf, be<lb></lb>tween three and four o'clock—he appeared to have a great bulk in his pocket—one of the men who look after the butter was in she road with me—I stopped the prisoner, and brought him down on the wharf, where he was searched, and two bladders of lard, weighing, 16<hi rend="italic">lbs</hi>., taken out of his pocket.</p>

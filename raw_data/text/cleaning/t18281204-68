            . I live in Fenchurch-street. On the 10th of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was passing through a crowd at the corner of <placeName id="t18281204-68-crimeloc351">Queen-street</placeName>

            . I took the prisoners to the watch-house, and left them there; I had not seen them near Queen-street - I did not look into the hole to see if any body else was there, but afterwards thought I had not searched them properly, and returned in ten or fifteen minutes; I found them both there - there was nobody else there: immediately I opened the lock-up room, Hall jumped down from an iron railing, and sat down by the side of Curtis - I perceived that Hall had a different handkerchief on to that he had before; I said, "Pine, he has got a different handkerchief on, look up at the railing for his handkerchief;" I took the prisoners out of the place, and Pine produced a handkerchief, with a gold watch, seal, and chain, which Mr. Todd claimed on the 11th, not the 14th - I did not show it to the prisoners till they got to the Compter; they then said it did not belong to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CURTIS. Q.When we were put into the place, was there not a young man there? A. Not to my knowledge; there was nobody there when I returned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HALL. I did not jump from the window - we were both standing up instead of Curtis sitting down. Witness. I asked him what he wanted up there.</p>

            . I returned to the watch-house with Reardon in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; as we opened the door we saw Hall had a different handkerchief on - I found the very handkerchief he had on his neck before on the floor, and up at the place he dropped from, I found this watch, on the iron grating.</p>

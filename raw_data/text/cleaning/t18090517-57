When the people left work, as gate-keeper, my duty called me to run them down; I rubbed the prisoner down, and under his left arm I felt something; I said to him, partner, what have you got here; he said nothing; I opened his clothes and found two books; I turned him over to my brother officer, he took him to the guard room and searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. They were under the care of the London dock company, and laying within their walls - A. Yes; they were laying facing No 2, on the London dock quay; they had been weighed that day for the duties, and were laying there for the person to whom they belonged, under the care of the dock company.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Can you say that you saw the two books in question until they were taken from the prisoner - A. No, I did not. There was a case of books laying on the quay of this description.</p>

There was a case of books open on the Quay that day for the purpose of weighing them for the customs; they were imported; I took the prisoner to the Thames police. On the Friday I took the books to Mr. Boosey; I saw the same case in his shop; it was marked T. B. and the prisoner acknowledged that he had taken the sugar, it was a small quantity.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. That case was marked T. B. - did it not belong to Mr. Boosey - A. Mr. Boosey took it into his possession; he would not have taken it in if it did not belong to him; he expected to import the whole of the case: but some of the books were missing from the case.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BRADLEY. Q. You are a labourer in the London docks - A. Yes, and so was the prisoner. On the 4th of May, he and I were working at the same scale where every thing is weighed that were landed; I was at the landing of the case of books out of the ship, called the Spanish Patriot; it was opened for the purpose of being weighed; there was paper between every tier of books.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found these books in some waste paper; I put them in my bosom; I thought them of little or no value, and when I came to the gate the officer stopped me; I had them in my bosom.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

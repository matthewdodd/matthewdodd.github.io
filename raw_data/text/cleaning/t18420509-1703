                  </hi>. I am servant to Messrs. William and Albert Dunk, hop-fac<lb></lb>tors and warehousemen, in Compter-street, Borough. Previous to the 26th of March they had ten pockets of bops—on the evening of that day they were missed—previous to missing them we had taken these samplet—in consequence of the loss we gave directions to have them advertised—the pockets had the Excise marks on them—four of them were marked "Richard Stillman," fire were marked "Thomas Haward Peasmark," and one "Thomas Back Westwood, East-end, 1841"—those pockets had the Excise weight on them—ten pockets of hops have since been pro<lb></lb>duced to me by the police—I believe the hops contained in those tea pockets to be the very hops we lost—they have been weighed, and there is 29lbs. weight difference in the ten pockets—the Excise weight on the ten pockets we lost was "15cwt. 2qrs. 22lbs.," and the weight of those produced to me by the policeman was 15cwt. 3qrs. 22lbs., which is above</p>

               <p>the Excise weight marked on the pockets—the Excise weight on Pye's pockets was much heavier than on those we lost—nine of the pockets pro<lb></lb>duced by the police were marked "William Pye, Cuxton, Kent, 1841," and the other, "L. Starn, of Leigh, Kent, 1841"—the hops bear no resem<lb></lb>blance to Pye's or Starn's.</p>

               <p>Sale too—Sale said, "Harris, will you go?"—I said, "Yes"—Sale went with me, and harnessed the horse—I then went with him to Burrow's—mews—Sale drove the van, and I staid behind to take some ropes, as I did not know what it was I was going to take—I then took ten pockets of hops from the loft in Burrows—mews—neither of the prisoners assisted in the removal of them—as I was starting Ginbey came up and told me to go the water—he said, "I am almost afraid it is too late," and asked me whether I could put them any where for the night—I said there was the Running Horse, in Blackfriars-road, but that was not approved of—T afterwards went over Blackfriars-bridge to the corner of Faringdon-street—he then told me to drive to Old-street—road—I went there and he met me there again—he said he should run them in there, it was too late to go further—it was a livery—stable yard, the sign of the Leaping Bar—I took the horse out—he asked me whether I should take the horse home—I said "Yes," at first—he said, "Put him in, and give him a feed of corn," so I ran the; horse in, and agreed to meet him next morning—I was to meet him a quarter or twenty minutes before seven o'clock, which I did—I put the horse to—I then went with the hops to Mr. Bowden's brewhouse—I untied the ropes by Ginbey's direction—while doing that, he spoke to me—I did not hear what he said at first—he told me to pull in, and say I came from the Black<lb></lb>friars—road, and then he suddenly went away and left me—I did not see any body approaching at the time he went away—no person came up imme<lb></lb>diately after to speak to me, not for half or three quarters of an hour—I saw the policeman in about ten minutes, but I was not aware he was a policeman when I first saw him—he was in plain clothes—he took me into custody, with the cart and hops, and locked me up for eight days.</p>

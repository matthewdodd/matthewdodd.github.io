                  </hi>. I am a sailor. I came home about three weeks ago, and am residing at No.19, Providence-street. On Saturday eight, the 3rd September, at ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner Boulton in the King William public-house—she asked me to treat her with a drop of gin, and so I did—I paid for it, and changed a sovereign there—I received the change from the master of the house, and she took two half-crowns out of my hand—I did not give her permission—I asked her to give it to me again—she said, "I won't giver it you again, you come and sleep with me, "—I said, "I won't sleep with nobody"—then she ran away from me—I had known her before, she lived in New Gravel-lane—I went there at half-past ten o'clock the same night—I knocked at the door, and found Web<lb></lb>ber—her house is about twenty fathoms from where I was drinking—Webber opened the door—I asked where Ann was—she said, "She is not in the house"—it was raining, and I sat down in the chair, and just as I was sleeping, Webber said, "Why do you sleep in this way? You had bet<lb></lb>ter go up stairs and lie down on the bed"—I said, "Well, when she comes into the house you call me"—I went up stairs and laid down—I took my jacket, handkerchief, and hat off, and put on the chair, and my waistcoat and watch under my pillow—there was ten sovereigns in gold in a small bag in my waistcoat pocket, and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some small coppers in the other waistcoat<lb></lb>pocket—she took away the last copper—I fell asleep, and awoke at two o'clock in the morning—I heard the watchman <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out, and knocked at the door because I could not open it myself—Webber came up and opened the door—I asked her what time it was—she said, "I think it is two or three o'clock in the morning"—I said, "Well, now I will see what o'clock in is"—she said, "Last night your two shipmates came up stairs to you, and took away your watch and money"—I said, "What business had you to let them come to take my watch and money? that won't do; I suppose you took it to take care of it; if you give it to me back again, I will make you a good present"—she said afterwards, "If you don't <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi> that word I will give you something"—I went to the house of my companions, and returned, and told her my shipmates had never been near—she said, "Yes, two of your shipmates came up stairs, and took your watch and money; and when he came down he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a present"—I said, "I won't do; that is not true; give me my watch and purse, and I will give you a present"—the policeman heard a noise—he came and said "What is this?"—I told him what I accused her of—he overhauled all the house, to see if he could find any thing—she took up a knife, and said, "If you don't <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi> that word, I will run you through and though"—the policeman found some of the property under the floor.</p>

On Sunday morning the 4th of September, I went to this house, and there found the prosecutor and Webber—he said to her, "You give me you property, and I will make you a handsome present"—I turned back and said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "A mere nothing; I only want to get my property"—I said, "Tell me the truth"—he said, "I have been robbed of my watch and money"—I searched the upper part of the house, and when I came down she took up a knife and was going to stab him—I ran between them, and took her out to a place in Pennington-street, where she said the shipmates lived—when she saw the man there, she said that was not the man—I locked the house door when I went, and took the key with me—I then returned to her house, and under the floor I found a dirty cloth, and three sovereigns in it, under about a foot of dust—there had been a board fresh broken up—I went again on the Tursday following, and found this card concealed in some foreign grain that was over the first-place—I shook it,</p>

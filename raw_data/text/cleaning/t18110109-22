            . On Sunday, the 30th of December, at about eleven at night, I was at the end of Castle street, in the <placeName id="t18110109-22-crimeloc127">City-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18110109-22-crimeloc127" type="placeName" value="City-road"></interp>

               <p>Q. Could you distinguish it was one of the three men that gave you the blow - A. Yes, it was one of the three men; that blow was given at the same instant the person took the seal; or perhaps a few seconds after, it was not before. After I perceived it I turned round, and then I had the blow, just as the other was running. I then discovered that they had robbed me. I immediately pursued the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man that had taken the seal, key, and ribbon - A. Yes, he ran away and I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man that gave you the blow - A. I did not see him. I followed the man that took the seal and key towards Finsbury-square to Providence-row, I kept him in sight all the way, at the lower end of Providence-row, he struck against a post and fell, he immediately got up again, and ran across Wilson-street, I did not catch him. Crossing Wilson-street he fell again, and I collared him; I kept my hold of him; several watchman came up, I gave him in charge of two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you kept the man in sight all the time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the man that you gave in charge was the same man that had taken your seal and key - A. I am positive of it. It was a fine clear frosty night. I requested two of the watchmen that were there to look after the seal; I was certain he had not dropped it before he came there; it was a clear night, I could have seen it. It was brought to me the next day. I went to the watchhouse with the prisoner Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was the prisoner Cox that you so secured - A. Yes, he was searched at the watchhouse, the seal and key was not found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice at all of the man who snatched at you seal and key at the time that he did it - A. I took notice of him particularly; I know his person; I could not perceive his face; I kept him in sight, and took him to the watchhouse; I am certain Cox is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the man that gave you the blow - A. No. I observed three together, I believe Botwright to be one of the three.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not observed him particularly - A. No.</p>

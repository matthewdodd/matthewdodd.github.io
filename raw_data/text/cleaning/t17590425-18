               <p>Q. What bundle was it?</p>
               <p>Parnell. It was a bundle of stockings, seven pair; I know them to be mine. Produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. What pass'd before the Alderman?</p>
               <p>Parnell. He said there was his play fellow with him, and it was he that took them. At first he said, he was going along and kicked the stockings with his foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at last own to the taking the bundle?</p>
               <p>Parnell. No, he entirely denied it; he has altered his dress now, he was in a red coat; I went to New-Prison to him in order to relieve him, believing him to be very poor, but he behaved so ill that I would not relieve him.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I am fifteen years of age to-day: on the first of March I was standing on the shop stool putting some goods in our bays-case; I saw a person go out of the shop in a red coat; I ran out into the street and saw the prisoner at the bar and another person, both dressed in red coats; they were shuffling together; I immediately seized the prisoner, and instantly a bundle dropp'd to the ground from between them; I took the prisoner by the collar and brought him back into the shop as well as I could; the other boy ran over the way imediately into Skinners-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any assistance?</p>
               <p>Cooper. No, none, only a Stone-Mason that lives in Kingsland-Road; he took up the bundle and brought it into the shop after me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distance from your shop door was it that you took hold of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cooper. To the best of my knowledge it was about two or three posts from the door, that is about eight or nine yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bundle?</p>
               <p>Cooper. These are girls pink hose.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property are they?</p>
               <p>Cooper. They are my master's; I am certain of it, because here is my own hand-writing on the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge the prisoner with taking that bundle of stockings ?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I did: he said he knew nothing of the bundle, nor nothing of the boy that ran away; then he said, he felt the bundle at his back; and afterwards he said, he kicked it with his foot as he was going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before the Alderman?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I was: he denied it there; he said his name was Nelson when he was in our shop, and before the Alderman he said his name was Bates.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I did not take the stockings, nor knew of them any more than this piece of wood. I am very willing to go on board one of his Majesty's ships again; I was on board a Collier, and had taken 35 s. and was going on board again to go to the northward.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cooper. Can you say that the prisoner took the stockings out of your shop?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I am certain that it was either the prisoner, or the other boy that ran away.</p>

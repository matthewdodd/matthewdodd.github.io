            . I am assistant at Hatton-garden. On the 6th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I and the witnesses were in the <placeName id="t18200112-93-crimeloc521">Strand</placeName>

I saw Brett take a handkerchief half out of the gentleman's pocket; the gentleman turned round, and they fell back, then followed him as far as Somerset House. I there saw Brett forward, and the other two covering him, and saw him take the handkerchief out, and give it to Woodcock; I was on the opposite side - the gentleman did not perceive it - all three separated. I went and told the gentleman, and he missed his handkerchief; Thompson shewed it to him, and he claimed it. He said he was a solicitor in the country and could not attend - he would not give us his name or direction.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Read, and saw the prisoners and another following the gentleman; I sent Read forward and kept back myself, supposing they would know me. Before they got to Somerset House I saw Brett close on the gentleman, and the other two covering him - I could not see what he did. Immediately after that Woodcock ran towards me in the middle of the road, fell down and dropped it; the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120045"></xptr>came back and claimed it, but would not give his name - they appeared clumsy at the business.</p>

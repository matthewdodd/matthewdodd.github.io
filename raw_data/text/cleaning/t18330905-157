               <p>JOSEPH HAYWARD I live in Milton-street, Cripplegate. On the 4th of August, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I had been to Mile End-road, and was coming home - I had got through <placeName id="t18330905-157-crimeloc883">Osborne-street</placeName>

               <p>Simmonds. Q. Are are sure it was me that was there, and ran away? A. I am positive it was you; on Monday morning, when the policeman fetched me to see him, he acknowledged to my face that it was him.</p>
               <p>JOHN MOUNCEY. I live at No. 17, Rose-lane, Spitalfields. I was coming down Osborne-street, near Brick-lane, about half-past ten o'clock - I went down Wentworth-street, and saw Simmonds running down the street, with his coat on, and as I went towards my residence, I saw him standing against Mr. Sheen's door, with his coat off - that was about five minutes after.</p>
               <p>Simmonds. Q. Was I not alone? A. I saw nobody with him; I did not see Seymour at all.</p>

             re-examined. I saw them running in Wentworth-street; both ran together across Brick-lane, to Wentworth-street, and on to the alley, which is in Wentworth-street, and leads into Whitechapel - it was possible for a person to see one, and not the other; the one which had the watch got into the alley first.</p>

I was coming down Wentworth-street, with Mr. Becket, and saw Seymour run down Wentworth-street from Brick-lane, and down Angel-alley, and in a minute or two after, I saw Simmonds run straight down the street - he had his coat on then, and returned just by Angel-alley in a minute or two afterwards with his coat off - he said to five or six others, who were together,"It is a fine yellow-man"; he said so as he came running in front of us; there were five or six of us together coming home; he then went back, and went into Mr. Sheen's, which was the house he had gone into before; he came out again directly afterwards, and Seymour was against the door; as we went by they went off together, down towards Petticoat-lane - I met Grant, the policeman, and told him what had become of them; he went down towards Rose-lane; I stood at the corner of Rose-lane; Simmonds came back from Petticoat-lane - Cotton took him - Seymour came right facing us, and said, it was a fine yellow-man, and then he turned back, I am quite certain of them both; I was close to a gas-light.</p>
               <p>Seymour. I wish to ask Hayward a question; When I was at Worship-street, the magistrate asked him if Simmonds had his coat off or on, when the robbery was committed, and he said he had it off two or three times over.</p>

I was on duty and have known the prisoners some time - I saw them together about three-quarter's of an hour before the robbery - I afterwards went to the corner of Wentworth-street, and stood there about five minutes, and Simmonds came up with his coat off - I said, I must trouble him to go with me again, he said, "It is Sunday night, Cotton, this seems a regular thing," I said, "You know what it is for, you know it is for a watch," he said, "I did not have the watch;" I took him to the station-house - no watch was to be found.</p>
               <p>Simmonds's Defence. I know nothing about it, Cotton has got my money - I used to sell fruit in the street, and the 4s. was the remainder of my market money - both the policemen know me, and never knew me do wrong - they never saw me do harm, if you will ask them about it.</p>
               <p>Seymour's Defence. I was in Bishopsgate-street at the time, at home with my master - I used to travel with him to sell braces and things - he bid me good night - I thought I would go home and go to bed, and a policeman caught hold of me and said he wanted me.</p>

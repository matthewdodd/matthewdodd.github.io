On the 17th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in, and called for a pint of beer, and asked for a pen and ink. Redford and Holt went out and came in again; they said something about some bread, I said I sold it, they asked for some. I went to the cupboard for it, and while I turned my back they went out; they had hardly drank any beer- they did not return. In about five minutes I missed the dial, which hung up in the box where they were. Between nine and ten o'clock Jackson came in, and told me to attend at the office. I am in care of the house for Green and Co. until it is let.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was on duty on the 17th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in Church-lane, St. George's. The prisoner, Redford, passed me with something under his arm, wrapped up; I asked what he had there? he made no answer, but walked on- I followed, and asked him again - He said it was a Dutch clock, which he brought from over the water, from West-square, Blackfriar's-road, and he was going to take it to his sister's, in Kingsland-road. I asked who it belonged to? he said to his mother, that he knew the maker very well, there were two brothers of them, and he went to school with them, and their names were Baggs. I took him into custody; there was a boy before him, without a coat, and a man behind him; the man followed us to the watch-house; I cannot say whether it was Wilks, I think Holt is the boy.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. George's. On the 17th of November the prisoner, Redford, was brought to the watch-house with the dial- I questioned him about it; at last he said it was of no use to tell a falsehood about it- that he had been innocently led into it, and that it came from a house in the Minories. He then said the two lads that were with him gave it to him to carry; that they went into a public-house with him. He went out for a sheet of paper to write a letter for them, on his return he met them outside with the dial, and told him to come along, he must not go in any more- in conequence of which I apprehended Holt and Wilks the next morning; the dial was wrapped up in Holt's great-coat. When I took

             I told him there was his coat; he said it was his coat, but he had lent to his brother to go into the country with. I found two spoons, a chisel, and a new lock and key on him. I also found a small iron chisel, a knife, and a quantity of wire on Wilks. I told him he had come out of his way. He said he had to call at Wapping.</p>

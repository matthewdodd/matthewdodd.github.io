                  </hi> I am a solicitor, in King's-road, Chelsea. I left town with my wife and family, on 7th Aug.—I returned in two of three days, and left again on 4th Sept., leaving my servant, Jane West, in charge of the house, and Dignam, my clerk, in charge of my offices—I returned on the 7th and in consequence of a communication from Mr. Kayes, my articled clerk, I examined my premises, and found a drawer, in which I occasionally kept cash, broken open; also my wife's wardrobe, and the toilet-glass drawer—a great quantity of thing were stolen—I had left a good watch-guard chain lying on a shelf in the wardrobe—I do not think it was covered up—I found that Dignam had absconded—he was subsequently taken into custody and prosecuted—I withdrew from that charge, and he was sent to the Sessions on another—whilst he was in prison I received a written communication from him, through the Governor, in consequence of which I had the prisoner and two other persons taken into custody—this is my gold guard-chain—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know it from the swivel being broken, which was the cause of its being put away.</p>

                  </hi> I was servant to Mr. Archbutt—he left town on 4th Sept—I had known the prisoner about a month or six weeks previously. On Sun<lb></lb>day evening, 5th Sept., he came to the house about six o'clock, and I went out with him, leaving Dignam in charge of the house—I came back before nine—I did not discover that any robbery had taken place until the Monday morning—I did not know what things were in the wardrobe.</p>

                  </hi> I was clerk to Mr. Archbutt. I took charge of the house on Sunday, the 5th Sept.—I went there about six o'clock in the evening—I had previously made an arrangement with Ensor—he told me that he was going to meet some friends down at Westminster, and asked if I would ac<lb></lb>company him—I said "Yes," and went with him to the White Horse—I saw his friends there—Ensor proposed that they should come to Mr. Archbutt's house on the next Sunday; that I should come and take care of the house, and he would take the servant out; and while she was gone, they were to</p>

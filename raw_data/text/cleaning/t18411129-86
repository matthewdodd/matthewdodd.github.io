                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Hoxton Old Town, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. The prisoner Barnes was in my ser<lb></lb>vice about four months, as a baker, and left about the 22nd of September—on the 29th of October I went to bed about five minutes before eleven—I locked the front door, and my boy fastened the back door—I did not see him do it—next morning, about half-past five, I came down into my parlour, at the back of the shop, where I kept a little spaniel bitch—I did not see her there—I went into the shop, and up stairs—I then went to the back door, and found the bar down, the door open, and the cellar door open—I went backwards, and found a square door at the back of the bakehouse, over the oven, open, and a place where they could get over the tiles the back way—there is a cellar-flap in the street, which is kept down by its own weight—the doors I found open I did not see fastened—my boy was directed to fasten them—I missed a frock coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 29th of October I met the prisoner Barnes at the corner of King's-row, Hoxton—He asked me where the dogs were kept—I said, <hi rend="italic">Little Frisky</hi> was kept down stairs, and the other up stairs, in the back room—I met him again on the Saturday following—he said, "You have lost <hi rend="italic">Little Frisky</hi>,—have you not?"—I said, Yes—he asked me if any of the pups were gone—I said, No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Barnes</hi>. I met him on the Friday as the robbery was committed on the Friday night—I said, "Your master has drawn his batch soon to-day"—he said, Yes—I said, "He does not lay in bed so late now as when I was with him"—he said, "No, he gets up sooner," and that was all that passed—on Saturday I met him again—I said, "Your master has lost a spaniel dog, has he not?"—he said, Yes—I asked who had it—he said, "A person in the Land of Promise"—I said, "Did he give a sovereign to have it back again?"—he said, Yes—I said, "I saw bills in the windows about it," and knowing the name, I thought it was his, and that was all that passed. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He did not tell me he had seen bills in the win<lb></lb>dows—there were bills in the windows—my master had given 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to have it back, but Barnes did not say he had heard that—I believe a Mrs. Brown had it, in the Land of Promise—he had received it back before the rob<lb></lb>bery, and it was stolen again on the night of the robbery—it has not been recovered since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Barnes</hi>. I never told him any thing at all about being guilty—he asked me some questions, and I said anybody could go and break into Mr. Hile' as house at night, the flap was unfastened, and anybody could go and take it away and he not hear them, as he sleeps so sound—I never told him I had done it, but that anybody might do it—I never told him that I sold the bitch for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or any thing about the coat.</p>

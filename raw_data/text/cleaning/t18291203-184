               <p>JAMES JOSLER. I am a Bow-street patrol. On Wednesday evening, about eight o'clock, I was at Stoke Newington, and met Howsell with a cheese tied up in this apron, under his arm - I asked what he had got; he said a Gloucestester cheese, and he had brought it from up above; I asked the name of the place - he said he got it of a man with a donkey, for threepairs of shoes; I asked the value of the shoes - he said 5s. 6d. a pair; I said he must go to the watch-house.</p>

            . We lost this cheese and four Dutch cheeses on Wednesday evening, the 25th of November; I know nothing of the prisoners, and did not miss the cheeses till the officer brought them - I can swear to this Gloucester cheese, and one of the Dutch ones.</p>
               <p>JOHN CALLOW. I am a watchman. I was in Kingsland-road - I saw Jones and another coming along, about half-past seven o'clock on the Wednesday evening - I asked Jones what he had got; he said Nothing: I said, "You have?" he then said his companion gave it him, and gave him 1s. for carrying it, and his companion had got two more; I gave Jones in charge, and pursued the other man- he threw down these two cheeses and this pair of shoes; he got away, and I took the property - this cheese I found on Jones.</p>

               <p>Howsell's Defence. I was going to seek for work, and had three pairs of shoes; I met a man with a donkey, who had this cheese and several others with him - I asked if he would buy a pair of shoes; he said he had no money, but if I liked he would have the shoes for this cheese.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence. I was coming along, and saw a man with these cheeses - he asked where I came from; I said Manchester, and I was a weaver - he asked me to carry this cheese, and said he would give me 1s. and something to drink; when the watchman came I said I had the cheese of that gentleman - he could not see him; I said, "That is he;" he told me to shout after him - I did so, and he pursued him.</p>

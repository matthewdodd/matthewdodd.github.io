He clapped his hand upon my shoulder, intending to knock me down, but I recovered myself - he did not strike me - it was a violent push. He made a snatch at my watch; I had my hand on my fob, and kept my watch - the swivel broke, and he got off with the chain - the swivel broke while I was laying hold of the watch. He ran off, I followed him, his companion, followed me. I pursued the prisoner down a dark lane, and when he got into the street he turned about and met me. He unbuttoned his waistcoat, and told me to search him; he then said if I would let go he would go where I pleased. I let go; he started off, and I followed him - he got out of my sight a few minutes. A mob gathered round; he came up, and I laid hold of him - I am sure he is the man.</p>

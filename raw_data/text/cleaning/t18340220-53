I was in Aldgate about eleven o'clock, on the 3rd of February, and saw the prisoner and two others walking together - one of them, who has escaped, took the prosecutor's handkerchief out of his pocket with his hand - I saw him put his hand into the pocket, and take the handkerchief out, and hand it to the prisoner, who made use of it, and put it in his pocket - I collared him, touched the gentleman on the shoulder, and told him of it - I collared the prisoner on one side and he on the other, and pushed him into a shop - he dropped the handkerchief - I asked a child to pick it up, which the child did, and gave it to the policeman or the prosecutor - I am certain I saw him drop it - I never lost sight of him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along about half-past two o'clock the same day, and this man came and seized me by the collar, he tapped the gentleman on the shoulder, and said, "You have got his handkerchief" - the gentleman took me into a grocer's shop, and he said, "Search him, he has got your handkerchief about him," and a little boy brought it into the shop and gave it to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>JOHN SALTMARSH. I am quite certain I saw him drop it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is false about my using the handkerchief - I did not have it about me at all, and do not know who took it.</p>

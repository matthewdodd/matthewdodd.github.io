On the 26th of August, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in Lant-fields, Beth<lb></lb>nal-green, turning out of Dog-row into Northampton-street—he crossed the fields—he made a stop when he got under the railway arch, and then went on to Three Colt-lane, and into Abingdon-street—he then turned back again, and I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, "A box"—I asked what box, he said, "A cash-box"—one was a tin box, and two wooden boxes—I asked where he got it—he said "From a pub<lb></lb>lic-house, but could not tell me the name or sign—he said some man left them for him to fetch, and the man was gone into the country—he said he was going to take them to No. 32, Three Colt-lane—the boxes contained tools—there is no No. 32 in Three Colt-lane—I found a key, a pair of scales, a knife, and a book on him—he said he had had them three months.</p>

            , Esq; The day before yesterday in the morning, when I came down stairs, the prisoner (who was my <rs id="t17690628-24-deflabel123" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17690628-24-defend249 t17690628-24-deflabel123"></join>) asked me whether I had my scarlet and gold waistcoat above stairs. I said No. I found the back kitchen door open. I took notice to my coachman that the place where the clothes used to be was in disorder. I suspected things had been taken away. I looked, and missed the clothes mentioned, and expressed my surprize to him that the person that had taken these clothes had not taken more; because there were more clothes in that chest which they might have taken. I thought this must have been done by somebody that belonged to my family. I said I would go to a magistrate. I asked him what time he got up. He said about six; but he seldom got up so early. The coachman agreed it was extraordinary, and the more so, as the back door had been shut fast the night before. When at breakfast, I talked of going before Major 
               <persName id="t17690628-24-person253">
                  Spinnage

            . The prisoner expressed a great desire to have it inquired into. He wished it might be cleared up. I said, You can have no objection to going before the Major to have it inquired into. He went with me. When we came there, many circumstances made me suspect the prisoner. At last we found where he had been the night before. The servants<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280026"></xptr> had informed me he had been out twice that night. He told me he had been to see one Sharp, who had been his fellow servant when he lived with Lord Douglas. I went there, and found a bundle in a trunk which was broke open; there I found my white frock, and silk and cotton waistcoat. (Produced and deposed to.) Then before Mr. Spinnage the prisoner was asked particularly about the scarlet waistcoat. He said he had flung it down the necessary. I sent for a carpenter to search in the necessary-house, but there was no such thing found.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Phelps. There was a bundle brought on Monday last to our house by the prisoner at near nine at night, he carried it down stairs and put it into a box which I had given him two months before, and locked it up, and took the key with him. After that he came again some time in the evening, but then I was out; but I found him in the kitchen when I came home. I was by when Major

               <p>I did carry the clothes there.

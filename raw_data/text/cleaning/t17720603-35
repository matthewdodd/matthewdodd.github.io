Between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was in the fore part of the house, when one of the maids run down stairs, and said there were thieves in the parlour. I went backwards and missed a waiter; I ran to the window and saw several persons, one called out, We have taken one, and there are more in the yard; I went into the shop, and told my servant to run round by Creed-lane, and stop all he met; I went back to the window, and saw the prisoner by the palisadoes in the yard; I went out, my servants came to my assistance, and we pulled him into the parlour; we sent for the constable, and searched him; we found a chissel in his side pocket; we searched for fire-arms, but found none. When we had him in the parlour I taxed him with breaking into my house eight months ago; he said no, he did not; for this was his first offence. I lost a silver waiter, a table spoon, a salt seller, and salt-spoon out of the parlour; the palisadoes are breast high and sharp-pointed; the ground is nearly on a line with the bottom of the window; I was in the parlour about twenty minutes before, the plate was safe then; the window was shut down; there is a sort of a spring bolt; the candles had been lighted, but they were put out. When I went out of the parlour, Mrs. Greenough followed me and put them out.</p>

               <p>- Greenough, jun. On the 19th of May, in the evening, between nine and ten, nearer than nine; I happened to come into the counting house to my father; the servant came down, crying thieves! I went round according to my father's order; I found several persons with plate, that I knew to be my father's; I took it from them, and brought it home with me. I saw the man within the rails, and there were two or three persons came up, who would have got him over the rails, with a pretence to have him directly before the justice; but I thought he was more secure within the rails; (the plate produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . I left work that evening about eight o'clock; I lodge in Holiday yard; I went home about ten minutes before ten. I saw the prisoner and another man looking into Mr. Greenough's window; they gave a cough and parted. I went in, and told the woman of the house where I lodge, I believed there were thieves in the court. I came again to the door and looked, and they had got close to the windows; I shut the door and said they were there; I looked again, and they had got the window up, and one jumped in; I then said there is one in; she said, I had better go to the fore door of Mr. Greenough's, and alarm them; I went to go, but the man came out, with a piece of plate in his hand; I asked him what he did there? he then put the plate down, and pretended to put the shutters too; then I made an alarm of thieves! and he attempted to make his escape; I gave him a knock of the head, and he fell immediately: I kept him there till I got assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you say before my lord mayor, that I had nothing in my hand?</p>
               <p>Weed. I said no such thing, but that you had plate in your hand.</p>

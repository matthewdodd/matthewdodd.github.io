                  </hi> I am a widow, and reside at No. 50, Henry-street, Kennington-lane. On Sunday evening, the 19th of Sept., about twenty minutes to seven o'clock, I left home to go to chapel—I left no one in the house—I saw that it was all safe—I locked up both in front and behind myself—I pulled the street-door after me—it has a spring-lock—I brought away the key—I locked the gate of the garden in front of my house, and brought away the key—all the windows were left fast—I was called out of chapel, and got back to my house about half-past seven—I found the garden gate unfastened—the street door was shut, as I had left it—I opened it with my key, and went in—I could not have told that anybody had got in—the door must have been opened by a key—there were no marks of violence—it was not a latch-key, but a large street-door key—I first went into my front par<lb></lb>lour, and missed nothing from there—the tea-caddy was laid on the back—parlour table, with the lock hanging to it—there was nothing but the sugar in it—it had been broken open—nothing was taken from it—the drawers in the back parlour had been opened, and the contents were strewed on the floor—I</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Rush, of No. 15, Henry-street, opposite to Mrs. Field's. On this Sunday evening Miss Emmens' sister came across, and told me something; in consequence of which, I looked out towards Mrs. Field's house, and saw the figures of two people moving in the first floor front room—the blinds were drawn down, the candle was on the opposite side of the room they were white holland blinds, and the candle showed their figures—they were removing things constantly to and fro—I could not see the articles they moved—I saw them moving things from the cheffonier in the room—before the policeman came, I saw two persons came out of the house—it was not light enough for me to observe them, but I could see their figures very well—one was a short stout man, and the other tall and thin—I screamed out when I saw them come out—they heard at and attempted to strike my husband, who came up—they ran away—I ran after them—they got out of my sight—I did not see either of them taken—I afterwards saw one of them in the hands of constable Sewry, he resembled the tall man I had seen—I afterwards saw some skeleton keys lying in Mr. Field's garden, and I found just inside the garden the top of a silver cruet.</p>

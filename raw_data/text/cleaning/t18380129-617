                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, Nottingham-place, Mile-end—I am a dealer in jewellery, and attend sales—last Monday night, the 29th of January, I was going home with the articles stated in a bag—it was about ten o'clock—I carried the bag in my hands, over my arm, with the string twisted round my wrist, and round the mouth of the bag—I had got about fifteen yards from my house, and was talking to a woman, who I wanted to buy a pair of slippers of, when the prisoner came behind me—he said nothing, but pulled hold of my bag—I said, "What do you want of me?"—he said, "Give it to me"—I would not, and said, "What do you want of me?"—he took a knife out so quick, so clever, and cut it away—he cut the bag, not the string, and went away with the bag, leav<lb></lb>ing the string and part of the bag in my hand—he went away very quick—I hallooed out, "Stop thief," and ran after him, but could not go fast, as I had the rheumatism, and I fell down, and Sarah Burgess ran after him—I hallooed out, "My bag, my bag," and she said, "O the bag; the property"—I got up and ran on further, and saw the prisoner when I got to the station-house, when the rest of my bag and my property was produced to me—I knew it directly.</p>

A man, who works for us, brought home two pairs of shoes, and in conseq<lb></lb>uence of something, I walked with him down Nottingham-place—I saw a man standing by the side of a wall there, about a yard before I got to him—the prosecutor was going along, and the man rushed out with great violence, caught hold of his bag, and said, <hi rend="italic">"</hi> Give it to me"—the prose<lb></lb>cutor</p>

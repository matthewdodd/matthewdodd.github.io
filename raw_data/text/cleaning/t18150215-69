            . I live in Cock-lane; my husband keeps a shop there: he keeps a coal shed, and deals in the brokery line. On Friday, the 13th of January, the prisoner came, he brought with him a glass lanthorn for sale: he said, I kept a coal shed he was going past, and as we sold coals he thought the lanthorn would be of use in our shop; I did not know the value of it; I said, I would give half a crown for it; the prisoner went out, and said he would not take it; he returned, and brought it in, said he must take it; I then gave him half a crown for the lamp, he left it; on Saturday morning we cleaned it, and put it out for sale.

            . I am a lamp-lighter; I trim the lamp for Giltspur-street Compter. On the 13th of January last, I trimmed this lamp about two o'clock in the afternoon; I left it there; I went to Ely-place. I missed the lamp when I came to light it at four o'clock. On Saturday morning at four o'clock, I saw it at Mrs. How's, a broker's shop, in Cock-lane; Mrs. How gave it to the street keeper in my presence. This is the lamp, I know it myself very well it is of the value of seven shillings.</p>

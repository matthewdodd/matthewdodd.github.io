                  </hi>. I live at No. 93, Granby Street, Waterloo Road. I am an unfortunate woman, and live in an apartment in that house—the pri<lb></lb>soner has occupied another apartment there—she was not doing so when this happened—she was staying with a party that was living in the house—she had not slept there that night—she had slept there the last week, up to that time—before that she had been seeing her friends in the country for two months—she had been back a week—she had been sleeping in the front parlour of that house—I occupy the back parlour—on Monday, 1st June, I returned home about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner sitting on the step of the door—I asked her to let me pass in, but she did not—I asked her again to let me pass in, and told her she did not pay the rent of the whole house—on my saying that, the prisoner got up and gave me a violent blow, and knocked me down—I had a dreadful black eye—she gave me a great many blows—she knocked the senses out of me—the blow fell on the back of my head, and took my senses away—I called to the landlord to assist me, and carry me in—I do not recollect anything after that—I do not know how I got in; I was taken in—the next time I saw the prisoner was on the following morning, when I saw her about 1 o'clock, just in the par<lb></lb>lour door—I was up stairs; I went down stairs, and said, "Jane, what did. you give me such a black eye for?"—she said, "You b—, I will give you.</p>
               <p>another"—I stood at the door, and she came at me with a pair of scissors—she struck me over the forehead; there is a mark there—she pushed the scissors at me—she took hold of my hair, and I took hold of her's—I after<lb></lb>wards went up stairs, and fastened myself in a room; she came up stairs and broke the door open—in my room there was a quart pot on the table; I saw the prisoner take it up—my fellow-lodger was in the room, and she said, "Jane, I will not have any disturbance made in my room"—the pri<lb></lb>soner took up the pot, and held it up first at her; she then came up to me, and said, "You b—, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for you"—I moved to the other side of the fire place—she came and struck me a blow over the head; she cut my head open—my eye was still bleeding—I put my hands up to my head as the blood was flowing from me, and said, "Oh, Jane! how can you be so cruel?"—I got hold of the ledge of the window, and cried out, "Murder!"—the cut with the pot was right on the top of my head—the first blow was struck down stairs, at the street door—the prisoner was standing just in the front parlour door—that was in her room—it was the room where she had been sleeping—she had not slept there that night—she did not pay any rent.</p>

               <p>did not when she knocked me down—it is a middling sized passage—I did not push her at all—the first thing she did was, she got up and knocked me down—there were a few people round when I was knocked down; there was not a mob—there was not a scuffle between me and the prisoner—she would not let me pass in—there was no scuffle between us—there had been no disagreement between us before—we were not particular friends—I cannot say whether she sent for two oysters to put on my eye; I had some in the house—they were applied to my eye—I do not know that she expressed her sorrow at what had taken place—I do not know that she asked me to lie down—I do not know when I recovered my consciousness—I have heard the prisoner say that she was about to remove from that house where she had been lodging with me, to another house—the second assault took place on the next day, about 1 o'clock in the day—I did not go down and open the door when I heard her knock—I was up stairs at the time, I went down after she had come in; I asked her why she gave me that black eye—she said that if I was not satisfied with that, she would give me another one—I did not take hold of her hair before she took the scissors—I believe she took the scissors from off the drawers, but I cannot say—the drawers were standing close by the door, in the parlour—she was just inside the parlour door—I did not see her go to the drawers and take the scissors; I cannot say whether she did or not; she had them in her hands when I saw them—we had no scuffle before the scissors were used—I am not in the habit of using bad language—the scissors were not used in a struggle between us; it was all done in a moment—I had not put my fingers on her before she took up the scissors—I cannot say whether she had the scissors in her hand before I was struck—the parlour is not a very large room—she did not rush suddenly at me, she was standing just inside the door—she was close to me all this time—there is a pair of scissors generally lying on the drawers—I do not know whether they require scissors in their work—I believe I was struck with the scissors at the same time that we had one another by the hair—it was all done in a moment—I do not know that I saw the scissors before I felt them—I am quite sure it was done by some<lb></lb>thing sharp, and the blood came down—I am quite sure I did not seize her by the hair first—it was not long after that she struck me with the pewter pot—after the scuffle she went down stairs, I think; I did not see her go—I did not rush at her with a piece of an iron bolt; I had nothing at all in my hand, I can swear that—there was only one woman in the room when she struck me with the pewter pot, Alice Bayley—she did not attack her—the door was locked—it was not very strong, she broke it open—she did not say any<lb></lb>thing—I did not say anything to her—she held the pewter pot up at Alice Bayley first—I did not do anything—I got to the other side of the fire place, out of her way—she was not in a very excited state—she was not intoxi<lb></lb>cated on either of the occasions—she might have had a glass before that time; she was not tipsy—I do not know that she had been drinking; I did not see her drink anything—I did nothing on this second occasion when she struck me with the pewter pot—Jonathan Adams did not come up and say to me that I should murder the woman—I was not separated from her by any one—when she struck at me with the scissors some one got me away, and I went up stairs, or she might have murdered me then—there are two other women living in the house besides Mrs. Barton, the landlady—they did not take any part in it—they might have said, "Don't hurt her;" I do not know—the prisoner was not attacked by the other women—she did not call them names—I had had no disagreement with her before—I cannot say</p>

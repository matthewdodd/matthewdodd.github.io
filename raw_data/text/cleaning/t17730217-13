                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170015"></xptr>Mrs. Vowell. I know I lost the things mentioned in the indictment ( repeating them;) the money, watch, and snuff-box were in a bureau, and the clothes were in the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see them before you missed them?</p>
               <p>Vowell. I do not know but I might see some of them that same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bureau locked?</p>
               <p>Vowell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The drawers locked?</p>
               <p>Vowell No? I found them missing about five in the evening on the 20th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the bureau open?</p>
               <p>Vowell. Yes; it appeared to be wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the gown and other things are you positive they were in the drawers at any time?</p>
               <p>Vowell Yes: a few days before, I suspected the prisoner; the things were found on her.</p>

            . I am a constable; the prisoner was advertised, and I took her with one of the gowns on her back; I found her in Liverpoole; the things have been in the Mayor of Liverpoole's house ever since; they are here now; she had a watch hanging by her side. The Mayor's clerk is here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whittal. I am clerk to Mr. Gilwood, who is town clerk of Liverpoole; when the prisoner was apprehended I attended the Mayor to take the information; she said she took the things and the money found upon her from her master Mr. Vowell: they have been in the custody of the Mayor of Liverpoole. (The gown produced.)</p>
               <p>Ratcliffe. This is the gown I found upon her.</p>

            . I know the prisoner; I always looked upon her as a sober honest girl; she has often been in my house; I never had any reason to suspect her; I believe it to be her first offence. I dare say Mr. Vowell desires she might appear in as favourable a light as can be to the court.</p>

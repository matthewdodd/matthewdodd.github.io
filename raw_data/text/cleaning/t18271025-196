             - we met the three prisoners and several more persons with them; when I came up to them, Herring said to me, "You are a bl-y nose;" I had known him for four or five years, but was never in his company that I know of; I once sat in a public-house where he was, some years ago; I asked what he meant by that - he up with his fist, and knocked me down into the kennel; the other prisoners were there at the time - it was a violent blow, and knocked two of my teeth out; Bulpit said, as I laid in the kennel, "Now, Bill, chib the b-r," and Cuttle snatched my seals, and broke the ribbon; he did did not get them, as Crispin caught his hand, and he dropped them; he broke the ribbon - I went to rise up, and Herring kicked me, so that I was scarcely able to rise from the ground; Cuttle ran towards Tower-hill, and Herring ran down Gravel-lane; they all ran away - Crispin followed Herring, and I got after her, into Pennington-street, where she was holding him by the neck-handkerchief, and he was knocking her about the head - we called the watchman, who came up, and took him; the gang came round me again; the watchman gave Herring to another watchman, and he took me to the watch-house - I saw Herring and Bulpit at the watch-house; Herring came and took hold of my hand, and said, "For God's sake, forgive me - I have done wrong;" I said I would not. I afterwards met the officer, who told me to come to the Thames Police-office on Monday; I said at the watch-house, that I had been robbed and almost murdered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Does Crispin pass as Mrs. Watts? A. No - I swear that; we had had a pot of half and half between us. I saw Cartwright that night at the watch-house - I did not offer to make it up with Herring; I was bleeding. I was never in prison, or before a Magistrate, I have known Bulpit five years, but was never in her company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, in the presence of Cartwright, offer to make friends with one of the prisoners? A. No.</p>

               <p>ELIZA CRISPIN. On the night in question Watts and I were going home, and met the prisoners and several others; on coming up to them Herring stepped of the pavement, called Watts a nose, and struck him; he fell on the ground; he kicked him in the mouth and several other places; Bulpit said, "Go it, Bill, chib him;" Cuttle then laid hold of his seals; I went to see what he was doing - he broke the ribbon, but did not get them; they all ran off; I pursued Herring, and kept hold of him till the watchman came; he was beating me about the head; Watts came up - I heard Herring say to him, "For God's sake, George, forgive me - don't give charge of me to night - take a warrant on Monday morning;" the watchman came up, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Watts sober? A. Yes; we had had two pints of half and half; I live with him as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250079"></xptr>his wife; I have gone by his name. I do not know whether he has heard me called Mrs. Watts; I was never tried any where. I was not in the watch-house myself.</p>

I said, "Come to me on Monday morning," which he did, and shewed me the bruises on his side; I then went to a house, and found Bulpit on a bed - I took her, and said, "Where is Bill?" she said, "He is at Crawley's;" I went there, and found Herring - he said, "Is it about Watts?" I said, "Yes:" he said, "I expected I should be nailed to-day:" I afterwards went with Shields, and found Cuttle in a room, which we broke open.</p>

               <p>BULPIT's Defence. When we met them, Crispin came and insulted me - she said she would fight me; I said I would take other means if she did not go about her business; I went to the watch-house with my husband (for we are married), and when they came away, I left with them - I said nothing in the watch-house.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. George's in the East, and have been an officer twenty years. The parties were brought into the watch-house for fighting in the street; both Watts and Herring were very much in liquor - their faces were both very bloody, I am certain; they called one another Bill and George; Watts said, "You had no right to strike me;" they shook hands and walked out of the watch-house: I was afterwards sent for by the Magistrate, to know why I dismissed the case; but they made it up themselves before any charge was booked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Swinglam? A. Yes - but nothing was said about a robbery; I did not hear of that for four or five days after, when he came and said, "Those persons should not have been discharged - they were accused of a robbery;" I heard Herring ask Watts to forgive him- Watts said, "I will not be served in this way."</p>
               <p>Q. If they had only been fighting, why should he ask forgiveness? A. He asked him to make it up, which he did; Herring said, "We will go and have a pot of beer;" if a robbery had been mentioned, I should have taken the charge; I know nothing of either of them; several persons rushed into the watch-house - there might be a dozen there.</p>
               <p>JOHN SWINGLAM re-examined. When I took Herring, somebody said, "He shan't take him to the watch-house tonight;" I took him there, but was sent out before the case was discharged; I heard that they had shook hands and settled it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HERRING. I was coming along, and saw the prosecutor ill-using Cuttle, who was a stranger to me I said, "George, don't ill-use him;" he turned round, and struck me in the mouth; I said, "If you strike me I will strike you;" he said, "I'll fight you for 1l.;" I struck him in my own defence - I had been to market with my wife.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WATTS. I had not struck him at all - I never quarrelled with him in my life; I did not shake hands with him in the watch-house; he came, caught hold of me, and said, "Forgive me:" I said, "How can I? you came to rob me, and I know you have been a thief for years."</p>

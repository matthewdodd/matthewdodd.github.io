               <p>hands and knees, crawling away from the water-butt—I went and asked him what he was doing there—he said, "Nothing"—I took him into custody—he went one step outside, into the lane, with me—I called two other officers, and he turned and struck at me—they came up, and he struck at them—we took him to the station—I went back to the yard, and found the pipe of the water-butt severed in two; one piece was hanging from the wall, and a piece was missing, which one of the sergeants brought to the station—I had been in the yard an hour before, and it was safe.</p>

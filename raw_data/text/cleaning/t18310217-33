            . I am a Policeman, No. 175 G. division. I took the prisoner from the last witness; I had him at a public-house near the office, before he was before the Magistrate - I made him no threat or promise; I asked what he was charged with - he asked if I could recollect a robbery in Whitechapel; I said No - he then asked if I recollected a gentleman named Cohen entrusting some property to a porter; I said I did - he said, "Then I am the man, and Sheen (using a horrid expression) assisted me in doing it, and had part of the property;" I cautioned him that his own words might convict him - he said he did not care a d-n, for that, for there were witnesses enough to transport him; but he was sure they could not make it a robbery, but a breach of trust.</p>

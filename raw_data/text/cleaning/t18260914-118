I was coming up Long-acre, and saw a great many officers; I saw a young man in a long brown coat drop this handkerchief, which I took up; Boston then asked what I had got - I said it was nothing to him; he said if I did not give it him he would get an officer. Soon afterwards the other prisoner was brought to me, but I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>BALL'S Defence. I was coming up Long-acre, from Queen-street chapel - I passed a great many officers, who caught this young man for something, and then they caught me, and said I belonged to him.</p>

            . I am a warehouse-keeper; the prisoner was foreman under me on the coffee floor; he has no right to take samples without my orders - I did not order him to take samples; sometimes a sample weighs 2 lbs., and occasionally 3 lbs.; if there are many bags, we take a little out of each, tie them up in paper, and mark the weight outside - that produced was in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not often authorized me to draw a sample to oblige a merchant, without an excise order - A. I have, but they are never taken out in a handkerchief, or hat; if a merchant's clerk wants coffee, to shew his employers, we allow him to take a 1/4 lb. - it is done under the excise officer's notice, but we ought to have an excise order to draw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not authorize me to draw larger samples for my brother - A. His brother is clerk to the owner of the coffee, and I have done such a thing, but never allowed him to draw a regular sample for his brother, without the leave of my superior.</p>
               <p>RICHARD OVER re-examined. Webster said that the coffee was secreted in the prisoner's hat, and without paper - the prisoner did not say whom he drew the sample for.</p>

            . I am clerk to Meyers and Co. I saw the prisoner at the East India Docks, on the 24th of April. I gave him no orders about samples, I only asked him to get some coffee weighed, which my employers had bought. I was present before the Magistrate on the 28th April. I do not know whether what the prisoner said was taken down - Mr. Langley was the Magistrate; the prisoner heard what I said, and denied it. I said, I gave him no orders for samples; he said, I did - I did not. I wanted no samples of any coffee in the East India Docks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not in March last, ask me to draw samples of coffee, which were coming by the Providence - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you would call for them if I could get them - A. I said, I would call for weights, but not samples; samples are always delivered in paper by an order - I never asked him to draw me samples without.</p>

            . I am an Excise surveyor. Samples must not be delivered without an Excise order; they generally take about 2 oz. from each package - it may amount to several pounds; we do them up in paper, and make them up in square parcels, and mark them outside. I saw the prisoner stopped by Webster, as he was going out to breakfast, at half-past eight o'clock; he was searched in the office, and nothing found on him, but upon taking off his hat, there was about 3 lbs. of coffee in a handkerchief - he had said he had nothing about him; he said it was samples which he was going to take to some person, he did not say whom - it was not the regular way to carry out samples.</p>

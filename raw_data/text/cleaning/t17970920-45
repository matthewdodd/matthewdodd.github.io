             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street: I searched the prisoner, on the 15th of July, at Mr. Bond's own apartments; I found a small key in his pocket, and upon going to his lodgings with him, in the kitchen, I saw a tea-caddie, which he said was his; this small key opened it, and I found in it a great number of duplicates, there are seventeen of them; four of them are of his own property.</p>
               <p>Mervin. These are all of them our duplicates, and they correspond with those which I have produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morse. I can swear positively to all these articles, except the three waistcoats, because they have my mark; the waistcoats I believe to be mine, but am not positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had occasion for a little money; I parted with these things with no other design than to redeem them when I took my wages, which would have been on the 27th of July; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200053"></xptr>to receive 20l. Mr. Morse never fulfilled his engagement with me; he was to settle with me every Monday, and he has let bills run up to 11l.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mervin. Q. Did he ever redeem any articles? - A. Yes; these six half handkerchiefs were pledged with me a twelvemonth ago, and he afterwards redeemed them.</p>

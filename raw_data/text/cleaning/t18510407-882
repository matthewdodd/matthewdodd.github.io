                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 279). I know the prisoner. On Sunday night, 9th March, I saw the prisoner with three men in the Barrow-road—I told her I wanted her—she said, "What do you want of me?"—said, "For robbing a young man who was living with your father"—she said, "Oh very well, I know nothing about him; I will go with you"—I took her to the station, where Relton identified this handkerchief, which was round her neck—the said, "It is not your handkerchief; I can bring witnesses to prove where I got it"—when we were in the outer court of the police-court she said she wanted to speak to her mother, who was there; I said she must not, unless in the pretence of a policeman—her mother said, "Mary, tell me what you bare done with the things"—she said, "I am not a <hi rend="italic">flat</hi> nor a fool; I am not going to open my mouth in a public court to fill everybody else's; if I get off I will tell him where the things are."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What grounds had you for telling the Magistrate I was a prostitute? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By seeing you with different men in coffee-shops at different hours of the night; I bare no recollection of asking you in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> whether you bad been out of town—you spoke to me and said,' "Where is Helton now, that young 'ape' or 'fool?'"—I said I supposed be would be at the police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Luxmore, a pawnbroker, of St. Martin's-lane. I produce these clothes pawned by the prisoner on 8th March, about twelve o'clock, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of William Helton, who she said was her husband, who wanted the money for a loan society—she pawned the coats and shirts at the same time—this is the ticket I gave.</p>

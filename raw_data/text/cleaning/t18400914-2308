                  </hi>. I am an ornament-manufacturer, and live in New Compton-street. On the 10th of September, between two and three o'clock in the day, I saw the two prisoners and another in Gerrard-street, as I was coming down Macclesfield-street—I have not the least doubt that they are</p>

               <p>two of the three—I observed them follow the prosecutor and another gen<lb></lb>tleman, and when they got close to them, I saw Rooke put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out his parse—Hawkins was by his side, quite close to the gentlemen, when Rooke took out the purse—Rooke walked on—the two gentlemen stopped to knock at a door—one of the companions, (the third one,) walked about a dozen yards before the gentleman, then turned, and looked him in the face—he then walked back and escaped—Hawkins crossed the road directly the purse was taken, and went away—I told the prosecutor that he had lost his purse—he went with me to Rooke, who did not attempt to run away—I accused him of having the purse—Rooke said he had not got the purse, and we might search him—the prosecutor asked a person in the crowd to get a police-man—I said I was sure Rooke had the purse; and when he found he could not get away, he pulled it out of his coat-pocket, went down on his knees, and begged for forgiveness—I am quite sure Hawkins was one of the three—he had an opportunity to see Rooke take the purse.</p>

I was walking with the prosecutor—I had knocked at the door of a lodg<lb></lb>ing-house which I was taken to, and the prosecutor said to me, in French, "I believe I have been robbed"—I said, "Feel if you have lost any thing"—he said, "Yes, my purse is gone"—at that moment Mr. Creswick cried out, and said, "That boy going on a-head of you has taken the gentle<lb></lb>man's purse"—I ran and collared Rooke—I charged him with having it—he denied it—I kept him from the area and from the people about, and just as the policeman was coming up he made an attempt to kneel down, and gave the purse into my hand, and I gave it to the policeman.</p>

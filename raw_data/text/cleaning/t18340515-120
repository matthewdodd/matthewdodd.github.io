               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Had Huet ever been authorized before, to sell horses and ponies for you? A. He never was - it had been out of my possession from six o'clock on Saturday night till five o'clock on Sunday evening, when I found him a mile and a half from where I lost him - I have reason to believe he had been further, for it was very much injured, and his legs all in a trembling and shaking - I drank with Huet and the prisoner - I had seen Huet about employed by people clipping - I had never seen the prisoner before - he appeared quite sober to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have been accustomed to horses? A. I have - the pony appeared jaded and trembling, as if he had been rode about - I had been looking for him the whole of Sunday, though he was found so near.</p>

            . I am a horse clipper and trimmer - I was assisting the prosecutor to sell the pony - I was riding him on Saturday, the 3rd of May, to get a customer - I was at the Constitution public-house, Lisson Grove, at half-past four o'clock, and was riding the horse - the prisoner came up while I was there - I have known him for years - he is a charcoal burner - he came up, and asked me if the pony was for sale - it had red ribbons on, and a halter round its neck - I said it was for sale - he asked the price - I said fifteen guineas - he said he would give me five - Sigston was either inside the door or close to the door - I said I could not take any such money - he said, "Let me look at it, get up, and ride him" - I got up on it, and rode him, and then gave him to William Smith, to run him up and down, for the prisoner to see that it was not lame, and after that he followed Smith and me down, and said he would get up, and ride it himself, and if he liked it, he would buy it- he jumped on, and I told him not to go out of the street - I said I would sell the pony if he would give the money for it, but the least I could take should be twelve guineas - I am sure I told him not to ride him out of the street - he got up, turned to the right, and went away - I never saw him again that day - I went to the Constitution with Sigston, and never left till half-past eleven o'clock - he never came there - I found the prisoner at eight o'clock on Sunday morning in bed at his friend's house - I cannot tell the name of the street - it is almost close to where the pony was taken from - I asked where the pony was - he said he did not know - I said if he did not tell me where it was, I must go and tell the owner, as it was intrusted to my care to sell - he got out of bed, and went to a barber's shop - I said, "Taylor, do tell me where the pony is" - he was rather in liquor then, I think - I cannot tell whether he was in liquor when he went off with the pony - he said he would go and have his beard off - I went and saw the prosecutor - I told him I had seen the prisoner, but he did not know where it was - the prisoner told me he thought it was gone down into the country - we got a policeman to look about, and at last it was found - I saw it at the Red Lion about half-past five o'clock - it was the same pony.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. About five years - I have been intimate with him, and found him always honest - the real value of the pony is about twelve guineas - that was the lowest price I was permitted to take for it - the prosecutor authorized me to sell it, by taking it round the park - I did not help the prisoner to get on the pony - at the latter end of the conversation I told him not to go out of the street - he rode away with it directly after I told him that - he told me if he liked it he would have it at fifteen guineas, which I asked him - if he had bid me twelve guineas, I should have taken it.</p>

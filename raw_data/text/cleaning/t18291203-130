               <p>WILLIAM HICKS. I am a labourer. I saw the handkerchief inside the prisoner's coat-pocket, and took him into custody.</p>

               <p>JOHN HARRISON. I was one of the new Police. I was at the corner of Bridge-street and heard a noise, looked round, and saw James taking this handkerchief from the prisoner's pocket; I took him in charge, and found this pair of scissars on him - they are very sharp pointed.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was another Police-man there; I should like to know if he would say what this one does -I am a whitesmith, and use the scissars to cut wire for tobacco-stoppers; I was unable to walk ten yards, much more to do such a thing - I had no pocket.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARRISON. He had an inside pocket on his left side - I shewed it before the Alderman.</p>

I lost my purse on Saturday morning, between four and five in the morning; it was laying on the chair by the side of M'Lockey. The prisoner came into our room between four and five in the morning; he took my purse, and shook the silver out into his hand. The prisoner lodged in the same house. I am sure he is the same man. I have known him three weeks back.</p>

            . I live in Fleet-lane. The prisoner came there on the 1st of September, bought a 1d. pie, left two parcels, and offered me 6d to change - I had no change; he asked to leave these parce's for five or ten minutes, and said he would leave me the 1d. for the pie - he did not come again till between twelve and one o'clock the next day; I saw Mr. Deacon's name on the bag, and went and told him - he got an officer, and when the prisoner came he was taken: he first asked me for the two parcels - I said "I expected you last night;" he said, "I was pre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160071"></xptr>vented;" when the officer came he denied knowing any thing about the parcels - I said, "What, do you want to persuade me that I don't know you again?" he then said he was the man, and offered to pay the 1d. for the pie.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where do you live? A. Near the bottom of Fleet-lane - Mr. Deacon lives at the bottom of Old Fleet-market; my shop is open, and within five minutes walk from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I took the prisoner - I heard Mrs. Swile tell him he had left the bags; he at first denied it - she said she was positive he was the person; he still denied it, and said, "You had better walk with me to Mr. Deacon's" - he then offered the 1d. for the pie; he said before the Alderman that he bought them, and paid his brother for them - the parcels were in his presence at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. DEACON. These are mine; they have my name on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose all the tea you send out is in paper of this sort? A. Yes, mostly - this mark is on almost all the tea and coffee that goes out; perhaps in the last six months I have sent out fifty such parcels; the only thing which I can distinguish these by, is, that they are an old weight; his brother was allowed to sell that night - the prisoner had been six months in my employ, but he was not so then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I paid my brother for them, which he is here to witness now; my brother has been imprisoned all the while, though the bill was thrown out against him.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Deacon's service. On the night in question I sold my brother these articles which he is accused of stealing - he paid me 16s. 6d., which I gave Mr. Deacon on the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to swear you paid him the money? A. Yes; he did find me kicking a parcel and a canister under the counter - I had the canister and bag on the floor to practise tying up tea; I was sitting on a stool - I was going to put it on the counter when I had got it into the bag; I did not find it more difficult there than on the counter - I do not know whether it was darker or not; I took the tea out of two canisters to practise mixing tea - I took the full value of it from my brother, and gave it to Mr. Deacon before he went out, but did not tell him what it was for; it was not entered in the book - it is not usual to enter articles which are paid for; I was taken up the next day - I did not tell Mr. Deacon this, because he would not believe me; I mentioned it before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was there a light in the shop? A. Yes, it was light all over - mixing teas is a usual thing at a tea-dealer's.</p>
               <p>MR. DEACON re-examined. I had sent for a 1/2 cwt. of sugar, for the payment of which I gave him a sovereign - it came to 11s., and when I came home he gave me the 9s. which was all I received.</p>

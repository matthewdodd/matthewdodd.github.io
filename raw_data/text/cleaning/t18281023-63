            . I am an officer. On the afternoon of the 29th of September I saw the prisoners in company with another, at the end of Cornhill - I followed them, thinking they looked suspicious, and in Cheapside I saw them survey two or three silversmiths' shops; I then followed them to Ludgate-hill, and saw them cross the street to Mrs. West's shop - I saw them walk three or four times round under the archway, and return again: Simpson twice looked into the front-window on Ludgate-street - I went into Mr. Alger's shop, where the last witness lives and told him to observe the lad, pointing him out - I then went down Ludgate-hill, facing the passage opposite the Old Bailey, came round through the archway, and saw Jones talking to somebody; I passed them, and saw Simpson still standing at the corner - I crossed over to Mr. Alger's, and said to the witness."You have kept your eye on the boy, shall you know him again?" he said he should; I then crossed, and saw the boy cross his hand at the window - I went round the hill, returned, and saw the glass was cut across and down: I went in and shewed it to Smith - I turned my eye, and Jones was leaning with his arm against the corner - he forced the glass in some little distance: I asked if there was another door - Smith said there were two side doors; Simpson then put his hand up, took the gass from the frame, and put it into his pocket - Jones immediately turned round, and drew the property out of the window: I saw him draw out some articles - the porter opened the first door, and in opening the second, which leads into the street, the bolt made a noise, and they immediately made off: I kept my eye on Jones - Simpson turned round and looked me full in the face; I followed Jones up the bill, and stopped him two doors from the house; I asked him what he had been doing - he said Nothing: I took him back to the shop, and asked what he had got in his pocket - he said Nothing; I found these articles in his coat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did you not make somebody else take Simpson? A. I had not an opportunity - I was at one time on the opposite side, and at another time by the gateway: I saw him pass him hand across the window - the window was not broken, but cut and starred; I never saw one broken in that way by accident - glass so thick as this would not split by the pressure of the elbow without being first starred; we might he not above six yards from Simpson - I saw nothing in his hand to cut the glass with; he did not run - I cannot conceive that it could he done by accident in the way it was broken - Jones took the glass; he took no goods out; it rained at the time, and there were a number of people standing under the archway - none of them are here; the crowd would hide him; the glass broken was in the gateway, where the people were standing - the prisoners stood rather away from the people, and were more conspicuous to me; the persons standing up were looking on to Ludgate-hill - I knew Simpson had not got the property, and by taking him I should have made a disturbance, and the one with the property would have escaped; the property was taken about four minutes after the window was broken: I knew Simpson's person before - he had on a brown jacket, waistcoat and trowsers, and a black hat - his jacket was braided.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. George Ackerman and others. printsellers, in the Strand. On the evening of the 29th of February I was returning from Windsor by Moody's coach, and on arriving at the White Horse-cellar, Piccadilly, the coach stopped—I got off and looked behind, and saw the parcel in question quite safe in the hind boot—I had brought it from Windsor—it contained the articles stated in the indict<lb></lb>ment—several passengers left the coach there—I went on with the coach—it stopped again at the Ship, at Charing-cross, and afterwards set me down in the Strand; and on taking out my parcels I missed the one in question—on the Friday following a policeman came to ask if we missed any pro<lb></lb>erty. and produced some—it was all tied up in a brown paper parcel—it was six o'clock in the evening when I got to Piccadilly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the evening of the 29th of February, between five and six o'clock, I was in company with another policeman by Charing-cross—I saw the prisoners in company together, and suspected them—we watched down them down as far as the Ship, when Cooper left the other two, and they walked up and down the Strand dearly an hour till six o'clock—they then came back to Charing-cross, and stood by Drummond's banking-house together for about five minutes, when Cooper came up to them with a brown paper parcel under his arm, and spoke to them—he walked along up Cockspur-street—the other two went along the dark side of the way into the Haymarket to him, Cooper still carrying the parcel—Cooper went up the Hatmarket, and put down the parcel under a shop window—he opened it, as if to examine the contents—the other two passed him, and stood about twenty yards away from him—Cooper then took the parcel under his arm, and turned back to Pall-mall, followed by the other two prisoners: and almost immediately after getting into Pall-mall, I saw Copper run away without the parcel, and jump be<lb></lb>hind a stage-coach—I pursued him, and took him off from behind the coach, and asked him if he had given a parcel to a young man—he said, no, he could not: for he had not had one—I brought him back, and give him to the constable who had taken the parcel from Clark—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Monday evening, the 29th of February, I was in company with two officers, and saw the three prisoners, and, suspecting them, we followed them—Cooper left the other two by the Ship—we followed Clark and Green for an hour, about the Strand—they came back, and stood by Drummond's and were joined shortly after by Cooper, having a brown paper parcel—they went across into the Haymar<lb></lb>ket—Cooper went to a shop, put down the bundle, took out his knife, cut open the string, and looked at the parcel—they returned to Pall-mall, and I saw Cooper give the parcel to Clerk—Green was with Clark at the time—as soon as Cooper gave him the parcel, he ran away, and got behind a stage-coach—I told my brother officers, and the witness pursued Cooper, and took him from the coach—I and my brother officers secured Green and Clark—Clark was then carrying the bundle, and Green with him—they were both close together, going the same road.</p>

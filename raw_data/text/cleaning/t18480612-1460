On 28th April I slept at the prisoner's house, at Shadwell—I had a female with me, and when I went to the house I gave my watch to her—she gave it to Ann Morgan in my presence—it was left in pawn for the bed—I stopped there that night and went away next morning—I did not ask for my watch when I went away—I went back about two o'clock in the afternoon and asked Ann Morgan for it—she said she had pawned it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she gave me the duplicate—there were two or three girls in the house, who kept pulling me about, and asking me for something to drink—I gave Ann Morgan a shilling to send for something to drink, and they brought in a pot of beer—I just tasted it—I had at that time four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and nine sovereigns in a purse, in my pocket—I was in the house till between four and five, when I left—I was about to pay a labourer, and I found my money was gone out of my purse, and the purse was put back again into my pocket—during the time I was in the house Ann Morgan sat by my side—I was quite sober when I went there—I drank about half-a-pint of beer, and in a few minutes I felt quite stupid—I left the house about half-past four and went to my ship—I told the mate of my vessel—I did not go back to the prisoner's house that night—I went the next morning and saw Ann Morgan—I told her what had happened; she denied knowing anything about it; I gave her in charge—she was searched at the station, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was taken from her, but no notes—I had seen Thomas Morgan in bed in the house, in the morning—I had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in my left-hand pocket—I did not lose that.</p>

Yes; I ran after her down the alley, and was crying out about my pocket-book, and I met with the prisoner M'Glue's wife; she said, what is the matter with you; and I told her I had been robbed of my pocket-book; and she asked what it contained; I told her ninety-six pounds; she told me to go over to another public-house opposite, that she pointed out to me, and call for a pint of beer, and I should get my pocket-book again, and then I should go down to their house to dinner.</p>

I turned round and saw the prisoner Allen, I said, yes, I do, Bett, you must go with me; says she, I heard you wanted me; before we came up to the Three-tuns door, I met with Mrs. M'Glue, I told her, she likewise must go with me, she refused, but I told her she must, and then she went, I took them both into the Three-tuns, and in the kitchen I searched

               <p>Mrs. M'Glue's defence. I saw Morson and M'Glue smoaking their pipes together, and I begged of him to come home, and he gave me a punch in the face; sometime afterwards, I saw this man a crying, I asked him what was the matter, and he said, he had lost all his property, knowing he had been in company with M'Glue, I desired him to go back, and try if he could hear any thing of it; I never saw Bett Allen at all, and he would not have known the public-house again if I had not taken him there.</p>
               <p>Allen's defence. I went into the house for a pint of beer, and the prosecutor asked me to have some ale, and I said, I had rather not, and that man, the watchman, said, if it was gin, I could drink it; the prosecutor was very much in liquor, and he asked me if I could accomodate him with a place to sleep in, he was reeling about the street very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120053"></xptr>drunk; I left him, and some time after, I was coming up the street, and I was told that Mr. Ford wanted me, that a man had been robbed of 500l. and I went to Mr. Ford, and tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him, and he said, yes, he did want me, and I was taken into custody; he was so intoxicated that he would have sworn to any woman.</p>

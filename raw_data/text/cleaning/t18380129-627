                  </hi>. I serve in the shop of my master, Mr. John Hawes Swann; he is a hosier and haberdasher, living at No. 127, Goswell-street. On the 23rd of January the two prisoners came to the shop, at six o'clock in the evening—they came in together, and Teer asked for some satin ribbon—I showed them some—Sullivan bought some first, and then Teer bought some, and while she was doing so Sullivan took ibis piece out of the drawer—it is twelve yards and three quarters of gauze ribbon—I saw her take it out of the drawer and put it under her cloak—after Teer had bought a piece they went out of the shop—they walked out, and I told Mr. Swann, who was in the next room—he immediately fol<lb></lb>lowed them, and they were brought back—they are the same persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at my brother's on this evening the two prisoners were in the shop, and directly they were gone the witness came and told us they had stolen a piece of ribbon—I and my brother went out—they crossed the road in a hurry, quite in a run, the moment they saw us—my brother followed them, and brought them back—they were very willing to come back into the shop—he asked me to fetch a policeman—I went out but did not succeed, and when I came back they were gone to the station-house—I went into the show-room and spoke to my sister—she requested me to go into the street, and about thirty yards from the prosecutor's shop I picked up this piece of ribbon, standing on its end in the dirt.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SIMMONDS. I was sent for, and the prosecutor said he had lost 25s. - I found 3s. on the prisoner in the tobacco pouch, and 8 1/2d. in her neck.(Pouch produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had given her the money, and accused her of stealing it, because she would not accompany him to a house of ill-fame.</p>

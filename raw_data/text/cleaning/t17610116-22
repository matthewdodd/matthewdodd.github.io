            . I was going up the Strand, and I saw the prisoner come past me; there was a great cry after him, Stop thief, stop thief. I laid my hand on his shoulder, and said, Are you the man? He said, no, he was not. I went a little further, and saw something stand out behind his coat. I called, You, Sir, what have you behind your coat: he said nothing. He went on a little further, and threw the hat over some iron rails, at a person's door: I took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that threw it there?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. I am sure it was he. [A hat produced.] This is the very hat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my property, and what was taken from my shop-window that night.</p>
               <p>Stubbs. The prisoner was taken, and secured by the constable and watchman, while I had the hat in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. This was a little after nine at night: he was carried before the justice: he was asked about stealing the hat; and he said he knew nothing of it, he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he taken after you had took up the hat?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. He was taken and brought back about a minute or two after; the woman was sent for, and she swore to her hat before the justice.</p>

               <p>I had been at Westminster, to see an acquaintance; coming back I saw a great crowd at justice Cox's door; I stood to see what the matter was; there was the cry, Stop thief. I saw something thrown over the rails. I ran along with the people: a person came and clapped hold on my shoulder, and said I had stole the hat. That person's a thieftaker I told him he was mistaken: they brought me to this man, Mr. Stubbs, and he said I was the person that threw the hat there; but I know nothing of the matter, neither did I know what was the matter, 'till I came to justice Cox.</p>

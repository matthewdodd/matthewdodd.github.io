                  </hi>. I keep the Red Lion, in Fore-street, in the parish of Lambeth—I occupy the whole house. On the 30th of March I was the last person up, on my premises—I retired at 12 o'clock, after fastening every thing except one shutter at the back of the house, which was not fast—the window was shut—the shutter was up, and a bolt went through the window-chill to fasten it, but we could not get into the room, having lost the key—the bar-door was locked—I came down about seven in the morning—my premises were undergoing repairs, which Brown was super<lb></lb>intending—I found the parlour shutter taken down, the window open, and the bar-door unlocked, which was locked when I went to bed—I found several boxes in the bar had been opened—one was a club box—they bad locks to them—I missed the money and articles stated in the indictment—this silver medal I can positively speak to from its general appearance, and the letter "P" on it—it was taken from the club-box—I have no marks on this twopenny-piece and the handkerchief—I lost a cotton handkerchief of this pattern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Dempster, a pawnbroker, in the Blackfriars-road. On Thursday, the 31st of March, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner sold me this medal—I asked him several questions—he said he had had it six months, had pawned it several times, and was tired of pawning it—I told him I thought it be<lb></lb>longed to the members of the Vintners' Company, and they could give him more than I could, I could give him no more than the price of old silver—he said he had had it by him six months, and would sell it—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he seemed surprised, and said, "Does it weigh more than half a crown?"—I said, "Yes"—I have no doubt of him, his face was dirty, and he was dressed as a waterman—I gave a description of him to an officer, the man who was sent round with the Hue and Cry, describ<lb></lb>ing the property stolen.</p>

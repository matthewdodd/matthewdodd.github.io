            . On the 28th of July, about nine at night, I saw the prosecutor at the end of St. Martin's Lane, and the prisoner follow him on to the New Buildings in the Strand: they were on that side Northumberland-house is on: I was on the other side. It was a moon light night. I saw the prisoner put his left hand into the gentleman's right hand pocket, his coat-being loose, and took something, and as he drew it out, I took it to be a handkerchief. Upon this I went to the gentleman, and asked him if he had lost any thing. The rest as the prosecutor.</p>

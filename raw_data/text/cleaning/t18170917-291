               <p>THOMAS HAMILTON. I am a Thames Police officer. On the 17th of September I was on the river, near Blackfriars Bridge, about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoners pulling up the river in a skiff, with the tide, going through the bridge, on the Middlesex side. The bowsprit was fastened to their boat - I pulled towards them, and they let it go; they knew me. I asked them why they let it go? Godwin said he did not let it go, but the stuff that held it broke. I asked them were they got it? Finnis said, they got it from Mr. Bruet's, of Blackwall, and were going ashore to the dock (Pointing to Whitefriars Dock). I took them to the police-ship. While they were in the ship, a knife was taken from Godwin-the blade had tar on it, as if it had been cutting rope. When at the office, Godwin said, it was no use to tell a lie, that they picked it up in the London Dock, and were going to take it to the Water Bailiff; it was forty-four feet long. I examined the rope-ends at Mr. Bond's which it had been fastened to-it appeared to have been cut. It was a tar rope, and corresponded with that in the boat.</p>

            , who is a mast-maker, and lives at Limehouse. On the evening of the 16th of September we had the bowsprit to alter; it was fastened to a raft in the water at the main float with a rope. I saw it safe at seven o'clock; the tide was then running down. If it had broken loose, it would have gone down the river-the tide turned about twelve o'clock. Our premises are a mile lower down the river than the London Docks. If it had broken loose, it could not have floated outside, the craft would prevent its getting clear off there; the spars were let loose when the rope was cut, and they remained safe; they were further outside than the bowsprit. I missed it at daylight the next morning-the rope was cut; I saw it at the office; it is our's, and is worth 6l. 10s.</p>

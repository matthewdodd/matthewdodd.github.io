               <p>of May, a few minutes before ten o'clock, the prisoner and another female named Catherine O'Hara came to my bar—the prisoner called for a pint of half-and-half, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid for it in halfpence—she immediately called for half a quartern of gin, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served her—she handed me half-a-crown over the bar, and I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I pat the half-crown into the till—there was no other half-crown there—I had no other half-crown in the bar—in about twenty minutes the prisoner and O'Hara came in again, and stood in the tame place—the prisoner called for a pint of half-and-half, and when I pat it before her she called for a quartern of gin out of the bottle—she laid down half-a-down on the counter—I <hi rend="italic">saw it was</hi> not a good one, and as I took it up I said, "What have you got here? this won't do"—a young man who was there said, "Let me see it"—I handed it over to him, and be said in the prisoner's presence, "It is very bad indeed," he gave it to me back and told me to give it her back, which I did, and told her it was a bad one, and I could not take it—the then said, "I must pay for the half and-half in halfpence, and we cannot have the gin"—as I was taking the gin from the counter, it struck me that the half-crown I had previously taken of the prisoner might be bad—I put on my spectacles, opened the till, took out the half-crown, and found it was bad—there was only that one half-crown, one shilling, and two sixpences in the till—I went up to the prisoner and said, "Now this is the half-crown you gave me"—she said, she had not given it to me/neither had she been in the house before, that night—I said, "It is not a quarter of an hour since you were here, both of you"—she began to be a little abusive—I said, "I believe you are regular <hi rend="italic">smashers,</hi> I shall send for an officer and give you into custody," which I did—I gave the first half-crown I received from the prisoner to inspector Martin.</p>

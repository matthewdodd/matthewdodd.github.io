Mr. Waddington made a complaint next morning - I saw the prisoner come down into the coffee-room with his hat in his hand, which he put down on the bench; he was afterwards taken into a private room to be searched: I was present when his room was searched - one shirt was found between the bed and the mattress, with a pin in it; he had said it was likely he should want the bed on the following night.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the house. I heard this complaint, and saw the prisoner coming down stairs with his hat in his hand, which he put down beside him, on the seat of the coffee-room; he asked for his boots, and one of the servants said they should be brought in a few minutes. In the mean time my master sent for an officer, who came, and took him into another room; he left his hat on the seat where he had been sitting; I fetched it, and it had two clean and one dirty shirts in it. Mr. Waddington's room was on the floor under that in which the prisoner slept in; it was about half-past two o'clock on Sunday morning before the prisoner came down.</p>

               <p>Before you only knew Wells by the name of West? - No, I learned his real name at his lodgings from Woodman; we never should have found either the curtains or him but for Woodman.</p>
               <p>Woodman had the same opportunity of escaping, yet he remained? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe Woodman knew that you knew very well about him and his connections? - I believe he did; and had any body else told me that this circumstance would have happened to Mr. Woodman I would not have believed them.</p>
               <p>Woodman did not live where Wells lived? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoners; I was fetched by the boy, and Woodman was standing by the counter, when I went into the shop; I took Woodman to the round-house, and I went with Jordan to No. 7, in Castle-court, Fullwoods-rents, to seek for Wells, I found him up two pair of stairs; Jordan knocked at the door, and Wells opened the door, and immediately I rushed in after Jordan, and he gave charge of them both; old Wells seemed quite alarmed; says Jordan,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250024"></xptr> you are to search, to see whether they are here; I looked about the bed, and different places; there was a great chest stood in the room; the old man said, they were not there; and if we went with him, it should be all right; he was only playing the rogue; and looking about under the head of the bed I pulled out these curtains, which I took care of; as soon as we got out they seemed very resolute; I threatened to cleave their sculls; they said, they would walk quietly; at Bloomsbury steps the old man gave me a push, and he said, d - n you, you dog, I will not go with you, and away he ran up the steps, I pursued after him, and took him and carried him to the round house, and I threw down the curtains; I suppose he hit me ten times and said, d - n you, you dog, I will not go with you, you have robbed me of my watch, and all that I have; there came past a gentleman and a lady, and I charged them in the name of the King, to aid and assist me; and I got him to the watch-house with difficulty; and in his pocket I found his watch, and a knife and a pick-lock key; it was only the top and the bottom of a key; and I gave it him again by order of the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you got to the shop you found Woodman perfectly at his ease? - Yes, he resigned himself to every thing I requested of him.</p>
               <p>Jordan. Before I discovered to Woodman the loss of my curtains, he very readily told me his name, and where he lived.</p>

               <p>I understood one counsel was to do for us all, it is untrue what the constable says; I never struck him, and he used me very ill, and tore a new silk waistcoat all to smash, and a new neckcloth.</p>
               <p>Brooks. It was torn in the scuffle.</p>

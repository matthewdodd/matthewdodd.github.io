            . I am a journeyman coach-maker.

I seized Easton with the handkerchief; Clark came up afterwards, and I took him also. I had a struggle with Clark, and Easton broke from me, but I secured him immediately, without losing sight of him. Mr. Boyes took the handkerchief from the flap of Easton's breeches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you often given information on these subjects? A. Yes; whenever I see a robbery - I had not seen one for twelve months before. I have been a witness here several times. I make boot-jacks and things at home, and live at No. 34, Henry-street, Hampstead-road.</p>

            . I am a printer. I was passing, and saw a mob - Mr. Boyes had a handkerchief in his hand, and said he had taken it from Easton's small clothes. I saw Boston take Clark, who put himself in a fighting attitude, Easton ran from Mr. Boyes, but was taken afterwards.</p>

On coming from the coffee-house, Boston said I was robbed; I felt, and missed my handkerchief, turned round, and he had hold of Easton, whom I took by the arm, and took my handkerchief from his breeches. He ran away, and an officer secured him in St. Bride's passage.</p>

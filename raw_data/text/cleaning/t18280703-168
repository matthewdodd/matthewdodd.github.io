I was playing with Christopher Douglass and some other boys, on some gravel-heaps, near our house - I saw the prisoner sitting on the hill, talking to Christopher Douglass, and he said if we would come down the road he would get us a bird's nest: we went up a new street, and he told Christopher Douglass and

No: you did not ask me to do anything; you only told us to take off our coats and go over a ditch, and said you would mind them - I did not go into any house; we all got over a wall; Pinks and Halls went over the ditch - you said you would go and get the bird's-nest, and would call out; I went with you as far as the turnpike.</p>

               <p>As I was going to work in the morning I came up Portpool-lane, and Mr. Smith and some more people were talking to the prisoner, I looked hard at the man, and seeing his white stockings were very dirty, we thought it was with the fire at Holborn,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300040"></xptr> the man was going down and was got some way Smith, it is very proper for there were pigs upon followed him to Bradshaw's-rents into the court where the prisoner was, we asked him what he was going to do with the things, he lived there he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he put them down in any house? - No, in the open court, and a man that was looking out at a window said, no man lived there, it was an empty house; then we seized the prisoner and the goods; he made no resistance, he said he had the pigs from Paddington, and some of the goods were sent out of Hertfordshire.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is Lissen-green from Theobald's-row? - About a mile and a half, or two miles.</p>
               <p>How long would a man be walking there? - Being loaded he could not come very fast.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I know nothing at all of the affair any further than this, as I told the gentlemen when they took me; I was going to the Rose, in Fleet-market, and I had the things at Mary-le-bone Turnpike, I was hired as a porter to carry them, I in Portpool-lane, at Bradshaw's-rents a basket maker lived; it is I should commit this robbed this says against me, because Clerkenwell but that very day, I have sent for Mr. Fletcher, he says I am very done by.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is a capital offence, now you know extremely well, a burglary must be committed in the night time, it is possible that there was time to have taken these things very early in the morning while it was light, as I believe the sun rises before five in the morning; as to the taking of the goods, they were found upon him, but as for the burglary, I own, I think it is going too far to say he was guilty of that, because he might have taken them in the morning.</p>

As I was talking to her, I saw the wave of my handkerchief, as it was pulled from my pocket. I immediately miss'd it. I turned round and saw the man that took it out give it to the prisoner at the bar. The prisoner was stooping, and the other delivered it to him betwixt his legs. (The prisoner seemed to be shamming buckling up his shoe.) I immediately laid hold of the prisoner, and charged him with my handkerchief, He denied it with a great deal of confusion. I said, he had got it under his coat on the right-hand side. I was going to take it, and saw him drop it behind him. I was stooping to take it up; he struck me, and endeavoured to make his escape. I threw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176209170003"></xptr> on the ground and secured him; but having no assistance, the other ran away.</p>

               <p>There was nobody with me. I was coming from Newington over the water, and saw the handkerchief lying. I took it up, and he said, I had picked his pocket.</p>

I was on duty in Greenwich fair, about four o'clock, on the 17th of May, and saw the prisoner in com<lb></lb>pany with a boy about eleven years of age—I observed the prisoner cast his eye towards a gentleman's pocket, which drew my attention—I then saw him take the boy, who turned out to be his brother, round to the</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Palmer's-green, in the parish of Edmonton; I have one partner - we lost three sheep in June from Lucas'-fields, near the tile-kilns; our flock consisted of fifty, I counted them on the morning of Wednesday, the 12th of June, they were then all right; I did not count them afterwards; but, on the Thursday, my shepherd told me three were lost - I told Foster of my loss; he got a warrant, and we went the same day to Queen-street, Tottenham-terrace - I then went to a shed occupied by the two prisoners - Tuck is a butcher, and the other is a labourer; I believe they are partners - you cannot see that it is a butcher's shop as you go along, there is no window comes in front, but by looking over the wall you can see meat in the shop if the door is open; we went into this shed, and found a haunch of mutton and a side of mutton, but I should not think it had been killed the night before - we found these two live sheep, which I can swear to be mine, they had been branded with a large H on the shoulder; they have attempted to cut it out, but there was enough left for me to trace out the remainder of the H; it can be traced now - they had also a mark of red ochre down the back and over the loins - I saw both the prisoners there - the officer showed them the warrant and said he came to search for sheep, did they know any thing of them? I think they both answered No - we then found these, and one of them said, when I claimed them,"Be careful how you swear to your property" - they did not give any account how they came by them - I have dealt in sheep all my life, these are half-bred sheep; I have no doubt they are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the officer went, did he not say it was to look for some sheep that had been stolen? A. Yes; and one or both the prisoners said they knew nothing of them - I have never expressed a doubt about these sheep being mine; I have always been positive of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you did not think they were yours? A. When I first saw them, it was through a glass, and seeing they were marked in another way, I said, "I don't think they are mine;' but when we got the key and went into the shed, I put my hand on them and said,"These are mine" - it was between nine and ten o'clock on the 12th, that I had seen them safe; the ochre mark on them seemed to have been done a day or thereabouts.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 13th of June, I went to the prisoners shed with Mr. Starkey; but I had been to the shed first and seen the sheep; they were marked with red ochre from head to tail, and there appeared to have been a letter H cut out with a pair of scissors, but the mark is plainly to be seen - when I went with the prosecutor, I saw both the prisoners; I said I had a warrant to search the house for sheep - Tuck took the warrant and read it; he said he knew nothing of the sheep - the other prisoner was present - Mr. Starkey said he could swear to these sheep as his property - I took the prisoners into custody and handcuffed them - Tuck said he had bought these sheep of a man whose name he did not know, near the Bell at Edmonton; I think he said it was on the Tuesday - Bilton did not say anything about them, but he said he was in partnership with Tuck, and lodged in the same house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the person who took the furniture out of the house? A. Yes, by their own desire; I have an inventory of it here, which Tuck made - I was desired to sell some meat, which I did - I paid the rent which was 1l. 16s., and I have the remainder of the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you sell the carcass of a lamb? A. Yes, to a butcher; the sheep we found are fat sheep.</p>

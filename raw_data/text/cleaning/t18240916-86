            . I live in Middleton-street, Clerkenwell; I was in Hanmel-street on the 9th of September, and saw the prisoner in Mr. Mason's garden; I knew he had no right there; when he saw me he ran away; I got to the top of the field, and saw the articles now produced with some others, lying on the ground, they were not in his possession; in about ten minutes I saw him on the outside of the garden; (I had then taken the things home) he was coming back to the place where I first saw him; I called out, and pursued him, he was stopped in Middleton-terrace; he had a knife which Mr. Brown claimed.</p>

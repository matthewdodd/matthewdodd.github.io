               <p>Q. Was you sober? - I was. After that I passed him, and went about two, or three hundred yards or four hundred, I cannot exactly say the distance; but as I was coming along the prisoner at the bar was coming towards me, and I was intimidated at seeing him come towards me, but I recollected that the watchman behind me was so near, and he was on his duty, that I passed him with confidence; the prisoner past me, and he had just past me about a yard, he then turned about, and put a pistol to my breast, and said your watch and money directly, and made use of no bad expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he hold this pistol? - He turned it on me.</p>
               <p>Q. In which hand did he hold this pistol? - The right. On which knowing the watchman was just behind, and it may be thinking he was rather nearer me than he was, I sprung back from him, and ran to the watchman, crying out thieves! thieves! watch! watch! I lost sight of him then, he ran away; I saw him about an hour after in the second field, in the New Road; I was over in the field to search for him, and four or five more of Mr. Wright's officers with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did this happen to you? - Near one o'clock on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him? - Two or three of these people brought him up to me; I had been hunting for him along with other people for half an hour.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260076"></xptr>Q. Did you know him again? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drest in the same way as he was before? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to seeing this man at the time he attacked you in this way, was it moon light, or what sort of light was it? - It was between light and dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamp there? - No, It was so light it did not need a lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of hat had he on? - I think a cocked hat, but I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of clothes? what colour? - Black, the same as he has on now. The barrel of the pistol struck my eyes, as being bright, it was not an iron one.</p>
               <p>Q. As to his hair, how was his hair? - I have no doubt of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an honest man and ought to be cautious how you swear. Do you mean coolly and deliberately to say, that he was the man? - I am sorry to say that, I am obliged so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you took him again? - I believe he might say I am not the man, or was it me? or words to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to that? - I said he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time I was taken how far was it from where was apprehended and detained by the officers, from the place where he was attempted to be robbed? - I was robbed in the road, and where he was taken by the officers I cannot tell; the officers brought him to me, the second field distant from where I was robbed, not half a quarter of a mile, or a tenth part distant. The man behaved exceeding well, he made use of no bad expressions.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any man with him at the time? - I did not see any man with him; I saw a man just before him; he ran across the field, and I followed him, I ran as soon as I was spoke to by Mr. Hurnall; I followed him over two fields, then I lost sight of him among some cows; as near as I can possibly tell in the night, he was dressed in black clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again that night? - I saw him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you say that was the same man that you had followed? - The runners brought him to me before that about a quarter of an hour after I lost sight of him, they brought him along side of my watch box in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to be the man that you saw before with the prosecutor? - I could not swear to the man, only he had the same clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor come up at the time he was in the hands of the runners? - He came up with some of the runners.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Hurnall say? - He said he was the man that put the pistol up to his breast; the man cursed and swore all the way down to the watch-house, he said he knew nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him did he know my person? - To the best of my remembrance by the clothes, the size, and the make of the person, you are the person.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was Mr. Hurnall and the prisoner to you when he cried out thieves? - Between two and three hundred yards as near as I can guess; the prisoner was about the same distance running from him in the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed? - I really cannot tell at that time of night; he had dark clothes on; that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - I pursued him till he got into that field among the cows, and there I lost sight of him, and the patroles took him coming back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him with the patroles? - In the space of twenty minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face at all? - Not until he was brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he is the same man? - I cannot say, I was not near him till he was brought to me; I see a man, but whether that is the man I cannot say, I believe him to be the same man, being nearly about the size and dress.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Grafton-place—I have been a servant, but have been out of a situation for fifteen months—on the 29th of July I met the prisoner at the corner of Stafford-street and Lisson-grove—she asked me to go with her—I said I had no money—she said, "Never mind, come along"—I said, "No, I would rather go home"—she said, "Nevermind, come home with me"—I went down to the bottom of Stafford-street, to No. 21, Steven-street—we went up stairs—she got a light—I took my hat off, and put my watch and chain into it—I undressed and went to bed—the prisoner came to me to bed with her clothes on—my hat was a white one, and my watch and guard were gold—after she had come to bed, she got up again in about ten minutes with the intention of washing herself—she went to the table, put her hand behind her, and took my watch out of my hat—she opened the room door, called <hi rend="italic">Nance</hi>, and went down—I missed my watch and went down and called the police—my watch and chain, and seali were worth about 201.—I bought them abroad, about four years ago—I hate never seen any of them since—I am sure the prisoner is the woman—I bad no money—I had not a farthing.</p>

I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together that night—I noticed the prosecutor's hat was white and he had white trowsers—they passed me and went into a house not far from where I was—I saw the prisoner and another female come out of the house in about ten minutes, and they went towards Lision-grove—a man ran after her and gave the prisoner a bonnet and shawl—he came out of No. 21, the same house as the women came out of—I heard the prosecutor halloo "Police!"and two policemen were passing—I am sure the prisoner is the woman—I knew her by sight, but never spoke to her.</p>

             told me, that they had taken these things out of his box; I questioned him concerning these things, and he admitted the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. In what manner did you question him, tell us all the conversation? - I enquired where they found the things, I was told in the prisoner's box, the prisoner was by, and he admitted that they were there, and that they were mine, he hoped I would shew him mercy; I spoke thus, how could you have the infamy to treat me so, who knew the size of my family, and know how hard I work; he hoped I would shew him mercy, says I, you may depend upon it, I will make an example of you in future for others; I shall take the necessary course of the law.</p>
               <p>(The Things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. Was the box locked or open? - The box was locked and the key was lost, it was broke open.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. In order to support this with all the evidence I could, I enquired after some of his acquaintance; this pair of gloves and handkerchief, I found in the possession of a young woman, servant to a gentlewoman at Islington, but I believe her to be a good young woman.</p>
               <p>Court. Is she here? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Very well, then say nothing about her. - He admitted that he had given them to her; some part of the gloves are in the possession of the constable, which he took from his person, out of his pocket, and the pin which we now mention, was found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of all these things? - I had stated them under the prime cost, in the indictment; I beg leave to mention to your Lordship, that I wished not to lay them so as to affect his life, but I could not get information on the subject.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they taken out of your house? - They were not removed out of my house.</p>
               <p>Court. If they were removed from the place where they were left by you, and where you thought proper to keep them, without your order or consent, it is as much a taking away, as if they were carried to York.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Have I now an opportunity my Lord of altering the amount of the sum, I have not a wish to hurt his life: I will value them at thirty-nine shillings and eleven-pence if you will give me leave.</p>
               <p>Court. You must take care you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300070"></xptr> have sworn before to real value, and I do not know how upon oath you can go back, having once fixed a price of that sort.</p>

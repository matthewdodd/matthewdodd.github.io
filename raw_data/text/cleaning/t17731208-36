            , is bricklayer to the East India Company. On Friday the 29th of October, the prisoner and another man went to work for Mr. Petit, master bricklayer at the East India coffee-house, which is next door to the India House; on the 29th, Friday, it rained into the India House; I sent to our master on Saturday; I went up and discovered a great quantity of lead taken away; I was looking over the parapet wall, and there I saw the prisoner wrenching this pipe away from the Company's premises; this pipe came down into Leadenhall-market; it was against the side of the wall of the house; he reached the lead from the inside of the trough.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not carried any off?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, because he saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loosened from the house?</p>
               <p>Smith. I saw him pull it down; he removed it four feet from the Company's premises upon another person's; he left off when he saw me; then he drew his ladder up and went off the premises; I asked him who he was at work for; he said Mr. Petit.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any business there?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; he was at work on the India House coffee-house; this was some distance from that place; he had got there by letting down a ladder; the pipe was twenty or more feet from where he was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or no any thing he was doing there might require this pipe to be moved though he had no right to move it?</p>
               <p>Smith. It lay a great way off, and it could be of no use in his work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pipe higher or lower?</p>
               <p>Smith. The pipe was much lower than he was at work.</p>

            . Upon the 1st of November I had a message from the India House to send a person to take measure of some lead that was stolen; I sent my man; I could not attend myself; when I went to look I found the lead was wrenched off by force: I am master plumber to the company.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it be of any service in the job he was upon to remove this pipe?</p>
               <p>Goodwin. No, it could be of no use.</p>

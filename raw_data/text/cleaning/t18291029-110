               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What wages did you give him? A.Fifteen shillings a week and a bushel of coals; there was no arrear of coals due - he booked the coals himself up to the 5th of September; he has lately opened a shop: he told me of it, and I said he might do what he pleased -I discharged him on the 5th of October; he said there were five bushels of coals due to him, but I did not know of this then; sometimes he booked them, and sometimes I did - I do not believe there were any due to him; the book will prove there were not thirty-six bushels due to him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon was it after the 5th of September that he left you? A. On the 5th of October - there could not have been more than four or five bushels due to him; I never authorised him to take thirty-six bushels to his own shed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were forty bushels of coals owing me; I have them in in the winter - I had had half a chaldron of cinders of him, and a load of wood of Mr. Winkworth; when I had a bushel of coals I put it down retail, as I did what I sold.</p>

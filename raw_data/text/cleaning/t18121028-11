He said, follow me, I dare say I shall find it for you. The prisoner turned down St. Mary Axe. The officer took hold of him, and found the handkerchief in his bosom; that is all I know of it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 16th of October, before twelve o'clock, I was in Leadenhall-street; I saw the prisoner stand by an engine; he was watching every gentleman that walked by: he touched a gentleman's pocket, left him, and followed Mr. Green. I was not certain that he had robbed him. I asked Mr. Green if he had lost any thing, he said, yes, his pocket-handkerchief. I pursued the prisoner. I said, I want you, my friend; and before I accused him of taking any thing, he said, here is the handkerchief; he dropped it, and I took it up. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief, it is marked G.</p>

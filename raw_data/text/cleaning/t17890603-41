               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Are you sure that this is all that you know about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now in the first place; what is this young lad? - A coach carver.</p>
               <p>Your husband is in the same business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In whose employ is this young man? - One Mr. Harris, in Shoreditch; he was his apprentice, my husband had known him some time; my husband works at Mr. Savage's in Queen-street; he never worked for my husband; he was not in my husband's employ.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively, or only to say that you do not know he was not in your husband's employ? - He was not, positively he was not.</p>
               <p>How came Mr. Harris, his master, to call upon your husband to threaten him for detaining his apprentice? - He never called at our house.</p>
               <p>And told him that if that young lad did not quit his employment, he would bring an action against him? - He never was in our house in his life, nor I never heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>How long was he in your house this day? - Most part of the day; from ten o'clock in the morning, till four o'clock in the afternoon; it was his own fault; you know; my husband asked him if he was going to work; he went out with my husband that day.</p>
               <p>Do you know the christian name of the person you rent the room of? -

            ; the young lad never was at our house before, and I never saw him at our house; I said my husband knew him, but not me; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Did not you know from your husband that he had frequently trusted him, and that he had frequently done jobs for your husband? - No, he never assisted my husband, he never was past our house before; that I know positively.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you went to your drawers? - Immediately as I went up stairs; the drawers were open, and a gown and petticoat of mine that were in the same drawer were left, and the clothes were gone; my husband and me knew where his master lived; he was taken up Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>There was no search after the young man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively, that before the Tuesday, you or anybody on your account went to his master's house? - My husband went on the Monday about five o'clock; I knew of no quarrel between Mr. Harris and my husband about his being detained from his service, and Mr. Harris has made no complaints that he was detained; Mr. Harris said if we did not punish his apprentice he would punish us; he has been taken up two or three times for a run-away apprentice; he said if we did not punish the boy, he would punish us for not punishing him.</p>

               <p>I lost a coat, waistcoat and breeches; I was not at home when they were lost, it was on the 4th of May I heard of it; my wife came up in great confusion, and told me what happened, in consequence of her information, I went to Justice Wilmot's and took out a warrant against the prisoner, and gave it to one Shakeshaft; on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030049"></xptr>Monday evening I informed him where the prisoner lived, and on Tuesday the prisoner was taken; the value of the clothes is three pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you known this lad? - About four or five years; he was at this time working as a coach carver; I believe he was very near out of his time; I look upon it, he was capable of making a good living, I fancy he was a good workman; I have worked for about eight months in the same shop that his master kept; I never employed him, the day this happened, was the day he ever was in my room.</p>
               <p>You have had some little squables with Mr. Harris? - No Sir, never in my life; Mr. Harris objected to this boy being out of work.</p>
               <p>Did he accuse you with that? - He could not.</p>
               <p>Did he? - Never, till this late affair happened.</p>
               <p>Why, has he not threatened to bring an action against you, for harbouring his apprentice? - Not that I know of; his wife told me he would punish me for not turning his boy away when he called to see me; he never was in my room in his life, till that very day she complained to me for that particular time; he was examined twice at the office.</p>

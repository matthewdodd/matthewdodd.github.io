                  </hi>. I am a widow, and occupy a room in Mulberry-court, Whitechapel. On the Saturday in April, before Easter Sunday, two young men came to my room, about half-past 5 o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner is one of them—I have a son who gets his living by playing the violin—they inquired for my son, and said he could get a dollar for playing for the night at a raffle—Mrs. Flaherty, a neighbour of mine, was in the room when they came in—I told them my son did not live with me—they then wished for some beer—I said I did not want any—they pressed very hard for it, and Mrs. Flaherty said, "As you press so hard, I will go and bring you a drop of beer," and the prisoner gave her sixpence—they had been there then about five minutes—when Mrs. Flaherty came in with the beer, they asked me to drink—I would have none—Mrs. Flaherty just put it to her lips, and drank a little of it, and they drank it themselves—Mrs. Flaherty then went away down to her own room—the prisoner then asked me how old I was—I told him I was 65; with that, he took hold of me by the throat, I think, with his right hand; he took hold of me so that I could not speak, or call out—the other one then came and took a brown holland bag oat of my pocket, it contained 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it consisted of one crown piece, and the remainder in half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences—it was money I had worked for, and saved up—I buy old clothes—when the man had got the bag from my pocket, he went down-stairs—the prisoner still had hold of me by the neck, and continued to hold me about three or four minutes, when he threw me on my side on the bed, and left the room—after he was gone, I had no feeling, and no power; but when I recovered, I was quite sensible of what had passed; I got up, locked my door, and went to bed—my throat was very sore next morning, and I was very hoarse for ten days, and my throat was swollen—I did not complain of what had happened, to my son afterwards—I went and told the City police about it on Easter Sunday, next morning, about 11—I saw Mrs. Flaherty about 9 next morning, and told her—that was before I went to the police—I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken into custody by Mr. Bateman, two or three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She stated at the police-court that her money was one crown piece, and all the rest half-crowns. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, there was two shillings and two sixpences—I do not know the name of the officer that I complained to on the Sunday morning; he is the officer on the beat in Petticoat-lane—I went over to him—I had never seen the prisoner before to ray knowledge.</p>

I live at I, Mul<lb></lb>berry-court, opposite Mrs. Hussey—I was in her room at the time the young men came in; the prisoner is one of them—I did not know him before—I am positive he is the person—it was between 5 and 6 o'clock in the day—they inquired of Mrs. Hussey about her son, and said if they had known of him on such a night, they could have given him a dollar for a night's play—I</p>

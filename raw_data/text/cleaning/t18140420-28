I felt another tug at my pocket, and on my turning round I found the two prisoners in possession of the officer, Brown.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I was on duty on Easter Monday in Newgate-street, about two o'clock, the children were going into church; I observed the two prisoners following the prosecutor; I watched their motions, and got close to them. I saw the prisoner Wiatt take the book from the prosecutor's pocket, and put into the hands of Frazer. I immediately collared both of them. Frazer threw the book in among the children. I let go Frazer to pick the book up; some gentleman laid hold of him as I turned round to pick the book up. I took them both into a shop and searched them both; on Frazer I found another pocket-book. This is the pocket-book that belongs to Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my own pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Wiatt said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Frazer's Defence. I am now fifty odd years of age. I have been the father of twenty-two children, eleven of which are alive now. I had been to my employers, Mr. Smith, of Postern-row, Tower-hill, with some pens that I had finished. He gave me twelve hundred more to go on with until he sent the porter with more. I had my boy with the quills in my hand when Brown, the officer, seized me. Before that, I felt something hit against my hand; I did not see it; it fell to the ground. When the officer picked it up, it appeared to be a pocket-book. As to the prisoner, Wiatt, I do not know him; I never saw him before.</p>

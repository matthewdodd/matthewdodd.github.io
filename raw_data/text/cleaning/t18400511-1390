                  </hi>. My father, Charles Oliver, lives in Clare-hall Cot<lb></lb>tage, Waterloo-place, Stepney. On the 7th of April, I went to his house about ten minutes after eight o'clock in the evening—I saw a light through, the window—my father was in the country at that time—I found the front door ajar, and an iron scraper placed against it inside—I entered the pas<lb></lb>sage, and two men came out of the room into the passage—they were both strangers—I asked them what was <hi rend="italic">up</hi>—they said, "It is all right, and <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> is backwards"—I said I did not think it was all right, nor should they go out till I had seen whether it was right or not—with that they struggled with me, and one of them said, "D—his eyes, knock him down"—they forced their way out, and got into the garden in front of the house—I attempted to take hold of them again, and they got through the gate, pulled the gate to, and struck me in the breast with it—they got into the street—I followed them into the field—one of them (the prisoner) fell down, and then I secured him—they had both been running—I was not out of sight of them at any time—it was nearly dark—it was twilight—I am sure I had them in sight the whole time, from the time of their getting to the gate till the man fell—I was close to them when they got out of the gate—I hit against the gate with my breast, which closed it—I had to open it again—I was about eight yards from them when I got out, and they rather gained ground—when the man fell, they were about as far from me as to the corner of this Court—they ran fifty or sixty yards before I caught them—I lost the other man entirely—the prisoner and I struggled in the field—I called, "Stop thief" all the way I ran, and when I secured him I called out for the police—a man named Bunn came up and helped me to hold him, and then Sergeant Shaw came up—we took the prisoner back to the house—I found every thing out of place and in confusion, drawers broken open and boxes too, and the things all in an uproar, all brought out into the middle of the room—the prisoner was taken to the station-house by a policeman, who Shaw gave him to—I afterwards went with Sergeant Parker with a lantern, which we got from the Maid and Magpie public-house, to the place where we had seized the prisoner, and found there four pairs of stockings and a crow-bar—I saw the prisoner in the passage from the light which was in the room, and know him by his face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Oliver, who is the son of Charles Oliver, who occupied Clare-hall Cottage. He was out of town at the time this happened—I and my husband had the care of the cottage while he was away, and lived in it—we always lived there—he was only gone on a job in the country, and was expected back again—on the evening in question I left the house about half-past six o'clock, with my husband and two cousins—I left the doors locked, and the shutters shot outside—we came home between one and two o'clock in the morning—we found my brother-in-law in the house, and the door broken open—I saw marks on the door next morning, as if it had been forced by a crow-bar—the drawers had been broken open, and the things turned out.</p>

About a quarter after eight o'clock on the evening in question I heard a cry of "Police"—I went up, and saw the prisoner struggling with Oliver—the prisoner fell—I went up and secured him—Bunn was up before me, endeavouring to assist the pro<lb></lb>secutor, when I got up. but when I first saw them there were only two of them—I saw Bunn go up and assist before I got up—I collared the prisoner, and asked Oliver what was the matter—he said he had found this man and another in the house—the prisoner said. "I never was near the house, you knocked me down, and almost cut my finger off"—I took him back to the house—I found the front-door had been forced—there were marks on it, and the bolt of the lock was forced out of the box—the room was in confu<lb></lb>sion, and the property turned out of the drawers—a candle was burning on the drawers in the bed-room—the house is all on the ground-floor—I found this handkerchief stretched out on the bed, and this linen in it.</p>

On the night in question I went to the Maid and Magpie public-house with Oliver, and got a light—we went to the field, and found four pairs of stockings and a crow-bar—Oliver pointed out the place to me, and the things wore found on the exact spot where he pointed out as having scuffled with the prisoner—I examined the bed-room door that night, and found a pressure, apparently done by some instrument just the width of this crow-bar—it was between the door and the jam—I put the crow-bar to it, and afterwards measured it, and consider decidedly that it corresponded—the drawers were inclosed with two folding-doors, and there were similar marks on those doors—I saw some marks on the outer door, but they appeared more forced by the body than an instrument—at the station-house 1 observed that three pairs of the stockings had blood on them, and remembering at the time the prisoner was brought in that his finger was cut, I asked him how that happened—</p>

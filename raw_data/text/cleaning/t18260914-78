            . I am a watchman. I was turning from Fleet-market to Holborn-hill, and heard a cry of Watch! I ran towards the sound, and saw the prisoner strike Mr. Morrison; he was about two doors from the corner of Field-land; he had the handkerchief in his hand when he struck the prosecutor; by the time I got up he ran down Field-lane; I followed, and never lost sight of him till I took him; Mr. Morrison staggered from the blow, and seized the handkerchief at the same time; the prisoner said a girl gave it to him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the night of the 30th of November I had a great quantity of linen to wash, and some of my own; there was a quantity of wet linen in the basket, which I and my daughter had washed through that day, and there was some in water- among them were the articles stated in the indictment; they are now here; they were washed, ready to go home the next day - when I got up the next morning the linen was all gone; the window had been taken quite out - the linen was marked when I lost it, but when I saw it again some of the marks were picked out, and some cut off.</p>

            . I am a constable of Edmonton. I got a warrant to search the prisoner's house, in Claret-street, Edmonton. Mead found most of the property in the house - I stood against the door, and saw him go into the front room, take a pair of stays from the fire, and say,"This is what I am looking for."</p>

prisoner stood against it, looking out - I went in directly.</p>

            . I am constable of Enfield. I went on the 3rd of December to search the house with Camp - I went into the front room, and found this pair of stays, hanging by the fire drying - I asked the prisoner who they belonged to; she said, "They are mine;" I said, "Then you are my prisoner;" I searched the house all over - I found the flooring, at the bottom of the house, was hollow; it is raised six or seven inches - I opened a door under the stairs, and put a stick under the floor; I felt something there - I then laid down, and dragged these articles out in this bag, which was nearly full: these are the articles - some of them have had the marks picked out, and some cut off; I found this cloth full of articles besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wash-house? A. I do not remember any; there is only one room up stairs, and one down; I think I saw two children in bed; a man, she cohabited with, came out as I went in - I will not swear that she was not at the next house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch manufacturer, and live in High-street, Borough. On the 26th of last July I went to the prisoner's counting-house, No. 24, Lime-street—he said he wanted some flat silver watches, to show to a friend of his in Liverpool, to see if they would suit the American market—I said I had not got any ready to send out for samples, but he should have some next Saturday—I could not get them ready then—the prisoner called on me on the Monday following—I said I could not get the watches ready, and I bad sent him a note to that effect—he said he had not received it—he then said, "Let me see the watches"—I did so, and he said, "I will take them as they are"—they were not in a fit state to send out for samples, and I told him so—he said his friend was a dealer in watches, and was a judge, and, of course, he did not expect new watches to look like those which I only sent for samples—upon that representation I delivered him three watches—he asked me to let him have them for eight or ten days—I said he might have them fourteen days, and then I was to have them back—I considered I had only lent them to him as samples, for fourteen days—they were to come back if approved, to make some of the same sort by—they were not in a state to be sold, neither as samples or otherwise—they required cleaning up—the silver dials wanted cleaning—they were not in a fit state even for samples, but he pressed so hard on me—he said if they suited, he would give me an order for fifteen or twenty dozen—I said they were to be returned in four<lb></lb>teen days, to a day—I particularly stated that—three of them were worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—finding they did not come back, about three weeks after, I went to the prisoner's counting house, and asked him if the watches had come back, and whether they suited—he said they had not come back, but they would be back in a few days, but they did not answer, they were too dear—he read a part of a letter to me in the German language, and it appeared to me to be his own hand-writing; it was written on another letter—it was never intended that the prisoner or his friend should become the purchaser of these particular watches—they were to be returned at all events, whether approved of or not as a pattern to make others by, if I got the order—he only said, "I want these watches as samples for my friend, I have not any interest in them "—these arc two of the watches—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the third has not been found.</p>

            . I saw the prisoners together on the night of the 24th of February - they attempted several pockets, and I mentioned it to the officers; I saw Boston take hold of a gentleman's pocket, put his hand into his pocket, and take out this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS. This is the handkerchief. I asked Boston what was on it - he said he did not believe there was any thing on it, but there is J. C. on it.</p>
               <p>Clark's Defence. There was a mob of two thousand people - the handkerchief was picked up behind two women; I was two yards from this young man - I had not been in the crowd two minutes before I was taken.</p>
               <p>Boston's Defence. The officer caught hold of me first, I asked what he wanted, and he let me go - the J. C. are the initials of my second father's name.</p>

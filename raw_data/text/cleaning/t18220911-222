            . I am a watchman. Clegg, another watchman, who is now in Ireland, sprung his rattle, I found the prisoner in his custody; she denied having the half-crown, but in Piccadilly she pulled it out of her mouth. Diaper was sober - she did not say he gave it her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave it me, and then wanted it back. I refused, and he went away, passed two watchmen, and then gave me in charge - he said, If I would return the money he would not give me in charge; I did so, but the watchman made him give me in charge.</p>

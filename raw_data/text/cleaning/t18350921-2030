                  </hi>. I live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. The prisoner came to our warehouse on the 23rd of June, to look at some cloth—I showed him several pieces—he selected one, and desired me to cut six yards, which I did—he then chose some waistcoating—I made the bill out—he said his father would pay for them—I said, "We do not trust any one"—I merely knew his father from being a tenant of mine; but I said as I knew his father, if he wanted a cut of cloth I most have an order for it—he went away, and brought this order in a short time, and I let him have it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Mr. Tucker, Please to let the bearer have the cloth, and waistcoat-piece, and I will call in a few days and pay you"—his father afterwards gave me the duplicate, and said he had sent him out of the country.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mr. Joseph Manesty.

                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on Saturday morning last, on the Greenwich-road, about a quarter past five o'clock—I did not know the prosecutor's house then—I know it now—I was about three miles and a half from his house—I saw the prisoner riding on a boy mare, and stopped him on the road—he was riding slowly—he had a horse-cloth and roller on the mare, and a halter—he was coming towards London, in a direction from the prosecutor's—I asked him who the bane belonged to—he said, "To Captain Manesty, of Woolwich"—I asked where he was going to take it—he told me to Chelmsford, in Essex—I asked him if he was a servant—he said he had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and to find his own livery, and that he was servant to Captain Manesty—I asked him if Captain Manesty was in the army or navy—he said, "In the navy"—I asked him if his master had given him a note or letter—he said, "No"—. I asked what money his master had given him to defray the turnpikes with—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him how long he had been in his employ—he said, "Last November twelvemonth"—I asked him what was to be done with the horse when he got to Chelmsford, whether it was going to be sold—he said it was too large for his master, and he was going to take it to his master's brother—I asked him why he did not have a saddle—he said his master only had one, and he might want to go out before he came back, as he should be gone two or three days—not believing him, I took him into custody, and locked him up at Greenwich—I then went and made inquiry—I went to the prosecutor's house, and saw Toomey—I was present when he saw the mare and claimed it—it was the same mare the prisoner was riding when I stopped him—he was going at a slow pace—I kept walking with him as he was going towards the station-house—after I questioned him, I detained him—I told him I should take him to the station-house—he said nothing to that—he went willingly—when I began to search him, he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a purse, and said, "Oh, master gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. last night, why, I must have lost the money"—I found no money on him.</p>

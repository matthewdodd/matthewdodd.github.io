On Tuesday morning the 8th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I was sitting in the parlour, by the side of my shop, at tea, with another son - James was gone into the shop to serve a customer, and John was not at home; the prisoner opened the door, and said, "Do you know, Ma'am, the front door is open?" we have a private door - I was so very much alarmed I ran out, and found the door open; there was no dirt on the stairs, she then said, "There must be somebody in the house;" I took the candle to look; there was no dirt on the stairs, nor any appearance of any body having been there - she said, "There must be some person in the house;" I went up with my youngest son, George, and the prisoner followed me up - as soon as I got on the landing-place I saw my bed-room door open, my drawers open, and things strewed about; I screamed out, and my son James, and the man he was serving, came up - I was very much frightened, and as soon as I recovered I saw a Policeman and strangers round me; I went up to a room on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070062"></xptr>second floor, and found the drawers pulled out and things strewed about in both the right and left-hand rooms - my son James called out, Mother, my watch and brooch, and John's watch are gone, the prisoner then walked into her own room, which is on the same floor - the Policeman and I followed her; her room was not in disorder, but she went to her box and said, They have been here too, the Police-man said, "Have you lost any thing?" she began talking hold of something, when was wrapped up? I think it was an old gown, and put it between her feet, on the floor - the Policeman said, "What have you got there?" she said, Nothing that belongs to my mistress;" he then took hold of it, opened it, and the two watched and brooch fell out - the man in the room said"No stranger has done this, you must be the person;" the Policemen said they must take her - I begged they would not, but they took her to the watch, she put her things loosely into her box, and went away with the key - a pair of silk stockings, a silk handkerchief, and a pair of under stockings, were found in her box, while she stood there - they were under the bundle the watches were wrapped in; the watches and all the things had been in my son James room, in a drawer - the Policeman came next morning, and asked if I missed any thing, I said, "Yes, a bit of silk," and I thought the paper, it had been in, laid in her bed-room - he fetched her key, and the silk was found at the bottom of her box, under the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. What day of the week was this? A. Tuesday - she was acquitted yesterday of stealing the silk, and I then preferred this indictment; it was the fault of the persons at Hick's-hall that this bill was not found before - I should not have gone up stairs if she had not told me the door was open; it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - she once brought me a brooch of my son's which she found; she was going to leave me on the Friday.</p>

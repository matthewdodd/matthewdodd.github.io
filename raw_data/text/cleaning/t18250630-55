               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master has frequently let me out of an evening, and given me the key of the side door - this led me into bad company, and I had gamed, and lost money. On the 4th of June I went and paid that money at the house, or else they would have exposed me to my father, but it was my master's letting me out of an evening, which was the cause of it.</p>

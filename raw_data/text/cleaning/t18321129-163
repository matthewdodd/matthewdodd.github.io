On the 13th of August five men came into the shop, and had some beef and bread - I served them; the prisoner was one - they were all in company; they began to be rather noisy, and my brother turned them out - I had a jar standing on the counter, it contained thirty-six penny pieces, and eighty-four halfpence; when the prisoner was gone this jar was missing - three of the men have been apprehended and convicted; I knew the prisoner before.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutor. On the evening of the 13th of August I saw the five persons together, and watched them for half an hour; they went into the shop, and tried to throw the jar and some papers down - I watched them out, and saw the prisoner and his brother go into a little alley; Mr. Wass then went to have a pint of beer, and one of those who were before tried, got the jar, and gave it to another, who ran off - the prisoner said to me, "If you say a word about my brother I will kick the front of your head in;" I ran and called the Police; the prisoner was not taken till now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not see the prisoner eating his meat quietly at the door? A. No, he came to his brother when I charged his brother with this; I am a housekeeper - my husband is a wheeler; I get my living by hard-work.</p>

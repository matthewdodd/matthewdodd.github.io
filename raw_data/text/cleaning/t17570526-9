               <p>M. Filling. I found them again at the pawnbrokers. The prisoner had absconded. I found her in the custody of a man, and I charged her with taking the things mentioned in the indictment. She own'd she did take them, and also where she had pawn'd them. I went with her to four different pawnbrokers and found them. ( Produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

            . I live with my mother, at No. 3, Gray's-buildings, Kingsland-road. On the 4th of June I was nearly facing Reed's shop between me and two o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another, they were going up the road - he looked into Reed's shop - I went away for about half an hour; as I returned I saw the prisoner taking some pistols out of the window - he took two or three: they were both there - there was a piece of board to the window which was broken; the prisoner put them under his jacket, and then they walked away; Miller, who was with me, went and told the master - the prisoner was then taken; I saw him drop one pistol from his coat -</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I believe it was in May, 1829, he came into your service? A. Yes; he had not to do the duty of two clerks, or any extra duty - he might in my absence have accounted to my partner, or to other persons; he was not always at home in an evening; he used sometimes to go out as a traveller for a day or two - I do not know that he was ever out for a week, or that I ever allowed a period of two weeks to pass without requiring an account; I always asked him what money he had when I saw him in the office - on the 23rd of January I showed him a letter from a gentleman, stating that he had paid his account; he had entered some money two or three days before that, and I had gone through his books with him about a weeks before -I had gone through the books weeks and weeks after Christmas, as some were behind hand; I never entered into any negotiation with him to treat these sums as a debt, and for him to give me security; I did mention the name of a Mr. Abbot, an attorney, but I did not direct him to go to him - I did not speak of a bill of sale, or warrant of attorney; he mentioned them to me - I did not send any person to take an inventroy of his effects - I authorized Mr. Abbot to hand over to the prisoner a small sum of money due from Dr. Phillimore, after the discovery; I know there was some money paid to the firm -I believe there is a bill of 25l. from Mr. Bryan; at the time he was taken, he stated there was about 15l. due to him for wages - there was not a bill of 20l. for disbursements; there was about 4l. for some trifling expences.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did he ever account to you for the three sums mentioned in the indictment? A. No - the sums alleged to be due to him would not cover the sums he has received by eight or ten times; he has received above 300l. for which he has not accounted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Should the sums he receive be entered in a book? A. Yes - he enters them himself, and then hands them over to me; he left us abruptly, without notice.</p>

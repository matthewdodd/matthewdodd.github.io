                  </hi> I am wife of John Theodore, of the Stag, Fulham-road in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea—the prisoner lived with me a month—on 25th April I received information from Stevens, my bar-maid, and went into my bed-room, on the second floor, about twenty-five minutes to three o'clock, and, from a box on the table, I missed a gold watch and chain, seal and keys, two diamond rings, a brooch, two gold hair pins, a mourning ring, and a gold keeper, and from the barmaid's room adjoining, a gold watch, and from the room below a gold pin and silver pencil-case—my box was unlicked—I had seen the things safe about five minutes to two o'clock—the value of them is about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent for a policeman and searched the house, but found nothing—the kitchen window looks into a yard which</p>

               <p>leads into a skittle-ground adjoining the tap-room—about half-past one that day I was in the back kitchen, and saw the prisoner getting in through the window—she must have come from the yard—that gave her an opportunity of speaking to any one in the skittle-ground—I asked what she had been doing out there—she made no reply—she was servant of all work, and had no right in the yard or skittle-ground—it was after that I saw my property safe—the prisoner had no right in the bed-rooms in the middle of the day, as her work was done—I kept a purse in the drawer—persons who usually came into the bed-room would know that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector.</hi>) I was sent for to Mr. Theodore's about four o'clock, on 25th April—I satisfied myself that the robbery must have been done by some one well acquainted with the house, and in the house at the time—the place where the money was taken from was where a purse of money had been kept for a considerable time—the person must have known that, as the articles were taken from the corner in which the purse was usually kept—the corner was rummaged about—the prisoner was then brought to me from the kitchen—I said, "I must examine you: a serious robbery has been committed in this house"—she said, "Well; you may"—I put several questions to her—she said, "But why am I questioned more than any one else; I have not been up stairs since the morning"—I said, "It is necessary that all parties should be examined"—she was very re<lb></lb>luctant to be examined—the barman was then examined—a few days after<lb></lb>wards, in consequence of what I heard from him, I gave instructions for the prisoner to be taken—she was searched, and nothing found on her—a person must pass the tap-room door to get to the skittle-ground, which is a very confined one, to pass through the window into the kitchen.</p>

On the Thursday after<lb></lb>noon about five minutes to two o'clock, I went into the bar and remained there till twenty-five minutes past two—the family were at dinner; they dined at two—there is a clock there—I could see the staircase that leads to my mistress's bed-room—the prisoner went up at five minutes past two—no one else went up in that time—I did not see the prisoner again till about twenty-five minutes to there, after the robbery—if any men had come in for refreshment I should have served them—I served no one in that interval—if any one came in they must have had some other object.</p>

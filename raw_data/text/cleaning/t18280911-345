I lost three silver spoons from my back room behind my shop, between ten and one o'clock - they had been in use at breakfast time, and at dinner time we missed them; they were two tea-spoons and one salt-spoon- I went to the constable - Knight was taken the same day; I had seen his brother before.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I produce two tea-spoons and a salt-spoon, pawned with me by Knight; he offered them - I rather suspected him, and he said he would fetch his mother; he went and fetched Hawkins, who said they had been left her by her brother - this was on the 2d of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HAWKINS' Defence. I will tell the truth about them - I had been up Piccadilly to help a woman to a coach; she gave me a shilling, and I returned and met Knight, who said that young Sage had given him these spoons to get some money; and the gentleman would not take them without some one went to speak for them, and I went - I know nothing about them; Sage was outside the door, he sent him with the spoons, and said they were for his master; the spoons had been there two or three hours before I went.</p>
               <p>KNIGHT's Defence. I was at work, picking potatoes, and Sage said "I have three spoons of my masters;" I asked who his master was - he would not tell me, but he asked me to go and pawn them; I did so - they would not take them of me; I came out, and saw my aunt passing by - I asked her to go and speak for me, which she did.</p>

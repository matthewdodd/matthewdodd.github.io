                  </hi>. I live at No. 13, Old Brompton, On the 21st of April, about six o'clock in the evening, I was at the Hungerford steam-boat pier—as I was stepping from one steam-boat to another I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner close behind me—he immediately made away round the fannel of the steam-boat—I felt, and missed my pocket<lb></lb>book—I went round the funnel and called out, he ran to me in great agitation,</p>

               <p>and handed me my pocket-book, and said, "I trust you will treat me like a gentleman"—he was going from the vessel towards land—he had not come out of any vessel—I have the pocket-book, and produce it.</p>

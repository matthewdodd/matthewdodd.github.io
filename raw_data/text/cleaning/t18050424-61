               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 18th of March I was going down Bishopsgate-street to the East-India-house, to get a ship; as I was going along there was a mob of people running on the other side of the way; I ran to see what was the matter, and there was a man they said had stole something, but what I could not tell; presently afterwards a gentleman said he was a constable, and stopped me; I was taken into a public-house, and the next day to the Mansion-house; I never saw the bag before I saw it at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you feel it.</p>

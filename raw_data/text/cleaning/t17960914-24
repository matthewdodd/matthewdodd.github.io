            , junior, sworn.</p>
               <p>I am son of the last witness; on the 30th of July, near twelve o'clock at night, I was alarmed by the barking of the dogs; I got out of bed, and opened the window; I heard the rustling of the geese, as though somebody was trying to catch them; I went and called the man, and desired him to get up; I went down to my father's yard, where the geese used to lay, and I could not find them, and then I went round the back side of the buildings, and coming the back way into the yard again, I found the gate propped open; and then I called to my father, and told him I thought the geese were stole; I listened at the top of the hill, and could not hear any thing, and then I went into my father's orchard, and within twenty yards of the orchard gate, I met the prisoner with a sack at his back; I took him by the collar, and insisted upon searching the sack, which I did; and found it contained nine geese, and I took him down to my father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them to be your father's geese? - A. They are my father's geese I am sure; for I have seen them every day, and ten times a day; they were left at my father's house with two or three men the rest of the night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been out a harvesting, and coming home late at night I was very much tired, and I laid down in the shed; and this farmer came with a pitch-fork and this bag and took me.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the witness.) Q. Was he making his way from your dwelling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got a large family.</p>

I did for a shilling, we went and spent it, and then went out; we went up into Red-lyon-street, and saw this cellar window open; he asked me to go down, I told him I would not; as I was by the window he shov'd me down, then he bid me hand him up the first thing I could get. I handed him up a firkin of butter, he carried it home, and came again and took six cheeses; at that time I laid six cheeses on the window ready for us next time. We went home, then he asked me to come again, I told him I would not; he said, if I would not he would go and tell the man. Then I went again the third time, when I was got down in the cellar a gentleman came by, and said, the window was open, so I got up and run away; then we went home and staid all night.</p>

I fastened the pigs up at seven o'clock, on the night of the 28th of June, and bolted them up in the pig-pen, so that they could not get out. The coachman alarmed me about two o'clock, and told me the pigs were gone. I saw them in the Back-lane, at Clapton, near Hackney, about four o'clock, the same morning; they were laying in the road, panting for breath. Some of Mr. Johnson's pigs were stolen, and they were with my master's.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner, lying in the Back-lane, by a shed; he was about two hundred yards from the pigs. I never saw him in the possession of the pigs. I asked him why he left the pigs? he said what pigs? I said the pigs you were driving through the gate at Clapton, about half an hour ago. He said to the best of his knowledge he had not seen a pig for three weeks. I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>1 Q. On the 19th of November last you had some goods at your door, and a chest that was going to Henly upon Thames to go by the waggon that evening; did you miss any of the parcels there? - A. The chest was taken away about seven o'clock at night. I had seen it at the door about a quarter of an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it contain? - A. Waste paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of it? - A. Two pounds two shillings. I was informed that the chest was taken away, and my bookkeeper went after the prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You are bookkeeper to Mr. Buttery? - A. I am; as I was attending to my business in the office, a lad that was standing at the door with a cart, ran into the office, and said, bookkeeper there is two men run away with the chest: I immediately pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them? - A. Yes, I saw them carrying the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Were two or one man carrying it? - A. two, the prisoner at the bar and another man: I overtook them; I took the prisoner at the bar with the chest in his hand; he was carrying it with one hand on the side of the chest, and the other man on the other side. It was nearly opposite a public house in Piccadilly; I put the man and the chest in this public house, and I sent for my master, I kept the chest in this public house, till the constable came, and then I gave it him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040032"></xptr>Q. You took the prisoner into custody I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the chest that you took from him? - A. Yes, I know it by my own name, that I wrote on if before I gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. That chest was under your master's care, was it? - A. It was; it was booked at my masters warehouse, to go by Cook's Henly waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not put into the waggon? - A. no; the waggon was not come up to the door, we expected it every moment, it was put there for the purpose of being loaded in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I should like to know how long it was before the lad gave any information where the chest was taken away? - A. Immediately as you took it away the boy came in; it could not be above half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that I was fully committed, he said he apprehended me at the distance of about sixty yards? - A. I apprehended you on the pavement exactly opposite the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was placed in the public house passage; if the landlord was here he could testify; I pushed it as I was going in the door? - A. I took you as you was carrying it in your hand; it was not placed in the passage, I took you opposite, then I pushed you into the passage</p>
               <p>Q. This chest was positively placed in the passage by two persons, they run away? - A. There was only one run away; you were carrying the chest with your left hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are positive that you saw the prisoner at the bar actually with his hand upon carrying it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says the distance was only sixty yards where I was apprehended, it was scarcely possible that he could see me carrying it, he being in the office when the boy run in and informed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from where the boy told you that some body run away with it? - A. About sixty yards, I believe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the mean time he fell down by the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall down? - A. I did fall down in pursuing him; I saw the prisoner at the bar before I fell down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He made use of this expression, that he fell down and nearly split himself; he was all over mud.</p>
               <p>Witness. I did fall down; I saw him before I fell down, and after I got up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was a foggy night, you could not see.</p>
               <p>Witness. It was not foggy at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether foggy or not foggy, you are sure you saw the prisoner carrying the chest? - A. I am quite clear of that.</p>
               <p>- LOVETT sworn. - I received the box the next morning of Mr. Dean; I have had it ever since.</p>

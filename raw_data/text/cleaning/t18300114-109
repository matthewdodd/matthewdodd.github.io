On the evening of 5th of December the prisoner came to me in the shop, and asked if Mr. Humphries lived there; I said No - he then asked if my master was at home; I went to call a servant, and saw the prisoner take the coat off the counter, and run away with it - he was brought back very soon, but the coat has never been found; I had every opportunity of seeing the prisoner, and am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was it? A.Half-past six o'clock in the evening; I had never seen the prisoner before - he was in the shop about five minutes; I have always said I knew his person - I did not say at the Police-office that I thought he was like the man; I am quite sure he is the man - he only asked me two questions; he was there about three minutes.</p>
               <p>JOHN JAMES FORD. I am the owner of the shop. I was coming home accidentally, and heard my boy cry Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and stopped him; he had nothing - I saw no one else running: I missed a blue body coat from my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not a great thoroughfare? A. Yes - he was seven doors from my shop; I could not swear there were no other persons running, but the prisoner was running across the road.</p>

               <p>(Prosecutor deposes to the spoons by the cypher R. A. I.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Look at the blond lace? - I know this to be my property by the corresponding numbers in my book.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark upon it? - There are particular numbers on the cards; they are not my writing.</p>
               <p>Had you lace of that sort which you missed? - I had; and particularly done up in one parcel, to put by, which I not immediately wanted; they would not have been wanted till next Midsummer.</p>
               <p>Do you think it a hard bargain to lend a guinea on them? - I suppose, to speak within compass, they cost me above forty shillings: the lawn probably is worth three guineas; I would not so particularly swear to the lawn, as they were all wrapped up together; and the pawn-broker's boy confessed he had taken them all.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made to him? - There was no promise or threat.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he had been a very bad wicked boy, and had taken the spoon, but confessed to nothing more: I repeated the question, I believe, fifty times: when these things were produced, he then owned he had taken them; I believe he confessed all the things that Carpmeal has; I recollect seeing Mrs. Tate wear this ring very frequently.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>

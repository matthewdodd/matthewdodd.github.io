               <p>JOHN GILLMAN. I am a Thames Police-officer. On the 8th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was on the water; the Dover Castle ship was laying near Blackwall in the City canal. I saw a boat rowed towards the ship, the prisoners, Roberts and French, were in it, they rowed alongside; a bundle was thrown out of the ship into the boat, and then another; I then went towards the ship, the boat was rowing towards me, when they saw me they pulled towards the opposite shore; Roberts knew me, I called to him by his name, they rowed on the opposite side; I called to Bly, who was on the opposite side, to stop them, which he did and sent them over to me; I found the bundles in the boat were cables - I asked Ro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170080"></xptr>berts where they got them, he said from a man; French said Roberts had told him to help him row the boat. I think that was the case. I went to the ship and found the other part of the cable, it appeared to have been recently cut. I saw the prisoner, Williams, on board, he was given into my custody, we told him we took him on suspicion of robbing the ship. Bly went to look for Exham, who was a ship-keeper.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BLY. I am an officer. I stopped the prisoners, Roberts and French, who were rowing the boat; I afterwards went on board the ship and saw Williams there; I afterwards found Exham concealed in the coal-hole, without his shoes; I found another bundle on the gun-deck, tied up ready to be moved, and the cable which had been just cut; I asked Exham what he did in the coal-hole, with his shoes off; he said he did not know who was looking for him, and he was afraid.</p>

            . I am a sailor. I was on board the Dover Castle. On the 7th of August, the day before the prisoners were taken, Roberts and Exham were on board the ship, Exham fetched a pot of beer and left Roberts on board, when I came on the gun-deck, I found the cable cut and concealed under some leather, next morning about nine o'clock, Roberts came on board with some bags, I asked him what he was going to do with them, he said he was going to put them out of port directly; I gave information to Gillman; Exham was the ship-keeper; the cable was whole a few days before that. Williams did not belong to the ship.</p>

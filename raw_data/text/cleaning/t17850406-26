               <p>I was sent to see what was the matter by the prosecutrix; I was setting in the parlour with the prosecutrix, we heard a noise in the adjoining house; I asked for a light and the key of the street door, which she gave me, and I went into the other house, and opened the door with the key, which was double locked; going into the parlour I saw two or three men; as soon as I went in they jumped out of the window; one out of the parlour window, and one out of the closet window, which they had broke open: I left the parlour, and caught the prisoner coming over the garden wall into the street.</p>
               <p>Should you have known he was one of the men that was in the house? - No, my Lord, I cannot swear that he was in the house: I know he is the man that was coming over the wall; I gave him a blow and I cut him in the arm with a knife, he made a great resistance, and we had a very hard struggle, and he tumbled down in the street, I secured him.</p>
               <p>Had he taken away any thing? - No, Sir, I secured him till the watchman came to my assistance, he was sent to the watch-house, and then I went into the house, and found several people in the house; and in the passage I found a closet window broke open; the plate of the shutter had been taken down, a pane of glass had been broke, which lets the hand into the screw; the screw was taken out, and the sash was thrown up, and so they got in; the lock of the closet door was forced open, which communicates to the parlour; we found the lock of the parlour door open, it was opened with an iron crow, I saw the marks after; we examined all the gardens; I said there is a neighbouring garden; and the watchman found the keys in the street and in the garden, and brought them to us, and the canister was found under the window in the garden, where they jumped out.</p>
               <p>Where did the canister stand before they came into the house? - In the closet.</p>

               <p>Was it an empty closet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of the closet? - Close to the window, close to the frame, which I look upon, by jumping out of the window they dragged that with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am journeyman to the prisoner, and have been so since before last Christmas—I saw some one bring harness to him on the 28th of March, about nine o'clock—I did not hear him make any offer of the harness for sale—I did not hear what was offered—I saw money pass—I did not hear the person who brought it say any thing to the prisoner—I only saw the harness brought and some money paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this in the morning or evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Morning—my master was not taken into custody at the house—I remember his being in custody—I did not hear what for until Harrison came to our house on the Friday morning—the Friday after the Tuesday I heard he was in custody, not for stealing a harness, but for receiving one—Harrison told me that was the charge—I went to the police-court—when Harrison told me about it, I did not tell him a man brought it there—he did not ask me, and I did not tell him—I did not tell until I was called upon—I knew my master was locked up—I went to the Justice the second time, on the Saturday—I did not give evidence—my master's attorney called me as a witness—I was attending, but was not examined—I heard a witness called by my master of the name of M'Laney—he is not here to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anybody present when the man brought the harness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a gentleman present—I was cutting his hair at the time—he was the only person present—I should know him if I saw him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That gentleman was not the Mr. M'Laney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It must be, sir—I was sent for on the third examination before the Magistrate—I was not called to give any evidence at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me you knew he was in prison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—Harrison came to me on the Friday morning—he had not been there before the Friday to my knowledge—he was not there before my master was taken up to my knowledge.</p>

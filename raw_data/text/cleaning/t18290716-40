               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons were near you? A. The prisoner and the person with him were the nearest to me; there was a multitude of people before me - I did not see the prisoner speak to the other, but when I seized the prisoner he got away; I did not say at the office that I did not think he was the person who took my handkerchief.</p>

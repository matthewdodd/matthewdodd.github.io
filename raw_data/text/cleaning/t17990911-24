               <p>Jury. Q.Did you make the watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have made a great many watches, I dare say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you lived in Southampton-street? - A. Between four and five years.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have made and sold a great many watches? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you put your name, and Southampton-street, upon every watch you have made there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a watch was it? - A. A metal watch.</p>
               <p>Q. After this lady had been with you, you went to the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, for ought you know, you took it out with you in your pocket? - A. I cannot say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where the prisoner lived? - A. Yes; he told me that very day, that he lived in Queen-Ann-street, West.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went to his mistress's house three days after? - A. I went the very next day, to tell her what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there? - A. I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, in a few days after, Mrs. Goring went to Brighton? - A. I do not know any thing about that the prisoner went with her to Brighton; I did not imagine that he had taken it, because, being a gentleman's servant, it would be ruination to his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner subsequent to the time of your having lost your watch, and previous to his being taken up? - A. Yes, he came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that he had heard such a thing rumoured that was so prejudicial to his character, and he was ready to go with you to Bow-street, or any where else? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not actually put his horses to the carriage, and drive you, and the Bow-street officer, to Bow-street? - A. He did, to take his oath.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you found your watch again? - A. About a month.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Mr. Dean's, No. 133, Oxford-street: A man brought me a watch to repair for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man? - A. I believe he is, but I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you satisfied that he is the man? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it that he brought this watch to you? - A. On Tuesday the 6th of August, about two or three o'clock in the day; he came in, and said, he would be much obliged to me to look at his watch, for it stopped, it was a metal hunting watch; I looked at it, and saw the watch had had a fall, or a shake; I asked him if he could leave it for two or three hours; he then desired me to lend him another hunting watch instead of that, he left me his watch and took another away with him; the watch remained there till Thursday the 9th, when the Bow-street officer came to me, and produced my watch that I had given to the prisoner, and I carried the other watch to Bow-street. (Produces the watch in question).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You told my Lord you could not swear he was the man, and yet you say you have no doubt he is the man; how do you reconcile that? - A. From circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is from circumstances that have transpired since that you are induced to believe he is the man, and not from a recollection of his person? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your name in the watch that you gave the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means do you know that watch? - A.There is the name of Russet in the watch.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you know the number? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If any other person had got into possession of that watch, could the Bow-street officers know, from the watch itself, that it belonged to you? - No, by no means.</p>

               <p>Q. You found the watch-maker's watch upon the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was in consequence of the candid disclosure of the prisoner, where he got that watch, that you discovered Mr. Higginson's watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you gave the same account of it at that time? - A. Yes, if I was to tell the story twenty times over, I should not very it I am sure. (The watch was deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Young. This is the watch that he left with me, and this other is the one that I lent him.</p>

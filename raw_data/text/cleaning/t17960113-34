               <p>I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On the 4th of December, the prosecutor came to me, and acquainted me, that he was robbed; I went with him and took the prisoner in custody; in searching her pockets, I found the duplicate your Lordship has just seen.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Pawnbroker.) Q. Where are your duplicates? - A. They are upon the articles.</p>
               <p>Kennedy. I found these duplicates, and this little shirt, which led me to the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. (To the Pawnbroker.) Do your duplicates correspond with these? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took them to pawn to get the woman more support than her husband allowed her.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor.) Look at these things;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130065"></xptr>do you know any of them? - A. Some of them: this table-cloth has my mark; and this sheet is marked; the child's things I know by sight, but I cannot pretend to swear to them; my wife died too, and lay a corpse in the house at the time some of these things were pawned; this child's bed-gown I know very well, it belonged to my child that died, six months old.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Myness. I can swear to this frock and shawl; it is the property of Mr. Butler; they were my property before, and I sold them to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Butler.) Q. Upon your oath, did she pawn any of these things for the support of your wife? - A. No, my Lord, upon my oath, she wanted for nothing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Myness. The last article that was pledged was while the man was gone out with his wife's corpse.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Myness.) Was that defence set up before the Magistrate? - A. No, my Lord.</p>

            </rs>. (Aged 35.)</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury, before Mr. COMMON SERJEANT.</p>
               <p>Court. You have aggravated your crime exceedingly: in the first place, you were taken into the house of a poor man to nurse his wife and child; to take advantage of that, is such an offence, as calls loudly for punishment; and, therefore, be assured, that the highest punishment that the law can inflict upon you, I shall think it my duty to inflict.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Pawnbroker.) You know perfectly well, that, by Act of Parliament, you are bound to put upon your duplicates, not only the name, but place of abode of the person pledging things, for the purpose of detection; in no one instance, in all these duplicates, have you put down the name of the place of her abode; and you, yourself, knowing her name to be Yates, to receive them in the name of Cousins. Depend upon it, if you had been brought here for receiving stolen goods, I should have thought it my duty to leave it to the Jury, to consider whether you did not take these things into your house, knowing them to be stolen. Your's is a very useful business, when properly conducted.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. My Lord, the Jury wish to return you thanks.</p>

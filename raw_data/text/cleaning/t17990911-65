On the 6th of March, when I employed her, she came at seven in the morning, and washed the things; I told her, if she was out of employ, it would be much better to have a servitude; I agreed to give her two shillings a week; on the 9th of March, I went to market, and left her in the house; I was gone about three quarters of an hour; I came home, and found my door locked; I then went down to the people in the shop; I lodge in the one-pair of stairs; after making enquiries, I went up stairs, and saw the glitter of a key in a little slit upon the second-floor stairs; I then opened the door and went in; I had occasion to go into the bed-room, and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment, and others which are not found; I found my property at the pawnbroker's, his name is Hewitt, the corner of Queen-street, about seven weeks ago; the pawnbroker has them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up? - A. At the time that I was told that my things were at Mr. Hewitt's, about two months after the robbery; I was yesterday obliged to take up the evidence, and had her bound over at Bow-street, because the prisoner had threatened her life; her name is Mary Simpson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Where do you lodge? - A. No. 32, Peter-street, Soho, I have lived there two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you taken in that time? - A. I never employ a servant, only I took this one out of mere charity.</p>
               <p>Q. She was the first servant you ever had? - A. No; I have had servants before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Skerman, and live in Margaret-street, Clerkenwell. About a quarter before two o'clock, on the 12th of November, I went out, leaving my daughter Louisa. who is ten years old, at home—I returned in about half-an-hour, and she began telling me about some one having been there, and my lodger, Charles House, came in with this copper, which is ours—when I left home, it was fixed in the Wash-house—I found it had been taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at home, a knock came to the door, and two sweeps, one of whom is the prisoner, came, and asked if the chimneys wanted sweeping—I said, "No"—he asked if I did not want them swept to-day—I said, "No"—I asked if he had been ordered to sweep them—he said, "Yes"—he went down stairs—I saw him trying to do something to the copper—a little while after, he told me to tell the other to bring the sack down—I went, and did so—they were going away, and the lodger came down.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at Mr. Skerman's. I was coming home, and saw the street-door open, and when I went to my room, a sweep about fifty years old came up, and said the men were down stairs—while I was talking, the little girl, the prisoner, and another man, came up—the prisoner asked if the up-stairs chimneys wanted sweeping—I said, "No"—I thought the prisoner's bag looked rather bulky—I went down, and missed the copper—he was then gone out—I went, and brought him back, with the copper, which he threw away.</p>

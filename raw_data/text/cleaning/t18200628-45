I was walking with my wife's sister, and my wife was walking behind with a lady. My attention was attracted by seeing my wife run after the prisoner. I had not observed him near me. I joined in the pursuit; my wife laid hold of him and charged him with stealing my handkerchief - he denied it. I then felt and missed it. I have never found it.</p>

I was walking behind him, and, about forty yards from the church, I perceived three boys walking between me and him - the prisoner was the middle one. I saw the prisoner stoop and take the handkerchief from my husband's pocket. I laid hold of him directly, and the other two escaped - they were about twelve years old. The prisoner struggled very much to get from me, and drew me into the middle of the road. He was secured immediately, without having broke from me. I saw him hand the handkerchief to one of the others.</p>

On the morning of the 17th of November I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner take a bundle of shawls from the further end of the shop - he placed them under his coat, and ran off; I followed - he ran too fast for me; I called Stop thief! and he threw them down - he was stopped near Westminster Session-house; I took up the shawls - they were my master's</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I take them? A. I saw you put them under your coat - I did not see you take them down from the nail; You threw them down about twenty yards from our shop, in Dartmouth-street.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner near Westminster Session-house, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; he was about sixty perches from Dartmonth-street - I saw him run out of Wilson-street; the witness and some labouring men were following him - I ran; when he saw me he stood still - the witness came up in less than a minute, with the shawls in his arms, and said he was the man who came into the shop; the prisoner denied it, but on the way to the watch-house he said, all that could be done was to transport him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You never saw me run? Witness. Yes, you did, till you saw me within three or four yards of you, and then you stood still.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going towards the Session-house, and saw a good many people; I stood twenty minutes before the Policeman came up - Williams then came up, and said, "That is the man;" I was standing looking at the people, and asked what it was - I wish to ask Williams if he saw my face when I took them.</p>

            . Yes, I did; I know it was him - I only lost sight of him as he turned the corner, but I had seen him several times before, when he has come in and asked the price of things; we had lost several things in the course of that week.</p>

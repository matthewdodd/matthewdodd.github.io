On the 6th of August he went out, I believe to go to dinner; one of my partners followed him, and one of the porters - he was brought back, and I charged him with having stolen some stockings; he said he was very sorry, he had done so, and that he had been tempted to steal them - the officer took these stockings from his trousers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not promise if I made any confession you would not hurt me? A. No, I made no promise of any kind; we perhaps kept him a quarter of an hour in conversation, as we wished to know if he could give us any information on an another subject - he gave us a great deal of information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. John Grant, of No. 70, London wall, pawnbroker; I sleep in the shop. On Monday, 16th May, I was awoke by a noise—I heard the side door which leads into the passage open; it makes a noise when opening—I noticed a glare of light from a lantern or candle—I immediately jumped out of bed, went, into the back shop, looked through the window, and saw the prisoner, Jackson making his way on the top of the water closet—I heard a noise of more than one person calling out "Jackson," from the house top—I went to the door of the next house, and met three men coming out of Carpenter's Hall gates—there was a policeman within twenty yards, and I called his attention to them—they went to the policeman and passed him, one on one side, and the other on the other—on looking over the premises I found two hats and some tools, one of the hats has been tried on Jackson, and it fits him (<hi rend="italic">the hat was here produced, and tried on Jackson</hi>)—I found the shutters on the first floor had been opened with a centre bit—they are bound with iron, and have bars at well—the wood work was riddled—the lead work of the plate room had been pulled up, that is where we keep valuable plate—there was a great quantity there—I found a chisel left by the burglars—it fitted the mark under the lead—I have tried it—they got in at the second floor window—they must have got on one another's backs—the window shutters of the first floor were very much strained—a centre bit would have done what I observed—I saw Jackson again at the station house on the Monday following—this occurred on the 16th, Whit Monday—I have no doubt that that is the man.</p>

Waterlow's house, they rent the next door—that was all the opportunity I had of seeing him—the men had caps on to the best of my belief—the window in the shop is plain glass, it had been cleaned about a week before.</p>

Waterlow rent the Carpenter's Hall premises; it is a printer's, I believe—it is next door to our house—when I went out into the street I saw the three men coming from the same passage that leads from Carpenter's Hall—the man on the water closet could have got to that passage—I heard a noise of other people in the house—I know they got out at the second floor window, because there was no other open.</p>

On 16th May, at 4 o'clock, I was coming down Saddlers'-place, and perceived three men; the two at the bar were among them, and one made his escape to the Circus—they were coming from a few yards this side of Mr. Grant's, from the direction of Carpenter's Hall—I saw the prosecutor behind me—when he perceived me, he called out, "Police, stop thief"—as I advanced they separated; one man struck off to the Circus—I could not perceive which it was—the others passed one on each side of me—Smith went on my right hand, and the other on my left—they went towards Bell-alley—I sprang my rattle, followed them to Bell-alley, and lost sight of them—I met another policeman, and gave information to him—I can only swear to Smith—when I saw them, two out of the three had no hats on.</p>

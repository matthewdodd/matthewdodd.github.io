On the 8th of December I went to the Pavilion, in Whitechapel-road, with a friend; I had the head-ache, and did not like it - I went out, and was standing in the street - Fagerty came, and accosted me - we talked some time; Williams came up - they asked me for some gin, and we all went and had some; I then went to a house with the two women, and went into a room up stairs; I took out my watch, and locked at the time - it was past six o'clock - I gave them half a crown a piece, and then 1s. to get some gin, which Wiliams went for; Fagerty then kneeled before me, and we made an agreement; she took the watch from my pocket, but I did not see her do it; she had not been out of the room, but had gone to the door and come back - then I put my hand, and missed my watch; I said, "You have got my watch;" she began to cry, and the landlady came up - she asked her where the watch was, and took the candle to look on the bed; Fagerty said, "I took it from him, put it into my bosom, and gave it to Mary Williams - why did she go away and leave me; I will go and look for her;" I said,"I must take care of you - you shall not go till I have my watch;" I went down stairs to the people in the house - the landlady and I were going to look for Williams, we met Mr. Prendergrass - Fagerty said the same thing to him as she had to me; he took her - we went and found Williams, who took us into the room, and said to the landlady"If you will promise me three things, I will tell you where the watch is - if you will wish that you may never see your husband any more; that your house may be burnt to ashes, and that you may be burnt to brimstone, if you tell, I will tell you where the watch is - I took it, and gave it to Rowe"- we went and took Rowe; he swore in coming along, that he had it, but had not got it then - the watch has never been found; I went before the Magistrate the next day, and while I was in the public-house a rascally fellow came and spoke to me; I then went into the room to Rowe - he said, "I suppose you have lost your watch;" I said,"Yes, you know that as well as I do;" he said, "If you will go to such a house, I will treat you with a bottle of wine, and send for a man who will get the watch;" a man came showed me a duplicate, and said, "I have got the duplicate from Rowe;" it was pawned for 25s. - I went to White Horse-street, and saw it, but it was not my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.You went home with both these women? A. Yes, by their persuasion, but I did not see Rowe till after I had lost my watch.</p>
               <p>SARAH EDWARDS. I keep the house to which these persons came; I let the room to Rowe and Williams, who live together as man and wife - I know Fagerty; I met her, Williams, and the prosecutor going in. as I was going out on the 8th of December; Fagerty said,******- and then Hall asked me to go and have some gin; I refused, but he forced me, and I did - I then went for some coffee and soap, and when I came back my husband said the girls had gone up stairs with a man; I went up -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140071"></xptr>Williams pushed me back, and went out; I afterwards heard Fagerty cry, and went up stairs - Fagerty said,"Williams has got the watch - I gave it her out of my bosom;" I told the prosecutor I would give him every assistance in my power - I heard Williams was gone to the Cross-keys, in Wentworth-street; we went there, but could not find Rowe - he was found opposite the Pavilion; I asked if he would give up the watch; he said he had got it, and intended to make good use of it, and he would not let it go - the prosecutor offered him four sovereigns for it; he said he would not let him have it by any means - the officer then took him to the watch-house; Williams said if I would swear by my husband's, and my own life, she would tell me where it was, that she gave it to

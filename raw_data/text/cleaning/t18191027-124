As I stood against the post, Henley struck me over the head with a stick, which cut my hat through with the blow - my head was cut in two places; my hat came over my eyes. They jumped out of the cart, pulled me about, and almost choked me; some of them tried to get my watch out, but could not, because my fob was twisted. I had about 322 l. in my pocket-book, and put my hand on it to secure it, then the prisoner and Griffiths came up to me, one of them cut my finger, which was on my pocket-book - they must have had a knife; I think they meant to cut my pocket. I hallooed out for assistance. I could neither move nor stir, I was confined so close against the post - assistance came, they were overpowered, jumped into the cart, and went off. It was broad daylight. As they were going off, one of them said,</p>
               <p>"You b - gg - r, you shall never live to transport another man for stealing iron." I had prosecuted a man for stealing iron, who was transported. I have not the least doubt of the prisoner being one of them. I knew him before, he lived near me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. He must have known that you knew him - A. I think so. I know two or three more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, at the office, or somewhere else, you said to him.</p>
               <p>"I know nothing of you, I cannot say you was one of them." - A. Never.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you never see him from that time till he was taken - A. Never. I did not know where he lived then. The day after the 27th, I was going to the gate, as before, saw him in the road, and ran after him - he got away. I seized Griffiths, and he also got away. The prisoner was taken three weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know where he lived - A. Yes. I heard of this charge on the 27th, and have been twenty times after him - he had absconded. I knew Griffiths well, and have often seen him in the prisoner's company. I had seen Henley and all of them in the cart, on the day of the robbery, at a quarter after seven o'clock, about a mile from the gate, coming from the fair. I know the whole gang.</p>

Then he took me to the house of Davis; I then took my clothes to Mr. Davis. I paid a shilling for the night, and on the next day, I went and looked out for a ship. The prisoner took my clothes, and went away; on the night of the 5th I missed them. My handkerchief and book I found on the prisoner, and the next day I found my coat; the prisoner had sold it to a barber. The bundles I gave to Mr. Davis to take care of. I lost two bundles altogether; containing all the articles in the indictment, and many more.</p>

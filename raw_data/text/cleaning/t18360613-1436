                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 37,—St. Pancras. I know the prisoners—I saw both of them on the 25th of January—I saw Haydon about eight o'clock in the evening at Mr. Tipping's yard—nobody else was present—he said he wanted to speak to me, and told me he had found some notes—he showed them to me, and I looked at them—there were two</p>

               <p>£10 notes, and four £5 notes—he then asked me to pass them for him—I told him I did not know any thing about the notes, and would note pass them—I told him to keep them for a few days, and there would be a reward offered for them—he said that would not do, that he had been driving a lady who had dropped them, that he had been with Mr. Tipping to the lady and made it all right, and there was no suspicion that he had them—I then took the notes to Chuck, and stated the case to him exactly as Haydon did to me—Chuck said that it was all right, he could pass them—that he knew a gentleman in the Strand who bought notes—I then gave Chuck a £5 note, which he changed at his lodging—I went to him next morning—he said the gentleman in the Strand has something to do with the Custom-house affair, and would have nothing to do with the notes—that he passed a £10 note at Shoolbred's, in Tottenham-court-road, a £5 note at the Little Gun, in Norton-street, and a £5 note was a lost in London-street—I don't know where the remainder were changed—I had between 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money—Haydon had 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Chuck had the remainder—I heard of the prisoners being taken into custody, and went into Billerica in Essex, and stopped there six weeks—I then had information that every thing was all right, and returned—I was apprehended on the 8th of May, I think, by Collier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman, and live at No. 9, Brunswick-street, New-road. I took Chuck into custody on the 2nd of February—Haydon was at that time in custody for this offence—they were remanded five times, and Cocks being out of the way, both were discharged—I took Cocks afterwards, about two o'clock in the morning of the 8th of May, in Tottenham-court-road—I afterwards took Haydon at five o'clock the same morning, and he said, "I suppose it is about the notes," adding that he knew nothing about them, he was as innocent as a child unborn—I was present at the apprehension of Chuck, about nine o'clock the same morning and he said it was now all up with him, now Cocks was taken, and pointing with his finger to his neckcloths, he said, "This young gentleman will be <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>"—I got a parcel of cloths from Summers for a pair of trowsers and two waistcoats.</p>

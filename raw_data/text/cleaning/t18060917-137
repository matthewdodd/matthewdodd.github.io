               <p>Q. That was the same muslin that you shewed to Mr. Eccles. - A. It was, it has been in my possession ever since. I produce it.</p>

He was apprehended in Pump court near Barbican; we took him in custody to a hackney coach stand, put him in a coach and took him to New Prison; we told the prisoner that if we had been in town that night we should have got the whole of the property; the prisoner said if it was not for the bloody Nosers we should not get half the swags we did.

               <p>Court. What day was it you were in Fann street. A. The day after the robbery. We were searching after the parties, we went to the Coach and Horses in Fann street; the prisoner said if we had come where he was, we should have a four corner bowl, meaning the bowls that they played with they should have thrown at us; Armstrong and Vickery were present in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner lodged. - A. I did, I never say him in his apartment, I understand it was his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Marchmont-street, Burton-crescent. On the 25th of November I was at Newgate-market—I bought a side of veal at Pocklington's, down the lane, in the market—my cart was in Warwick-square—I did not see the veal in the cart my<lb></lb>self, but it was lost soon after, and found at a beer-shop—I can identify it, because it is a very peculiar side—it is very white, and has a sweet-bread on it—it is a peculiar colour—when I found it it was cut up, but the whole side was there except a small part of the breast—I found it within an hour and a quarter—I swear positively that it is mine.</p>

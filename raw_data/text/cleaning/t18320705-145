Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning on the 6th of June, I was at my master's door, and saw two men loitering about - I watched them till twenty-five minutes past eight o'clock; I then saw them go up the street and fetch the prisoner; the prisoner and another went up the prosecutor's yard - the other stood and watched, and the prisoner came out with these veneers on his shoulder, and went across the street - I gave information, and he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you see where he brought the veneers from? A. No; they seemed a heavy load - I had seen the prisoner about seven minutes before the others called him: he was about twenty yards from there, and came when they called him.</p>

I was going down Sun-street, and met a gentleman, who asked me if I wanted a job; he took me down the yard, and placed the veneers on my shoulder - I said they were too heavy; he said he only wanted me to carry them to Long-alley; I crossed, and went down Dunning's alley - I then stopped to ask a person to help me up with them - the gentleman came up, and told me to carry them back, which I did.</p>
               <p>MR. OLIVER. He was not stopping; he was going on with them - I assisted him to take them back: when he got back he said some person desired him to take them.</p>

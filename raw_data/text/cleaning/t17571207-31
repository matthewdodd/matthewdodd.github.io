               <p>Q. Describe the coats.</p>
               <p>Williamson. They were blue lined with yellow; the great coat had plain yellow buttons, the other had yellow buttons with crosses on them like a harrow.</p>

               <p>Williamson. I searched the prisoner's lodging where he was quarter'd (he is a soldier) and found the stockings; they are very remarkable ones, being black mended with purple worstead.</p>

            . I keep a publick house in Buckingham Court, Charing-Cross. The prisoner came to our house on a Tuesday night, the beginning of November, about 7 or 8 o'clock, with a coat on his back which I know to be Mr. Lisle's livery; he asked me to pull it off (it was over his regimentals) and put it by for him till he called for it, which I did; he called for it next morning, bringing another man with him, who bought it of him for 7 s. and 6 d. and changed a 9 shilling piece with me to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was it?</p>
               <p>Wyn. I took the man to be a Jew, he was an old cloaths man.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not detect him, as you knew the coat?</p>
               <p>Wyn. I did not suspect it then to be Mr. Lisle's livery, but knowing his livery well I afterwards thought of it, it was a blue coat lined with yellow and brass buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wyn. He belongs to the guards.</p>

            . On the first of November at night I followed the prisoner down King-Street, he was very much in liquor. I sat down on the next steps to the White-Horse-Inn, and he went down the yard, where the stables are, but there is no thorough fare. I was there above twenty minutes, and did not see him come back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you waiting for him?</p>
               <p>E. Lamb. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williamson. Is that a thorough-fare?</p>
               <p>Williamson. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Lamb. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>E. Lamb. The clock struck nine before I left the place.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williamson. Was the stable door lock'd at that time?</p>
               <p>Williamson. It is very seldom or ever lock'd, the yard is a close yard, and he must get in before the gates were shut; the gates were found open the next morning.</p>

               <p>An old cloaths man brought a coat to me, the button holes were not lined with yellow; I bought it of him for 5 s. We had a man deserted, and I bought it to put on, that he might not know me when I went to take him; I was out several days after him, but could not find him.</p>

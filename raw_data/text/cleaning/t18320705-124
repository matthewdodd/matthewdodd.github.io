             (Police-constable K 256). On the 2nd of June I was informed of this, and took the prisoner in High-street, Poplar; I charged him with the robbery - he was silent at the moment, but on recovering himself, he denied all knowledge of it.</p>

I put his chest and hammock in the carman's care, and as I had some other things to mind, the cart went on without me; I stopped with the prosecutor, and told him to go to a gentleman about getting his cigars back - I then went out, and told a young man to go to the prosecutor, and tell him I was gone on to the Bell, in the Highway; I ran there, and got there before the cart - when it came up, it unloaded some things; the prosecutor came up, and we went on, and delivered the chest at his house - he has seen the carman, and took 1l. 14s. from him.</p>

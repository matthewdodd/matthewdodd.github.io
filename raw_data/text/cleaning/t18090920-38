               <p>Q. In consequence of something passing in your mind, did you watch the prisoner on the 12th of August, did you observe him going away from his employ that morning - A. Yes, I followed him about an hundred yards, when I came up to him, I said Mr. Cooper you must come back, when he came back I asked him what he had in his parcel, he said a pair of pantaloons, I took the parcel in my hand, and found it was very heavy. I desired him to untie it, he did so, and the pantaloons appeared; I opened the pantaloons, and it contained two or three parcels of these types, they were tied up in paper, the writing on the paper described what type they were, the writing was my overseer's.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to you - A. Oh God! Mr. Harding it is all over with me, and added that it had been a very unlucky week to him.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the value of these types - A. They are worth fifteen pence a pound as old metal, the value of the whole found upon him was between</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you call them papers of types -</p>
               <p>A. Because after printing they are separated in sixteen parts of a sheet, and tied up in paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the trade any particular name for them when they are tied up - A. I believe not except in the manner which has been used.</p>
               <p>Q. Would any body know by a paper of types what they mean - A. Yes, as I have stated as many letters as compose a page.</p>
               <p>Q. That in the trade would be called a paper of types - A. I do not know that there is any specific term for it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the jury, I commit myself to your mercy, and trust that as it is the first felonious offence that I have been charged with, I shall not solicit in vain, particularly on account of my family and relations who are of respectability. I might have had several citizens to my character, who could have spoken to my honesty, but I have preferred the danger of not having the best of witnesses, rather than plunge the best of parents into the greatest wretchedness; to the best of my knowledge there are but two or three persons except my wife in possession of my reputed crime, and the lenity I may obtain in consequence thereof shall not be ill-bestowed. I will by my future conduct make atonement for the lenity shewn me, and the distress that will fall on all belonging to me, by my appearance at this bar.</p>

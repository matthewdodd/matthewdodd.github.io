On the 24th of April, about a half-past eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoners; I was the worse for liquor, but I knew all the transaction - I passed them- Brown came after me, and asked me to accompany her home; after some time I went with her - as we were going along the other prisoner came up, and said she lived in the same apartment - I went with them to <placeName id="t18320517-86-crimeloc512">George-street, Spitalfields</placeName>

             (Police-constable H 120). The prosecutor called to me; I went up - he said he had lost his watch; he was in liquor, but seemed to know what he was about; he described the prisoners, and I took them at the Two Brewers, in Whitecross-street, in company together, and one of them, (I cannot say which,) threw this watch under the settle - I took it up.</p>
               <p>Johnson. Q.Were there not other persons there? A. Yes; two men and one woman, but it was one of you two who threw it down.</p>
               <p>Brown. He swears false; if he saw it thrown he must have seen who threw it - the prosecutor came to the sign of the Frying Pan, and gave us drink there.</p>

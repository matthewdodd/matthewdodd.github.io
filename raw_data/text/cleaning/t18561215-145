I went to bed from half past 12 to 1 o'clock—I saw the house secured by the shopwoman in my pre<lb></lb>sence—I saw both the parlour shutters fastened—they are outside shutters, and are bolted from within by opening the window—I was awoke about 3 o'clock by the police knocking at the door—I dressed myself, and went down and found the police standing in the passage—I found the parlour shutters broken; the iron work was broken; a skylight in the washhouse was broken, that had been sound the night before—the parlour cupboard had been broken open, and a great many paper packets of copper money taken, as well as some loose in a bag, and some in a tin—I do not know the exact quantity—I had Been it safe the previous evening.</p>

               <p>of money—not knowing whether any one was about in the house, or what it might be, I knocked at the door, rather gently at first—I received no answer—I knocked several times, and after several minutes two journeymen bakers, who were at work in the house, came down stain and opened the door, and said there were thieves in the house—it is a baker's shop—I went in and examined the premises—I found there had been thieves there, and that they had escaped by the skylight in the back kitchen, which was broken sufficient for a man to get out—it leads out on to the leads in the back yard, and to the back yard of No. 11, Beauchamp-street—I went out into Leather-lane, and placed several constables round the premises—I then re<lb></lb>turned to the prosecutor's house, and in the back kitchen found a bag in a hat, containing a quantity of copper money—another hat was hanging in the broken glass of the skylight—the socket that holds the bolt of the back door was broken, and the window bolt was taken off and placed against the table—they appeared to have broken in by the parlour window.</p>

I was on duty in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood of Hatton-garden on the morning of 30th Nov.—I was passing through Beauchamp-street a little after 3 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another man standing in the passage of No. 11—the front door was open—the prisoner was rubbing his eyes, and he said that the sound of the rattle had woke them out of their sleep—I had not known him before—I know now where he lives, No. 1, Plough-court, Holborn-hill—he does not live at No. 11, Beauchamp-street, it is a marine store dealer's—I was not at that time aware that a burglary had been committed, and I did not interfere with them—shortly after I heard of it, I went back again to the passage of No. 11, and there found two coats—the prisoner and the other man had no coats or hats on when I saw them—the coats were in the passage just where they had been standing—the breast pocket of one of the coats was full of copper money, loose, not tied up in anything—the men were gone when I returned to the passage—I had left the prisoner there—the other one Walked close by me as far as Leather-lane without his coat or hat.</p>

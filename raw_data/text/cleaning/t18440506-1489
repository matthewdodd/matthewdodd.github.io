Green came into my service on the 27th of April, and left on the 29th of last Nov.—James is her sister, and was in the habit of visiting her at my house—I saw her there on the evening before Green left—on Sunday the 7th of April, this year, I caused Green to be taken into custody—she was taken to Smithfield station, and searched by the female searcher—a bunch of keys was produced to me—one of them fitted the lock of a mahogany box that used to stand on my bed-room table, where the key of my warehouse was universally deposited, if I was not at home—Green said the keys belonged to her boxes, which were at her sis<lb></lb>ter's—on the same night I accompanied Finn the officer to No. 3, Crown-court—I</p>

About eight o'clock on Sunday night, the 7th of April, I took Green and another young woman—I took them to the station—the other one was discharged—the female searcher handed me a bunch of keys, one of them opened a box in the prosecutor's bed-room where the key of his warehouse used to be deposited—I then went to No. 3, Crown-court, and found James in the first floor front room—I said I had come to take her; she must come to the Smithfield station—she said, "What for?"—I said, "On suspicion of being concerned with your sister in robbing her late master"—I said, "Your sister has some boxes here"—she said, "These are them"—I took her to the station, and came back to the room—I found these two keys opened the two boxes that were there—I found in them some bits of cloth, some velvets, some satins, and linings—I found in one of the boxes this key, which turned out to be the key of the prosecutor's warehouse—I also found a Savings'-bank book—on Wednesday, the 10th of April, I went to Crown-court again—I went to the same room with Russell, and searched a chest of drawers—I found in them some little pieces of satin, and Russell found some remnants of woollen cloth—I opened the drawers by a bunch of keys which I got from a girl living in the house, and who was said by James, on Sunday night, to be her daughter.</p>

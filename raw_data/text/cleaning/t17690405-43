               <p>I belong to a ship. A man asked me several times to go to his lodgings to fetch some linen. Our ship lay at Rotherithe. He lay in one hammock, and I in another. He called me out of my hammock to go and fetch it. We went to my house, where he desired me to stay. He was not gone above a quarter of an hour, before he came back: then we went to the place where the ship lay. She was dropt down to Deptford. Then said he, As I want to buy some trowsers and jackets, we will go over to Rag-Fair and buy them. When we got there, he said, I have got some handkerchiefs, and I want to sell or pawn them. He desired me to go into that gentleman's shop to pawn them. I went in, and the gentleman stopped me.</p>

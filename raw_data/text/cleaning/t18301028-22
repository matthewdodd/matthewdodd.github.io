On the 28th of September, after eight o'clock in the morning, I saw this watch safe at the head of my bed on the first floor - I left the house about nine; the watch was silver, and worth 30s., it had a ribbon, a seal and key - I came home between six and seven that evening, it was safe then; between seven and eight I found the prisoner lying on the bed-room floor, between the dressing-table and the bed - it was dark; I knocked against him when I went in - he said he was in liquor, and came there to look for a lodging; he must have got in by false keys, for the doors were all locked - the front door is generally left open, but there is a door at the bottom of the staircase.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON Q. Was the man drunk when you found him? A. He said he was drunk; I do not know whether he was so or not; he laid down there - I said, "What do you do here?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I came to look for a lodging;" he looked dirty in the face - he did not say he had come for a lodger; there is no maid servant in the house - I had not been in the bed-room before since morning.</p>

            . I live in Goldsmith-street, St. Bride's, and rent the house. Merriott and his wife lodged with me; the prisoner was quite a stranger - I never knew him inquire for a lodging at my house; I had no other lodgers- Merriott's wife is my daughter; my street door is kept open all day, but we have a door on the staircase - I am sure that was shut between seven and eight o'clock, and from six to eight; a person must have opened that door to get to this bed-room-it opens with a latch-key; I had not been into the bed-room that day - I know the staircase door was shut; I saw the prisoner after he was taken, in the first floor room, and saw a phosphorus-box taken from him by Evans.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day of the week was it? A. Tuesday - I keep a chandler's shop; the prosecutor assists me in the business - the shop is on one side of the passage; there is an inner door at the foot of the stairs, beyond the shop door - the staircase door has no communication with the shop; I am frequently in the passage, and looked at that door - I found it shut; we heard a noise over-head, which alarmed us - Mr. Merriott went up stairs, and found the prisoner; we thought we heard the staircase door open and shut just before that - we went to the door, and it was then shut; we came back, and heard the noise over-head - nobody else lives in the house; I had not been out of the house all day.</p>

            . I am Keen's daughter-in-law, and the prosecutor's wife. I left my bed-room about nine o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of September - the watch was then at the head of the bed; I went out about six, and was not at home when the prisoner was taken - I saw the watch at the head of the bed at half-past four that afternoon; it is always kept there - there was nobody in the bed-room then; the bed-room cannot be got at without opening the door at the bottom of the stairs - I had locked the bed-room door, and hung the key in the room at the back of the shop, where we usually live; when the prisoner was taken the watch had been removed from the head of the bed - it laid on the counterpane when I saw it; the two shirts had been in a chest of drawers, in a closet in our sitting-room, which is on the same floor - I was sent for on the prisoner being taken, and when I came into the room I found the two shirts, four or five handkerchiefs, and one of my shifts removed from the drawer, and placed on the table; I am certain they were safe in the drawer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280020"></xptr>when I went out - the prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you were in the room at half-past four o'clock, you took particular notice of the watch? A. Yes, I made the bed at that time - I did not look under the bed; I am certain nobody was under it, for there are chests under it, so that a person could not get the whole of his body under - I did not look at the shirts and things that afternoon, but am certain they were there; they were in the drawer, and not on the table - one room communicates with another; you are obliged to go through the sitting-room to go to the bed-room - there is a back door to the house, but the staircase door is between that and the bed-room; the back door is kept bolted - a person coming in at the back door must open the staircase door to get up stairs.</p>
               <p>EDWARD EVANS. I am a porter. I was called by Keen, my next door neighbour, to assist in detaining the prisoner in the first floor room; I was obliged to go through the sitting-room to get to that bed-room - I there found the prisoner in custody; there was a strong smell of fire - I thought the place was on fire, but we found it was a phosphorus-box which was in his pocket; I saw him throw the case of it but of his pocket - I delivered it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you as drunk then as you are now? A. I was not drunk, nor am I now - I am a porter, and have lived twenty years with Messrs. Middleton and Co.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ASHPLANT. I am a constable. The prisoner was delivered to me - I found a key in his possession, and a latch-key was picked up among others, by Mr. Merriott, on the floor; I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner drunk? A. He was rather in liquor - I had not the least reason to suppose Evans drunk; I do not think him perfectly sober now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you try the latch-key to the staircase door? A. Yes, and it opened it.</p>

            . I am a plasterer, and live in George-yard, Snow-hill. The prisoner lived there with his father - I have known him twelve months; he bore a good character, and kept regular hours - he worked for Hadley and Co., the engine-makers, in Blackfriars-road; he was there till between one and two o'clock on the day of the robbery - an old man in the shop had got married, and stood a drop of beer; the prisoner had some, and perhaps was not able to stand it as well as others.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are these keys used is his business? A. This iron is one of his working tools - this latch-key I firmly believe he made to open his father's door; the others are common box lock keys - this one is a common key used in gentlemen's houses; it is called a master-key.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that key with open wards at each end? A. Some such key as this is used in gentlemen's houses; it might have got into a locksmith's hands.</p>

            . I live at Tipton, in Staffordshire. On the 22d of February, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in the cabin of my barge at <placeName id="t18180401-134-crimeloc747">Brentford lock</placeName>

I left my pocket-book and six 1l. notes in the cabin cupboard. I went to a public-house, and found the prisoner there. I had left him in the barge - He asked me for some money, I refused, and told him he was in debt; he left the public-house. I returned in about three-quarters of an hour, found he was not there, and the pocket-book and money gone. I found him next day at the Magpie, public-house, at Brentford; he said he would not work for a master who would give no money. I told him he had money enough. I went to search him; he had a man with him who knocked me down. I sent for a constable, he found the pocket-book, and four country notes on him, which were mine; the other two were Bank of England notes.</p>

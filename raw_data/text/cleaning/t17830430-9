             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner Littlepage, Mrs. Warrickshall, and her son; on the 11th of March, I was called up at five in the morning, to go and take possession of two thieves that were taken in the night for stealing yarn, and carried to Mr. Lowe's on Poplar Causeway; accordingly I went there and took them both in charge, and as I was going to handcuff them, one of them, whose name was Lane desired me to let him alone, and he would discover the whole transaction, I told him; if he would do that, we would clear the room and get a sheet of paper, and I would take his examination, which I accordingly did; after I had taken his examination, I read it to him, and he signed it in my presence, and one Mr. Tindall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That totally lies out of this case.</p>
               <p>Carpenter. Previous to my going to Mrs. Warrickshall's house, I charged Lowe to assist me to go there, to search for more yarn.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Mrs. Warrickshall? - She <rs id="t17830430-9-viclabel42" type="occupation">keeps a private house</rs>, and is a <rs id="t17830430-9-viclabel43" type="occupation">waterman's widow</rs>; while I was searching the premises, Mr. Hankey and Mr. Blackmore the King's surveyor came and asked me, whether I had found any copper pintles belonging to a ship's rudder and desired me to search for some, which I promised I would.</p>
               <p>Court. What is a pintle? - It is what is fastened to the rudder, for the rudder to swing backwards and forwards. (The pintle produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is it made of? - It is made of base metal; I told them I had not, I searched further, and Mr. Hankey and Blackmore assisted me, we found none; after they were gone, I begged of Mrs. Warrickshall, if she had any copper pintles to deliver them to me, for it would be better to throw herself on the mercy of the gentlemen, Hankey and Blackmore; she told me then, to fetch Mr. Hankey to her, that she might first hear what he said; I went and told Mr. Hankey, and he came and asked her what she wanted with him, she said, she wanted him to shew her mercy in this affair; Mr. Hankey told her, it was not in his power to grant her any lenity, but the law must take place.</p>

               <p>Court. What did she say to that? - Mr. Hankey then went away, and then she asked me what she should do, I told her she had better deliver them up, for I had not done rummaging, she then said she had but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300017"></xptr> one the other was disposed of; I then told her she had better give that up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you say what you should do, if she did not give it up, I told her I had not half done rummaging, she then begged that a sack might be brought to put it in, that it might not be exposed in the streets; this was in the bed chamber she begged me to take hold of one part of the bed, and she took hold of the other part, and there lay the pintle, between the sacking of the bed and the bed itself.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of it under the bed, did the sacking sway down? - I had not looked under that bed, this was the 11th of March, in the morning, I afterwards went to take Littlepage; he got from me, but I took him afterwards at Lambeth; he told me that every thing that Stannard, who was admitted an evidence had discovered was true, and that he would speak the same words before the court.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any of the particulars to you? - No, not to me, he said he would tell the Justice every thing that was transacted.</p>
               <p>Did you take Bell? - I took him with them, he said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you read that examination to Littlepage? - It was read before the magistrate, in the presence of Littlepage and me, I heard it read, and there was hardly a word of alteration.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The examination that you talked of first of all, was not relating at all to this business of the pintle? - That was concerning the ropes.</p>
               <p>You had made your unsuccessful search in this woman's house, and found nothing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What had Mr. Hankey to do there, he does not belong to the King's yard I believe, only Mr. Blackmore? - No.</p>
               <p>They having been gone, and nothing yet found, you say you and the woman were together, and you told her, it would be better for her, if she would discover where the pintle was what did you mean by that, or what did you she meant? - To give it with herself.</p>
               <p>You thought at that time, that she thought she should save herself by making this discovery? - I think she did.</p>
               <p>I think you said it would be better for her to discover this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After that I believe she shewed you where the pintle was? - She found by Mr. Hankey that he would shew her no mercy.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. He was gone before the pintle was found; then you had some conversation? - I told her she had better give it up, and throw herself upon the mercy of the prosecutor, for I had not done rummaging.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Then she still thought she should have favour? - She could not after Mr. Hankey was gone, because he told her, she could have no favour; I told her she had better give it up, it would save us a great deal of trouble, I do not know whether she would have delivered it up, but she saw I had not done rummaging.</p>
               <p>Well, but the fact is, she did deliver it up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. She asked you what you would advise her to do? - Yes.</p>
               <p>First you told her, if I understand you, that she had better throw herself upon the mercy of those two persons, one was an officer in the yard, and the other a merchant.</p>
               <p>And she then desired to see Mr. Hankey, and hear what he said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he came? - I fetched him myself.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A ship carpenter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. My Lord, I am council for the prisoner Bell, and I submit that the accomplice cannot be examined, unless there was some evidence to affect Bell.</p>
               <p>Court. What has been said cannot have any affect as to him.</p>

               <p>Then that brings it to about the 17th or 18th of February? - I and Littlepage went the Sunday morning down to the yard, and about eleven we went down to the dock where the Maidstone was, the Maidstone was a King's ship, and we laid the pintle upon the timber pile ready to be got away in the night, then between eight and nine we went down to the yard, and we had agreed to get

            . My Lord, I beg have to ask whether upon the evidence of Mr. Carpenter, your Lordship should think this confession of Mrs. Warrickshall's, was a confession made in expectation of that favor offered, and held out to her, by the constable, that it would be better for her, if she would discover where the pintle was; he himself says, he apprehended she thought so, and my Lord, I humbly apprehend wheresoever a confession is made by a prisoner, and promises of favor are held out to them, these courts have always held that the public faith should not be broken, therefore I hope that that promise made by the constable, shall be considered as the cause of this confession, and that a confession made under such influence, will not be received by the court.</p>
               <p>Mr. J. Nares. In this case the prisoner applies particularly to Mr. Hankey, and when the man says you had better throw yourself on the mercy of Hankey, and the other person now Hankey does not appear to be an immediate officer under the King, but a person immediately concerned as a Merchant; he was a person then enquiring into that fact, and who could prosecute, as any body can for a felony, and he give her no hopes in the world; says he, it is no in my power, and he adds besides, the law shall take its course; then afterwards away he went, and the prisoner advises with this man, not as considering him in the quality or office of constable, but as a friend, and adviser; says he, you had better deliver it up; now she had heard what the other person Hankey had said before, and this man adds, I have not done rummaging yet; she must know at that time that he certainly meant farther to go on, with respect to his rummaging, and that these goods must be found; therefore I think under the circumstances of this case, this is such a confession as should be laid aside; and I think it is proper evidence to be received; I should be glad to hear what my brother says.</p>
               <p>Mr. 
               <persName id="t17830430-9-person180">
                  Baron

            . It has been stated at the bar by Mr. Chetwood, as if it was the constant practice and rule of law, that both confessions and goods produced, in consequence of promises held out to the party, were to be rejected, from a regard to public faith: The rule however is this, that confessions or declarations by prisoners; are, or are not credible, and as such are or are not to be left to the Jury, as they appear to obtained with or without promises, or other inducements; if they are frank and voluntary, there is then no impeachment of their credit, and upon that ground<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300023"></xptr> of their being credible; they are left to the Jury to prove the fact, to which they are adduced, if they are obtained improperly, they deserve no credit, and because they deserve no credit, they are not to be left to the Jury. But this rule with respect to confessions has no application from principles and has never received any application in my practice, with respect to goods produced; because where goods are produced whatever was the inducement, by which the party is prevailed upon, their being found there does not depend upon the mere confession or parole declaration of the party, because the evidence that results from it is, that they are actually found in such custody; if they cannot make out that, they are found in the custody of the prisoner, if they cannot be brought home to the prisoner, without taking in the evidence of the prisoner, then so much of the evidence as depends upon the parole testimony of the prisoner must be rejected. It is novel in law, and extremly dangerous, and not consonant to the general principles of criminal law, for courts of that juridiction, to be holding out support of this sort of public faith; it is to say in other words, that felony may be compounded; if the party is promised encouragement, and upon the strength of that, the evidence of the goods that are found, is not to be produced against them; so far is the law from having this idea, with respect to public faith in promises, that the law goes great lengths against criminals; for instance in a civil case, the law would not allow a constable to put his hand into the pocket of the prisoner; whereas prisoners, and their lodgings are searched, and their pockets even rifled; all which, upon the principle of law is extremely different; and tho' I agree with my brother, whatever should be thought, to be the law on this subject, that this case does not fall within it; still I would not hear the council at the bar, assert that it has been the universal practice; without stating what has occurred to me, as to the practice, from the experience that I have had here.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. I perfectly noticed that in this particular instance, that case does not come within the rule laid down by Mr. Chetwood; yet I think no man should be bound to accuse himself, nor should any man, when lulled into a fatal security, with promises of being free, if he makes a confession, have that confession afterwards turned against him; I do not give my opinion here particularly, but I speak my own sentiments; suppose the crime to be ever so great, if a man having authority or power, a prosecutor or constable, says, let me know where these things are you shall go free, his life is concerned; and he relying on that promise, does make a confession, or does tell where the goods are, he ought to have the benefit of that promise; and so far I will venture to say, that in the little experience I have had, wherever confessions have been made; the people have been always asked whether it was voluntary; nay farther, whether the party was not apprized, that his life was at stake; if what my brother has mentioned is the opinion of the majority of the Judges, as he thinks it is, however I am bound by it, yet at the same time, I think it would be an exceeding hard case, that a man whose life is at stake, is to be lulled into security, and then because goods are found, which he has confessed, that confession is to operate against him. I only speak this as my opinion, as I think it a great hardship: We have read in other histories of other nations, that it is one of the particular species of fortune to tell the wretched; they shall be free if they confess, and immediately to turn that confession against them, I do not say, but my brother's law may be exceeding right, and he seems to mention it as the received opinion of the Judges; I do not contradict it, I only cannot help speaking the feelings of my own heart.</p>

            . There is no doubt, but that other Judges have thought on this subject, in this same manner, that my learned brother does: This subject has more than once, undergone solemn consideration,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300024"></xptr> and according to my recollection not having my papers here; (I do not mean to speak with absolute certainty, and the case before us, does not require, that I should;) but according to my best recollection, upon a solemn decision of the subject by the Judges, a majority of the Judges were of that opinion, of which I have now professed myself to be; and I do know extremely well, that very able men did at one time think otherwise, and that was the occasion of the subject brought under decision.</p>
               <p>Mr. Judge Nares. I believe something was mentioned, at the meeting of all Judges, but I did not understand, it is the separate opinion of all the Judges.</p>

               <persName id="t17830430-9-person182">

            . If a point should arise, it would be a very proper thing, that it should be determined in some solemn way, that it may receive a decision, one way or the other, in order that the law on this subject may be administered uniformly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Mr. Blackmore. Tell us exactly what was said?</p>
               <p>Mr. Blackmore. I was, my Lord, at Mrs. Warrickshall's, at the delivery of the pintle, I went in with Carpenter, I took Mrs. Warrickshall aside, on the landing place of the stairs, I said, Mrs. Warrickshall this matter differs from the yarn; she said, will you speak for me? Says I, I can do no such thing believe I said with the navy-board; there were no considerations of favor or mercy, offered her by me, and I was particularly careful not to give any idea favor or mercy, because I knew to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. My Lord, there is no evidence against young Warrickshall, but his going with the boat, and he is an apprentice to his mother, and he staid with the boat after he had landed his fare.</p>

               <p>You know gentlemen, if the two principals are not guilty, the accomplices cannot: With respect to Bell, who is one of the principals, there is nothing affects him, for what the other man says, who is a mere accomplice, without something confirm it, cannot affect him; because it is a certain rule, where one man thinks proper to take the guilt off himself, to put it on another, the law never credits that declaration: With respect to the other principal Littlepage, although the evidence of the accomplice, is very circumstantial, yet that would not do, without something to confirm it; but here is the strongest conformation in the world by Littlepage himself, for he says, that every word of this information was true: So, that there is a direct evidence by this Stannard, confirmed in the strongest manner by the prisoner, reduced into writing, and which cannot deceive: I cannot therefore see any thing that can be said in his favor, if you believe the evidence; supposing then, that Littlepage is guilty, then the question is, with respect to the other prisoners, who are indicted as receivers; and they you will observe, must know these things were stolen at the time they received them in order to be guilty: Now with respect to

            , there seems to be the strongest evidence in the world that can be given against her: Here are two shipwrights apprentices, come and tell her, they had got such a thing, she never asked them how they came by it, lends them a boat, orders her son to go with them, she weighs it, and pays these two lads for it: how she came to, were how to put any value upon it, is not material; for it is that sort of value, that is one of the strongest evidences in the world to prove, that she must know that they did not come honestly by it, because it is not half the real value of it, considered even in the light of an old pintle, but here it is as good as a new one: You see gentlemen, these circumstances of her bidding her boy go with her boat at one time, at another telling where her boat was, afterwards putting this pintle in the cellar, and its being found between the bed and the sacking;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300025"></xptr> and another thing, her wanting to see Mr. Hankey, and when he says, what do you want with me? she says, I want to apply for your mercy; if she had been doing what she thought an honest thing, what mercy did she want: And therefore this confession she had made at all hazards, and all events, knowing she was guilty, and knowing there was a man in the house, that if she had denied it would have proved what she said to be false: Therefore, it stands for you to decide upon it, whether under all these circumstances, you think she received it, knowing it to be stolen: But I must make one observation more, and that is with respect to the little boy, her son, and apprentice; he might hear what was said, but he had nothing to do with it, he had nothing to do with the contract, between his mother and these men, he goes with the boat, is to bring what is mother agreed, they should fetch, but he know nothing particular of it, and therefore, I own for my part these are circumstances in his favor, and as many a lad acting under the conduct of his mother, I think it would be two hard to make him partake of the consequences of guilt, in an equal degree with the mother herself, however, gentlemen, you have the whole before you, you will take the whole into your consideration, and you will give your verdict accordingly; you will find Littlepage guilty, if you think he is guilty, and then with regard to the other two, the two Warrickshall's, you will find one or both guilty, as you think in point of conscience you ought to do.</p>

            , you stand convicted of receiving stolen goods, on two several indictments; the offence is in sight of the law, so heinous, that the punishment of it is more severe, than that of other felonies, which are not punished with death; for in cases of all other felonies, the punishment seldom exceeds transportation for seven years, but the law wisely and truly judges that the offence of the receiver, is in general more dangerous, and pernicious than that of the thief: The Court has in your case, no power to mitigate your sentence, which is, that you be transported to America for the term of fourteen years.</p>

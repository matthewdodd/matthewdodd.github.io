               <p>Maddox. No, we went only for a walk; we went to a publick-house, facing the bunn-house, and drank five or six pots of beer and two half pints of gin; we then went away, and agreed to stop the first man we met; we walked all round Brumpton, but met no body that we thought proper to stop; but Knight seeing a window open in Brumpton said, there was a house that would do for us, and if I would give him a leg-up, he would get in; he got in, and threw out a bible, a pair of spectacles, and other things, and was just going to throw out the bed, had not the maid come up. We then came to Knightsbridge, and from thence were coming to St. Giles's, where we lodged; and as we came by Mrs. Trevill's house, Knight stopped and said to me, James, give me a leg-up, and I will get into the window; I took hold of one of his legs, and Barrat of the other, and we lifted him up into the window; he, being in liquor, fell down into the room; after he was in the flung out about six yards of cloth, fit for sheeting, a patelair and petticoat, a pair of stays and three bed-gowns, one was a cotton, the other two linnen.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the bed-gown; is that one of them? (he looks at it, and says) yes, my lord, I am sure it is. He afterwards flung out two or three old table-cloths, three or four old towels, and an apron</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the four men prisoners with you at that time?</p>
               <p>Maddox. Yes, they were; and when they were sold, they all took share of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they all assisted in this robbery?</p>
               <p>Maddox. They did, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the goods after they were delivered to you?</p>
               <p>Maddox. I tied them up in a table-cloth, and bade Barrat come along with me; I walked with the bundle upon my back as far as Hide-Park turnpike-gate, this was between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark at that time?</p>
               <p>Maddox. It was. I then said to Barrat, do you carry them; he did, and carried them to Monmouth-street; then I took them again, and carried them to St. Giles's; as soon as we came home we looked over the things, which we commonly do, for fear we should cheat one another. The next morning we went to see if we could sell them, we went with them to Bloomsbury-square, they would not buy them. Then the prisoner

               <p>Q. Was the sash pinned down?</p>

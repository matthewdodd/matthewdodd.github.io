I took my watch from my pocket, and put it in my hat; there was a row in the street; she went to the window, and said, she must go down to see what it was about; and in about two minutes she brought Smith up - they began sky-larking together, and knocked the candle off the table. I saw Wilson put her hand into my hat, but what she took out I cannot say; she went towards Smith - I felt in the hat, and missed my watch. I demanded it of Wilson - she took up the poker and offered to strike me, if I did not go out of the room; I said, I should not till I got my watch; Smith said,</p>
               <p>"She did not rob you of your watch." I got a watchman, and gave them in charge.</p>

               <p>"You have got my watch, and if you don't give it me I'll give you in charge." He came down to me; I went up and saw Wilson on the landing-place, going up another pair of stairs; but I kept her, and sent Bayer for another watchman, who came and took Smith.

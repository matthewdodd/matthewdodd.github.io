            . I am wife to the prosecutor: I missed my two table-cloths and a flat iron before Christmas; the prisoner then lived with me; I discharged her on the Saturday after, having been with me nine weeks; not on any suspicion, having known her from a child; her mother came on the Tuesday following for her cloaths; I told her she had no cloaths there; upon her mother inquiring after her things, it came out that the prisoner had pawned them, and some things of mine. The next evidence can give a farther account; the prisoner owned to every thing in my hearing when taken up.</p>

She brought the two table-cloths and said, they belong to a lodger in the same house, and desired me to get her 5 s. upon them; I went and pledged them for 5 s. 6 d. and gave her the money; she brought them about three weeks after the shirts.

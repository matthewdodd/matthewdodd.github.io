                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Pitman, of 9, Grove-place, in the parish of St. John, Hackney. On the night of 14th Dec. the family went to bed at a quarter-past ten o'clock—before that I had seen that the house was secure—I came down next morning about half-past six, and found both the dining-room doors open, and the kitchen door also, and fastened back with a weight—I found the back kitchen window-bar down, and taken away—that window was shut the night before, and the bar up—I found some desks and boxes about the house, open, which were not so the night before—I found the front kitchen cupboard doors open, the drawers half open, and a tea-caddy open—I missed some knives and forks, a toast-rack, a silver milk-jug, n silver butter-knife, and four coats, from the hall, worth between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my master's.</p>

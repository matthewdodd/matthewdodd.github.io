               <p>Q. Was it the same woman that came into your room that you saw go into Mrs. Sellman's? - A. Yes; I watched her from the door, I live nearly opposite; she was in about ten minutes, she came out with a parcel of loose things in her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether there was anybody there? - A. The shutters were shut; I saw her come out with the things under her arm, I was working with my shirt-sleeves tucked up; I pulled them down and ran after her, I soon overtook her, and before I got quite close to her she dropped the things; I picked up the things, and called out stop thief; a young lad laid hold of her, and I brought her back to Mr. Sellman's, he was ill in bed; I got him up, and sent for an officer and gave charge of her, the officer has got the things.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please you my Lord, I went to enquire for Mrs. Williams, I was going to look after some needle-work; I called at Mrs. Sellman's; I went up two pair of stairs to inquire for Mrs. Williams, she came out of Yorkshire; I asked the gentleman for her, he told me she did not live there; I immediately came out of the house, when that young man came to me; he said, you must go back with me; I went back, and was carried into the same house, and the first sight that ever I saw of the things was, that gentleman called Mrs. Sellman, and Mrs. Sellman came and kicked the things down stairs; as I stand before Almighty God, I never saw the things before; the young woman told me she lodged at No. 11; my friends have been here three days, they are not able to lose any more time.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Edwards.) Q. Whether you are perfectly sure that is the same woman that dropped the bundle? - A. I positively swear she is the same woman, she had a black eye at the same time.</p>

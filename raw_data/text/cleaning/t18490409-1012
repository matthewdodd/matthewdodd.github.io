                  </hi>. I am an appraiser, of 28, Denmark-street, in the parish of St. Giles's-in-the-Fields. I let the shop to Mr. Towers—on 8th March, between half-past ten and eleven at night, I went to bed—the house was fast; you cannot get into the shop without coming through my pri<lb></lb>vate door</p>

I found Mr. Eld's door ajar; it was fast when I went my round about twelve—I went into the passage and called the landlord up—as he came down stairs the prisoner and two others rushed out of the shop—I caught hold of the prisoner and another—they all three struck me on the head and dragged me into the street—the prisoner fell down; he got up, and ran away—I never lost sight of him—I took him to the station—the other two escaped.</p>

On 9th of March, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning my dog barked; I went down and found a policeman in the passage—I said, "What do you want?" and before he could answer, three men rushed out—the prisoner was the third; he struggled with Godden—they both fell in the passage, and again in the street—the prisoner ran, and Godden after him—I picked up a hat where the prisoner fell, and took it to the station—he said, "That is my hat, give it to me"—I returned to the house and found a bag full of boots with the mouth to the ground, with another bag laid over it, and a pile of boots beside it, a key and padlock lay on the desk.</p>

            . I was coming home, through Fleet-street, that Sunday night, and saw the two prisoners following the gentleman; they turned back after him at Temple-bar: he there met them; then I thought they were about no good, and I watched them. I observed Curtis take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, and put it behind him in his hand, for about half a minute, and Wilkinson took it out of his hand, and put it into his pocket: then I went and told the gentleman: he and I went on the other side the way; then at St. Dunstan's church we took hold of them. I saw Wilkinson take the handkerchief, and shuffle about, and let it fall by his feet.</p>

On Friday evening, 26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Oct., I was out with a van, delivering parcels—I stopped at Silsey's, in Watling-street, to deliver a bale of goods, and left a lad in the van to mind it—the horse's head was turned towards St. Paul's-churchyard, and we were on the opposite side of the road to Silsey's—I returned in about two minutes, and missed the box—I then drove the van on to the first cab-stand in St. Paul's-church-yard, and saw two persons, the prisoner and another, in the act of getting into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the box in their possession—I jumped down off the box of the van, and said, "That is my box," and with that both the persons ran away—I pursued the prisoner, and gave him into custody—at the time I claimed the box they were both in the act of getting into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the box was in the prisoner's hand.</p>

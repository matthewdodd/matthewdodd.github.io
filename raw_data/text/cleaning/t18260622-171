I was called by Mr. Cook's servant, about half-past ten o'clock at night, on the 31st of May - I went and told him to get my partner to stand at the back of the premises - I searched and found this piece of pipe near the gate, at the back of the house; it was entirely cut from the place where it had been, and put through the gate in order to be carried away - I came back and found the prisoner in my partner's custody - I found a pair of shoes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220062"></xptr>in a cart close by where the lead pipe laid; we took the prisoner to the watch-house; he had no shoes on, but he put on those I found; they just fitted him - next morning we compared the lead pipe with what was left, and it corresponded exactly; a knife was found in the cart where the shoes had been, and a basket by the side of the lead.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was ordered by the servant to go with him, and he placed me outside the premises, and said whoever was inside they could not get out, except by that gateway - when I had been there about ten minutes the prisoner came from an archway, close to Mr. Cook's premises; he had no shoes on - I asked him what took him there, as there was no thoroughfare - he said he had heard a cry of Thieves! and he went to hold a candle for a watchman, who had looked for the thieves - I held him, and he was taken to the watch-house; a pair of shoes were found in the cart, which fitted him.</p>

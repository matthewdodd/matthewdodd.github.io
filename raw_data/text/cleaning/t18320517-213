On Wednesday evening the 18th of April, a person came in very like the prisoner, in a blue cloak, like the one here produced; he asked for a Tasso, or some such book which he had seen at our house - I told him we had no such book; I had observed a Bible on the counter that day - he said he would call again the next morning; I saw the Bible which had been on our counter at Mr. Barron's on the Tuesday following - this is it; it has our mark on it; I had not sold it - it is worth 15s.</p>

Witness. I said I did not recollect your face exactly; I had not seen the cloak produced before I saw you - I said before I recollected, that it was on Wednesday or Thursday, but I afterwards recollected it was Wednesday, two days before Good Friday. I did not say it was a wet evening, and that the prisoner was muffled up in a cloak; I said he had a cloak on - it was between eight and nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect; it was dark; the shop was not very well lighted; you was not there many minutes; there was no other person present - I missed the Bible in about half an hour - I do not recollect selling you a book about a fortnight before; I cannot recollect your face now, but your voice is similar - the Bible has a mark in it, but some dirt has been rubbed over it.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARRON. I live in Drury-lane, and keep a general sale shop. On Wednesday evening, the 18th of April, the prisoner came in; he had a blue cloth coat and spectacles on; he was very smartly dressed, and his cloak enveloped him completely; the prisoner is the man, I recollect his person perfectly well - he came about ten minutes or a quarter-past nine o'clock; he said, "Is this a pawnbroker's?" I said "No, it is not;" he said, "I have a book I want to raise some money on," and he asked if I would buy it; I said I did not care; he showed me this Bible, said it was valuable, and had the Apocrypha - he wanted 10s. on it - I gave him 8s. for it, and I said if he wanted it again he should have it; he pressed very much upon me to keep it for him; I put it in the window the next day - I particularly noticed his voice, he has rather a foreign accent and I recognized him by that; Mr. Parker came and asked for the book, and knew it by the mark; the prisoner came again on the Tuesday evening following, with a brush; I had received information to detain him; I made sure he was the man, and I called my wife to be sure that he was the person - she said Yes; I have not the slightest doubt by his voice and appearance that he is the man - this is the Bible; it had a private mark in it, which had been rubbed when I had it from the prisoner; I think my shop is three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

On the 14th of November, about four o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop together - Dunn offered to pawn a piece of cotton for 4s. - I offered 3s. 6d., which she would not take, and they went out; they both returned almost directly, but did not come up to the counter - Dunn asked me again for 4s., which I refused - this apron hung within the shop near the door, with four handkerchiefs fastened to it; I saw it safe then - I went to serve another customer - my attention was drawn to the door, and I heard the apron pulled down; I could not see who did it, as Dunn stood before the person - there were two or three persons in the shop; I went round to the door immediately, and Dunn exclaimed, "Good God! she has got it;" I ran down the street three or four doors, and found Griffin with the handkerchiefs and apron on her arm - Dunn was looking towards me, and could not see them taken; I secured Griffin, brought her into the shop, and Dunn exclaimed, "Mary Griffin, what a fool you must be to do it where I am so well known;" they were both detained, and on Dunn was found some silver, and a knife, which belonged to Griffin.</p>

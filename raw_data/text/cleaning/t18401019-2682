                  </hi>. I am a Thames-police Inspector. I was on duty on one of the police galleys, on the 20th of October—I drove up with the tide—when I got to Lambeth I saw the prisoner in the <hi rend="italic">Agnes,</hi> which was deeply laden with coals—it was a dark night, but there was gas-light on shore, about fifty yards from the barge—I saw the prisoner stoop down on board the barge, walk out into a boat alongside, and put something down—he then went into the barge again, picked up something, went into the boat, and dropped it down—it appeared by the fall to be coal—on seeing me he began to make his way on shore in a boat on the other side of the barge—I pursued, and got up to him before he got on shore—I asked how he accounted for being in the barge—he said he went there to seek an an<lb></lb>chor—I asked whose boat that was alongside the barge—he said, "I don't know"—I took him alongside the boat, and asked if he knew whose, boat it was—he said, "Yes, it is mine"—I found twenty-two large pieces of coal in the bottom of the boat—they weighed 230lbs.—I asked whose coals they were—he first said he did not know how they came there—I told him I saw him take them out of the barge—he then laid he took them for his own use—I took him on board the station-ship—I examined the barge with a lantern before I left, and found several holes where there had been coals apparently taken out—I did not notice the quality, but I brought a sample out.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose Petticoat was that ?</p>
               <p>Scott. The Petticoat is mine, and the Duffil Coat was the Apprentice's.</p>
               <p>Q. At what Time did you lose these Things?</p>
               <p>Scott. The 21st of January I went out at Half an Hour after One, and came home Half an Hour after Five, and found my Door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this Duffil Coat and Petticoat there at Half an Hour after One, when you went away?</p>
               <p>Scott. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know they were taken by this Woman?</p>
               <p>Scott. I found them the 24th of January at this Woman's, Joannah Cornish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own Knowledge, how Joannah Cornish came by this Petticoat and Duffil Coat ?</p>
               <p>Scott. The Prisoner confessed before the Justice, that she had sold them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What things was she charged with taking?</p>
               <p>Scott. She said she had a white Cloak, two Caps, two Hats, a white Wig, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with the Prisoner before the Justice when she made this Confession? Was the Confession signed by her?</p>
               <p>Scott: I can't tell, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing further of your own Knowledge? Did the Prisoner tell you at any other Time what she had taken?</p>
               <p>Scott. When I went to her at Newgate, she stood to that, that this Woman had all but a blue Rug for 3 s. 3 d.</p>
               <p>Q. to Joannah Cornish. What do you know of Matter ?</p>
               <p>Cornish. The Prisoner came to my House the 24th of January, and brought me a quilted Petticoat, and an old blue Frock or Shirt, made in the Form of a Shirt; she asked me 5 s. for it. I said they were not worth it, and I gave her 3 s. 3 d. for them, the quilted Petticoat was dirty, I washed it, and hung it up at my Door for Sale; the Prosecutor came by and saw it, and said it was her Property; they were to give me eight Days to find the Prisoner, but instead of eight they gave me but one, and sent me to Bridewell, till I was bailed and found the Prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith. On the 20th of July I was coming past Mrs. Knight's house, in Cornhill, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner opposite the shop—I went on about one hundred yards, and then sat down to rest, as I had my tools on my back, and I saw him run by with a roll under his arm—I gave information to the officer, who took him with it.</p>

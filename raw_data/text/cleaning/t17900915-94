               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This was about four o'clock in the morning? - I do not know; it was early in the morning; I cannot tell the hour; I rather think it was six.</p>

               <p>Yes, but is that very well; had you been up all night or not? do I speak loud enough? - I was not up all night.</p>
               <p>You take a long while to recollect it? - Why, I cannot talk so well as you can.</p>
               <p>Had you really not been up all night? - I had not been up all night.</p>
               <p>Where had you been in bed? - Where I should be in bed; where should any man be?</p>
               <p>You ought to be in bed with your wife, if you had one; had you been in bed there? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Cannot you help us to a little kind of random guess what time you went into the publick-house? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>How long had you been up? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where had you been before you went there? - I can partly guess; but I cannot say.</p>

               <p>So you walked about for some handful of hours, and then you found your way into the Golden Lion? Did you know the young woman that sat along-side of you at the Golden Lion? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Where might you pick her up? - I did not pick her up.</p>
               <p>You never saw her before? - I do not know any think at all about a young woman.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was not you mortally drunk? - Mortally drunk! I do not know what sort of drunkenness this is.</p>
               <p>It is that sort of drunkenness, that, except you a witness, you have the good luck to be in from the first of January to the 31st of December.</p>
               <p>What! to be drunk all the year round!</p>

               <p>My father keeps the Barley-mow, Long-lane: on Monday, 19th of July, between six and seven in the morning, the prisoner brought a pocket-book, and asked me to let him leave it an hour or two, for fear he should lose it in Smithfield: I put it in a drawer: in three minutes after the officer brought him in: Cartwright, the witness, was with me at the time.</p>

               <p>I am a hair-dresser: I was with Stephens: (deposed to the same effect:) he had some gin, and paid for it: in a minute Bell brought in the prisoner, and he came in and said let me have the pocket-book that I left over night for two six-pennyworths, with a girl: says Stephens, you did not leave it last night, you left it just now: is this the pocket-book? yes, says he: Bell took the prisoner away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The pocket-book produced, and deposed to by the contents; there were several bills and receipts, and bills of parcel in it.</p>

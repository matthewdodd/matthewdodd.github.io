            . On the 21st of December Mr. Compton called upon me - I went with him to No. 3, Edmond's-place; we found the prisoners up stairs: I found a dead pig in a tub of water, being scalded; I found two more laying in the corner - one alive, and the other dead. The prisoners both said they did not know how they came there; I said it was very strange pigs should come there and they not know how - they then said a man had driven them in, and was to call for them at twelve o'clock. On handcuffing them I found their hands were quite damp - there was a pot of water by them, with blood and water in it, as if they had been washing their hands in it - we found a picklock-key and a hammer, which the pigs had been knocked at the head with - the hammer matched the bruises, and was all over blood, and so was a case-knife; the pigs appeared to have been first stunned, and then had their throats cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What sort of a house is this? A. It has only two rooms. Two girls lived there besides the prisoners. I found the pigs in the lower room; the tub of water was up stairs. I saw nobody escape out of the roof.</p>

            . I went with Tweedy - his account is correct. I found a picklock and a door key concealed under the floor - one of them opens the shed door where the pigs were stolen from, better than Mr. Compton's own. I found another picklock-key laying by the pig's nose. The hammer and knife were bloody.</p>

On the 21st of December, about five minutes to seven o'clock in the morning, I was in my room, and heard a person going up the court - I opened the window, looked out, and saw that person return down the court, and stand by the side of his own door - it was Dimsdale. I saw Smith drive three pigs into the house, where they both live. I went into the house afterwards, and found a saddle, which I gave to Moore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was going from his own place then returned, and a man drove the pigs in? A. Yes - he had been up the court to shut the gate at the end.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Totton, a village near Southamp<lb></lb>ton. In October last, I was staying at the Bath-hotel, Piccadilly, which is kept by Mr. Paine—I left my bed-room about five or a quarter-past five o'clock in the afternoon of the 19th, to go to dinner—I had a tin-case in my bed-room, in which I locked up a few trinkets—I had had it open that af<lb></lb>ternoon, and the things belonging to it, I believe were all there when I left—I had seen them about half an hour before I left the bed-room—I had a padlock on it—there were a gold watch-chain and seal, and tow keys at<lb></lb>tached to it, and a hook, two combs set with topaz, a pocket-book, and three bottles of scent, and several trinkets, rings, and other things—I did not lock my room door—I returned to my room about twelve o'clock—I dined on the first floor—my wife was with me, and for it—I locked my door at night while I was in bed, therefore it must have been taken in the evening—I have seen the box since in the possession of Ballard, and some of the articles—some of them bad been pawned—I suppose them worth from eighty to a hundred guineas, at a low rate.</p>

I am a constable of Bow-street office, On the 30th of October, I received information from Mrs. Abrahams, who I believe is the prisoner's wife's mother; and in consequence of a conversation, I went in company with Fletcher, another officer, to No. 18, Leicester-square—I asked for a person of the name of Jones there—I was taken to the prisoner in a room at the top of the house—he was partly dressed—It was about twelve o'clock—the landlady showed me up stairs—she knocked at the door, and said, "Mr. Jones, here are two gentleman want you."—I walked into the room, and said, "What do you mean to say your name is, Sir?" he said. "Skerret, "—I said we had come to speak to him respecting the rob<lb></lb>bery at the Bath Hotel, Piceadilly, and said, "Do you know any thing about it?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Do you mean to say you did not go there, and engage a bed without taking it?"—he said, he had not been there—I first searched the pocket of his trowsers, and then began to search the room—I turned round to the prisoner, and said, "Where is the watch?"—he said, "My watch is in the drawer"—I pulled open the top drawer, and it was not there—I said, "which drawer do you mean?"—he said, "That one," pointing to the second one—I opened the second drawer, and found this watch, with the chain and key attached to it—I took it up, looked at it, and said, "Oh, this is the watch, here are the initials, "—he said, "No, that it mine"—It had "J.B.P." on it—I then went and looked at the maker's name in the Hue and Cry, and said, "This must be the watch for here is the maker's name, and all the same"—the prisoner said, "Will you awear to that?" I said, "No, I shall leave somebody else to do that"—he said once or twice over that we should find ourselves mistaken</p>

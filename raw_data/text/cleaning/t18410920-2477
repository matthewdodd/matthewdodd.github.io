                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Thomas Smee, of Baker-street; the family was out of town for the day on the 15th of September, and I was in care of the house—I went to the area-gate to take the milk at ten mi<lb></lb>nutes to five o'clock—the area-door shut too, and then I was out—while I was taking the milk the prisoner came by—he had a mattress on his shoulders—the string broke and it fell on the ground—I do not know whether it was an accident or done on purpose—he asked me if I could give him a strong bit of cord to tie it up—I said, I don't know, but if you will have the kindness to get over the gate and open the parlour win<lb></lb>dow, get in and run down stairs and open the door for me, I will see"—he did so—there was a woman with him, but he only went in—I thought he was longer than he ought to be in opening the door—I looked through the</p>

I there saw the prisoner up stairs, and I said I took him on suspicion of stealing a silver milk-pot from Baker-street—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he was endeavouring to force himself into another room, and a little girl there said, "Go out, you shan't come in here"—I took him to the station—the woman came to the station and said, "How could you do such a thing as this?"—he said, "Don't you be a d—fool"—he asked for pen, ink, and paper, and sat down to write, and asked if it would be read—we said, "Yes"—he then threw down the pen and said, "Then you shan't have the opportunity of seeing it."</p>

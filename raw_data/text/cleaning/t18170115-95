My street door was left open at six o'clock, on the morning of the 4th of December. I heard a noise in my shop about half past six o'clock, it was not day-light, it was rather light. I sleep in a room even with my shop. There is a gass-light facing the window. I saw the prisoner in the shop putting the tea in his bag. I went back for my key; when I returned he was gone. I found him on the step of the street-door with the bag in his hand. My lodgers left the door open; but I found the staple of my cellar door drawn, and the floor of my shop broken away; he must have broken through the floor to get in; it was forced up. I could not follow him, as I was not dressed. I called out stop thief. The prisoner had lodged at my house about seven months before. I saw him by the gass-light, which reflects into my shop. I described him to the officer, and told the officer his name. I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment; they were in my shop the evening before.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUTT. I am an officer. Mrs. Parker described his person to me. I apprehended him on the 5th of December.</p>

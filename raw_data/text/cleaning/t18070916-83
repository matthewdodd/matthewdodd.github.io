As I was coming home I met the prisoner a little after one o'clock on the 10th of August; I met the prisoner as she was going dinner. Observing her to have her gown in this way, (witness describing it) and her pockets to stick out, I thought it somewhat singular; I watched her where she was going; I followed her to Mr. Hill's, pawnbroker, Newman's passage, Upper Rathbone place, where I found her in the act of offering this to pledge (producing another article.)</p>
               <p>Q. You found her in the act of pledging some of your property. - A. Yes; I took her in custody and gave her to the officer; he searched the woman and found forty eight duplicates upon her; some of which were for my property</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any one of them on the 25th of July. - A. Not one.</p>
               <p>Mr. CLEARSON. I am a pawnbroker in Castle-street, Oxford-road. I took in pledges of the prisoner at different times; this striped holland was pledged on the 25th of July for two shillings; I am sure the prisoner pawned it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My trouble is great; I fall on your mercy. I am the wife of an officer that has served his Majesty for years; I have a son now in the service. After having a child that has lost a leg, I was obliged to solicit for work; I in an unguarded moment was tempted to take the articles till I received my money from my husband, which was due in a few days; I entreat you will have mercy on me.</p>

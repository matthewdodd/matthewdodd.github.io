Barrs, who was with me, said there was a light in the chapel. I called out,</p>
               <p>"Who is there?" The prisoner Thomas rushed by him and came-by me. I pursued and caught him in the chapel yard, took him to the watch-house, and on returning, in a minute or two, met Nugent, and took him, as he appeared to be coming in a hurry. I found his hands very muddy. I took him to the chapel, where Barrs was, and in his hat found two matches. Barrs said he was the man who had got over the chapel wall; there was a great deal of mud under the wall.</p>

            . I was with Almond - we have the keys of the chapel. I saw a light in the Vestry, went in, and found a piece of candle in a person's hand - it was puffed out in a moment. Thomas rushed out and was secured. I ran and saw Nugent getting over the wall, and cut at him with my cutlass; called Stop thief! and Almond brought him back. The Vestry-room shutter was broken to pieces, and by it I found a crow-bar, tinder-box, flint, steel, and matches, and an iron wedge under the door. - Some knives and forks had been moved, and laid by the door; a piece of carpet was taken up and thrown into the yard, several books were moved, and a strange bag was left there. Nugent was cut in four or five places by the broken glass on the wall.</p>

            . Q. I believe you superintend Mr. Butts's business. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the care of the accompting house. - A. I had, I left it locked, and the windows were all safe. I was the last person that was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it contain property in it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. State to the court what property was in it. - A. One piece of Russia sheeting, and one piece that something was cut-off, and thirty yards of Russia duck, about half an hundred weight of sailing twine, and eleven balls of packthread.</p>
               <p>Q. You left this property there on the evening of the 20th. - A. Yes. When I came between seven and eight in the morning, there were four squares of the window frame broken in, so that a man could get in; I found on going in several things displaced. I found both the desks broken open, but nothing in the desk was taken, but all the things I have mentioned were gone. On the 3d of March, eleven balls of packthread, and nine balls of twine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever worked for Mr. Butts. - A. Yes, he drove one of Mr. Butts's teams, from the 4th of May, till the 11th of July.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of the property that was brought to you, what did you proceed to do. - A. I procured a search warrant; I searched the prisoner's house on the 8th of March, accompanied with the constable Evans,

            , and my son; the constable and Evans entered his room first; they found these pieces of Russia shetting, some of them in pieces, as if a woman was at work at them. I found a piece of Russia duck, some of which was made into a bed tick.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the Russia duck was there in all - A. Thirty yards; one sheet was made of it, and the piece that was left corresponded with that made up in sheeting and the bed tick; he also had a smock frock and trowsers made of the Russia duck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the smock frock, sheet, bed tick, trowsers, and the piece that was left, make up about thirty yards. - A. I should suppose so. We also found a brush in his room.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. He worked for me near a month, till the 28th of November; for the last fortnight he worked in the old barn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that old barn contain. - A. Barley.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course it was locked. - A. Yes, and the prisoner had the custody of the key most nights but Saturday night, and then he hung it up in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell me under what circumstances, but did he leave the country, was he discharged by you. - A. No, he went without being discharged by me.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner went away did you employ a man of the name of Newton to thrash in the barn. - A. No, I had allowed Mr. Dawes to use the opposite side of that barn, he employed Newton.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner was with you on the 20th of November was any body employed in that barn but the prisoner. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you employed by Mr. Dawes to thrash in Mr. Moorin's old barn. - A. Yes. There I found under the roof of the barn, between the boards and the barley, nine balls of twine, and eleven balls of packthread; as soon as I found it I took it to the public house and mentioned what I had found; in consequence of which it was afterwards claimed by Mr. Strudwicke. This is the twine, I can swear to it; here is a hole where a mouse crept in, he hung in there, he was as dry as a bone.</p>

            . I live at Tamworth, I was present at the time the prisoner was apprehended. I am a farmer; when we saw the prisoner the constable said come in, here he is; we saw him in a field; they had just apprehended his wife. I gave chase after him; he ran a considerable way.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he ran was any thing said to him. - A. Not a word. This was the 9th of March; he ran for about a mile and a quarter; there was a man a hedging; I cried stop him, he attempted to stop him, he could not; I asked the hedger for his bill, he gave it to me, we ran about a mile and a half farther, then I got up to him, when he got over a hedge. I said surrender; he stopped and held up his fist, I said I will strike you with the bill if you do not surrender. He knocked me down and put his knees on my throat and attempted to choak me; I gave him several cuts with the bill; he bled and got weak; I throwed him off, I said come surrender; he walked on and we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the house that was searched was the prisoner's house. - A. His wife told me so afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time claim any of the property that was seized there. - A. She claimed it, but not in his presence; he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. This was at Epsom, a great many miles across the country. - A. I knew he lived in that country.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else present when this struggle took place. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that you cut that man's nose in two. A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you also know that he had so many grievous wounds that his life was despaired of. - A. It may be so; I only gave him blows in my own defence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he ever make any complaints before the magistrate. - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>

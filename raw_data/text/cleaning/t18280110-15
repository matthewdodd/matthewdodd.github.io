On the 21st of August I left town; I locked my door, and left all these articles safe; I did not return till the 12th of October - I unlocked my room door, and found my room nearly empty; all these articles were gone; they are worth about 10l. The prisoner still continued at the house; he left some few days after I returned. I asked if he knew any thing of it - he said he did not - that he was up and down ten times a day; I told him I thought those who were up and down ten times a day had robbed my room - and after this conversation he left the lodging; I do not know where he went to lodge. I applied at Bow-street, and was present on the 31st of December, when a search-warrant was executed at No. 3, Adam-street West, in a second floor room, and a great part of my property was found there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many lodgers were in the house? A. I do not know; I lodged there nearly two years - there might be five or six, but I cannot say; three or four rooms were unoccupied before I left town. I had given the key to my husband, who left town a fortnight after me. The prisoner left within a fortnight of my return; I called the landlord up the first night of my return, and complained of my loss; I believe the prisoner did not remain a fortnight after that - I will swear he was not there a month; there was nothing about the articles to enable a person who bought them, to know they were mine: he did not visit my room - I had not twenty words with him before I left town. I applied to the Magistrate after this conversation, and the prisoner returned a day or two after he left, and was detained by the officer, and denied knowing any thing of it. The officer said I could not have a warrant unless I swore I suspected the property to be in any part of the house, and a warrant was not granted till I found where he lodged; he was at home when we found the property.</p>

The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100013"></xptr>prosecutrix applied for a search-warrant about the 29th of December; I know nothing of her first application: a warrant was granted on the Monday morning - I accompanied her to No. 3, Adam-street West, Portman-square; I found the prisoner and his wife in the second floor back room; I asked if his name was Bullen - he said it was: I said I had a warrant to search his premises, and told my brother officer to call up Sandy; she looked round the room, and claimed the bed curtains, the bed, bolster, pillows, looking-glass, table, fire-irons, fender, carpet, rug, china, and a variety of furniture; he began to cry, and said he was ruined, and that he should destroy himself. I took him into custody, and took the property to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say he had purchased the articles? A. No; he said he had taken them away, and if I would let him go he would make good all he had broken in removing them. I did not mention this before, because I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not sworn to tell the whole truth? A. Yes, but an officer is often stopped for saying too much. I know nothing of his having eight children - I saw one child in the room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take him to the pawnbrokers? A. No - they saw him at the office, and said a woman had pawned them. I hear he has two children in Devonshire, and that his wife has six.</p>

             is my first cousin, and lived with me - the prisoner visited her at my house; we had no reason to suppose he was married - I went to St. Mary-le-bone church with them when they were married; I witnessed the register - she had no fortune. They lived together in Upper Mary-lebone-street , till he was apprehended at the instigation of his first wife. She was married by the name of King - I do not know how the mistake happened - she cannot write - they were married by banus.</p>

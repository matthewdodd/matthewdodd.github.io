On the 22d of February, I only went to the next door for some potatoes for my husband's dinner, I don't think I was gone ten minutes, I came to my door and I found my door open, and this woman running out of it; I had left my door locked with the key in it at the outside; I had the middle room in the house; when I came she ran up two, three or four stairs to the garret, I cannot exactly say which; I asked her who she wanted? or what business she had in my room? or whether she wanted the woman that lived up stairs? she said, she did want the woman that lived up stairs, and I directly called the woman, she said the woman was not at home, as soon as I called she came and opened the door; the prisoner directly ran away, and I finding my door open I ran after her, she went into a court and up some strange stairs, and I apprehended her myself; she had with her one cotton gown, one black silk cloak, &amp;c. as in the indictment; the things are here. (Produced and deposed to.) I took her back to the place where she took them from, and then I took them from her; I did not know the woman before.</p>

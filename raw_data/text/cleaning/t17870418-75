               <p>On the 24th of February, between eight and nine, I was at the prosecutor's house, and this Edmunds and Jones came there, and said, there were two men stealing the lead off the flat in London-street, Mr. Gowing and me went with them, Mr. Gowing, and Jones stood at the front of the house, while<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180075"></xptr>Edmunds and me went to the back part of it, when we came to the corner, we just saw a man at the foot of the wall, we immediately rushed down upon him, and he stopped down, I caught him by the collar, and brought him out; I saw the other prisoner Ball lay on the coping of the wall; I did not move him then, but he dropped inside; and I went and took him; there was no other to be found in the house, we called him several times to come down, and he would not stir, then I said, go, fetch a gun, and we will soon bring him down; the wall is 16 feet high, but there is a leaded flat about the middle of it; after we took the prisoners, we all went and examined the lead; the lead was all gone but these two pipes, this pipe was on the flat; it has been measured, and it corresponded, I saw it tried.</p>
               <p>Court to Gowing. I suppose you cannot swear to the lead particularly? - No more than by its sitting the place.</p>

               <p>I was a porter in Covent Garden, and a young man gave me a shilling to carry a trunk from the Green Man to the Adam and Eve; I staid an hour, and so he gave me some drink; and I wandered about, and came past this house; and I sat down; and this man came directly and found me.</p>

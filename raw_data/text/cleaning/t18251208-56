            . I am a baker, and live in Paradise-row - Mr. Taylor lives about five minutes walk from me. On the 4th of November, about twenty minutes before one o'clock, I was with my barrow at the corner of Queen's-row, which is about half a mile from Taylor's, I saw the prisoner with this clock - there were two other persons on the other side of the way, who seemed to be in company with him, and I saw one of them make a sign to him to go down a turning, which he did; I followed, and asked him where he got the clock; he said a man had given it to him, and I might have it if I liked; he then got away, and ran very fast; I cried Stop thief! and he was taken before he got out of my sight. I am quite certain of his person.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I saw Arkett with his barrow - he said three suspicious characters had gone past with a clock; I went with him in pursuit - he came up with the prisoner first, and asked how he got the clock; he said it was given to him - he threw it down and Arkett caught it; I pursued and took him in the King's-road.</p>

            . I am a pastry-cook, and live at Chelsea. Mr. Taylor is a neighbour of mine; he had left a clock with me, which I saw safe on the morning of the 4th of November; I did not miss it till it was brought back to my shop; I said I could not swear to it, but I believed it to be the one I had in the house - the prisoner was quite a stranger.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Richard Lawrence, a general dealer, in Charcroft's terrace, New Cut, Lambeth. On Friday, the 7th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, and in<lb></lb>quired of my sister the price of a snuff-box, and while she turned to ask me the price, he must have put this snuff-box into his pocket—he said the one he asked the price of was too much, and put it down, and went away.</p>

On the afternoon of the 7th of April I was in company with Goff in the New Cut, and saw the prisoner—Goff said, "He has got something, and has put it into his pocket"—he ran off as hard as he could—I ran after him for half a mile, and when about six yards from him I saw him take this box from his pocket, and throw it into the road.</p>

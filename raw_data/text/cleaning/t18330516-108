            . These pigeons belong to me; I can swear to them - I heard they were lost, and went to Leadenhall-market, but could not find them - we then went to Mr. Stevens, and found these nine, which I can swear to by their marks.</p>

            . I am a pigeon-dealer, and live at No. 26, Slater-street. I bought these pigeons of the prisoner and another young man, last Tuesday week; they asked me 8s. for them - I asked the prisoner what was his reason for parting with them, he said because he had lost so many - I said 8s. was more than they were worth; I gave him 6s. 3d. for them.</p>

             - I never saw the contents; I leave the foreman to shut our warehouse up when I leave, and the keys are brought to my house. On the morning of the 7th of March, at nine o'clock, I found the premises had been broken into, and the property gone: the warehouse is in the parish of Allhallows, Barking - the windows have all iron bars to them; persons outside cannot look into the windows unless they get within the gates - I found the fronts of several boxes ripped down, and several articles taken away; the locks of the premises were all broken open - we found one silver candlestick left behind, and several plated articles; the warehouse which was broken open is at the back part of the premises - we let part of the front warehouses- the windows were perfect outside, but the interior was all dilapidated; the counting-house was broken open, the deaks and iron safe broken open, and money gone - there was a bag put up to prevent the party being seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were several boxes opened, or one taken away? A. No boxes were taken away, but the contents were - one was entirely stripped, and the other partly; no outer door was broken that I could discover.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WILLIAMS. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Colebatch. On the 6th of March I locked up the warehouse, and delivered the keys to the clerk; I left the premises quite safe - I went again about nine o'clock in the morning; Mr. Colebatch was there - I found the outer wicket secure, but the inner wicket open; the two doors of the salt warehouse were also open - I found a door on the staircase had been forced open by some instrument; I went up stairs, saw another box forced open, and things scattered about the floor - it was principally linen; five boxes had been forced open.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the morning of the 7th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Paul-street, Finsbury, and saw the prisoner - he nodded at me, and I saw Haydon behind him, carrying a basket, about a yard and a half off; I was on the opposite side, crossed over, and questioned him -I found the basket contained plate; I then looked for the prisoner, but could not find him that day - I took Haydon into custody; he was detained till the following Monday, when I met the prisoner in Leonard-street, about eleven o'clock - I was going down by the Tabernacle, and all at once saw a person turn round and run a contrary way, but I was not it was him then - I saw the person run into a shop; I went to the shop, but could not see him - I went to the stairs which lead to the bake-house, and hallooed Joe come up (meaning the prisoner) and he came from the cellar where they bake; I said "If you go quietly I won't handcuff you," he said he would go quietly, and I took him to Guildhall - he was going to say something; I said, "Mind what you say to me," and nothing passed - I have had the plate ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He knew you? A. Yes, and nodded - I followed the porter two or three yards, and then looked for the prisoner, before I stopped the porter, and he was gone in a moment; he could not have got out of my sight if he had walked - I went to look for him, but did not go to his house; I met him on the Monday, nearly on the same spot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had a complaint in his bowels which obliged him to go down there? A. Certainly not - I believe the baker's wife was in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he came up was there any conversation between him and the person in the shop? A. None.</p>

            . I am an officer; I was with Herdsfield in Paul-street, and met the prisoner, and a porter behind him a few steps, with a large basket - Herdsfield crossed over the road, lifted up something, and called me over; I am certain the prisoner is the man who was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you search the prisoner? A. I saw him searched, and 40l. odd found on him.</p>
               <p>JOHN HAYDON. I am a porter, and generally ply at Spitalfields-market. I was there on the 7th of March, when the prisoner applied to me between ten and eleven o'clock; he asked if I wanted a job I said Yes - he said"Then carry these," and gave me a parcel wrapped up in a great coat - he put it into my basket himself; the officer took it from me in Paul-street - it is the same parcel; he went before me into Lamb-street, across Spital-square, up Primrose-street - we came at last into Paul-street, and I was taken into custody; the prisoner had ran away then - I had seen him not a minute before; he went away when the officer spoke to him - he had continued with me up to that time; the parcel the officer took from me was exactly the same as he gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where do you live? A. In York-street, Shoreditch. I never saw the prisoner before; I never said I doubted his being the man, nor that there were so many faces alike, I did not like to swear to him - I said he was the man; I did not express a doubt of him, but swore positively to him; I have seen Herdsfield here - he has never called on me, nor have I had any conversation with him about swearing to the prisoner; he was about six yards before me, and saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you follow any other person but him from the market, till you were stopped? A. None.</p>
               <p>THE REVEREND EDWARD OSBORNE. I had left some plate in the care of the prosecutors, secured in a box, above a year ago; I have since seen, out of the box, some of the plate - that was before the Magistrate; I knew it to be part of what I left in their care - (examining the property) this is part of it; there is still some missing - the value of this is considerably above 100l.: I saw the box after the robbery - it was the same box as contained the plate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent - it is all prejudice against me: Haydon strongly denied my being the person before the Magistrate, and said there were so many alike he could not tell: Herdsfield called at my house, and was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110009"></xptr>told I was gone out to see the paper; he came out, and saw me, and says I ran into the shop. Had I not forty-eight hours to escape if I had been guilty? it is nothing but a conspiracy.</p>

I have known the prisoner about two years - he dealt with me, and is a jeweller, I believe; he frequently called to see me - we both visited: he called the day he was taken up - he did not appear particularly ill; I came into the shop just after the officers - he often went down stairs without leave; he was familiar with the place: it was not unusual for him to go down.</p>

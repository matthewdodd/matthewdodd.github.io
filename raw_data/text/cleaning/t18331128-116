            . I lodge at the Five Bells, Finchley. On the 16th of November, I fell in with the prisoner and four more young men in Grays-inn-lane, and I went to Smithfield, and looked at some trousers which were in pawn - we then went to a skittle-ground at the <placeName id="t18331128-116-crimeloc660">White Hart, Aylesbury-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. What time in the day did you come from Finchley? A. About eleven o'clock in the day; I walked to town and met the prisoner at the Marquis of Granby in Grays-inn-lane, about three o'clock; I had stopped on the road, but had taken no liquor till I got to the Marquis of Granby - I will swear I was quite sober when I got there; I met the prisoner in the skittle-ground there - he introduced himself to me by offering to bet me on the game; I did bet with him once or twice - I do not recollect whether I hesitated or not - it is not a fact that I offered to bet with him; I did not challenge the prisoner to play with me, but I did his friend, whose name was Hopkins, and we played; I do not know how many games; it might be from ten to fifteen games; it was not twenty; we played till about eight o'clock - I drank a little brandy-and-water, certainly - we played for drink; I cannot tell how many games I won or lost - the persons in the ground drank the liquor; there were ten or fifteen quantities of liquor drank by myself and the persons in the ground; I cannot tell who in particular - the first game was for a glass of brandy-and-water; the prisoner, his friend, and me, and I believe two other persons partook of it - the second game was for the same - I cannot recollect what the third game was for - I partook of any quantity of liquor if I felt inclined; I might drink four or five times; I did not note it down - I left the place quite sober; I drank brandy-and-water and half-and-half; I mean half ale and half porter - I had one glass of gin after the games were over; I cannot tell how much I paid for the liquor - I had three sovereigns when I went to the ground - I cannot tell what I spent, for I won and lost money - the prisoner then wished me to go and look at the trousers, which I did, and bought them for 5s.; I am positive of that - we then went to the White Hart, in Aylesbury-street - I had a Welch rabbit and a pint of beer, and the prisoner induced me to go into the skittle-ground there - I played one or two games; I did not notice how many; I paid my way as far as I went - I do not recollect whether they were single games or rubbers; a single game is only one; a rubber is the best two of three - I played about two rubbers; I do not know how long it took to play them; I went about nine o'clock, and was going home comfortable about ten o'clock, when I was robbed - I do not know what liquor I had in the skittle-ground; I do not believe I had any: I might take a taste - when the prisoner robbed me, I caught hold of him, held him as long as I was able, and called for assistance as loud as I could - when I left the skittle ground, the prisoner ran after me and robbed me - there were ten or twelve persons in the skittle-ground then - the prisoner ran after me, and took my money in the passage; I saw his face at the time - there were no lights in the passage, but there is a light in the bar, which shines through a window, and gives light sufficient to recognise any person - I caught the prisoner's head under my arm, and held it for two or three seconds, or perhaps a minute - I cannot tell how long.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you sober, when you got to the White Hart, so as to know what you were about? A. Yes, decidedly; I can swear it was the prisoner took my money - I know I had 2l. 6s. because I counted my money under a gas-light in the ground, just before I came out, and I can distinctly swear that the prisoner ran up to me and took my money - I cried out, "I am robbed;" there were nine or ten persons at play in the ground; they must have heard me - I did not pursue the prisoner; I ran to the front-door, and called for a policeman; I thought the prisoner was safe, as he ran back into the skittle-ground - I had three sovereigns in my pocket when I came to town; I had only changed one of them - the silver and sovereigns were in the same pocket.</p>

            . My father keeps the White Hart, Aylesbury-street - I recollect the prisoner and the prosecutor coming on that Saturday evening, a little before nine o'clock; the prosecutor appeared to be perfectly sober; they went backwards to play at skittles; I afterwards heard the prosecutor say he was robbed by the man he had come in with; he was then in the front of the bar; I did not hear him say how much he had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons came in with the prosecutor? A. Two; they staid about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in front of the bar; the prosecutor had a slice of bread and cheese toasted; I did not see him have any drink - I was about my business; I cannot tell how many persons were in the house, or in the skittle ground - the prosecutor did not appear drunk; a man who was drunk might call out that he was robbed.</p>

            . I live next door to the White Hart. I was opening my back-door, about ten o'clock that night, and saw two men standing at the door; the prisoner is very much like one of them, but it was dark, and I could not swear to him; he had no hat on - they said, "Let us through, it is only a lark" - I said, "I do not like such larks in my house, get back again over the wall" - it is a good high wall between my yard, and the public-house yard; I saw that the man's hair who had no hat on was dark, and he had a long coat on - I told them to get back, and gave one a lift over the wall; the other got over - I then came to the front-door, and heard a calling for the police; I saw the police going in; I got a light, and the steps, and found a phosphorus box swimming on the water in the butt, which is by the wall where they got over - they could not get over without almost touching it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A porkbutcher - I had no light when I went to my back-door, but a good light in my shop, on the cross-counter, which shone to the back-door - the men were close to the door when I opened it; I cannot swear the prisoner is one of the men, but one had his hat off and had dark hair - I lifted one over the wall; the water-butt is not on my side - I have heard there were ten or twelve people in the skittle-ground, but they could not have lifted any one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280095"></xptr>over without being very close to the water-butt, or touching it, as there is only about a foot of wall, but what the butt stands against which leads into my yard - the box I saw on the water might have fallen from the person who got over the wall.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said at first that you would not swear to the prisoner at the bar? A. Yes; but he was a young man like him, and he had dark hair - the water butt stands about the middle of this short wall - a person dropping anything in getting over the wall, would very likely drop it into the butt.</p>

             (Police-constable G 107). I was at the White Hart door, and saw a great many persons assembled, some of whom said, a man was robbed of 2l. 6s.; I saw the prisoner come out of the mob without his hat, and he had a long coat on - he walked out of the door and said, "I know which way he is gone, I will go and find him out;" when he got out of the crowd he ran away - Martha Lewis said, that was one of the men; there was another officer who took the prisoner's partner - when I went out again, Robinson told me, he had found the phosphorus box - I drew the water out of the butt, and found in it nine skeleton keys, a dark lantern, a jemmy, and this halfpenny</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do men use these tools to pick pockets? A. No; I think they are used for house-breaking - the prisoner wore a long coat, it reached to the middle of his legs; he seemed rather confused - when I went into the skittle-ground there were about ten men there; they all had hats on, that I saw; I cannot say they all had long coats on; I only spoke of the prisoner's partner from what the prosecutor said - I had seen them both before, but not together - the prisoner was taken afterwards, but not by me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it not probable that those men who pick pockets might use these tools for housebreaking? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent. I left the gentleman about nine o'clock, and bade him, good night, and he said so to me. I left him, with the young man, playing skittles. I did not play a game with him.</p>

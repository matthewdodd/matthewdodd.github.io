               <p>Amey Deseret. On the 20th of January, after tea in the morning, this young gentlewoman, Mrs. GOODWIN, told me, that we were robbed, I asked her of what? she said, of two shirts and her buckles; I was very much surprized, and looked to see if we had lost any thing else, and I missed nine silver spoons, a dozen of silver-handled knives, thirteen forks, and a silver pint mug.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Deseret. She was my <rs id="t17440223-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Did she say, she supposed her husband took them?</p>
               <p>Deseret. She did not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your goods again?</p>
               <p>Deseret. I have not found any thing at all; the spoons and the pint mug were in her charge, and she had a place to lock them up in; she said, she did let a man in, but I don't think he could carry them off without her knowledge; she has owned since, that she took away three spoons in Christmas week.</p>
               <p>ELIZ. GOODWIN. She confessed she carried out three of the spoons in Christmas week, and gave them to the man she called her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say, any body else had been there?</p>
               <p>GOODWIN. She said, no body had been there but her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say, that her husband must take them?</p>
               <p>GOODWIN. She did not say so; I told her, if no body else had been there, he had stole them.</p>

            . The 28th of Dec. the man who goes for her husband brought three spoons to me to pawn; I saw a crest upon them, and refused to take them in; she came afterwards; I asked her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230003"></xptr> whether they were her own spoons? or how she came by them? She said, she had them of an Embassador for a debt, but I did not take them in; I found out afterwards who she lived with, and then I believed them to be stole.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner produced a Witness, who said, that she had lived with him as a servant, and always behaved herself well; and, by what he had heard, behaved well, wherever she lived as a servant, and believes she is a sober honest woman.</p>
               <p>Another Witness said, she had known her all her life time, and that she always behaved herself well, and has lived in very creditable families.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have lived in creditable good families, with great people, both here and in my own country (Holland) and they know my character, God Almighty take my soul! I am not guilty of this thing, indeed.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marylebone. On the 23rd of December, about a quarter to five o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Skinner-street with another person; Maberly had a female holding his arm - I saw the prisoner with his companion go close behind Maberly, and by the light of a shop window I saw the prisoner put his hand into Maberly's pocket, and take out this handkerchief; I told my brother officer the little one had taken it out (the other was taller than him); I went one way round a cart, and my brother officer the other - I saw him take the prisoner, and take the handkerchief off the ground; I had seen it go on the ground just as he laid hold of the prisoner - it appeared to drop from him - I went after the other, but lost him; Maberly claimed the handkerchief by its not being hemmed by a woman; the prisoner had another handkerchief on his neck, - he said "That is mine, it is not marked;" and it was marked.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman laid hold of a bricklayer at first, and said, "I have got you;" he then let him go, and took me - he took the handkerchief, and said "I saw you drop it. I will swear it." Witness. I am certain I saw him take it from the pocket.</p>

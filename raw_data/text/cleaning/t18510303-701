                  </hi>. I live in Phoenix-place, Queen's-row, Kensing<lb></lb>ton. I was at home on 6th Jan., and something attracted my attention—I ran to the door with my wife—I saw the prisoner nine or ten yards from the door—he ran across, and struck my wife on the left breast with his right hand, took hold of her by the hair, and was pulling her away—I took hold of her to pull her away, and he then took me by my hair, and pulled me along nine or ten yards—I was not well at the time—I took hold of him, and said I would give him in charge—I would not let him go, and he gave me two kicks in the belly—I saw him putting his hands in his pockets—I do not know what he took out, as it was dark, but I felt a knife going into my belly—I hallooed out "Murder! he has stabbed me"—Boyle caught hold of him—I put my hand to my belly, and found part of my inside out—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there till 11th Feb.—I am an out-door patient still, and have been under the doctor's care ten weeks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Your uncle and fourteen others occupied one room in the house where I lived; and because I attempted to get them out, you all formed this conspiracy against me, with intent to murder me; here is the coat which I wore when you assaulted me, torn to pieces (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) and here are four of my teeth which were knocked out; your brother-in-law, and his three sons, and three daughters were the conspirators; I could not stand the smell of you all living in one room, and informed the landlord and the surveyor; the agent gave you notice, and you determined to be revenged on me; you cried for me and my wife to come down, or you would tear our livers out; you sent all the boys in the street to hoot after me; you seized me, and I tried to extricate myself; you got my finger in your mouth, and tried to eat it off; your wife came up with a poker, and knocked me on the auditory pipe, which goes to the brain, and causes a sensation all over the body; and I was struck with a hammer on the temple; and they jumped en me when I was down; you are the prin<lb></lb>cipal engine of the conspiracy. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I live next door to you—my sister and her husband and children lived in the house, and do still—you were turned out by the landlord when they went there—I heard the notice given to you to quit, but you did not go—I had nothing to do with it—my brother did not strike you, he was in the City at the time—I know nothing of your being struck by any one.</p>

                  </hi>. On 6th Feb., between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was passing Hedderman's house, and saw him and the prisoner holding each other—I went into my house, which is near, came out again and found the prisoner holding Hedderman by the neck-handkerchief; there were other people standing about—Hedderman held the prisoner, to give him in charge—the prisoner requested him to let him go, but he would not—the prisoner dropped his hands down afterwards, made a blow with his left hand, and Hedderman cried "Murder! Mr. Boyle, he has got a knife, and I am stabbed"—I rushed to the prisoner, clasped my arras round him, and saw a knife in his hand—I called to James Keyes to assist me—he took the knife from him—I held him, and gave him in charge.</p>

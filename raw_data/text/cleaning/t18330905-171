On the 17th of July, the prosecutor came, and was security for a loom for me, and he put it up - he left me about four o'clock in the afternoon; he returned about six, and said, he had been robbed - I had not seen the prisoner for a week or two before that, but that night I saw him with his sisters at the Blue Ball public-house, in Cock-lane - I looked at him a long while, because he was clean, and I had not seen him so before; I asked his sisters, if he was not their brother; they said, no - I then looked at his hand, and saw one finger was off, and I knew it was him - I flew out of the house to look for a policeman, and the prisoner escaped - the next morning I went to Mr. Sturgeon's; he went with me to a house in Castle-street - we went up stairs, and Sturgeon persuaded the prisoner to come down; there was a poker taken up, but I do not know whether the prisoner took it, or whether it was a pipe in his mouth - he ran after me into the passage.</p>

            . I worked in Rozee's shop with the prisoner, on the 15th of July, from morning till night - he went out in the morning to get some tobacco; he was a long while gone, and when he came back, he said, he had been to his sister's to borrow 1d. to buy the tobacco; he then had his dinner, smoked his pipe, and worked till eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I had my work from Mr. Green, of Steward-street, which I took to Mr. Rozee, who engaged to learn me to make velvet; at length I found he was not a trust-worthy person, being in the habit of getting drunk for three or four weeks at a time; I heard that he had lived with a female for some years, until she was committed to Newgate for robbing the person's house who had engaged her to wash and char; he then sent the children to the workhouse, and left her till she was married to a Mr. Simmons: and now Mr. and Mrs. Simmons, Mr. Rozee, and the children all live in one room. On the day named in the indictment, a young man came to pay me some money, which he had borrowed at sundry times; we staid a short time; when we came down stairs I had my dirty linen, and the young man's dirty linen, to take to my sisters to wash; the door of the workshop has no fastening, and as I came down stairs, I said to Mrs. Ghost, "Be so good as to look after the door, as Rozee is out getting drunk again;" I then left the young man, and went home to my sister's to dinner. The street-door is always open, so that any person might go up or down the stairs without being perceived; and Mr. Rozee some time ago lost his work before, while he was out at the public-house.</p>

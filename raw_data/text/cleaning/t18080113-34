               <p>Court to Gadsby. Stand up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man. - A. That is the man that had the money, the other changed the note; these two men together said they had forty pounds. At the time they were standing at the bar Butler was as close to Gadsby as I am now; Butler said do not make a noise in the woman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Butler doing. - A. I could not tell; I knew Butler, he had resorted to my house. Before Gadsby left the bar he missed the money, that moment

Foggerty he was in my tap room, he made off, and was not seen in my house till Saturday; he lodged in my house at the time. This happened in my house yesterday week. On Thursday, about seven o'clock in the evening, he left my house and was not seen till Saturday eleven o'clock at night.</p>

            . I live in George-alley. Fleet-market; I was in the soldier's company at Mrs. Murphy's the Thatched House, Field-lane; we went in the parlour and had oysters, after that they came out and had a glass of something at the bar; I saw

             very much about one of these young men when he was at the bar; I saw him put his hand into the right hand pocket of the young man who lost his money, he pulled his hand out, he did not bring any thing out then; in less than a minute he put his hand in again, and pulled out a white cloth there; seemed to be something in it about the compass of half a crownsworth of halfpence; he gave it to

            , they both went out immediately, and went up Shoe-lane as fast as they could go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Foggerty. - A. I did not. I knew Butler and Moore they used Mrs. Murphy's house.</p>
               <p>Butler. This woman has been at the bar before ever I have, she has been here for robbing a gentleman of a watch; she has been in divers prisons, although she had the good luck to get off; I find myself aggrieved that she should give her evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. If you want to impeach her evidence, you must prove it from the record of the trial.</p>
               <p>JOHN HANCOCK. I am an officer. On the night the robbery was committed, me and my brother officers were looking in at the different houses round St. Giles's. At the Black Dog St. Giles', we saw Butler, and two men answering the description of the two other men, they were drinking mixed liquor; when I went in I heard the prisoner Butler say, do you want me, or something to that purpose the expression he used was to Price; I did not know any thing about the robbery at that time, or else I should have proceed to have searched him, and the two other men; this was the very same night of the robbery a little before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Murphy. What time of night was this robbery committed on. - A. About seven.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hancock. You are sure they were all together. A. Not Foggerty; there were two men in company with Butler, they answered the description of the other men that the soldiers gave me; Butler I knew was there the other two I cannot say, I did not see Foggerty.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EKELSOE. I am an officer. On Friday the 8th of January, Wood and I were in St. Giles's; we apprehended Butler in Dyot-street, I took Foggerty on Sunday morning in Field-lane. I found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Butler's Defence. My defence is as this; on the 7th of January, which was my birth day, I was then thirty one years of age, I had some money in my pocket, which I chused to spend upon the spot where I was born, which is Plumtree-street Broad-street, St. Giles's. I went from the Thatched House, Field-lane, to that part, between the hours of seven and eight o'clock at night; I drank freely as many other persons might do Mr. Hancock might see me undoubtedly, I asked him to drink, but with regard to my asking if I was wanted it is wrong.</p>
               <p>Foggerty's Defence. If I was dying this moment,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130032"></xptr>the last word should be that I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. to Price. Q. You are beadle of St. Andrew's parish. - A. Yes. I have known Butler for a length of time: when I went into the Black Dog with Hancock, Butler said, Price I shall not drink with you, for you will not let me get a shilling since you have walked Holborn; d - n me, says he, if you want me here I am.</p>

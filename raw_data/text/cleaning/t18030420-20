               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners - did you see them on the 18th of March? - A. Yes, I saw Newlan come to Dunning's-alley, with a whip in his hand; the cart was in the alley; it was about six o'clock in the evening; Newlan, I am certain, was the man; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200028"></xptr>cart stopped on the right-hand side of the way; there were two other men with him; one was Thomas Dolphin, and the other Bill Ivatt.</p>

            ? - A.No, I rather think it was Bill Ivatt; they were drawing something off from a cask in a cart.</p>

               <p>Q. How were they drawing it off? - A.With a little brass cock and bullock's bladder; when they had drawn it off, they put it under some dung in the alley, by the side of the cart; they moved the dung, and covered it over again; then they fixed another bladder to the cock.</p>
               <p>JOHN AYRES sworn. - I am a tallow blanchard: On the 18th of March I was going down Bishopsgate-street, and within about twenty yards of the horses, in a cart in Dunning's-alley, I smelt a particularly strong smell of brandy; there were two casks in the cart; when I came even with the cart, I saw three men.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the bar? - A. Newlan is the man that drove the cart, the other I cannot speak to; when I was even with the cart, I endeavoured to get a sight of their faces, but on account of the casks I could not; as I moved, they moved the contrary way, till I got round the tail of the cart, and then they all three ran away; when I came up, I observed a brass cock annexed to the brandy puncheon, with a bladder; I examined the bladder, and found it contained brandy; I then took charge of the horses and cart, and stopped for about ten minutes; I sent for two constables, but could not find them; Newlan then came up, and asked me what business I had with the cart; he began to drive the horses and cart away, and used some abusive language; I told him, I would take him in custody as well as the cart; he endeavoured to drive the horses over me to drive away; I told him, he should not go on till I had got a peaceofficer; upon that, Mr. Matthews came up, a publican, and said, I had better let the man go, because the liquor would be seized, and he agreed to go with me; I asked Newlan for the permit, which he reluctantly produced, but it was so badly written we could not read it; Newlan said, he was going to Holborn-bridge with the liquor, and then to Bridge-street; when we came to Snow-hill, we called at the Vintner's porters, and from them we learned that the goods were going to Oxford-street, to one Mr. Harriott, and they did not choose to go with it, as they always racked it off.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that in the hearing of the prisoner? -- A. Yes; then I asked the porters where Mr. Harriott lived, and one of them told me the corner of Hanway-yard, in Oxford-street; Mr. Matthews accompanied me as far as the George and Blue Boar, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. In passing through Smithfield, did you meet a person of the name of Adams? - A. I did; he is a fellow-servant with the prisoner Newlan; he offered to take care of the cart till he got to Oxford-road, but the prisoner refused; Adams notwithstanding did join, and accompanied the cart; then I went on to Oxford-road, and left Mr. Matthews and Adams in care of the cart, as close to the George and Blue Boar as could be; I found Mr. Harriott's house, but not till after the cart had arrived there; I found the cart in the same state in which I left it; in consequence of what passed between the prisoner and Mr. Harriott, a coach was sent for to convey Mr. Harriott, myself, Mr. Matthews, and another person, into the City, to Messrs. Bridges and Reay's; the prisoner Newlan voluntarily offered to go behind the coach; we left Adams in care of the cart, and drove to Messrs. Bridges and Reay's; when we arrived there, Newlan was not to be found; I did not see him again that evening; I communicated all I had observed to the prosecutors.</p>

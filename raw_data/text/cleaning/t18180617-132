The prisoner ran away, although my master asked him to go and have some refreshment. He returned in ten minutes, and said he had been for some tea. When he returned, I showed him the letter; he cried. I told him there was a spoon missing, and he must be searched. He said he had not got it. He was searched, and a handkerchief was found on him, marked

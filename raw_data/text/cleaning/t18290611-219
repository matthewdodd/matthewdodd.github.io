On the 10th of June a person called me from up stairs, and said that a parcel was gone from the door; I went down and missed it - I followed the prisoner, who was then out of sight; I came up with him at the distance of two or three streets; he had turned some corners, and had thrown the cotton down - a person gave it me; I had seen it safe a few minutes before.</p>

            . I am a glazier, and live in the Edgware-road. On the 10the of June I saw my next door neighbour run to the prosecutor's door; I saw the prisoner running down Chapel-street with a bundle - I pursued him, he turned two corners, and was near two hundred yards from the prosecutor's when he dropped the bundle, I pursued him into a court and took him - I am certain he is the person I saw carrying the bundle - it was not taken up till I brought him back to the place where it had been dropped, and I took it up - he had been running very fast.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the Horse and Sack, kept by Mr. Moss. The prisoner came in on this Saturday night, before the prosecutor - he sat in the taproom for a minute, and then stood up by the fire; I saw the prisoner speak to him; he called for a quartern of gin, and gave me half a crown - I gave him the change; the prisoner then put her hand into his pocket, and pulled out the money; the men who had been drinking with her were laughing and talking together, and she dropped all but two half-crowns and one shilling, which she kept in her hand - the prosecutor accused her of the robbery; my master was serving in the bar, and knew nothing of it till morning - the house was cleared because it was twelve o'clock - I believe the prisoner went away with the men; I found no money on the floor - I believe the men picked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him by the Red Lion; he took me to this house, and paid for some fish for me there - I heard some money drop, but do not know where it came from; I got intoxicated, and do not know what became of him.</p>

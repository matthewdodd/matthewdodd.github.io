             sworn. - I am servant to my Lord Essex; the day after Christmas-day a fire happened at my Lord Essex's house: as soon as my Lord and Lady had got out of the house, I thought it necessary to secure the plate in the dining-room; the moment I came back from my Lord Macartney's, where I had conducted my Lord and and Lady to, I found about a dozen or fourteen people in the dining-room; I ordered them all to withdraw, the prisoner was one of them; three or four of them were very unwilling to go; I desired them to go by fair means, otherwise I should use force; they all went out, and I locked the door immediately, and put the key in my pocket; I then went to my Lord's dressing-room for some writings, and, in about two minutes, I returned to the dining-room door, which I found burst open; I entered the room, and saw the prisoner putting spoons in his pocket; there were six or seven more people in the room with him; he took them from the plates that were upon the table in the dining-room; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090027"></xptr>went towards him, but the other people crouded me so, that he made his escape out at the door; I thought he had been gone through the porter's hall; I went to look for him, but could not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not speak to him at the time you saw him taking the spoons? - A. No; I returned and saw him in the room adjoining the dining-room, that we call the drawing-room; he was there handling something at my Lady's writing-desk; I caught him by the collar, and asked him what he had in his pocket; he said, nothing, but his own; I told him I should search him; he told me, I should not; by force I searched him, and took four spoons out of his coat pocket; I took the spoons in one hand, and him in the other, and delivered the spoons up to General St. John, who was at the door; I delivered the prisoner up to two people that I knew, who took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have learned since who this man is, have not you, that he is a hair-dresser, in Wells-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do not you know he was acquainted with some of the servants in Lord Essex's family? - A. He was not, nor I never saw his face till that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Lord Shrewsbury's family? - A. Only the butler, by sight.</p>
               <p>Q.They live in the same street? - A. No, in Stanhope-street, which is close by.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know he has met with Lord Effex's servants frequently in Lord Shrewsbury's family? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q.You are not a livery-servant? - A. Yes, I am, but my livery coat was so bad, that I could not put it on; I was in livery at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that he was taking care of them for the family? - A. He did not say any any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you happen to know whether he actually secured any articles for the family? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The man had got completely out of your sight, and might have got out of the house? - A. Yes, he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the publican who lives over the way, that day? - A.No.</p>
               <p>General St. JOHN sworn. - I was at my Lord Effex's on the day when this misfortune happened, I was standing before the house soon after the fire; I saw the last witness, with several other people, bringing in a man that seemed to be in custody; Alsbury desired the favour of me to take these spoons into my possession, which he said he had taken from a man who was then in custody; I cannot say whether that man was the prisoner or not; I have had these spoons ever since, (produces them); I know these table-spoons to be my Lord Essex's, there are the coronet and arms upon them; the other two spoons have my Lady Essex's initials upon them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Alsbury. I believe he was in liquor at the time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I went with Wilson to drink tea at Stanhope-street, at Lord Shrewsbury's, to see a friend of mine, and he was to wait at a public-house till I called for him, and when I went he was gone; the fire had happened in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the public-house from Lord Essex's? - A. About one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him after the fire took place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six respectable witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>The Jury wished to recommend the prisoner to mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very bad offence taking advantage of the calamity of fire to commit depredations.</p>
               <p>Foreman. The ground of our recommendation was the good character that he has hitherto maintained, together with the circumstance of his being in a state of inebriety.</p>

I volunteered to go on board his Majesty's Ship the Harpy, at Sheerness. I went on board for about an hour, she was full, and we returned to town.

            . I was one of the men on board the Flying Fish. The prisoner was one of the crew which consisted of four - I had my things in a bundle - I took it ashore with me. On opening it I missed a new shirt - I had seen my bundle under the prisoner's legs the night before - I asked him for it - he pretended to be asleep. I found my shirt on his back at the office.</p>

            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 26th of October I went on board the Flying Fish, the prisoner and Holstock were on board, and in Cunningham's bed-cabin I found a false bottom newly laid down. I had it opened, and found the drawers, and check shirt; one pair of mitts; one pair of worsted stockings; one comfort; one black handkerchief, and one book. I took them to the office. Cunningham claimed the shirt the prisoner wore. I took it off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in Carnaby-street. I sleep in the front attic—on the 26th of January, about eleven o'clock at night, I went to bed and put my clothes by the side of my bed—on the following morning, between four and five o'clock, I awoke and heard a strange voice in the room—I got up, and went down stairs—I went back again for a light, and locked for my clothes—I found my waistcoat moved from where I had left it, and missed half-a-sovereign, half-a-crown, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I had safe the night before, when I went to bed—I afterwards accused the prisoner of taking it—she was a stranger, but had come up to the room with a young man named Dowling—he is not here—the landlord does not allow women to be brought there—she was in bed there when I went down stairs, for I saw her—it was light enough to see by the gas—I got a po<lb></lb>liceman, and she was then up, and dressed, standing on the landing—I do not think she was undressed all night—I accused her of taking my mo<lb></lb>ney—she denied it, and said she had no money about her—she was searched, and half-a-sovereign, half-a-crown, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on her, in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I met a gentleman in Regent-street, who gave me a sove<lb></lb>reign—I went into two or three public-house, and had something to drink—I cannot recollect what house I changed the sovereign at—I then met a tailor, and he took me up to some room—he knew I had the money, and he told his mate of it, who then said I had stolen his money. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Dowling is a tailor—I described the money I lost to the policeman in the morning before it was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prosecutor did not state the amount of his loss before I took the prisoner—he merely said he had been robbed—I kept Dowling in custody while I searched the prisoner, and found the money—when charged with having this money, she said she had none—I found it in her boson, in a pocket-handkerchief—there was half-a-sovereign, half-a-crown, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she told the Magistrate she had met a gentleman. and it was the change of a sovereign; but when I found it on her, she made on reply—Adams said he had lost 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked if he had marked any of it—he said not, but it was half-a-sovereign, half-a-crown, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—that was before I searched her—I found the coin he specified, and some halfpence as well with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It was within 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the money I got—his companion had seen me tie it up at the public-house, and they guessed it within 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

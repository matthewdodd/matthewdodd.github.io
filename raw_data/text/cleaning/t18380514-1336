On the 3rd of May the three pri<lb></lb>soners came to the shop together—Barnadine had a child—they asked to see some silk handkerchiefs—I showed them several—they all looked at them—I then saw Barnadine go to the top of the shop, above the others, take a piece of print, and walk out with it—the child was cross, and I suppose she made that a cause for leaving the shop—she took the print in going out—I do not know that the other two saw her take it—she was followed out by Mr. Davies—I went on showing the other two the handkerchiefs, and saw</p>

               <p>Effingham draw a piece of silk handkerchief from under the others, and put it under her dress—I do not think she was aware that I had sent anybody after Barnadine—Mr. Davies and a policeman then came in with Barnar<lb></lb>dine, and Effingham attempted to put the handkerchiefs she had taker again under the wrapper on the counter, and I took the wrapper from her—she then threw the piece of handkerchiefs down by the side of the counter—she took it from under her dress.</p>

I am a milk-man, and occupy a shop and parlour and first floor in Park-street, Dorset-square—the rest of the house is occupied by two lodgers—the landlord does not live in the house—his name is Richard Parsley—on the 22nd of July I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock, in the back room first floor with my wife—I was awoke a little after three in the morning by my wife—I got out of bed and found the bed-room door open, which I had shut myself—my wife was in bed before me—I went on to the landing-place, looked over the banisters, and saw a woman at the bottom of the stairs—I</p>

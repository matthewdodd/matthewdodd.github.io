                  </hi>. On 10th Aug., at seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop and bought six yards of print and three yards of calico of my wife—I was not in the shop, but could see her—my wife called me forward—I went, and the prisoner said she had paid my wife for a dress—I said, "Where did you put the money?"—she said she had put it on the counter—I said, if so, I would clear the counter and look for it—I was clear<lb></lb>ing the counter, there was no money there—I then said I would send for policeman, to see where the money was, as I could not allow it to pass without finding the money—she said, "Send for a policeman for me, will you; I will soon put a stop to that"—I was on the same side of the counter as her and she struck me on the head several blows, apparently with her hand—I pushed her from me, she ran forward to me again, and I then saw a ife in her hand—I laid hold of her wrist, and when she found she could not knife in her hand away she tried to bite me—she had cut me before this—my wife had gone to the door to send for a policeman—when she came back I told her to get the knife from her, and she got it from her with great difficulty—I held the prisoner till a policeman came and took her—she cut me and bit me on the shoulder—I bled considerably for nearly half-an-hour.</p>

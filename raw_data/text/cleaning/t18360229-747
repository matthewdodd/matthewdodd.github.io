                  </hi>. On the 30th of January I went to the house kept by Ridley, and found the prisoner there—I asked him if his name was Colson—he said it was—I said I wanted to speak to him privately, and took him out in the front, and asked him if he knew a person of the name of Gibbs, in Newsport-street—he said he did—I asked him when he saw him last—he said on Thursday last he lunched with him—I then told him I wished him to go with me to Mr. Gibbs, for he had lost a cash-box—I took him to the station-house, and then I went to his boxes, which Mr. Ridley said he had brought, and I found a key, seal, and ring, and this bag, with thirty-five sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in it.</p>

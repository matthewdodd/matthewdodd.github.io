               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; on the 25th April, the prisoner was going to leave my house, I asked her leave to look into her box; she went up stairs immediately and unlocked the box; when the box was opened, I found the several articles that are mentioned in the indictment in her box, of my property; and, on searching her person, I found a padlock concealed, sewed up, in a white towel, under her upper petticoat; the towel was mine, it was marked C. No. 4; and the padlock was our's; I asked her if they were mine, and she said, yes, ma'am, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any promises to her, or threats to induce her to confess? - A. I did not, she said they were mine; I should have let her go, but finding the padlock upon her, I kept her till I sent for Mr. Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. Why because of the padlock? - A. Because in the night of the 11th of April, some thieves had got into the house, and stolen out some property, she lived with us at that time; I knew nothing of the robbery till the morning she came up first and alarmed me; there were four hams, and two sides of bacon, which they got off with.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did this lead you to keep her till Mr. Clark came? - A. Because this padlock fastened down the cellar window, at which she said the thieves entered; we had searched for the padlock that morning, and she was one that helped me and my friends to look for it, and we never found it; I am sure that the things that were found upon her are mine, (they were produced and deposed to by Mr. and Mrs. Clark).</p>
               <p>Mr. Clark. I was out of town at the time of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110099"></xptr>the burglary, and when I came to town, I made every search for the padlock, and she knew I was very anxious to find it, because I was confident that lock could not have been picked, it is of a very peculiar construction; I am sure it is mine, and I have the key belonging to it, (produces it).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My mistress's house was broke open when I was a-bed and a-sleep; the day before I was coming away, I found this padlock, and was afraid to give it to my mistress, because she scolds so very much, that I was afraid; and she said, if I would confess who had got the bacon and ham, she would not hurt me. <rs id="t17960511-32-verdict164" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a coal heaver, and live at Brentford. On the 15th of September, about nine o'clock at night, I was at Brentford fair—the prisoner was standing near me—I felt somebody at my pocket—I looked, and saw the prisoner's hand in my right-hand trowsers pocket, in which was a crown-piece—I am not certain whether I had a shilling or not—I laid hold of her hand, and told her she had put her hand in my pocket, and taken a crown-piece out—she said she had not, and was very abusive—I gave her to the policeman—I saw him find a crown-piece in the same hand which had been in my pocket—she tried to throw it away several times—this is my crown—I never spoke to her till I found her hand in my pocket.</p>

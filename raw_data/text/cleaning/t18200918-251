A person who is not apprehended, came up and hit me a blow in my neck; I should know him again - I felt it for some moments. At the same time he snatched at my watch; the chain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180095"></xptr>broke, and he got the seals and key; he then handed it either to Edwards or Wherry, which I cannot say - they were immediately behind him in his company. I seized the man who struck me, and called for assistance. I was beset by several of them, and had stones and other things thrown at me - I still held the man until I was knocked down by several - I saw Wolfe among them. When they had partly dispersed, I got up and found several more hustling me to get my pocket-book. I got away as quick as I could - I was obliged to escape through a gateway into a marble-yard for safety. In an hour or two, I saw Edwards and Wherry among a crowd near White Conduit-house - I pointed them out to Smith; they were then secured. I seized Edwards myself, and gave him to Smith - they both ran away as they saw me with Smith and other officers - they were secured near thirty yards off. When I was in Portland-road, I had a second scuffle with the man I at first seized, and who had been rescued from me. I was struck at several times, and saw Wherry about the crowd. While I was being hustled, I felt a hand in my coat-pocket; as soon as I could turn round, I saw Wolfe was nearest behind me, and several loose papers about his feet, which were taken from my pocket. I was very much beaten. He was apprehended the next day. The second attack was twenty or thirty yards from where the first was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether Wherry or Edwards took the seals from the man, you cannot say - A. No, he extended his hand towards them. They were among the crowd while I was being beat - they threw stones at me; one of the stones hit me in the neck. They were along with the man at the time he robbed me.</p>

            . I am keeper of St. Pancras watch-house. I was at White Conduit-house, and saw Mr. Teasdale at the top of the hill; he pointed out Edwards and Wherry among a gang of nine or ten. Edwards turned round and looked, and the whole gang ran off different ways. I followed and secured Edwards - he made great resistance. I told him he was a pickpocket - he then fought very hard, and one of those behind me struck me. As soon as I got hold of him, he whipped his hand into his pocket. I took two seals and a broken ring out of his hand; they have not been owned; he was trying to throw them away. I took him to the watch-house, and the other two were delivered to me.</p>

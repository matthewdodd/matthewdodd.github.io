             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have known the prisoner five or six years; I lived with him last Michaelmas, and about a month before, in Bethnal-green Road.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come home that morning? - A. Between twelve and one; he went out again in a few minutes, and returned in about an hour and a half, about half past two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark then? - A. Dark; he came up stairs, and Moore followed him; Moore had the copper and the linen; he had nothing with him; he came up stairs first; I was in bed; they put the copper and the things into my room, and they continued there till morning, when Moore put them upon the garret-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time the next morning did they go out? - A. Not till four o'clock in the afternoon; the officers came on the Sunday in the morning, about half past nine; the prisoner and Moore were neither of them there. I did not go up stairs with the officers, but I saw them bring the things down; there was in the copper, a nankeen waistcoat, a child's frock, a cotton bed-gown, and a piece of calico, like a breakfast-cloth; when the prisoner came home he was secured and taken to the watch-house; I was afterwards taken to the watch-house and put into a separate cage; he said he was very sorry for the situation he had brought me to; he asked where Moore was; I said, he ought to be taken as well as he; he said, no, never mind, don't say any thing about Moore: he said he was sure of suffering himself.(The property was deposed to by Mrs. Hopwood.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner. (To Tapp.) Q. Did I ever rent that room? - A. I rented it, at his desire; and he always gave me the money to pay the rent.</p>

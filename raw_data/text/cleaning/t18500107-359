                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watch-maker, at 147, Fleet-street. On Wednesday, 2nd Jan., the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I had got a good watch—I said I had, and showed him two or three silver ones, which I considered suitable for a man in his station of life; he looked like a sailor—he said be did not mind about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, but he must have a good watch, it was for a present to his uncle in America—I then produced a gold one, the price of which was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he looked at it, and seemed to make up his mind, and purchase it—I laid it on the counter, and he said, "Will you say 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said no, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price—he then asked for a good heavy chain, I showed him one—he said it was not heavy enough, had I got a heavier one—I went to the other side of the counter to get a heavier one, and a handful of pepper immediately came into my eyes, which blinded me, and when I recovered my sight the watch and the prisoner were gone—the transaction altogether did not take ten minutes—I had the opportunity of seeing his face—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—I have since seen the watch in the prisoner's possession.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Cohen, a general dealer, of 67, Royal Mint-street—he is a reformed Jew—on Thursday afternoon, about four o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop, and asked me to buy the ticket of a watch—my mistress came and asked what he wanted for it—he said 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he had bought it in Fleet-street, and given 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, he was paid off from the Navy twelve weeks ago; he said some weeks, whether it was three or twelve—I think it was twelve—he said nothing about having picked up the duplicate in King William-street—I went, at my mistress's direction, to the pawnbroker's, taking 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with me, to get it out, for my mistress to see if she would buy it—my mistress asked the prisoner if he would go with me—he said no, and she invited him into the parlour—when I got to the pawnbroker's, a policeman came in—he took the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., came back with me, and took the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. James's. On the night of the 24th of August I was in the <placeName id="t18290910-193-crimeloc1081">Quadrant, in Regent-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. About ten o'clock at night - it was dark, but this was between two lamps; he ran down by the County Fire-office and into another street; here is a mark on the handkerchief; as soon as we had taken him I endeavoured to find who the gentleman was, but he was gone, and I could not find him; I was on the opposite side of the way, and did not lose sight of him as he turned the corner; I swear I saw him throw the handkerchief from his hand at the corner of the Quadrant, where it was quite light; I was hardly five yards from him - I swear I 
saw him take it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard Williams cry Stop thief! I sprung my rattle, and pursued the prisoner up the street; Williams had picked up the handkerchief - I saw him in a stooping position when the prisoner ran from him; I pursued to Queen-street, he made a halt at the door of the Catherine Wheel, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What distance was the officer from the prisoner? A. I should think not ten yards - there were no sharp turnings, they were in a slanting direction; I did not see the handkerchief thrown away.</p>

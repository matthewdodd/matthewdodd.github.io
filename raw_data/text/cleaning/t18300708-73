            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in Brewer-street on the 5th of June - I saw Bilston with a quarter of lamb; he took it to a shop, and asked them to let him leave it there for an hour - they thought it was not all right, and spoke to me; I watched till he came back and had the lamb - he went out and round the corner, where he met King, who had some other meat; they went to some shops, and both King and Bilston tried to sell it - I then took them; I showed the meat to Daley - King said he had bought the meat for 12s.</p>

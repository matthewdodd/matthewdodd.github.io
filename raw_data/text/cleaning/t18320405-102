I was left in care of the cart, and between seven and eight o'clock I saw the prisoner come out of Londonhouse-yard; I was called to help another man with three sheep, and when I came from helping him I saw the prisoner pass the yard that leads to the Goose and Gridiron, with the carcass of a sheep on his shoulder; I went up to him, and asked him what he was going to do with that; he said he had just had it given him to carry - I took him into custody, and looked into the cart; there was no carcass there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was not running? A. No, walking; I had seen him about the market before, but I did not know him: he made no resistance.</p>

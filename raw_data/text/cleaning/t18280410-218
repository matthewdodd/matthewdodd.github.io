            . I was at the Brunswick Theatre; there was a great rush; I heard the prosecutor call out, "Don't hurt my wife;" I saw Gray had got hold of the prosecutor's coat on his right hand side, and his other hand was under the coat: Hall pushed against him close to the prosecutor, and in a moment Newton called out"He has got it" - I looked and saw the watch fall; it dropped as if from Gray, but I did not see it in any one's hand; there was a crowd at the time, in consequence of some vehicle going by.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was a rush backwards and forwards? A. Yes; we were all pushed against the prosecutor.</p>

            . I was with Waddington, and saw Hall with his hands in a direction towards the prosecutor; he gave Gray something, which he put into his right-hand trousers pocket - Hall was in front of him, and Gray close at his right-hand side; I collared Gray directly; he put his hand into his pocket, and took something out, and the pocket with it; and in struggling I saw this watch in the kennel, between his legs; I did not see it fall - it was something small that Hall gave Gray.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear Waddington examined? A. Yes; we were all pushed together; Hall was pressed violently against the prosecutor- he could not prevent it; there were above a hundred persons there: Hall was hardly master of his hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. And yet you saw Gray put something into his pocket, and take it out again? A. Yes - there were several people pushing against us; I did not hear the watch fall; I first saw it on the ground; Gray had not been pushed about at that time- I kept him pretty steady.</p>

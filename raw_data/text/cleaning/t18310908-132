            . I was in Old-street-road on the 6th of July; the prisoner came up, passed me, and picked up a paper parcel, close at my side - he opened it, and took out a bill, which he requested me to read; it said, "Two gold rings, and one pair of handsome gold ear-rings, with drops, 5l. 19s. 6d." - he said he could not read writing; I read it, and gave him the bill back - he said he wished it had been two sovereigns, it would have done him more service, as he was going out of town that afternoon; he then left me, and went to Shoreditch - I went up Kingsland-road, and had not gone far before another man passed me, and he picked up a paper - he said to me,"I have not found a prize;" I had not gone far before the prisoner overtook me again, and said if I liked I should have the jewellery for 30s. - I said I did not know how much I had about me, but would see; I looked and found I had but 7s. and a sovereign, which I gave him for the rings and the ear-rings, and we parted - I had told him I had seen the other man, who told me a lady in her carriage had just dropped some jewellery, that her footman was looking for it, and there would be a reward of three sovereigns for it in the morning; the man had told me so - the prisoner said he should not hear of that, as he was going out of town, and if I gave him 30s. for them, and went to the place I should get 30s. for myself - I took them to a jeweller's on the following Saturday; I am told they are not worth 4s.</p>

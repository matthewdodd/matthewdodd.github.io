                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Stone-buildings. The prisoner was my clerk—I am agent to Mr. Bishop, of Exeter—the pri<lb></lb>soner was authorized to receive money due to me or Mr. Bishop, and pay it to me at the time, or else the same evening, and to send to me at the same time an account of all business done, and a part of that would be the money he had received and paid—he had a general authority for receiving money—on the 16th of March he gave me no account of the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—nor did he mention the transaction—on the 2nd of August he gave me no account of any sums of money received from Messrs Clark and Metcalf—nor any account of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received of them on Mr. Bishop's account—I discharged him on the 2nd of November, this year—up to that time he had made no statement at all of these sums—I knew nothing about the receipt of them at that time—I have an account of them in the prisoner's hand-writing, given to me since—neither of these three sums have ever been paid me—I am the general agent of Mr. Bishop—I transact all his business—I receive money for him, and pay it—this paper was given me by Mr. Homerton, who recommended the prisoner to me as clerk—and there I find the prisoner had received several other sums, independent of these—Mr. Force was a clerk to Mr. Bishop, and he had been a clerk to me in January last—he was employed as my clerk, to collect accounts due to Mr. Bishop—the prisoner had no authority to re<lb></lb>ceive these sums of money from any one but me—Mr. Bishop delivered me a book, which contains these sums, authorizing me to receive them—I had the list from him—there were two sums of Clerk and Metcalf, of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were due to Mr. Bishop—the prisoner had access to that book, which was delivered to me by Mr. Bishop himself.</p>

I had lent him some time before, and part of which was due to me; and as he left me on the Tuesday I thought it was better to take as acknowledgment from him—the receipt was for the wages—I did not owe him any wages, they were due on the Saturday, and leaving me as he did I considered he was not entitled to any—this is the receipt—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the salary for that week—I owned him no money on the 2nd of November—I never told him I would not prosecute—Mr. Force did not act as autho<lb></lb>rized by Mr. Bishop to receive his money—he is living at Exeter—Moon sat in the same room as the prisoner—Force never received accounts for Mr. Bishop which he was not obliged to account to me for—I never asked for any bill of exchange of the prisoner, nor authorized any body to ask it—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—I was under no engagement, but I have occasion<lb></lb>ally given him cast-off clothes—I cannot say whether any person while Force was in the office, came and paid any of Bishop's debts to Force, and the prisoner—I did not allow Force any salary—he was an articled clerk—I had this book from Mr. Bishop himself, to receive the sums—this letter was delivered to me by him to receive the sum of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had a letter to receive every sum in this book—I cannot show any authority to receive the sums mentioned in the indictment, because the prisoner has taken those letters, and called on the persons for the sums—I have had those letters withdrawn from my drawer, to which the prisoner had access—the parties would not have paid without some authority—the prisoner never to my knowledge paid any sums of money collected by him, to Force for Bishop, when Force was in the office—Force left in January last—this letter is an authority—there is no signature to it, but he had so many to collect (<hi rend="italic">reads.</hi>) "Sir,—Above I send you the Under Sheriff's charges, which I will thank you to pay to Mr. William Harris, 5 Stone-buildings Lincolns Inn, as the delay in payment of these small bills occasions great inconvenience, your early attention will oblige,—Sir, your most obedient servant"—I received in each case in which I was to obtain money for Bishop, a special authority from him—I have asked the clerk of Metcalf and Clark whether he had any letter corresponding with the one I put in—the prisoner paid no money to Force by my desire or to my knowledge—Force has paid me no money on account of Mr. Bishop—I know he has received money for him—that was when he was in my office—he accounted to me for it, but did not pay it to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

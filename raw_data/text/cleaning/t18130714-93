I lost my watch on the 30th of June. It was my business that night to get some nightmen together; coming out of the public-house in the New-road, very near the four crossings, I was accosted by two females. I cannot swear to the prisoner's person; I was accosted by her or some one; this one, if she is the same, she turned back; she appeared to be frightened and agitated; some conversation passed respecting the weather. She asked me if I was a married man; I told her yes; and when we came to the corner she left me and crossed to the <placeName id="t18130714-93-crimeloc540">Hampstead-road</placeName>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Friday night, the 2nd of July, I received information from Gentery that he had been robbed of his watch. The next morning I apprehended the prisoner at her lodging; I desired her to give me the watch, or the duplicate of the watch that she had taken from a person a night or two back; she accordingly fetched it me, stating that she had had taken it from a person on Wednesday; he had only gave her four pence; she did not think that enough. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me for a ticket of a thimble; I said I had a ticket of a watch; I went and got it him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch.</p>

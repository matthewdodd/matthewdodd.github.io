                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and carry on business in Brewer-street, Somer's-town, in the parish of St. Pancras. I reside at No.67, Pratt-street, Camden-town—my wife carries on the business of the shop, with the assistance of a shopman, named James—I do not know his other name—he lives and sleeps in the house—there are lodgers in the house—my house was broken open no Sunday, the 14th of February—I had attended to business that morning in the shop—un<lb></lb>fortunately, I open on Sunday morning—I am collector of poor rates for St. Pancras, and am engaged the whole week in that occupation—on Sunday morning my wife generally remains in Pratt-street and I generally go down to look after the business in Brewer-street—both the houses are in St. Pancras parish—the shopman was also there that day—I left at a little after twelve o'clock on Sunday morning, the shopman left with me—I left nobody in the house—every door and window were fastened and locked, I believe, expect the room occupied by three young gentlemen, who merely deep in the house—their door was not locked, they are not in the habit of locking it—the shopman is always at home at ten o'clock at night—the fa<lb></lb>ther of the young gentlemen lives in the same street, and if the shopman is not at home, they wait there till he comes home—I locked the street door and</p>

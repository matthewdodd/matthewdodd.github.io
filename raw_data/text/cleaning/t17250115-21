James Hughs deposed, that going along Shoe-Lame in a very dark Night, the Prisoner catched hold of his Arm, and, My Dear, says she, where are you going? Won't you give me a Pint? You sawcy Bitch, (says he) what should I give you a Pint for? By - , says she, I will have a Kiss then; and throwing one Hand round his Neck, he felt the other in his Pocket. Rot your Impudence, for a corrupted Toad, says he; do you want to pick my Pocket? He push'd her from him, felt for his Money, mist it, stopt her, and she cry'd out Murder. The Prisoner in her Defence said, that as she was passing by the Prosecutor, he threw his Arm round her, and would needs go home with her. They went together to a Neighbour's House, where he gave her 2 s. to occupy her. He would have lain with her all Night; but because she refused, he charged her with picking his Pocket. <rs id="t17250115-21-verdict112" type="verdictDescription">

            , senior. I am the husband of the last witness. The rabbits were left at my house on the 7th of January. The prisoner, Bridgen, came and another with him, and wanted 12s. for them. I found a silver-grey doe among them, which I knew had been mine. I told them that I had sold it, but they said they had bred it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150054"></xptr>themselves; they said that they lived at Purim-place, Dog-row, and that the rabbits were there own, and that I might go home with them to see the hutches, if I would buy them. I gave them 8s. and told them I would pay them the rest when they brought the hutches. I sent my son to look at the hutches, when he came back I looked more distinctly at the rabbits in consequence of what he said, and remembered selling the silver doe to Mr. Bloom. I shewed them all to him and he claimed them.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BAXTER, jun. My father sent me with Bridgen, and another boy, to look at the hutches, when we got to Church-street, they said they would not sell them, as they were going to keep more rabbits; and they sent me back again.</p>

            . I set up at Mr. Bloom's to watch the premises; I saw Bridgen come from the premises with another boy, they had forced the back gate open; it was about half-past one o'clock in the morning. I apprehended him, and found a chisel, a phosphorus-box, and matches on him, while I was taking him before the magistrate, he said that there were six of the party, and gave me their names, he said that two were on the look out and four went in, and that he had taken the rabbits. I afterwards took Ross, Gibbons.</p>

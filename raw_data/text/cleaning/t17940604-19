I see the stockings there in December last, I had no occasion to open the parcels to miss any thing from that time; when I missed them I let the matter rest till Monday, it being late of Saturday, and between Saturday and Monday I searched further to ascertain what I had lost. On Monday I went to the police office, in Hatton Garden, and got a warrant, and had the prisoner apprehended and searched, and part of my property was found on her; I searched her person and box; finding part of my property on her, I had reason to suspect Thomas Baker, her father, of having received part of my property;

Thomas Baker on the Sunday preceeding his being apprehended, he came to a public house in my neighbourhood and sent for his daughter; I sent for him over; he would not come; he always used before to come to my house, and I made him welcome; that day he would not come, I suspected that he had got a pair of my stockings on; I went over to the public house, and I see he had got a pair of stockings on which I thought was mine; the next day after I had the woman apprehended; I told my suspicion to the police office, and had a warrant and apprehended him; we searched his box and found part of my property in it, it was in Bowl-court Shoreditch; his wife said it was his box; I always heard and understood that he lived there, from his daughter; I don't know that I ever heard it from him, his wife was there; I found there about four yards of printed cotton, two pair of hose, two wooden shaving boxes, and a glass ink stand, and a duplicate for two pair of stockings; the witness here has got them, the things are all here.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Thomas. At the time that Vaux comes up to me, he comes and tells me that my daughter was taken for theft? I am very sorry for it, says I, and says he, you must come and bail her; I said then if she had been a thief, I would not come nigh her; and I went all about with him to the pawnbrokers, and never knew I was a prisoner. I told them if she had thieved, there were some of the goods in my place, a piece of cotton, and a pair of white stockings, I acknowledged this to him, and if I had thought they had been wrong got, I should not have permitted them to have been there.</p>

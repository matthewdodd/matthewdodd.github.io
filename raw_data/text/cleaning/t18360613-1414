                  </hi>. I am a silk trimming manufacturer, and carry on business in Twister's Alley, Bunhill-Row. I have no partner—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my employ for a considerable time—having heard something from the foreman, I thought it necessary to go to the prisoner, and told him he was short in some silk—he said he did not know any thing about it—I said he had secreted some silk in the shop—he said he did not know; if he had,</p>

I was present when he spoke to the prisoner—he asked him if he knew any thing of two bobbins of lavender silk, which were concealed in the shop—he said he did—Mr. Machu then said where were they—he said he could find them—on saying that, Mr. Machu sent me again to search the place of its concealment, to see of it was there—it was not—I knew the place, because I had watched it for two nights, and when the silks were removed from there, I communicated it to Mr. Machu—the prisoner then said he could find them if they were there—he took me to the place where the property and been concealed, and they were not there—when he could not find them, he said he did not know any thing about them—I had seen them there about half an hour before they were removed.</p>

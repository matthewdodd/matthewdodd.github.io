My husband talks of taking some stables in town, and he brings his things a little at a time; I was in the one horse chaise; the sack was tied behind the chaise with a saddle upon it; I came from Biggleswade, in Bedfordshire; I never see him take it, till the brewer's servant came and told me I was robbed; I was then just at the lower end of St. John's-street.</p>

I see the man attempt to cut behind that chaise. Then we followed down half down the narrow way of St. John's-street, and then we see this man cut at it again; then the prisoner took it from behind the chaise, and we took him with the property in his arms; he was going from the chaise with it; we took him before he got on the pavement; then I gave it to the other man to hold while I went and stopped the chaise with the lady; I asked the lady whether she had any thing tied behind the chaise? she said she had; I asked her what it was? she said a sadule with a sack. The man that was along with me took care of the sack, while I went with the prisoner to the watch house.</p>

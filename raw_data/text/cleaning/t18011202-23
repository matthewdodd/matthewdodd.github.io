               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Beside examining the prisoner's pocket, did you examine the bag into which the filings had been put? - A. Not particularly, but I took out the cuttings of the coffee-pot; I took out all he had left; he could not have filed any large quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you did not put that in the pocket and that in the bag into the scale together? - A. The silver in the bag would not come off the pot in that stage of it; there were no scrapings came off.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner worked at home you cannot speak to? - A. He had no tools.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the boy deliver these things? - A. I did not; but it was impossible he could take any out.</p>

I have very little to say in my own defence; I have been in the habit of being an employed master myself, and was going to do a small job; I had silver of my own, and only wanted to take a piece of folder, and meant to put a piece of silver in the place of it; I have served Mr. Pontifex faithfully and honestly, and he has been a good master to me; but I wish I had served my God as well as I served Mr. Pontifex, I should have nothing now to lament.</p>

I am the wife of William White, of 7 1/2, Clarendon-place, Somers-town—we occupy the first-floor; it is in the parish of St. Pancras—on Monday, 20th Jan., I went out at half-past two o'clock—I locked my door, and took the key with me—I did not leave any one in my part of the house—I returned at a quarter before five—I found my</p>

I saw the prisoner at Mrs. White's on a Monday, three weeks ago, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I was going down-stairs, and he was knocking at Mrs. White's door—I went down into the kitchen, and when I came up again I saw him coming along the passage from Mrs. White's part of the house—he had a bundle under his arm—his face was towards me—I saw him twice—I am sure he is the man—I saw him again at the Magistrate's last Monday—Mrs. White took me to see him; I recognized him in the Court.</p>

I live in Mrs. White's house; she occupies the first-floor—three weeks ago to-day I saw the prisoner in Clarendon-place, opposite Mrs. White's; he walked up and down, and looked at the houses opposite; that was half-past three o'clock—I had seen Mrs. White go out before—in about twenty minutes I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. White's, with a bundle—I did not see him come out, but some children said, "That man has come out of the house; I think he is a thief"—in consequence of that I took particular notice of him—I have no doubt he is the man—he had no bundle when I first saw him.</p>

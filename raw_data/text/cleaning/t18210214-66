In about an hour and a half, the prisoner asked for the money for the room, 1 s., which I gave her. I counted my money, and I asked where I was to sleep? She said,</p>
               <p>"In that room." They went out and shut the door. In the morning, I was interrupted about five o'clock - I felt something moving under the pillow; and by the light of the fire, I saw the prisoner with my breeches, taking the money out. She threw them down - I insisted on having the money - she refused. I went to the door to call the watch, but could not make him hear: on my return, the woman was gone, but the prisoner remained. I went again, and saw the watchman, who came in and took her. I am positive she is the woman.</p>

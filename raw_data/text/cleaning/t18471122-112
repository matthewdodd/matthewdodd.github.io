                  </hi> I am an attorney at Guildhall-chambers, and at Enfield.

               <p>done so—I am not prepared to say where it was executed, or whether I was present at its execution—my name is not there as an attesting witness, therefore the presumption is that I was not—I have no recollection of Mrs. Phipps refusing to sign it on finding it was an absolute sale of her life-in<lb></lb>terest, nor of my taking away the deed and bringing another in ten days, which she signed.</p>

Mr. Lucena was employed by the creditors to oppose me in the Insolvent Court, and during the time of my incarceration he went down to Mr. Rance, stating he was a friend of mine, and though he had orders to attend the Court, told him he could transact the business for him without his coming up; after I came out of prison, Mr. Addington pitied my case very much, and lent me 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay my creditors 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; they all signed the release which Mr. Lucena drew up, except Mrs. Hughes, the creditor for whom he had opposed me, who would be paid in full 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which, with 159<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the amount of Mr. Lucena's bill, was paid out of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced by Mr. Addington. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> A great part of what the prisoner states is right—it is substantially correct, except as to my going to Mr. Rance—I certainly did go to Mr. Rance, but it was as solicitor to the assignee—I employed Mr. Rance, as the trustee under the will, to pay the money under the estate—I drew up the release by which the prisoner was discharged by his creditors—my bill was 159<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was paid.</p>

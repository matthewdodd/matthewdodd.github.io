            . I am an officer. Mr. Wollett had collared the prisoner before I came up - he came down to the end of Skinner-street, and gave the prisoner into my charge, for picking his pocket of a handkerchief.</p>

I was turning the corner of Hosier-lane-several persons were passing up and down; the gentleman turned round, and looked me very hard in the face, but I went on taking no notice - the gentleman came along, collared me, and charged me with taking his handkerchief, which I told him was false; he struck me, knocked me down, and gave me into custody.</p>

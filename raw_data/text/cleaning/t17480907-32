               <p>Marley. We lodged in one house, I lost the money out of my breeches-pocket, and my pumps with the buckles in them were under the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Marley . Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake in the morning?</p>
               <p>Marley. Between one and two; and I miss'd my buckles then, and I ask'd my comrade Mumford where he was; and he said he was a long-side of me; and I ask'd him where Downing the prisoner was, and he said he was along-side of me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070013"></xptr> but I found he was gone; and I met with the prisoner again the same morning, about half an hour after six, when I was going to advertise him; and I charged him with robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you charged him with robbing you?</p>
               <p>Marley. He said he found the 3 l. 12 s. piece in the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you get it again?</p>
               <p>Marley. It was found between his stocking and his foot, and he said the 36 s. piece was changed; and he had my shoes upon his feet, but I could not find my buckles upon him.</p>

               <p>Marley No, my lord, I can't ; but I lost such a piece that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . When I went to bed, I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. to Marley. Was he in liquor?</p>
               <p>Marley. I don't know; I did not observe that he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says he saw his shoes upon my feet; why did he not challenge them?</p>
               <p>Marley. I said they were my property.</p>

               <p>Mumford. They were either copper, or brass. These are the buckles that the prosecutor had; there's W M upon them . The prosecutor ask'd for the prisoner, and I said he was a long-side of him. He said he was gone; I jump'd out of bed to piss , and he said the money was all gone too, and I came down, and found the window-shutters and the casement open; and I said, bear a hand, as fast as you can, and after him, and we met with him in Leadenhall-street. He was searched, and he had the 3 l. 12 s. piece between his stocking and his foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he carried before a magistrate?</p>
               <p>Mumford. Yes; and he said the 36 s. piece was changed at one Mr. Haynes's in Darkhouse-lane .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said the other night, in Newgate, that he would hang me.</p>

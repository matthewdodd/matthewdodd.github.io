                  </hi>. I keep the Cross Keys, in St. John-street, Clerkenwell—it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Sepulchre—the Luton coach goes from my house about five o'clock. On the 12th March I saw the coachman come with the parcel into the bar-room—I saw him put it on the desk, on the left-hand as you go into the room—the prisoner was in the bar at that time, sitting opposite the door, a little beyond the fire-place—I think I had spoken to her, but I am not quite certain—I was there when she first came, about twenty minutes before five o'clock—she had a shawl and bonnet on—she asked Miss Bishop some question, and went away—she returned, and after she had returned I saw her sitting in the bar-room when the coachman took the parcel to the desk—the door by which you enter from the bar to the bar-room is a glazed door—I remember a gentleman coming in in a very few minutes after the parcel came—I knew him by sight, he had been sometimes at the house—I did not know his name—I do not think he had anything in his hand—he went into the bar-room—I was inside the bar, and met him coming, before he got to the door which goes into the bar-room—I interposed to prevent his going into that room—he pushed rudely, by me, saying there was a lady there belonging to him—he then went by the glazed door into the bar-room, and went up to where the prisoner was sitting—there was a conversation between them—I heard nothing more than the word "wife," which was said by the prisoner—I was then standing near the desk on which the parcel was—I noticed that it was in its proper state, and done up in brown paper, sealed and directed—this is it—while I was standing near the desk, the gen<lb></lb>tleman called for a glass of sherry—I went towards the door, and asked Miss Bishop to bring it him—she brought it, and I gave it him—I was all the time remaining in the room—he gave me a shilling to pay for it, and I called to Miss Bishop to give 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—in doing that I turned from the prisoner and the gentleman towards the glazed door, and I observed, reflected by the glass, the red seals of a parcel being passed by the gentleman across to the prisoner where she was sitting—the gentleman was then between the desk and the chair the prisoner was sitting on—I went to the desk, and there found a different parcel to the one that had been there—this is it—it is</p>

               <p>sealed, but has no direction on it—I examined it so as to see that it was not the parcel that had been there before—I turned to the gentleman, and said, "You have changed the banker's parcel!"—I had the sham parcel then in my hand—on my saying that he took hold of my arm, and attempted to pot me out of the bar—I threw this parcel to Miss Bishop, and said, "Get assist<lb></lb>ance;" but he succeeded in pushing past me and leaving the house—I turned, and saw the parcel drop from the right side of the prisoner—I did not observe where it came from—she had then left the chair and approached the desk—she said, "What is all this about?"—she did not attempt to leave the room then—she had before approached the door, and I said to her, "If he has escaped, you shall not"—a gentleman named Elwin came to ray assist<lb></lb>ance, and she was detained—there was no other parcel on the desk but the banker's parcel—I had known the gentleman by sight—he had called to leave a coat, and sometimes had a glass of sherry when he fetched it away In the afternoon—there were two men in the house, whom I had noticed before when that gentleman was there—they were standing at the bar window—I believe they had some brandy-and-water—I did not serve them—I did not see anything more of them.</p>

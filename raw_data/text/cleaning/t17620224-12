               <p>Mr. Payne. I am a carpenter at Hammersmith, and was intrusted to take care of a house belonging to 'Squire Fawkener, and to do something to it; there were two chimney glasses, and several locks upon the doors, and some other things. Some time in November my servant informed me, that some of the locks had been taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to the house yourself?</p>
               <p>Payne. The 26th of November; and I missed the six locks, two chimney glasses, and some galley tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Payne. I acquainted Mr. Fawkener with it, and consulted what to do.</p>

            . Some time in November last, the prisoner and I went to a House of Mr. Fawkener, and took away from thence six or seven brass locks and some galley tiles. When we had taken the locks off, we concluded to sell the tiles first; but not meeting with a purchaser, then we endeavoured to sell a lock. As we could not meet with any-body immediately to buy it, we carried it to Mr. Hilton, a pawnbroker, to pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pawn it for?</p>
               <p>Smith. Two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the rest of the things?</p>
               <p>Smith. We got leave for the tiles to remain at the pawnbroker's till we called for them, the locks we took home to Izack's house. and we took the insides of the locks out; for that, he said, would be the best way to sell them. A day or two after he told me, I should sell or pawn one, and he and I went into Swithin's-alley, Le cester fields, and I pawned it for 18 d. at Mr. Watson's. Then, my Lord, we parted; he had the rest, and in a day or two he sold one, but where I cannot say. Then I sold one.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the tiles?</p>
               <p>Smith. He told me he had sold them to a man in the street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240014"></xptr>Q. How did you divide the rest?</p>
               <p>Smith. The first lock that he sold he kept the money, and for that I sold I kept the money; but I know not what became of the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the chimney glasses?</p>
               <p>Smith. We saw none when we were there; we only took brass locks and the galley tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you of the first lot that was pawn'd?</p>
               <p>Smith. One shilling, my lord.</p>

            . I am the person who first missed the things. Some time after Michealmas there was one chimney glass in the parlour, and another in the housekeeper's room up stairs, besides a lookingglass in another chamber, and several brass locks, I believe 12 or 13. Afterwards a gentleman came to look at the house, and he asked me if there were locks to the doors; and I said, yes, brass locks. Then I went to shew him the house, and missed six or seven of the locks, and called my fellow-servant to shew him that the locks had been taken off; and observed, that the person, who had taken them off, had broke the boxes, not knowing that they were false ones; and, upon acquainting my master of it, he ordered me to take off the rest, which I did. Some time in January a person came to look at the house, and it appeared to us, that the doors must have been broke open to get at the things up stairs.</p>

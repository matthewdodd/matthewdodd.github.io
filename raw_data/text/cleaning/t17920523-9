               <p>On Friday, the 11th of May, I had reason to suspect some money had been taken out of my bureau, and being willing to find out the offender, the beginning of the week before last I marked seven guineas and a half, and placed them near a canvass bag in the bureau; I marked them with a cross under the curl of the George side of the guinea; the escrutore I then locked, and gave the key to Mrs. Blackburne; and upon coming to the escrutore on the Wednesday morning I found it open, and one of the marked guineas taken out; on Friday, the 11th of May, the prisoner brought with him ten pounds, in guineas, half guineas, and silver, all of which were particularly marked in the O of George; this ten pounds so marked we put into the canvass bag to the six guineas and a half that were left; on my return from the House of Commons, about nine o'clock, I found the bureau again opened; on examining the bag I discovered two guineas and a half were gone; on this I went to Mr. Potter, and desired him to come down and do what we could to discover the offender; I called all the servants into the parlour and desired Mr. Potter would search; upon searching

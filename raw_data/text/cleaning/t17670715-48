On the 29th of May, the two prisoners offered me ten bushels of soot to sell; we agreed for it; when I was going to pay them, a lad came and told me, that soot was taken out of my warehouse, and gave me a clear account of it; I went to Westwood, and told him, I thought he had no visible way of getting it; he said he brought it for two men, named Rotherham and Doeg, upon which I sent for them; Doeg came, and said, he never sent him to sell soot in his life; this was in the prisoner Wilson's hearings; the other was gone to Limehouse; I sent for him the next day; he came, and said he had not sent them with any. I went into the yard, and said to Westwood, how did you came by this; he said, it is my own; I said, you certainly have stole it; he said, one of the sacks was his own; I paid him 2 s. for one sack, I had great room to suspect them; Wilson was my servant; I went for the officer, and charged them, and they were carried to the Compter, and on the Monday before the fitting Alderman.</p>

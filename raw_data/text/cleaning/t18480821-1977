                  </hi>. I am a plane-maker, and live at 5, Wood-street, Westminster. On Tuesday morning, 18th July, between two and three o'clock, I was going up Dean-street, Westminster, and met the prisoners Jones and Flynn—they stopped me, and wished me to go home with them—I would not at first, but after some talk I consented, and went to 20, St. Ann-street, to the front-room second-floor—both the women went into the room with me—I gave Flynn 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she went out to get some gin—Jones remained—she asked me to give her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave it her; and while we were on the bed together I felt her draw my watch out of my pocket—there was a hair guard round my neck, which snapped in two—I snatched at her hand to</p>

I did live in the same bouse, but not in the same room; when the prosecutor was at the station-house he only said, "I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> I know you."</p>

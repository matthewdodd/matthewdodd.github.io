                  </hi>. I am a farrier, and live at No. 12, Three Cup-alley, Lower Shadwell. On the 6th of September I saw the prisoner between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—he said he had been recommended by a Mr. M'Crow, to come and ask me if I wanted to purchase a horse and gig—he asked if I knew Mr. M'Crow—I said, "Yes, he was a broker in St. George's-in-the-East"—he said he had purchased a blind horse and chaise in the country, and that he had been taken in with them—he said he wanted to sell them on account of his holidays, as he had a month's holidays—they were the Jews' holidays—he said he had got the horse at livery at Min<lb></lb>don's, in the back road, that Mindon wanted to charge him a guinea a week for the horse, and as he was not going to travel again for a month, he wanted to sell them—he said the gig was broken, and he did not mean to repair it, as he wanted to get a lighter concern to travel with—he asked when I would see them—I told him, in the morning—when he came next morning, he said he had given four watches, worth five guineas each, for the horse and chaise, and had been taken in, for he did not know the horse was blind till four days after he had bought it, and he had had it between four and five months—I did not go to see it, and he came on foot about half-past eight o'clock in the morning—my man went and fetched the horse and gig—the prisoner went with the man, and came back with him—he said he had brought the horse and gig, and would I come down and look at them—I came down—he said "There is the horse and gig"—he said it was a very nice sort of horse, that he had run it down a good deal, that he bought them for 20 guineas, and he would not like to sacrifice many pounds in selling it—I said I would not offend him, and I did not like to offer any thing, as he talked about so large a price—he said I should not offend him if 1 offered him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he asked if it was not worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "No"—I bid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for the gig was all broken to pieces, the irons broken, and the horse in a very bad state—I suppose it had been overdriven—it did not feed for hours after—I bought them for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the horse would not fetch 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at any sale, in the state it came to me in—I made it a bed, and it laid down—the bargain was made at the Three Cups public-house, as he asked me to go there to have something to drink—I bad nothing to drink, but he had a glass of rum—I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me this bill and receipt for it, and the landlady put her name to it at his request.</p>

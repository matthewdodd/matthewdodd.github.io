            . I am a potboy at the Ship-on-ground public house. I was down in the cellar at the Ship-on-ground, in Bear-lane. Patterson brought a parcel there, about half past nine o'clock in the morning; he told my master had given him leave to bring it there. He cut off the wrapper and gave me the wrapper, to make an apron of; he asked me if I could put the truss into the other cellar; one is a beer cellar, and the other a spirit cellar. I locked the cellar up, and mislaid the key somewhere. About half an hour afterwards I informed my master that it was smuggled goods; he did not seem to take any notice of it. It passed on until nine o'clock at night; two men came in and asked if Patterson had been there. I said no; about half past ten o'clock Patterson came in; he called for a pint of beer. I drawed it him; he asked me to go down and get the parcel in brown paper. I did; he walked out with it under his arm, he did not say any thing more to me till the next morning; he came into my bed-room, and asked me what I thought of the parcel; I said I thought it was stolen or smuggled goods, that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the goods - A. Mr. Atkinson has got them; the wrapper went back with the things. When he gave me the wrapper, I cut off the marks and burnt them. I did it without a thought; there were the marks upon it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLTON. On the 26th of July, about five minutes after ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into my house with a small truss; he asked me to let him leave it. I did. At about half after ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came again; he went into the tap-room, and called for a pint of beer, my lad drawed it him. He said he wanted one of those pieces in the spirit cellar. I took the key and went down with him; this parcel was open with several large paper parcels. I had no doubt then they were stolen. I thought it would be best to let him have one of these pieces then, and make an appointment with him to come the next morning. The next morning he was to come at six o'clock; I got up at four o'clock; I went to get a constable, I could not find one. I found the truss belonged to Atkinson and Delwyn, Corbett's-court; Mr. Delwyn found the truss first.</p>

             at Southampton. The porter put them down by the side of the waggon, under the shed; after that we proceeded to weigh another parcel for another waggon; I heard an uncommon talking, and went out to see what was the matter, when one of the men, who had the prisoner by the collar, told me they had got a thief; which was the prisoner; they were for ducking him, but I said, No, by no means. I sent for a constable, and held the prisoner the while; then we took him to Woodstreet-Compter.</p>

I crossed the market to get a pennyworth of purl, coming back I saw the prisoner with the paper parcel upon his arm; he was about two yards from where the rest of the goods lay in the yard; I took the parcel from him, and laid hold of him.

            . I am a porter at the Rose Inn. I saw nothing of this till I was called by Mr. More. I never saw the prisoner before; he had no business in the yard as I know of.</p>

               <p>I was bound to the sea, and had been abroad sixteen months; but the ship was laid up for the winter. I had a letter that my mother was very sick; my master granted me leave to go to see her; when I came to London, she sent me to an old woman, a nurse, at Bloomsbury; as I was going there, I met a man who asked me where I had been; I told him: he said, if you will carry a parcel for me, I will pay you for it, and ordered me to meet him at the Fleet-market; which I did: he bid me follow him: I did; he then went and lifted that parcel on my shoulders, and again bid me follow him: he went out, and as I was going after him, that gentleman laid hold of me. I called to the man, Thomas or John, Why don't you answer! but he made off. Be pleased to ask the porter, whether I did not call in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. to More. Did you hear the prisoner call as he said?</p>
               <p>More. When he found I had laid hold of him, he said (Tom stop, don't go away.) I did see the glimpse of a man, but not to discern what dress he had on; he ran off as fast as he could towards Fleetstreet, down the side of the market.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Smithfield, about five minutes before one o'clock, on this morning; the prosecutor passed me, and said "Good night;" he had his watch chain hanging out of his pocket then; when he had got by, about ten yards, Griffith and Callaghan came by together; Callaghan said, "I think we shall have a good draw to-night;" Dow was just before them; I followed them, and when they got to the Rose-inn. Griffith went in front of the prosecutor - I did not see him take any thing; I saw the prosecutor take hold of him, and he said, "Watchman, this man has got my watch and chain;" I took hold of him, and saw the others holding their hands as if to take it - I called to Clark to take Dow, which he did as soon as he came out of the pens - Callaghan then came up; I told him to keep off, or else he would get into trouble - he went, and came up again with a short stick, about as thick as my wrist; I then said, "I will take you;" he put out his foot to try to throw me, but could not - he then struck me on the head - I had a silk hat on, which was cut, but it warded off the blows - he then ran off, and a gentleman tried to stop him; he struck at him, and knocked him down; I pursued him with the rattle, some other gentleman attempted to stop him; he nearly knocked him down, but he stopped him; I came up and took him; I found the chain and seals the next morning close by the spot; the prosecutor was not drunk; there were some girls there, but it is my opinion they were not with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CALLAGHAN. When he was at the watch-house, he said he would speak truth on both sides; and the prosecutor said it was me. Witness. No; he did not; Callaghan threatened to stab me with a knife.</p>

            . I was watch-housekeeper. Those three prisoners were brought to the watch-house on the 15th of June - I searched then and found nothing but half-a-crown and a halfpenny on Callaghan; I afterwards got the seal and chain, which the prosecutor claims; he did not appear to be drunk; I understood he had been to the Leicester Committee, at the Three Cups public-house; he had been drinking, but I believe knew what he was about; Callaghan, when brought to the watch-house, conducted himself in a very insolent way.</p>

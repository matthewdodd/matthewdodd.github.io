            . I am a watch-house keeper. I found the prisoner and prosecutor at the watch-house - he said she had robbed him, because he was a little groggy; he said she had taken 13s. or 14s., and gave me two half-crowns and a sixpence, which he said was all he had got back; I asked her what she had got - she said, "I believe half a crown, and 1s.;" I searched her, and found two more half-crowns, three shillings, and a sixpence; I detained them both, as he was groggy.</p>

About twenty minutes to twelve o'clock I saw the prosecutor and prisoner pass our window - I heard them at words, and told them to move on; he said he would not till he had got his money; I had heard something fall on the stones - I got a light, and found the tobacco-box under the window.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            , and when I came out again, he was walking backwards and forwards; he might have got away, if he would; when he was before the Magistrate, he said they belonged to a Mrs. Walker at Gosport; that she had intrusted him to take them into his care, as he was coming to town; the Magistrate then committed him for further examination; the next day, or the day after, Mrs. Withers came to my house, and saw the trunk.</p>

               <p>Mrs. SUNDERLAND sworn. - I live at No. 20, Holles-street, Clare-market: On Sunday evening, the 11th of January, the prisoner came to my house about seven o'clock; he came to take a lodging for himself and another sailor; there was a young man with him dressed like a sailor; the prisoner at the bar had a small box; I saw him open the box, to shew that he had abundance of things in it to pay the lodgings; it was only corded round when I saw it; it was not locked; he told me his wife had gone away from him, and he had kept all her clothes; I said, I could not conceive it could be his wife's, for she was a small woman; he lodged at my house with her four months before; these things were much larger than her's; besides, she had only common clothes; they lodged with me four days, they had no box then; the young lad that he brought along with him, said, have nothing to do with that box, ma'am, for he has stole it; he denied the charge; I let him put it in a two-pair of stairs back room, which he had taken, and then they both went away, and said they would return in about half an hour; I saw no more of him till the next morning, then I asked him what was to be done with the box, and the young man again said he had stole it from a coach, and then the prisoner went to strike him; I was very much alarmed; then they both went up stairs, and opened it; I told him to be honest, and go and give up the box to the inn again; then he came down stairs, and said he would go to the inn, and bring the lady, or get her to send a porter for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say what inn? - A. No; they both said they came by the Portsmouth coach; I then went, and asked Mr. Goring's advice; while he was gone, there came a little woman, who said, she was his wife, that she had come for a box of her things that he had taken away, and that it had been left there by mistake; it was not the woman that lived with him when he lodged with me before; I asked her what it contained, and she could not inform me; she was going away, and the prisoner came in, and he insisted upon my giving up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180013"></xptr>the box, and I would not; I asked him if that was his wife, and he said, no, it was a woman he lived with; about four o'clock, he came with a man that called himself a constable, and three other men, to make me give it up, and then I went and fetched Mr. Goring, but the man afterwards disowned being a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming through Whitechapel; I met a woman that asked me to take this trunk to my lodging; I opened it before Mrs. Sunderland, and when I lodged with her before, I rigged her and her daughter out with money that I had taken at Somerset-house. <rs id="t18010218-17-verdict86" type="verdictDescription">

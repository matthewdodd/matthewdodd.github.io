                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Tapper and Son woollen drapers, of No. 74, Bishopsgate-street. On Tuesday, 13th Feb., the prisoners came to our shop, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I did not know them before—they asked me to show them some black cloth to make an over coat—I cannot say which spoke first—I showed them several pieces—the tailor especially examined the cloths; I mean Cracknell—he selected the piece, and told me to cut off a quantity sufficient to make a coat—they selected satin for a waistcoat, some doe skin, for trowsers, and some material for trimmings; the articles came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Cracknell told me to pack the parcel up, that he was going into the City, and would call for the parcel on his return—he then left the shop, leaving Jackson there—I packed up the goods, and made out the bill—I gave Jackson the bill, and he gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked him to write his name on it, and he wrote "J. Smith," and gave the note to me—I asked him for his address, and wrote it myself; it was Bridge-street, Hoxton—there was a number, but I forget it now—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I keep a hosier's shop at No. 16, Jewin-street, and am a niece of the prisoner, Cracknell. On 10th Feb., between 10 and 12 o'clock in the forenoon, Cracknell came to my shop with Jackson—Cracknell said the person with him was going to Australia, and was wanting something in my way—Cracknell went up stairs to see my mother, his sister; she was then on a visit at my hous—while he was up stairs, Jackson purchased some goods; I cannot recollect all of them; there was some hosiery and handkerchiefs; they came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he was going to Australia, and what he was purchasing he should be wanting—Cracknell afterwards came down stairs into the shop, and went to Jackson—I put the articles he had purchased into paper, and gave them to Jackson, and he produced what appeared to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Note—I asked him if he had not got change; he said, "No, he had not"—Cracknell was present at the time—I told Eliza Varley, my assistant, to go and get change—she was not gone long—she returned with change—I gave Jackson four sovereigns, and he gave me half a crown; that was in Cracknell's presence—on the following Friday, the note was returned to me by Miss Vickress, marked "forged" all over—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on receiving the note from Miss "Vickress, I went with her and another friend to No. 3, King-street, Commercial-road East, where Cracknell lived—we went in and saw him—I asked him if he could tell me anything of the person that was with him, that gave me the note—he took a written note from his pocket, and said he knew nothing of him any further than he had received this note—this is the note he produced—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "London, Feb. 13, '55.

               <p>knew nothing further of him, but that that was where he had to take the clothes to; upon that I returned home—in the course of the same afternoon, Cracknell called upon me—he said he was very sorry it had happened; that he had got quite the amount of goods in his possession; and I should not be the loser by the note—he said the goods belonged to the party that came with him, or something to that effect—he then left, and returned again in the evening, and we went to Miss Vickress—I took 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. With me—I gave that to Mr. Vickress, and received this note in exchange—Cracknell and I parted at the door of Mr. Vickress, and went dif<lb></lb>ferent ways—on the following Monday, I went to Drury-lane in company with a friend named Friend—I went there to receive the money for the note—Monday was the time appointed by this note, and I went in accord<lb></lb>ance with that suggestion—I found Cracknell there; he was standing at the corner of some street—there was no such place as the Star coffee-house—we walked about for some time; half an hour or more, perhaps—I saw Cracknell and his brother; the brother had a bundle, and there was another man named Lancaster with them—Cracknell said they had been looking for the Star coffee house, and could not find such a place, and he could not do anything further than to give me the clothes—I went with Mr. Friend and them to a public-house, and Cracknell put the clothes in a parcel, and gave them to us—upon receiving the clothes, Mr. Friend drew up this paper for me to give to Cracknell—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Received of Mr. Cracknell, two coats, and two pairs of trowsers, for money due, and if not called for in a fortnight shall become my property. For H. Markham. John Friend. 19th Feb., 1855."—I gave that to Cracknell, and the forged note—I think his brother had the forged note in his possession at the time—I saw him give it to Cracknell—1 had given it to his brother the evening before—on the Tuesday, in the following week, I saw Moss, the police-officer—in consequence of what I learnt from him, I went next day, Wednesday, to the Police Court, and there saw Cracknell in charge—Moss has the clothes which I received from Cracknell's brother.</p>

               <p>of ale and went into the parlour—Jackson came in about five or ten minutes afterwards, and asked if there was a gentleman named Cracknell waiting—I opened the parlour, and showed him in—when I went in they were talking about selling a horse—Cracknell had a horse for sale, belonging to his master, Mr. Matthews, I believe—I followed Jackson into the room, I did not take notice of how they saluted each other—I was ordered to bring in a pint of spiced ale—I went for it, and when I came back they were talking about the sale of a horse—I did not notice the names they called each other—I had nothing to draw my attention in particular to this matter—I cannot tell what it was that Cracknell said about the horse—they could not come to terms about the horse, and they were talking about a suit of clothing—I went in and out once or twice—I cannot tell you everything—I was in there when Cracknell measured Jackson for a suit of clothes—I heard the order given—Cracknell said he would make a suit for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were to be finished on that day week—Jackson said he should be up to market on the Monday, and they were to be brought to my place—they wanted change then for a note, because Jackson was to pay down 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit to Cracknell after he took the measure—Jackson first produced a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I could not give change for that, but I could for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he then produced a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I brought it out, and told Mrs. Lancaster to go up and get change for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which she did, and Jackson followed me out and came to the bar—I got. the pen and ink, and said, "Write your name down," and he put down "Samuel Brown"—Cracknell was not present then, he was in the parlour—I also saw the name of George Groom on the note, above where Jackson wrote—this is the note <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave Jackson change, three sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—Cracknell was in the parlour during-this time—Jackson wrote the name at the bar—Cracknell came out after I gave Jackson the change, and he gave Cracknell a sovereign that he was to have for a deposit, and Cracknell wrote a receipt on a bit of paper, "Received, one sovereign," and he was to have the things made that day week—they had a talk together a bit, and they had another glass of ale, and stopped a quarter of an hour or so at the bar, and then Jackson left—I dare say Cracknell stopped half an hour or three quarters more with me talking—I put the note in my pocket, and when I went to bed I put it up stairs—there was no other note—on the Friday or Saturday afterwards, Cracknell returned to my house—he said, "I under<lb></lb>stand my niece has been taking a bad 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, Lancaster, and I hope yours is not the same"—I said, "I hope not, either"—I showed him the note, and he said, "We will go down to the bank with it on Monday morning"—I think this was on Saturday—I was rather uneasy to know whether it was good or bad, and I went down with it myself on the Monday—when I came back, Cracknell was at my place, waiting—"I said, "Cracknell, this is the same as your niece took, a bad 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—he said, "Well, Lancaster, you shall not be the loser, for I will pay you as soon as I can raise the money."—I said, "Do, because I want to pay it away"—which he did; he even pledged his things to make me the money—I was not present when he pledged them, but I have no doubt of it—he paid me the money in three instalments—he looked at the note when I brought it back, and he saw the names on it—he did not make any remark upon them—in the course of the same day I went with Cracknell to Drury-lane, to see if we could find Jackson—Cracknell went to his brother s, in the Strand, to get the clothes—I went with him—he said he had received a letter to take them to the Star coffee house, Drury-lane—he had no bundle when he started—he went</p>

On Monday, 12th Feb., the prisoners came to the shop together, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I did not know either of them before—they conversed together at times—that enabled me to ascertain that Cracknell was a tailor—he asked for beaver cloth to make a great coat—I took some down at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—they both looked at it—Cracknell decided it not to be good enough, so I got others that were better—they decided upon what cloth they would have—took no notice of what they said to each other—they did talk to each other, and they decided to have better cloth, and I cut off the length they required; it was only for one—Cracknell then asked for doeskins for trowsers—I showed them some—they looked at several pieces—there was some conversation between them as to the length they wanted, and they purchased enough for two pairs of trowsers and two vests—Cracknell then said they wanted vestings, and I passed them on to Mr. Grant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shopman to Messrs. Bartram and Harvey. On Monday, 12th Feb., the two prisoners were passed on to me by the last witness—Cracknell asked to be shown some fancy silks for waistcoats—they both decided upon having a length or two for fancy waistcoats—they talked together frequently—I cut off the silk for the waistcoats, and some lining—the things amounted to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Jackson paid for them; he gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and half a sovereign, and I was to bring him in change a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I took the note, and asked him to write his name at the back of it, which he did—he wrote "J. Parkins, Hoxton"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the note—he wrote this in my presence—Cracknell was standing by the side of him at the time, so that he could see what he wrote—I wrote on the note "Grant," and the date "12—2—55"—I am certain this is the note—I took it to the counting house, and gave it to the cashier—I brought the change in coin, and gave it to Jackson—he put it into his purse, or pocket—Cracknell then took the parcel, and went as far as the door with Jackson; he then told Jackson he should be with him directly, and he returned to the shop and got a commission—he then followed me again from the counting house to the shop, where we saw Jackson looking at another piece for a waistcoat—he bought it, and paid for it—during this time Cracknell spoke about Mr. Bartram, and he also said that he had known him when he was in Suffolk—he asked me his Christian name, and I told him.</p>

In consequence of information, on Tuesday, 27th Feb., I went to the Beehive public house, in King-street, Commercial-road East, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I went into a little room at the back, which gave me the opportunity of seeing who came into the bar—about ten minutes after I was there I saw Cracknell come in, in company with Lancaster—they came into the room where I was, and had some ale together—I then said to Cracknell, "I am a police officer; I must take you into custody for being concerned with another party in uttering a forged 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note at the shop of Messrs. Bartram and Harvey, Holborn-hill"—he said, "Yes, that is right; I went with the party, but I know nothing of him"—I was about to search the prisoner—he was in the act of putting something into his pocket—he said, "Search me at the station"—I searched him there and then; I found in his pocket two forged 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—these are them (<hi rend="italic">looking at the two uttered to Markham and Lancaster</hi>)—I found a pocket book on him—he said there was a letter in that that he had received from the party that he had been with to Bartram and Harvey's—this is it (<hi rend="italic">the one produced</hi>)—he said that he had left the clothes that were purchased, at Mrs. Markham's, in Jewin-street, as security for the payment—I then took him to No. 3, King-street—I there found three waistcoat pieces.—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

TWO</hi> of these are what I cut off)—he also produced to me a pawnbroker's duplicate—it referred to some doeskin, and other articles, pledged on 17th Feb.—I examined at the pawnbroker's the things it referred to—the notes were marked "Forged," as they are now—Cracknell said he had paid Lancaster the money for the one, and left the clothes with Mrs. Markham for the other—this receipt of Mrs. Markham's was in the pocket book—he said they went together to Lancaster's, and had some spiced ale there, and there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note changed there, and that was the note—he said Lancaster had been to him, and he had just paid Lancaster the last pound, or something of that sort; I do not recollect the exact words—he said that Lancaster kept a beer shop in Cloth-fair, and he had known him for some time—I asked him if he knew anything of Jackson, and he said he knew nothing of him, further than going with him to these places, that is, Bartram and Harvey's, Markham's and Lancaster's—he said that he (Cracknell) had lived at the Beehive as waiter for about six months, and he had seen Jackson there—I asked where Jackson was most likely to be found, and he said the most likely place was Tiger's-bay—I asked him where Tiger's-bay was—he said that Brunswick-street was called Tiger's-bay, that it was close by the Beehive, and was infested with whores and thieves; that that was the most likely place, to find him there with those girls.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH ASHEY. I am the prosecutor's foreman. On the morning of the 16th of December the prisoner came to the door, and asked if we had any speckled melons - I said No; he asked if I should have any next morning - I said I thought not; he said he was sorry for it, and went up the lane; I left the warehouse, and went to No. 38, which commands a view of our door - I went up stairs. and was sent for in a quarter an hour, and found the prisoner the custody of Fitt.</p>
               <p>JAMES THOMAS FITT. I am in Levy's employ. I saw the prisoner come in about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; he inquired the price of imperial French plums - another man told him; Mr. Levy was not in the warehouse - he proposed to wait, and desired to see some eighth boxes of imperials, which the other man desired me to show him, and while I was doing so the prisoner came behind me, and looked at some cartoons - I turned round, and saw him put a cartoon under his coat; it contained 4 lbs, of French plums - he then declined having any plums, saying they were too dear, and walked out into the street; I followed, and took him in the street with the plums - he put them down on a bag of nuts, after I secured him; I cannot swear that the same were given to the constable.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WEIR. I am a constable, and took charge of the box of plums; the prisoner said he did not intend to steal them, he only meant to go to the show board to look at them.</p>
               <p>MR. LEVY. The box was delivered to me - I know it to be the same.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to inquire for speckled melons - I then went to Mr. Wright's, and bought one hundred oranges; I returned to this warehouse, and asked to see a box of imperials - I have dealt there nearly seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140045"></xptr>years: he was opening a box - I said, "Never mind, here is one open - let me look at this;" I took it up, and went to the show-board - my basket stood at the door with lemons and oranges; I went to the door with the box in my hand - he laid hold of me, and said I was going to steal it.</p>
               <p>JAMES THOMAS FITT. He had got off the steps, and was in the street, going away towards Thames-street - he had a basket in his hand when I took him; his baskets were within our warehouse.</p>

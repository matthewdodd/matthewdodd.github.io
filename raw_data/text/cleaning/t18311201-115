            . I am a Police-constable. On the 9th of November I saw the prisoner and another person in the Strand - I followed them to Fleet-street; they tried several gentleman's pockets; and at the corner of <placeName id="t18311201-115-crimeloc620">Water-lane</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Why did not you apprise the gentleman of it? A. If I had, I must have lost you: I might be ten yards from you.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the handkerchief was his own; that on his taking it from his pocket, to wipe some coach-splashes from his face, the officer came up, and charged him with stealing it from a gentleman.</p>

            . There was a cart coming up, and the prisoner had another lad with him, covering him with an apron - I am certain I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the gentleman's left-hand pocket, and put it into his trousers pocket - here is the letter L. on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010067"></xptr>it; the gentleman looked round, but took no more notice - the prisoner ran down the yard, and I caught him about fifteen yards off; there was a great crowd about the gentleman - I had known the prisoner before, and had followed him down the Strand and Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What time of day was this? A. About half-past two o'clock; I was on the other side of the street, and could see plainly - the prisoner was in the service of his brother-in-law for some time, who is a coach-carver.</p>

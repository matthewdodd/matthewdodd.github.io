                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 187.) On the morning of 17th Nov. I was on duty at Staines—I had been by Mr. Holgate's yard the night before—I saw the fowls all safe then, and a sheet over a chain—between two and three o'clock I went down again—the fowls and sheet were gone—I know the pri<lb></lb>soner—I had marked his door that night by putting a rose-bush at it at eleven o'clock—I had seen him safe in his house at eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, and had passed his door every hour after that—I afterwards went to his house, and found the rose-bush was dropped down—I think the door had been opened—it is a bye-place, not where people pass—I asked for admittance, was let in, found the prisoner there, and asked him where he had been—his wife said to him, "You have been <hi rend="italic">on to it</hi> again"—I then asked him whether he had got anything in the house—he said he had not—I searched, and found this sheet under the bed, and this fowl wrapped up in it, quite warm—this sheet has Mr. Holgate's initials—it is such a sheet as I had seen hanging up at his premises—I took the prisoner, took his boots off, and the sergeant and I fitted them to some marks in Mr. Holgate's yard—they exactly corresponded.</p>

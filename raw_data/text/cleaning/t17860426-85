When the prisoners were brought back in the shop, there was beef and veal, and mutton, in different pieces, in this bag, which was taken off a hook, and it lay in the same place where the boy told me he saw the prisoners lay; I came back along with Carr; I did not see him taken.</p>

               <p>Sir, Haylock was in the public house, over at the Pitt's Head; he said, here is Burleigh's man over the way, playing at marbles; says he, I will go and send him for a beef-steak; says I, why do not you? I went up with him, and he told the boy to go for some beef-steaks; says the boy, it is very right, I forgot the bag; says I, then, you rogue, run as fast as you can, they have no dinner.</p>
               <p>Court. I rather believe that circumstance is a mistake; but I am not satisfied about the other; and if the Court will take upon themselves to be at the expence of a prosecution for perjury against Haylock, I will commit him.</p>
               <p>Haylock. I hope not.</p>
               <p>Blacketer. I ordered a shoulder of mutton for my own dinner.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, Haylock, unless you give very good bail, you will be committed for perjury; let him be taken into custody, and the expences of it will be borne by the city.</p>

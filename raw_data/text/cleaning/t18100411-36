             in Hampshire. At the time this happened I had just come to town. I had been down after the place, and then returned to town.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was it. - A. On the 19th, of February, about one o'clock in the morning, I was going to my lodgings in Portman Mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been till that time in the morning. - A. I had taken the carriage to Mr. Naples, I was going home; I was in David-street, Oxford Road; I looked at my watch at the time, it was a little after one; I crossed Oxford-street opposite of Gee's court; I was going along Oxford-street to Portman Mews; I met the prisoner, she stopped me, she wanted me to go with her, she pushed up against me two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her. - A. No, I did not, I went about ten yards further before I lost my watch. I never was with her at all only when she pushed up against me. Immediately I missed my watch I called the watchman, and directly she went up Gee's court.</p>
               <p>

            Was she with you when you missed the watch - A. No, she had left me then, she did not walk with me at all, she pushed up against me and then I passed on. I refused going with her; directly I called the watchman she went up Gee's court; the watchman and I went up Gee's court; we could not hear any thing of her; I did not see her afterwards till the 26th of February. I then saw her in North-audley-street about ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen her before that first night, had you - A. No, I knew her by her speech and by her face. My brother took her; she was pointed out by the two girls that told us she had pawned the watch for 2 l. My brother and the prisoner went into the public-house together; I went in directly after; I knew the prisoner directly. The prisoner told me she never saw me in her life before. I told her I had seen her before, and I was very well satisfied I had seen her again. I charged the watch with her, and sent her to the watch-house. The next morning I saw my watch at the pawnbroker's in Berwick-street.</p>

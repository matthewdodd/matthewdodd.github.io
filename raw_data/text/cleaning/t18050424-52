               <p>Q. After you had bought this property did Mr. Dewick call at your house? - A.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are overseer to Mr. Dewick, of course you know the prisoner's name? - A. I always understood his name was Johnson; I did not know that he assumed any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recommend the prisoner to sell any property to Mr. Thompson? - A. Never. (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I carried these articles to the house of Mr. Thompson, for the behalf of the widow of one Simpson. This Simpson had the same access to this property as I had, provided it is Mr. Dewick's property; he was employed by Mr. Dewick to melt a quantity of old metal, and to cast them into types of different descriptions; Mr. Dewick has delivered a vast quantity to him at various times; there are a great many of these that are used in printing-offices in town; there is no private mark can be on them; how can Mr. Dewick swear that it is his property.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is the widow? - A. She is gone home to her native country; she is a native of North Britain.</p>
               <p>Dewick. A man of the name of Simpson worked in my house for two or three days; I never sold him a single letter or metal of any description; that is two years ago; here are letters in this box that have been cast for me since the death of Simpson; he died in May, 1804; this property was sold in December, 1804. He never occupied any thing but a garret; it was not likely he should have this property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

The wife was ordered out of court while the husband gave his evidence, which was as follows: that on the 7th of April he and his wife called to see the prisoner in his lodgings; that while they were there, about twelve o'clock, or some time after, there came in two men, seemingly seafaring men, with two bundles. The bundles were not opened while he was there; that they had a silver watch, and two spoons, and a pair of silver buckles, which the prisoner ordered them to put into a chest; that after the prisoner was gone for beer, the men took out another watch and hung it up, saying, that Mr. Morris might see what time of the day it was when he came up; and he did not observe, that when the prisoner came in, he looked at the watch at all.</p>
               <p>The wife when called in gave evidence, that the two strangers brought in four bundles, two watches, and two spoons; that the prisoner gave them the liberty to leave the things for a few days; that the prisoner was by at the time when the two watches were produced, and when one of them was hung up in his apartment.

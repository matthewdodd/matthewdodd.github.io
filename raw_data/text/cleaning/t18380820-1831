                  </hi>. I now live with Mr. Penny, the Inspector of Police in Clerkenwell-before I came to London I lived with ray uncle at Great Burford, in Bedfordshire—I came to town in the wagon, and I arrived here on the last day of June, between five and six o'clock in the morning—I was set down at the wagon-office, in St. John-street—I endeavoured to get a place of service—I went to a laundress, and they were not up—I afterwards went into a public-house which was open—I there saw the pri<lb></lb>soner Neville—she said she was a country person, and her husband had been dead seven years, and she invited me to go to her house to breakfast—I had brought a trunk with me to town, containing my clothes, as stated in the in<lb></lb>dictment-most of them were new things, and were worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had bought them myself, and I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money in my pocket—I went with Neville to her house, and carried my box with me almost all the way, and she took it and carried it up stairs-when I got there, the prisoner Chapman got up and let me in—I found her lying in bed, ill—I laid down for about an hour in the same room my trunk was in—I then got up and had breakfast—I saw all the four prisoners at breakfast-Austin and the black girl Jones came up while I and Neville and Chapman were at break-fast, and took breakfast along with us—after breakfast Neville asked me to lend her a shilling to buy her some coals, and I lent her one—my money was loose in my pocket-Chapman took the shilling, and went for the coals, and the boy brought them up while I was in the room-Neville then told me to go out for a walk with Austin (who, she said, was her brother) and Jones, while she cleaned up her room—she said there were such rogues in London, if I did not leave what money I had in my pocket, they would take it away from me—I took my pocket off, and put it, money and all, into my box in her room—the box was not locked or corded; it was tied up in a brown shawl—I had seen my money in the morning when I paid my fare in the wagon—I had three half-crowns, five shillings and sixpence, and two sovereigns-except the shilling I lent Neville, the rest was in the box-Austin, Jones, and I then went out, and walked about for three hours-Austin said he could tell me of some work—he knew a friend who could get me plenty of good work—we went into a public-house, and he wrote a letter there to get me a situation, and said I might mention his name when I got there—I have got the letter—I left the pub<lb></lb>lic-house with him and Jones—she did not hear what he said about the letter, as she was gone out—she came in again just as we came out of the public-house—I do not know that she heard any of the conversation about the letter—we all three came away together, and Austin said to me, "Young woman, don't you think you can find your way back again to Neville's room?"—I said, "No, I am quite a stranger in town, and don't think I can"-Jones said she had been cook eleven years in a family, and was going out for half a day, and should get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and plenty of broken victuals, and she must leave me—they then left me—I told Austin I wanted to find Neville's house, to get some clothes and money—he went with me, and pre<lb></lb>tended to show me into Neville's room—he left me at the bottom of the stairs, and said, "That is the room, go up there, young woman"—he then went away—I did not know it was not Neville's room till I went up stairs, and found nothing but shoemakers there-when I came down he was gone—Jones</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and lived servant with Mrs. Hooker, No. 1, Ball-yard, Golden-lane. On Saturday, the 30th of June, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner Austin brought some things to my mistress's stall, and asked her to buy them—she said she did not want them—he brought them to me, and I bought two petticoats, four aprons, and four pairs of stockings of him for 95.—he asked me if I would go on an errand for him to pawn two gowns, and if I got 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he would give me Is. for myself—I pawned them at Mr. Telfer's, in White<lb></lb>cross-street—he waited for me till I came back, and delivered him the money, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me Is.—the prisoner Jones was with him at the time, when I gave him the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he gave it to Jones, and asked me would I mind the duplicate till he came for it, which I did—I afterwards read something in the newspaper about the robbery, and went to the office, and gave up the things.</p>

I have known Austin for years—I have washed for him, and spoken to him from time to time—on the Sunday my sister (the prisoner Chapman) wrote to my husband, and I heard of this—on the Wednesday following I met Austin in Cow-lane, about nine o'clock in the morning—he stopped me, and asked where I was going—I told him I was going to work—he said, "A pretty concern about your sister"—I said, "What is it?" pretending to be ignorant of it all—I said, "I heard she was taken up for being tipsy"—he said "It is more than that, I am afraid to be here—I expect to be taken every minute; the officers are after me"—I said, "Have you any thing to do with it?"—he said, "Yes"—we went into the Golden Ball—he told me that on Saturday morning a country girl came from the country, and was brought into my sister's place—he got talking to her, put his arm round her waist, and took from her pocket two sixpences, and eight-pence—he thought the girl felt him do it, and he rolled it up, and put it into her box—he then got into conversation with her, and asked her to take a walk, and he and the black girl went out with her—that in conversation with her, he said, what a foolish girl she was to come to London without money or friends, and she replied, she had brought two sovereigns and a half, and a five shilling piece, besides other small silver with her—he said he left her then, came into the room, broke the box open, and made away with her clothes, and took the money away—I then said I must go to work—I went out, called Scott, a city-policeman, and gave him into custody—he said the best way to make away with the box was by burning it, and he said it was burnt; and Jones told me it was burnt on the Monday.</p>

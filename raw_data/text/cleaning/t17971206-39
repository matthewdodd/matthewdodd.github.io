             sworn. - On the 11th of November, I was sent for to a public house, in Oxford-street; the prisoner at the bar was there, with four counterfeit half guineas, he said, he had taken them in change of a note, from Mr. Jones; I had the four half guineas put into my hand, and I asked him, if he ever lost sight of the half guineas from the time he received them of Mr. Jones, till that time, he said, no; going along to Mr. Jones's, he varied in his story, and said, there had been two of them out of his sight; I thought, as he had been with a girl of the town, she might have served him in that way; I went and took the girl to the watch-house; then I went with the prisoner to Mr. Jones's, when I knocked at the door, he made his escape into some unfinished buildings, there we were in search of him for a considerable time, and at last gave him up, and then a woman gave me information, that she had seen him in the back part of the buildings, and upon something that I said, he came out, and I took him down to the watch-house, and found this duplicate upon him. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Townsend. I have the fellow duplicate to it in my pocket, I gave it to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones. This is my watch, I know it by the day of the month upon the face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I received the half guineas from Mrs. Jones, she gave me the watch to pawn, to get rid of the half guineas; I was a deserter, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060056"></xptr>had been about with him, he wanted me to insist again, and I would not.</p>

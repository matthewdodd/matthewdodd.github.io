About the latter end of July, I had occasion for a person in the capacity of an amanuensis, to transcribe various things that I used to send to the press; the prisoner was recomended to me as a person in great distress, but who belonged to a very respectable family, and whose misfortunes he had not contributed to by any bad action; he wrote a very good hand, and I employed him in that capacity; he had recourse to my chambers, copied for me, and went away; I being concerned in a house that was in Gravel-street Harton-garden, and unlet, I let him sleep at my chambers; I placed such an unlimitted confidence in him, that Ivery seldom went there; however having occasion to be there on the 27th of March, I desired him to be there and prepare the fire; I went there, and the first thing I observed was, that there was no carpet on the large parlour; I said where are my carpets? he said, I have taken them up, and put them in the next room; I thought it was so, I found no carpets there; I went into the kitchen, and, in short, in every room in the chambers, then I followed him where I had sent him, and desired him to come to the chambers, I told him; he very candidly then confessed that he had made away with them, and some stockings, various matrasses, a bolster, pillows, and in short a variety of articles, and he produced the pawnbroker's tickets, pawned at various places, and in the name of Mason, some were pawned at Mr. Cooper's; I immediately applied to Mr. Cokayne, an attorney, who lives in Lyon's-inn, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>How lately before the 27th of March had you seen these things in your chambers? - It happened about six weeks before that.</p>

            . I lost my coat out of the stable, at Collegehill, on the 28th of June, about one o'clock in the day; I had not left it above a minute before I missed it - I had shut the door, but it was not locked; as I returned I met the prisoner coming from the stable, but I did not see that he had anything with him - I went in, missed the coat, and followed; he ran about one hundred yards and was stopped; I got hold of him - I am sure he is the person who came out of the stable; he had no right in the stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How did he come out? A. He walked out and shut the door - I did not see anything about him, but I think he must have had the coat.</p>

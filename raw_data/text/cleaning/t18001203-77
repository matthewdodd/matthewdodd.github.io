               <p>SAMUEL WOODLEY sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Brown: On Monday morning, about ten o'clock, of the 17th of November, I saw the prisoner coming out of our warehouse, with a parcel of rice in a piece of hammock, and I saw him conceal it in a parcel of hemp, which was in Mr. Elliott's warehouse; it was necessary to pass through Elliott's warehouse to get to Brown's; I asked him what he had got there, he said, I have got nothing; I turned the hemp over, and found the rice, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030051"></xptr>same as he had; I took it away in his presence, and asked him how he could be guilty of such an action; he said, what; why, says I, stealing the rice; I then went over to the warehouse opposite; I was walking underneath in the warehouse, and heard the rice rattle on the floor, and upon going up I discovered the prisoner; I then went and informed Mr. Brown; I examined the casks, and found a cask had been broke open; it was the same sort, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Was there any body in the warehouse at the time you supposed the rice to be stealing? A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q.Does not Mr. Ellioft deal in rice? - A. I have known him have a very small quantity of East India rice, but this was Carolina rice.</p>
               <p>Q.When was the prisoner taken into custody? - A. On Friday the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you not to take him into custody on the spot, when you detected him? - A. I was not going to take the law in my own hands.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not continue in his place, and not abscond? - A. Yes; I did not see him the next day, but the day after I did, and Wednesday and Thursday, and took him up on Friday.</p>

               <p>Court (To Brown.) Q.What is Elliott's warehouse for? - A. Hemp, flax, and cordage.</p>

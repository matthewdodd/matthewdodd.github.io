                  </hi>. I am a laceman, and live in Hereford-place, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road. On the 10th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock, the two prisoners came to my shop and asked my daughter-in-law to serve them—I saw the thread lace box on the counter before them—they asked my daughter to go to the other end of the shop for something else, and while she was gone, Puddick took five cards of thread lace off the counter and gave them to Curry, who concealed them under her right arm, under her shawl—I saw them—I was in the parlour at the back of the shop—I came up and fixed my eye on Curry—I saw she had the lace under her right arm as she was sitting on the seat—seeing she was discovered, she burst into tears, took the lace from under her arm, and put it on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoners came to the shop and asked to look at some thread lace—they then asked for some stomachers, and while my back was turned to get them, one of them took the lace out of the box—it was there when I went, and it was gone when I came back—there was 154 yards of it—MR. Hendy came into the shop soon after, and stood behind them watching them—they bought three-quarters of a yard of lace at half-a-crown a yard, and paid for it—they had not bought any before—I saw the lace produced and thrown upon the counter.</p>

On the evening of the 14th of March, about five o'clock, I was standing near the door in the shop. I observed the prisoners coming from the interior of the shop; from their manner and appearance I suspected them, I seized hold of Watlin, and took from her the piece of Irish-linen in question; she had it folded up in her apron. I perceived the apron projected out, that excited my suspicion. She said, she did not bring it out of my shop, but had picked it up at the threshold of my door. I took it from her, and held Watlin; Barnard was a little before. I turned Watlin in the shop. I said, if one of the young men would take her, I would go after the other. I pursued<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200038"></xptr>Barnard into a passage just by, and brought her back; she walked quick. When I stopped Watlin, Barnard was standing in Horse-shoe-court, as if at a loss where to go. When I took hold of Barnard she threw a piece of gingham from herself; it is not our property. The value of the piece I took from Watlin is more than two pounds ten-shillings.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Vipond and Remington. I saw both the prisoners come into our shop as companions, they asked to see some pieces of calico; I shewed them some. Watlin bought two yards, and paid me. I served them at the back part of the shop; there were entire pieces of linen laying on the counter where I served them. There were three shopmen in the shop besides me; they are not here. I did not miss any thing until after Mr. Remington had stopped Watlin; I then discovered a piece of linen was missing from the back part of the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 54.) On the 12th of February I was on duty in Hackney-wick. I do not know how far that is from the prosecutor's—at a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning I met the two prisoners in company together—my suspicion was attracted by the bulky appearance of one—they had both smock-frocks on—I spoke to Smith, and bid him good morning, and after a little time I ordered them to stop and give up the property they had in their possession—they stopped—I searched them, and found eight dead fowls and two dead ducks—on Smith I found five dead fowls and one dead duck, stowed about his body, hanging to his braces, and his smock-frock was made like a bag—on Baltock I found three fowls and one dead duck—they were suspended from his braces, under his smock-frock—I asked where they got them, but they would not tell me—I took them to the station-house—the fowls and ducks had been recently killed, and were partly picked—the heads and necks were not picked.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Chigwell, in Essex, about eight miles from where these men were. I saw the fowls and ducks at the police-station—I knew them—they were the property of me and my brother—I attended to them daily, and knew them—here is one dead cock, which is a Spanish cock—they ran about in a lock-up house—there is a hole at the bottom for the fowls to go in—I locked it on Sunday, the 11th of February—I saw</p>

               <p>them all secure about three o'clock that day, and about seven o'clock the next morning my servant told me of the loss—I went down, and missed six hens, a pullet, a duck and drake—the drake was perfectly white, and very large—I have no doubt they were our property—the face of the padlock had been forced off with a chisel, or something.</p>

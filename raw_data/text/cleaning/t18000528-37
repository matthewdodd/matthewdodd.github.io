             sworn. - I am a box-maker<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280038"></xptr>On the 22d of April, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with a truss upon his shoulder, and another man by the side of him; from his manner of carrying it, and seeming to be in haste, it gave me a suspicion that it did not belong to him; I followed him to the top of Distaff-lane, the prisoner, and the other man, went into a court called Crown-court, and pitched the load in the court; the prisoner stopped with it, and the other man went away; my father being an officer of that parish, I went and informed him what I had seen; he immediately came and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At nine o'clock at night, I suppose it was about dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you walk? - A. About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. On the same side of the way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the face of the person, you know? - A. No: I could not see his face on account of the truss.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you gone for your father? - A. I suppose, about half a minute; it was only the length of four houses; I never lost sight of the end of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear, that the person you saw with the truss when you came back with your father, was the same you had left there? - A. I believe it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. What coat had he on? - A. A brown coat.</p>

               <p>Q. That is not very remarkable - what stockings had be on? - A. Blue and white.</p>
               <p>Q. That is equally remarkable - what was the colour of the coat that the other man had on? - A. Blue.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a blue coat? - A. He was on the outside of the prisoner, and being dark, I cannot swear positively it was blue.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man was between you and the person you suppose to be the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you had a much better opportunity of observing him than the person carrying the truss? - A. I took more notice of the man that carried the truss than I did the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into your father's house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor turn from the court at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk backwards then? - A. My back was to it when I went to call my father.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any doubt, that the person that you saw when you came back with your father, was the same man that you had seen with the truss? - A. Not the least.</p>

             sworn. - I am a painter: On the 22d of April, about a quarter before nine, I went to Crown-court, and I saw a truss lie three or four yards up the court, and the prisoner at the end of the court; I looked at the truss, and took down the direction of it, and by that I found who it belonged to; I took possession of the truss, and have had it ever since; it weighed one hundred and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Watson. This is the truss that I took in on the 22d of April, I know it by the mark S P S, Bristol; it has never been opened.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the contents of it? - A. By the invoice. (The truss was opened, and found to contain linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Read.) Did you see this truss packed? - A. I did not; but I can swear to the goods, and I can swear to the marking of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is twenty-seven pounds the value of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney contended that the property was proved not to be in an out-house, but a part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Court. I am certainly with you upon that point, for it is only the lower part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Dibbin.) Q. How far is Distaff-lane from your house? - A. Between three and four hundred yards; rather less than more.</p>

             sworn. - The day before yesterday, I and my ship-mate were walking along, and two girls accosted us; I am a stranger, I do not know rightly whereabouts it was; it was about four or five o'clock; my ship-mate treated them with half a pint of gin; they took us home to a private house, I should know the house if I was to see it again; I put my jacket and my waistcoat upon the table, and put my pocket-book into my jacket, then Clarke took it out, and would not give it me again; I put my back against the door, and swore she should not go out. I locked the door, and broke the key; then she went up two pair of stairs, and I went up stairs, and there was Clarke with another young woman, not the other prisoner, and a man, and he struck at me, and I made him go down stairs, and would not let her; then she told me if I would go to the public-house with her, she would give it me; then there was a pocket-book put into my bosom, I took it out, it was another pocket-book, and I would not have any but my right pocket-book; then she shoved herself against me, and the other prisoner, Riley, who was the <rs id="t17990403-54-deflabel308" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner, Clarke, is the girl that you speak of? - A. I am certain sure that is the woman on the starboard side there.</p>

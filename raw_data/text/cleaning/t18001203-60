             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowleys. Q. I believe you are a person employed by Messrs. Perry in their dock-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar at this time in your service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he to serve? - A. According to his indentures, he was out of his time last May, but having a few words, he left me, and in consequence of which, he was serving his lost time; he was employed in the dock-yard of Messrs. Perry; on the 31st of October last, we had docked a ship in the afternoon; I am a corker, I ordered him, with the rest of the servants, to be down by six o'clock, for the purpose of shutting the gates upon the ship in the dock; on going from my own house to the yard, I sat down at the yard gate, and between six and seven in the evening, I saw a person come out with a great coat, trailing upon the ground, and I told the watchman to stop him; the watchman told me it was my own servant; on the watchman saying that, I called him by name, three times, he did not answer me; he attempted to run. I immediately ran after him, and took him with the copper wrapped in the inside of the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of copper was it? - A. Sheet copper, such as is used for sheething the ships; I brought it back to the watch-house, at the yard gate; I charged him with the coat being another person's, in the yard, he positively denied it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he say about the copper? - A. He told me he had taken it from the Albion's dock, an East-India ship. (The copper produced.)</p>
               <p>Witness. That is the sheet I took from him.</p>

            , younger.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such a ship as the Albion under repair, at your docks? - A. Yes; I delivered out thirty-one sheets, one of them was missing, and another was obliged to be put in it's place.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that copper, and tell me whether it is that kind of copper used in sheathing ships? - A. Yes; it is what we call eight and twenty ounce; a thinner sort is sixteen ounce; that is five foot by twenty, and this is four foot two.</p>

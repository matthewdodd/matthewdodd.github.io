               <p>Q. Do you know whence he took that sugar?</p>
               <p>Neal. I imagine, by there being so large a hole, he took it out of the same cask. The wharfinger's watchman mended the hole as well as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open?</p>
               <p>Neal. No, it lay bouge ways.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw him take a lump out, how did he get it out?</p>
               <p>Neal. I do not know how he came at it, but he did not deny it. There were two staves broke in the hogshead; let the prisoner deny it if he can, there he is.</p>
